MakeUp in Los Angeles promises to be the major makeup event of this start of year,"Premium Beauty News - More exhibitors and more visitors... more conferences and more speakers too? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - We were the first surprised by the enthusiasm MakeUp in Los Angeles generated across the entire industry. We knew that California was - more and more -, ""the place where things happen"" but it is clear that the explosion of the Internet phenomenon and e-sales literally boost our show, not just on the West Coast but also in all the other regions of the world where we are present. Simply because, MakeUp In is the only makeup event in the makeup industry that fits exactly to the evolution of this sector, with always more innovations, flexibility and subcontractors! The beauty industry is at a turning point in its history, revolutionized by technology and the arrival of Millennials (people born in the 1980s and 1990s), a savvy generation when it comes to the use of makeup. During the first day of the MakeUp in Los Angeles Event, on February 8, 2017 at the Quixote Studio, leading trend specialists, experts and brand representatives will provide insights of the major beauty trends shaping the future of our industry. With a special focus on the West Coast influences, considered as the innovation hub of beauty, this first day will be dedicated to the new influences that are disrupting our industry. Premium Beauty News - Do you think new winds of change are really blowing from the Californian coast in terms of makeup trends and innovations? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - The first conference on the first day, Wednesday, February 8 at 10:20am will set the scene! It will be given by Sarah Jindal, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst-Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel, on the theme: ""Overview of Upcoming Trends and the California Influence."" Sarah will present the beauty trends in the US and how they should influence the future of our industry. She will also focus on the West Coast and the specificities of this market. Another highlight of this first morning in Los Angeles, makeup in the movie industry. An unavoidable topic in Los Angeles, just a few steps away from Hollywood. A theme that will be closely reviewed from 01:30 pm to 02:30 pm, this same Wednesday, February 8, by Michele Burke, MakeUp Artist. For her, ""designing makeup for leading ladies and men on feature films is a highly specialized field. High profile actors, producers, directors as well as time and money restraints require the film makeup artist to develop a unique eye, special skills and techniques."" On Thursday, February 9, from 11:45 am 12:30 pm, another conference not to be missed, That of Antoinette van den Berg, ""The Lady in Blu"" from the Future-Touch Company, themed: ""New Influences: Changing time concepts."" Antoinette believes that, ""usually future cosmetic trends, are defined by visual elements. While new influences are non visual and in-material"". ""The Lady in Blu"" will visualize in-material influences that will lead to new time concepts and shine a light on how to use the changes as a source of inspiration for product and concept development in the cosmetic industry. Premium Beauty News - This second edition of MakeUp in Los Angeles will mostly be an opportunity to meet top brands that influence the makeup generation. Sandra Maguarian - Absolutely! Anastasia, SmashBox, GlamGlow, Flirt, Nyx, Stila, Houglass, Yes To, Ilia Beauty, Rituel de Fille…, will be some of the top brands who will take part and enliven the various discussions at the roundtables and conferences of this second edition of MakeUp in LosAngeles. As of the first hour of the first day, the tone will be given! Anastasia Soare will open this first session of debates by retracing her path, probably one of the most amazing in this West Coast saga. Beauty pioneer, creative visionary and powerhouse entrepreneur Anastasia Soare is Founder, CEO, and driving force behind Anastasia Beverly Hills (ABH) - one of the fastest-growing brands in the global beauty industry. The digital influence, which is irrigating the beauty sphere from its Californian epicenter, will be one of the hot topics of this day with the presence of brands like Stila (Samantha Cutler, Chief Product Development Officer); Hourglass (Kate Helfrich, Vice President Product Development); Yes to (Ingrid Jakel, CEO) and NYX (Joyce Kim, Vice President Product Development). Another highlight of the first day will be the roundtable on Millennials with the exceptional presence of Jill Tomandl, VP Product Development & Innovation at Lauder - Smashbox. A round table dedicated to the influence of Millennials with the participation of innovation Millennials in the Lauder Group (ELC Gen Next), from the brands Clinique (Karina Spritz); Glamglow (Noelle Kot) Flirt (Vanessa Munoz) and Smashbox (Kia Ragland). Finally, the Wellness trend, which is flooding the beauty planet, will be at the centre of exchanges taking place at the last round table with rising brands in makeup and represented by their founders, Katherine & Caroline Ramos for Rituel de Filles and Sasha Plavsic for Ilia Beauty. Premium Beauty News - Particularly ""rich"" conferences in perspective? Sandra Maguarian - It is with the help of Leila Rochet-Podvin - in charge of this first day of conferences - and speakers, that you will get a better understanding of the growing influence of new technologies and social networks. Beauty is more daring, more hedonistic, a sign of our ever more connected society that now uses images to communicate. Selfies, Snapchat or Instagram posts – in this new era dominated by influencers, consumers are totally ""hooked"" to their smartphones, and modifying the beauty landscape. Premium Beauty News - Packaging of course will also be in the spotlight! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Make up products are the combination of three inseparable elements, present in any and all product, and which must work together in close harmony to generate the expected result: the formula, the packaging and the applicator. The combination of different areas to treat (eyes, lips, nails…), each with its own specific demands, with a wealth of packaging technologies (tubes, pencils, swivel mechanisms, sprays…), not to forget a booming number of applicator types (brushes, felt-tips, flock-tips, spatulas, balls…) results in significant complexity, that brands must master in order to introduce products that meet the high expectations of ever more educated, demanding and mobile consumers. Thursday, February 9 from 11am to 12pm and then in the afternoon from 02:30 pm to 05:00 pm, Gérald Martines, Founder and President of IN•SIGNES and his industry peers will show you how to make the ""right packaging choice"". The first ""Beauty Packaging"" workshop will help you get a complete overview of this vast universe and better understand the technology behind it. This workshop will present the process for selecting the appropriate packaging for a specific application and will set up a comprehensive typology of cosmetic packagings: – Inventory of makeup areas, – Specific constraints, – The selection process of a packaging type, – Overview of the main dosage forms for cosmetic formulas: lotions, serums, oils, gels, wax… – Combining make up application with packaging technology: Cosmetic packaging typology. From 02:30 pm to 05:00 pm, you will know everything about mascaras, lipgloss, lipsticks, pencils and packaging intended for foundations. You will get a grasp at the basic technology at work, identify critical functions and walk through the main criteria to consider developing an impeccably operating pack, from material compatibility issues to air tightness and more. A workshop where you will have access also to some significant innovations and current technology trends to provide Marketing Product Managers and Packaging Engineers with a comprehensive overview. Mascara is beyond dispute the cosmetic category where the interaction between the formula, the applicator and the pack plays the most critical role, and where innovations in these elements nourish each other, resulting in a sustained stream of novelties. Second packaging thoroughly reviewed, Lipgloss, which is probably the favorite lip make up category with the younger generations, because of its ease of use and an ever-increasing palette of available effects. After being a relatively low tech category for a while lipgloss has seen a sustained pace of innovation in applicators and packaging solutions lately making it a very dynamic category. Third ""featured"" packaging, traditional lipstick, which remains the flagship of any makeup lineup. Innovations in multi-benefit formulas and new gestures have lately fueled a corresponding flow of innovations in packaging solutions in order to handle the more demanding modern lipstick formulations or the new ways in which makeup brands are utilizing the good old mechanisms. Then come pencils, are a ubiquitous make up solution, which has invaded virtually all makeup applications from eyes to lips and face, not to forget the highly dynamic segment of brows. The classical wooden pencil, still a must, has evolved into a wealth of solutions from plastic to automatic pencils opening lots of opportunities for innovative applications. Finally how not to review packagings intended for foundation, which is the foundation... of makeup. Few categories embrace as many applications, combining such a vast variety of formula types, each with its own requirement in terms of texture and viscosity, with a large choice of packaging solutions that must be carefully selected to properly deliver the optimal result.

Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech to open their biggest edition next week,"Year after year, the Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech trade show continues growing. With 780 exhibitors from 40 countries/regions, a 25% growth compared to 2016, the leading Japanese tradeshow dedicated to personal care products is becoming an unmissable event. Twelve national pavilions will gather exhibitors from Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Korea, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, USA, Spain. The organisers expect to welcome about 30,000 visitors (versus 23,295 in 2016). Actually, this annual event is a two-in-one show: Cosme Tokyo, dedicated to finished products from all around the world, and Cosme Tech, dedicated to the suppliers of cosmetic brands, (ingredients, packaging, contract manufacturing, etc.). While the organic and natural cosmetics market has been growing steadily in Japan and Asia over the recent years, the event will host numerous brands and suppliers focusing on sustainable cosmetics. The natural and organic brands exhibiting at the show include for instance: – AuFloras Springfields Hand Cream, a natural cosmetics brand established in Australia by strict Vegan husband and wife. – Plenus All In One Shampoo, a multifunctional shampoo made with Japanese Alps pure water and 16 kinds of plant components and the fragrance of floral herb. – Skinfood Body Butter, a product born from the nature of New Zealand using natural and paraben-free materials. As far as organic and natural ingredients are concerned, exhibitors in the Cosme Tech part will also showcase their own innovations: – I.T.O. CO., LTD. will present GO-VC a new nonionic and amphilic ascorbic-acid derivative offering skin moisturizing, anti-acne, whitening, high stability, anti bacteria, and more. – A natural surfactant made by fermentation by Kaneka Corporation. – Yama No Kibudou Crystal Sap eco, by Sako-Honten Co., Ltd., an extract of crimson glory vine (Vitis coignetiae), a native plant from Japan, now organically grown in orchard and now finding its new usage for cosmetics with high moisturising effect."
Perfume brands successfully target young women consumers,"Are women under 35 years of age the best bet for perfume makers? With total sales of 390 million euros YTD end of August 2016, the segment of perfumes targeting Millennial women account for one third of women's perfumes sales in value. According to The NPD Group, this segment reported a significant resurgence over the past two years in France and is now one of the main drivers of the market growing by +5% over the period August 2014 - August 2015 and +4% over the period August 2015 - August 2016 in a market that dropped by 2% in 2016. The trend far exceeds the French market with a double-digit growth several other European countries including Spain and Italy. In order to attract digital-native women whose expectations and consumption patterns are deemed to widely differ from those of their elders, brands have opted for two different strategies. The first one consists in launching a brand-new concept, such as Olympea by Paco Rabanne (best European [1] launch in 2015). The second strategy consists in the reinterpretation and rejuvenation of a major classic line such as YSL's Black Opium (best European launch in 2014) or Poison Girl by Dior (best European launch in 2016, based on YTD figures October 2016). ""Big names adopt a very targeted communication to attract women under 35. For example, bottles of reinterpreted classics are entirely customized, with more girly or glittery colours. Brands also try to build familial stories by choosing movie star's children or former beauty icons as global ambassadors. A key role is given to music as well as to digital marketing which offers immersive experiences thus multiplying consumers' commitment on social networks. Furthermore, communication is often unconventional, putting forward a more rebellious or offbeat way of life than their elders,"" says Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. Fall 2016 has only accentuated the trend, with several key launches typically targeting Millennials such as YSL's Mon Paris, N° 5 L'Eau by Chanel or Kenzo's World (the three top performing launches of October 2016, according to The NDP Group). ""However, while these new proposals are clearly meeting success, we did not survey the real age of those actually buying these perfumes and that could be a source of surprises,"" adds Mathilde Lion. Indeed, both prestige brands and retailers are aware of the difficulty to attract younger consumers in the selective channel. As far as men's fragrances are concerned, the trend contrasts with the women's market. According to NPD, sales of fragrances targeting younger men have fallen sharply over the last two years (-7% YTD August 2015, -8% YTD August 2016). However, the market research company deems that this segment, which accounts for only 18% of the entire prestige men's fragrance market, has a great potential for growth. Depending on their success, recent launches might therefore reverse the trend."
Italy-based colour cosmetics supplier Regi is starting its US factory,"Premium Beauty News - Quite a progression for your company since its creation, in 1994. What explains this success? Vittoria Cicchetti - Since the beginning, we have been an open-minded, customer oriented, very transparent and earnest company. We try to create a strong partnership with our clients. We love to work together, move forward together and grow together with them. At the same time, we are always trying to spark innovation, in all its forms. Our R&D department is constantly pushing forward to implement new technologies: that's why we are always up to date with the cosmetics world's evolution. We take pride in the quality of our products and processes, certified by the highest quality standards. Each year we work to improve our supply and production chain, to give our clients the best possible service. Premium Beauty News - Within a few years Regi has become a major supplier in the make-up business. The opening of a new plant in the United States is a key step of the company's global expansion. Vittoria Cicchetti - We created the company in 1994. Very quickly we benefited from strong growth. And as of the year 2010 we decided to build a new industrial site in Crema where we are now and then to settle in India in 2010 in a factory with a surface area of 3,500 sq. m. (37 673 sq. ft.). As for Regi USA that we are now opening, it was designed as a new production and distribution unit, a new milestone for our company, with the clear idea to merge our business model into an American operational approach and an innovative logistics system. Our presence on the US market goes back to many years, just like the decision to invest in tailor-made formulations to suit the American market. It became a reality this year, with a 4,500 sq. m. (48,437 sq. ft.) facility, replicating the same technological standard as Regi's HQ in Italy. The plant is fully equipped to deal with the main product categories from day one (powders, emulsions, anhydrous products) with a possibility for expansion. Premium Beauty News - You already had a footprint in the United States. This new plant is a logical outcome! Vittoria Cicchetti - Over the years, our relationship with American clients grew so much tighter that it almost seemed natural to get closer to them physically. Regi USA has the same imprinting that our clients are familiar with: over the edge technology, high capacity, flexibility, certified quality standards, total traceability, quality as our philosophy of work. And the same level of expertise of our people and the same love for our products than we have in Italy. At the same time, Regi USA will be a revolution for our US customers and all those who need global distribution thanks to a faster, simpler and more comfortable way to work together. A great step forward: to imagine, develop and produce literally by their side. New challenges, new solutions but the same passion."
UK: Sales of prestige beauty products jump 6% post-Brexit,"The greatest growth post-Brexit has been in the sale of niche fragrances (£125+) and super premium skincare (£200+), both of which reported double digit growth. ""The growth in prestige beauty sales is impressive,"" says Teresa Fisher, Senior Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. She adds, ""Post-Brexit there was much uncertainty in the market, but what these figures show is that the demand for luxury and prestige beauty products has been boosted by Brexit. Why? We know that shopping in the UK became less expensive for overseas tourists due to the drop in the value of the pound and that the largest growth in the market has been in London and online."" The prestige beauty market in the UK was valued at £2,446 million in 2015. The post-Brexit sales boom mainly concerns luxury, high-end beauty products with a premium price tag. Reporting double digit growth, super premium skincare sales rose 32% compared to the same period in 2015, and in comparison to pre-Brexit where the sector only grew by 4%. Niche fragrances reported an increase of 59.5% in sales compared to the same period in 2015, growing twice as fast as vs pre-Brexit (at 28% growth in January to June 2016 compared to 2015). A survey carried out by Dealabs, France leading platform for sharing good deals, shows that average prices of cosmetic products (mass or prestige) are 3% lower on British online sales platforms than in France. Taking into account the exchange and delivery costs, buying on a British website is therefore especially interesting for the most expensive products. Most regions in the UK reported growth in sales of prestige beauty products with Midland and the East plus Yorkshire and the North East demonstrating the strongest areas outside London. However, it was in London where the greatest growth was reported and this was mimicked online. For the three-month period July to September 2016, online sales (although it only represents 9.2% of total prestige beauty market) increased by 34.3% compared to the period July to September 2015 and contributes most (43.7%) to total prestige beauty growth in this period. The second biggest contributor in the three-month period post Brexit was London, with 37.9% of total growth, increasing sales at by 7.3%. London represents 30.1% in value of the total prestige beauty market in the UK. The drop of the British currency in the wake of the Brexit vote was followed by moderate inflation, mainly boosted by cost of clothing and footwear, recreation and culture and furnishings. The fact that prices did not grow faster is probably due to the high margins some economic players were able to achieve when the Sterling surged during the euro crisis. However, it is not known how long main players will resist to the temptation to increase prices in particular before the Christmas festive season. ""We have already seen that some manufacturers in the news have increased their pricing so it will be an opportunity to review the future ahead with regards to consumer's ongoing purchasing habits,"" concludes Teresa Fisher."
More launches in niche perfumery than in the selective network in 2016,"More than 2,000 new perfumes were launched all around the world in 2016, a high figure that mirrors the progress observed over the past few years. Among them, 41% come from niche perfumery, and 34% from the selective network – a significant shift since 2015. It should also be highlighted that the share of women and men's perfumes is declining, to the advantage of the ""mixed"" or ""non-positioned"" types typical of niche perfumery, which has become the prevailing genre: it now represents 43% of the offering, compared to 17% in 2006. Isabelle Ferrand observes that men's fragrance trails ""are reaching new power heights."" ""Along with the family of Woody fragrances, which prevails, the Fern family is making a strong comeback, but more like a sub-family. Without being dominant, it appears like a hint behind woody or oriental bases. The Hesperides family is losing ground, but citrus fruit still remain easily perceptible as top notes."" Women's fragrances are mainly classified in the Floral family, for 72% of perfumes, followed by the Oriental family, 13%. There is even a tendency to make hybrid fragrances with the Oriental family: the term ""Floriental"" is now increasingly used. As for ""non-positioned"" perfumes, which should now be considered a determining category on the market, the families ranked at the top are Floral (36%) and Woody perfumes (31%). ""In the future, I bet Woody fragrances will boom among women's perfumes,"" explains Isabelle Ferrand, always on the look-out for weak signals. The rose remains the queen, as it is claimed by many brands. Iris is also used regularly in olfactory compositions, and more surprisingly, in the new Cartier fragrance for men: L'Envol. Isabelle Ferrand also emphasizes the fact that patchouli is settling as the new flagship ingredient of the year. Isabelle Ferrand has noticed more and more savoury bases in perfumery, which has opened to exclusive influences with cannabis, caviar, buckwheat, algae, rain, chestnut, champagne, or wasabi notes… As for the sweet flavours, pear notes are gaining ground, and sweet notes like honey, coffee, or crème brûlée remain well-positioned. ""This year, the phenomenon to pay attention to is that of perfume couples. Think about Zadig et Voltaire, who have launched their men-women duo at the same time, or about the simultaneous launch of One Million and Lady Million as a Privé version, or how Jean-Paul Gaultier has put Mâle and Classique closer together. Given all these recent daring campaigns, we can imagine heterosexual couples will soon no longer be a reference to launch a perfume couple,"" Isabelle Ferrand anticipates. To be continued in 2017."
MakeUp in SaoPaulo puts the spotlights on innovation,"In a context characterized by the recession of the Brazilian economy with a strong attention to prices, all eyes were on the show's famous ""Innovation Tree,"" which unveiled a selection of the most cutting-edge new products. Among these innovations we selected: – Alkos's new 'Single Twins Eyebrows' product, a double-ended pencil featuring one end for drawing and definition, and another to fill, set and highlight eyebrows and ensure they stay in place all day, to address the full brows trend that has been on air for some time now. – 'Miracle Sensation Purple,' a highly pigmented pen eyeliner in a striking purple shade designed by Schwan Cosmetics. According to the manufacturer it lasts for 8 hours or longer. The liner is water-resistant, free from parabens, and dries to a matte finish. – Faber-Castell's latest invention, a magnetic lipliner made using a gel-like formula for an extra-smooth finish. The liner, which comes in highly pigmented color variations, is soft and creamy when applied, but hardens into a 'magnetic' finish that lasts for 8 hours after less than a minute. – While bold lips have been on trend for some time, lipsticks manufacturer Weckerle has been working on an alternative — the transparent 'Ph-Antastic Lipstick'. The product reacts with the skin's pH levels upon application, forming a custom shade in a crystalline high-shine finish. – As far as packaging is concerned, Qualipac has come up with a solution to the problem of fiddly packages, such as mascara, eyeliners and lip gloss tubes. Its new product 'One Touch' offers a simple press-and-release mechanism that can be custom designed with multiple materials and shapes. While the Brazilian cosmetics market has proved particularly resilient in the economic crisis that has hit the country since 2014, competition in this market has steadily increased. The positions of the main players were reshuffled. Natura's market share thus dropped from 14.9% in 2010 to 11.1% in 2015. Simultaneously, the Boticário Group, the other Brazilian cosmetics giant, recorded a rise of its market share from 6.9% in 2010 to 10.9% in 2015. ""The Boticário Group has been able to anticipate changes in Brazilian consumption habits and transform its businesses into a multichannel model,"" explains Valeria Grossmann, General Director of design agency Centdegrés in Brazil. In such a context, the participants in MakeUp in SaoPaulo insisted on the key role of innovation to boost the growth of beauty brands. For instance, Arcade Beauty and Adhespack, two specialists in sampling and single-use packaging, highlighted the huge potential of samples in an increasingly digitized market. According to Daniel Fernandes de Oliveira, Business Intelligence Manager at ABIHPEC, the Brazilian association for the personal care industry, makeup is probably the category with the greatest growth potential in Brazil. The country accounts for 50% of cosmetics sales in Latin America, but only for 42% of the makeup consumption. ""For several years, Brazilian cosmetics players have demonstrated their ability to innovate while containing the rise of prices,"" he said. This perfectly matches with the expectations of Brazilian consumers whose great interest in cosmetic products seems to be hampered only by the limitation of their purchasing power."
How Millenials are driving the digital beauty revolution,"Considering that what Millennials are doing now is what everyone will be doing soon, it is key to have a better understanding of their behaviours. ""For beauty brands, digital beauty is the next major wave that will create a dramatic shift in the beauty industry and how consumers interface with their products. Many brands are still trying to navigate how to embrace and adjust to this new generation of beauty buyers,"" said Sinead Norenius-Raniere, Board Member of the Bay Area Beauty Association. According to Facebook data, nearly 1 in 2 surveyed Millennial [1] and Gen X [2] beauty buyers in the US are still looking for the beauty style and products that work best on them. Where are they looking? Not just magazines, stores and TV anymore. Digital is now a main channel for beauty purchasers, with mobile leading the way. Indeed, beauty accounts on Instagram attract over 20 million unique followers in the US. ""Women now have a vibrant array of content creators to gather advice on the latest beauty products and techniques from ease of their mobile phone. Whether it's a friend who shares their same skin concern or a blogger with a great smoky eye, women are relating to other women who they feel have less to personally gain from sharing their beauty know-how,"" explains Facebook IQ (a Facebook division focused on research, data, and trends) In parallel, the survey conducted by Poshly on 175 women between the ages of 18-35 finds 65% millennials trust the makeup recommendation of a makeup artist or beauty influencer on Instagram or YouTube over a salesperson in the store. While Facebook finds 56% Young Millennial Beauty Buyers (18-24) agree that when it comes to make-up, they are adventurous and enjoy experimenting with their look. The Poshly survey reveals that 78% would be more inclined to purchase makeup from a brand if they could see what it looks likes virtually on their face before purchasing it. When it comes to age segmentation, Facebook IQ shows there are significant variations on how the different age classes consider beauty. While Younger Millennials (18-24) are more open to experimenting with beauty products they are also more likely to embrace not wearing make-up in content they post on Instagram, using the #nomakeup. Older Millennials (25-34) are more comfortable in their own skin but start to think about remedies against aging, including battling wrinkles, covering dark circles and creating the appearance of dewy skin. They aren't as up to date on the latest beauty tips and tricks as they were just a few years ago. Eventually, for Gen Xers (35-44) beauty is part of a holistic approach to overall wellness. Their resources and priorities are different from their younger counterparts, too. Many still consult magazines, and they're more focused on their ""me time."" Gen X women also post more about their lives, with hashtags like #kids, #fitmom, #yoga and #lovemyjob being unique to this group on Instagram."
Cosmoprof Asia 2016: Record numbers confirm the success of the new format,"For its 2016 edition, Cosmoprof Asia faced a daunting challenge. Held in cramped conditions last year in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC), the show had no other choice than move to larger premises. The organizers thus decided to split the show into two distinct venues: suppliers (packaging, formulas, Ingredients, machinery) were therefore moved to AsiaWord-Expo (AWE), a modern and large exhibition centre near the airport, while finished products and some selected suppliers stayed at the HKCEC, on the Hong Kong island. This strategy not only allowed the show to host new exhibitors (650 new companies) and new sectors (ingredients, machines), but it was also well accepted by both visitors (up 21%!) and exhibitors. The event welcomed 650 new companies this year taking the total number of exhibitors to 2,698 from 49 countries and regions. 732 companies from 19 countries exhibited at the AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE), the venue for packaging, ingredients and processing equipment, from 15-17 November 2016. Finished cosmetics were showcased at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) from 16-18 November 2016 by 1,966 companies from 49 countries. Cosmoprof Asia 2016 hosted 24 national and group pavilions from Australia, Belgium, Brazil, California, China, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA with inaugural pavilions from Bulgaria and Latvia. The fair played host to 76,818 trade visitors from 129 countries and regions (21% increase over 2015). ""With the strong international representation and presence, Cosmoprof Asia remains the indisputably most important networking opportunity in Asia Pacific for the beauty industry,"" said Michael Duck, Executive Vice President, UBM Asia Ltd. For the first time ever, AWE served as a focused venue for companies specialising in packaging, machinery, OEM, contract manufacturing and raw materials. While a handful of key exhibitors decided not to participate this year, the overall mood on the show floor was very positive, in particular because of the impressive affluence, proving the visitors clearly understood where to find what they were looking for. The headline event was the first edition of the Innovation Circle Awards, organised in partnership with trends agency Beautystreams, recognising the most innovative packaging, design and formula. A jury panel comprised of the beauty industry's elite including AmorePacific, Centdegrés, L'Oréal, Marie Dalgar, Martha Tilaar Group and NYX Cosmetics selected the winners and products were displayed in a prominent area on the show floor. The Lipstick Factory in Hall 5 gave live demonstrations on the manufacturing process of a luxury lipstick thanks to a partnership with three leading Italian exhibitors - Brivaplast (packaging), Chromavis (formulation) and Vetraco (machinery). The project was supported by the Italian Ministry of the Economic Development and ITA - Italian Trade Agency, in collaboration with Cosmetica Italia - Personal Care Association. At the HKCEC, the ""Extraordinary Gallery"" in Hall 3G took centre stage. Here a selected group of coveted and innovative multicultural brands from supply chain and finished products displayed their products. On this occasion, a special edition of a high-end nail lacquer in three unique colours and textures was jointly created by Centdegrés, Groupe Pochet (glass), Fiabila (nail polish) and trend agency Beautystreams. Concomitant to the show, a rich information programme comprising more than 30 educational sessions offered world class content to all participants. The World Asia Forum held across both venues addressed the industry's most talked about trends and topics. Sessions in AWE focused on the latest ingredients, technologies and packaging, while at HKCEC visitors discovered the latest trends and development in product, branding and marketing. Cosmoprof Asia will be back in 2017 from 14 to 16 November at AsiaWorld-Expo and from 15 to 17 November at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre."
"The beard, a massive success among the French","No one can deny how much hair has been growing on men's faces recently. Just over half of Frenchmen (52%) surveyed by Ifop say they are always closely shaven, compared to 48% who declare they have a beard, a moustache, or a goatee. Still, the beard remains the most common facial hair form among men, with 40% of bearded men among the adult men's population. If several beard styles can be differentiated, it is the three-day beard that is the most popular (24% of bearded men), ahead of the ten-day beard (8%), the short beard (5%), and the long beard (1%). However, there is no general agreement about the moustache, far from it: only 4% of the French aged over 18 have yielded to it. The same goes for the goatee (3%) and short beards on the chin (1%). Nonetheless, this big comeback is far from concerning all generations and social classes to the same extent. Indeed, wearing a beard seems to be closely related to the age of the people surveyed: the proportion of bearded men is twice more important among young men under 35 (52%) than among seniors aged over 60 (24%). And it is among thirty-year-olds aged 25-34 that it is more common to wear a beard (55%). And yet, it is actually reaching the older generation (50% for men aged 35-50), which shows having a beard is not or no longer restricted to young people. It can also be noticed that the beard is mostly popular among upper working classes, in particular managers and higher intellectual occupations (54%) like teachers, journalists, and artists. The survey results also highlight a North/South split as regards the prevailing form of hair among the male sex. It is actually in the regions located in the North-East and North-West quarters of France that the proportion of hairy faces represents a majority, except in the Parisian region, where beards and hairy faces are a minority (43%). On the contrary, the proportion of closely shaven men represents a majority in all regions south of the Loire river. And after the large central region, it is in Provence that it is the lowest. Bearded or closely shaven? Women are really divided over this issue. Half of them consider closely shaven men are sexier, and 45% are more easily tempted by bearded men, in particular men with a three-day beard (33%). Just like their male counterparts, women are much less attracted by moustaches (only 2% think men with a moustache are sexier) and beards on the chin (1%). It should be noted that young girls are extremely seduced by bearded men. More than eight French women aged under 25 out of 10 (81%) think men are sexier with a beard. According to Ifop analysts, ""if clean-shaven faces remain the standard among a narrow majority of Frenchmen, more hairy faces are unquestionably trendier right now, in particular among young men massively encouraged to wear the beard by women their own age."" The beard has seduced a large share of the male population by going much beyond ""bobo"" and other ""hipster"" borders through a social imitation process."
Increasingly image-conscious men and baby boomers boost the beauty market,"According to a recent survey by Canadean [1], the increasingly visually-oriented culture of society often means consumers associate image with success. While women are 1.3 times more likely to feel under pressure to look good than men, both genders associate appearance with success in personal and professional lives, with 66% of women and 61% of men subscribing to this belief. The belief that image correlates with success is strong across all age groups, with over half of consumers agreeing. Young adults aged 16-24, however, are likely to be most influenced by this notion, with 65% agreeing, decreasing to 60% among those aged 55 and over. ""This trend reflects how image-consciousness is catching up with men and baby boomers, demonstrating narrowing gender and age disparities in the beauty market,"" explains Veronika Zhupanova, Analyst for Canadean. According to Canadean, the increasing number of occasions when men use skincare products exhibits this trend. ""Among major global economies, men used skincare products on 453 billion occasions in 2011, which shot up to 557 billion occasions in 2015. Meanwhile, as image-conscious consumers age, the desire to maximize appearance among the older generation will increase,"" said the market research firm. ""With image-consciousness becoming ever-more pervasive among aging populations in developed economies and the pension age rising, competition to look good among this demographic will drive demand in categories such as anti-aging skincare and make-up, as consumers seek to impress employers and appear as dynamic as younger colleagues,"" noted Zhupanova. Amongst the young, social media, now a popular daily ritual, can be a significant driver of image-consciousness. ""Selfie"" culture encourages the taking of close-up photographs as a means of self-expression and impressing peers. The close-up nature of the shots, however, means potential for skin imperfections to be captured is high, and may encourage people to seek out products to minimize this. ""While there have been a number of launches targeting photo occasions for young adults, such as Estée Lauder's Flash Photo Powder, older consumers remain overlooked despite increasing social media use. This demographic offers prime opportunities in the make-up and skincare categories to innovate in line with the latest trends, such as the desire to be always 'photoready' during busy days. In order to make the most of this opportunity, companies should be subtle in their marketing towards older consumers, emphasizing the important role photos have in making memories, for example,"" continued Zhupanova."

"The ""MakeUp In"" trade shows strengthen their global implantation strategy","Premium Beauty News - In eight years the gone through road is quite impressive! Sandra Maguarian - In such a fast moving and complex world, hungry for change, there is no room for complacency! This doesn't mean we are not proud of what we have already achieved, on the contrary, but we must constantly adapt to this fast-changing world. Our shows prove it! Eight years ago, they simply did not exist! Just take a look at what's going on in the make-up sector with this redistribution of cards between newcomers and traditional players. Who would have imagined a few years ago, the pace at which some small and medium brands are gaining a firm foothold at the expense of big brands, via the internet and the power of bloggers and influencers. Everything has changed in just a years months. Premium Beauty News - Your strategy is to be where things happen in terms of make-up innovations? Sandra Maguarian - It's impossible to predict everything of course, but we do our best to anticipate and be there when the wave is just starting growing to accompany it. Clearly, the timing of the first MakeUp in Paris in 2010 was perfect! The launch of a similar event in New York also made sense. As did the successive openings in Sao Paulo and Seoul. Creating the first BtoB event in Korea in 2013 also stuck perfectly with the sudden attractiveness of the country for its innovations in formulas and packaging. And the recipe was the same for MakeUp in LosAngeles. In both cases, the fashion aspects had full hold. Imagine that we simply increased twofold the number of exhibitors at MakeUp in LosAngeles from one year to the other! Simply outstanding, don't you think? Premium Beauty News - You announced that MakeUp in NewYork will stay in Manhattan but moves on the 5th Avenue in 2017. Sandra Maguarian - We can't wait to give the good news this week. As you know, it is not that easy to find a venue in Manhattan meeting all our requirements. This new venue which is located at number 415 of this mythical 5th Avenue is a place that meets all these requirements. It is in the centre of Manhattan, therefore ideally placed, easy to access, on two very accessible levels for visitors. This new venue will also allow us to strengthen the exclusive nature of our event with a limited number of floor places. Premium Beauty News - In Asia, you decided to extend the concept? Sandra Maguarian - The success of MakeUp in Seoul is undeniable! But the make-up market is evolving very quickly in Asia. And as you know, each country in this geographic area has its own strong cultural identity. It influences behaviours trends, expectations, needs. The MakeUp In concept must adapt to these cultural identities and try to satisfy each component of a booming region. This is also the same approach that led us to create MakeUp in LosAngeles while in the meantime MakeUp in NewYork is progressing year after year. One country, two events! For Asia, obviously such a large and diverse area can only be covered properly by becoming directly involved in each of its countries and by seeking to find or bring the good ""make-up"" word in each country. Not any country, of course: after South Korea, China and Japan are obviously the three pillar countries of this legitimacy in the field of make-up and skincare. MakeUp in Seoul changes to MakeUp in Asia and will take place successively as planned in Seoul on 5 and 6 April next, then in Shanghai in April 2018 and in Tokyo in April 2019, to settle in Seoul again in April 2020. A logical, coherent and efficient itinerary for the benefit of visitors and exhibitors! Premium Beauty News - All in all, quite an impressive network of events! Sandra Maguarian - It is not for the sake of growing. Above all it's efficiency that's driving us! It is also demand coming from this vast variety of visitors/exhibitors. This comes down in one year, to five events, three months apart! Think globally but act locally!"
France: Pharmacies directly compete with perfume shops and department stores,"In a context where French consumers are increasingly sensitive to prices and promotions when health and beauty products are concerned, it is not surprising to see that high-end distribution channels are losing ground. Indeed, the data revealed by Sandrine Cayeux and Anaïs Dupuy, Consumer Insight specialists at Kantar Worldpanel, during the seminar organised by FEBEA on current changes in the French beauty retail channels, show a steady growth of mass market channels and discount channels. On the contrary, the selective circuit (perfume stores and department stores) continues to lose ground, despite its resistance in the fragrance segment. However, the pharmacy channel remains very attractive and seems not to be impacted by this phenomenon. ""In five years, the selective channel lost 2.5 million buyers and recorded a decrease of the average basket value,"" said Sandrine Cayeux. Actually, the competition is tough. On average, French consumers visit 4 retail businesses for their beauty hygiene purchases out of a total of 220 theoretically available in this segment. However, according to Kantar, the pharmacy channel appears as the main competitor of perfumeries and department stores. A third of the people who make their purchases in the selective circuit also buys beauty and hygiene products in pharmacies. There are also 7.9 people who buy their products both in pharmacies and online, in addition to the selective circuit. Purchasing powers of consumers buying in the selective channel and in the pharmaceutical channel are also very similar. Nevertheless, customers of the selective channel are younger than those of the pharmacy channel since regular attendance of pharmacies starts with the first child. The two channels have other similarities: they are appreciated for the variety of their offer, the in-store advice and the facility to find the right products on the shelves. However, perfumeries and department stores show better performance for the shopping experience, loyalty offers and the distribution of samples. The strengths of pharmacies are the advice by a professional and the quality of products. Over the past five years, the number of buyers of hygiene and beauty products in pharmacies has grown steadily (with a penetration rate rising from 28% in 2011 to 29.9% in 2016) and a rise in the average value of purchase (69.3 euros in 2016 vs. 62.8 euros in 2011) and in the frequency of purchases. Let's note however that 60% of incremental volumes earned by pharmacies are a net gain for the overall market and not simply the cannibalization of other circuits. But when cannibalization exists, half of it is affecting perfumeries and department stores. When asked by Kantar about the reasons to buy beauty products in pharmacies, French consumers first mention ""the quality of products"", ""the possibility to find skincare products suitable for sensitive skins"" and ""the quality/price ratio."" The pharmacy channel appears as a more serious competitor than the web for the selective channel, although online sales still have significant room for improvement in France, where they account for 7% of total beauty prestige sales, compared to 26% in the UK. According to Kantar, online buyers have a lower purchasing power than perfumery customers and are highly motivated by discounts. ""The online channel has its own specificities it not just a complement to bricks-and-mortar beauty store,"" says Anaïs Dupuy. In order to regain market share, the selective channel must rely on its best assets strengths, in particular on fragrances, which are the channel's flagship products. The shopping experience is also an important asset where some improvements are possible, especially through even better targeted and customized samples, or even better loyalty programs."
Russia: The rise of local brands,"Despite the crisis in the economy, the beauty industry is doing quite well in Russia, which remains the 4th largest personal care market in Europe. Clearly, the rise of imported products prices, in the wake of the strong devaluation of the Russian currency in 2014, logically led consumers to shift a part of their purchases to locally produced mass personal care items, but they did not renounce to prestige perfumes and cosmetics, even if they had to cut back on other expenses due. According to market research firm RBC, ""Provided the rubble remains stable and the households' real income continues to grow, the Russian beauty market will experience a steady growth during the years to come."" The optimism was clearly visible on the show floor. This year's edition of InterCHARM hosted more than 980 exhibitors, including 242 international companies and was visited by 69,894 visitors, an increase of 11.3% compared to the previous year. ""The show returned to growth this year, even if some companies have frozen their investments. Furthermore, the crisis had a positive impact on Russian manufacturers and brands which took advantage of the situation and gained market shares. They were also able to grow in terms of quality,"" explained the organisers. In the wake of the Russian rubble devaluation, imports of personal care products decreased in 2015 while the domestic production increased. ""We work mainly with international brands, but the number purely local customers is increasing. There is a real rise of Russian brands,"" confirms Christian Darsy, Vice President Sales Cosmetic & Household at Fareva, one of the world's leading subcontractors who operates a plant in Russia and another in Ukraine. According to Synovate Comcon, in the mass retail channel, skin care brand Chistaya Linia dominates the market before Nivea. Natura Siberica's success story is also emblematic of this phenomenon. The Russian natural cosmetics brand now has its own stores in Moscow, Kazan, Surgut, Tuymen, Ryazan, St. Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don, Novosibirsk and Kyzyl in Russia, as well as in Barcelona (Spain ), Copenhagen (Denmark), Tallinn (Estonia), Tokyo and Yokohama (Japan) and Hong Kong (China) and its products are available in numerous stores in France, Belgium, UK, Germany, China and several other countries. Other Russian brands such as Sachettè or MontCarotte also successfully grew in credibility in the prestige segment. The success of Natura Siberica also illustrates the huge interest of Russian consumers for natural and organic cosmetic products. They are paying an increasing attention to the composition and quality of cosmetic products. As a result, the 2014-2015 crisis did not impact the sales of natural and organic products which continued to grow during this period. The growth in this segment is explained by the consumers' increasing attention to their health and by a growing sensitivity to environmental issues. There is also a greater availability of natural and organic cosmetics in bricks-and-mortar beauty retail chains, whether in traditional networks (Rive Gauche now distributes US beauty brand Avalon Organics) or in recently launched dedicated stores such as the Organic Shop chain. Since 2013, InterCHARM has devoted a specific exhibiting area to independent perfumery brands. Under the name ""La Niche"", this area reflects the dynamism of high-end niche perfumery in Russia. Of course, in Russia as in other countries in the world beauty chain retailers and major international selective brands represent the vast majority of sales. But niche brands hold prominent positions in department stores or in the most upscale points of sale in Moscow and other big cities. While the economic situation is stabilizing, the strong enthusiasm of Russian consumers for cosmetic products should continue to drive the growth of the market with annual growth forecasts oscillating between 6% and 12% depending on market research agencies. The oral care segment is one of the best performing, although most of the growth will come from key market segments: skin care, hair care, colour cosmetics and fragrances."
"Olfactory coaching, or how to revive advice in store","Of course, the days when we remained loyal to the same perfume our whole lives (or almost) are gone… if there ever were days like these. Still, most of us have a very personal olfactory style that conveys the impression we make on others' memories. But we need to get to know it or recognize it: it is often embodied by four or five favourite fragrances for which it was like love at first sight, and which are tricky to identify among the extremely large offering in classic or alternative perfumery. ""Given the number of references on the market today, it is really difficult for consumers not to get lost in the world of perfumes, especially since they no longer get the advice they did until the 80s/90s, before self-service perfume stores emerged. But they still need it,"" comments Juliette Faliu, co-founder of l'Olfactorama and creator of Nez Bavard, a concept of olfactory meetings for people interested in perfume, enthusiasts, and lovers. To make up for this lack of advice, multiple initiatives are being launched. For example, after working for professionals in her early career, Sophie Normand decided to offer private individuals her knowledge in perfumery by organizing olfactory coaching sessions. ""Too many people wear 'mainstream' perfumes, because they just do not know what else to wear, and I think it is a shame,"" she explains. Once her clients have sent her back a first contact questionnaire, she gets a better idea of their olfactory perception during meetings at their homes or near the Opéra, in Paris: that is where most perfume stores have settled, so she can introduce them to different raw materials or notes. ""The idea is to find the perfume(s) that will correspond to them, so that they know which words define what they like and feel. We do change with the seasons or the different periods in our lives, but we often stick to the same scents,"" she explains. Once this phase is over, our expert suggests a transversal selection of about ten niche perfumes or major classics to rediscover, and she invites her clients to go and test them directly in store. ""A perfume may be more or less present on the skin, it may have a very different outcome depending on the wearer, so the test phase is essential to eventually keep only two or three key fragrances,"" she adds. Usually thirty-year-old Parisians, Sophie Normand's clients do not hesitate to spare EUR80 to EUR130 (group formula) for this new approach. ""Most of my clients think commercial perfumes no longer correspond to them and everything smells the same in the selective network. They feel like turning to alternative perfumery, but they are a bit lost, because they do not know this world,"" adds Sophie Normand. Advice is actually an essential for small niche brands, and it has contributed a lot to the growing interest in alternative perfumery. At Annick Goutal's, L'Artisan Parfumeur, or other stores like Frédéric Malle's, the objective has always been to take the time to get to know customers and offer them experience. These values are making a strong comeback, as they are used as a differentiating argument by independent perfume stores, and major brands like Guerlain or Chanel have been introducing profiling in their wholly-owned stores, for their own products. Profiling is practiced in different ways, in particular with digital technologies for a few major traditional brands or points of sale in the selective network, or at Nose's, a cosmetics and perfume concept store that has developed olfactory diagnosis software. At a larger scale, and within the limits imposed by a format that covers the whole selective offering, there is also Marionnaud's ""Beauty Code"": advisors are equipped with touch screen tablets. If they are commonly used in olfactory coaching, digital technologies can raise the same issues as the lack of advice. ""Digital devices will never replace the advice provided by humans. In the field of perfumes, they still cannot make customers feel like visiting a store, so they will probably always remain a complement,"" Juliette Faliu asserts, ""because the need for help comes from the fact that perfumery is not an easy subject to deal with, from an intellectual standpoint. And it makes it quite difficult to provide useful knowledge to the general public. Therefore, a good advisor must both be a good psychologist and a good translator, so that they can transpose customers' words into the perfume language. In addition, they must show excellent knowledge in the market's fragrances to determine which of their own products correspond to those mentioned by customers. No software can offset this adaptive knowledge and relationship,"" she adds. However, digital technologies are still interesting in that they create communities, in particular for young people for whom networks prevail… and contribute to providing advice. To manage to survive troubled times, the perfumery market tends to reposition itself on a higher-end, more exclusive world. And even if it is still a little early to predict the future of olfactory coaching, there is no doubt personalized advice is part of the luxury instruments it can integrate."
Global men's personal care market to reach US$166 billion by 2022,"Constant change in lifestyle and rise in disposable income have increased the demand for men's personal care products [1], finds Allied Market Research (AMR) in a recent report [2]. Moreover, increase in the number of product offerings to tap the fluctuating grooming habits of men and organized retail further fuel the market growth. In addition, the global upsurge in online retail platforms, and the escalation in health, and fitness consciousness among men is anticipated to offer more business opportunities. However, rise in packaging costs could prove to be a major challenge for the players. ""The increasing bent towards corporate life and rising awareness towards men's grooming, specifically among the youth is expected to boost the demand of personal care products. Moreover, launch of herbal products with low chemical content has witnessed remarkable growth in the men personal care market"", states Yogiata Sharma, Research Analyst, and Consumer Goods at AMR. According to AMR, the men's skin care segment accounted for the maximum market share in 2015, due to wide-spread popularity of face creams and moisturizers among the consumers. The segment is anticipated to lead the market throughout the analysis period, with a CAGR of 4.5% from 2016 - 2022. From a growth perspective, men oral care product category would witness the highest CAGR, owing to the increasing penetration of advanced toothpaste, to tackle dental problems, among customers of all age groups. The demand of this category would be also be supplemented by the increasing demand of mouth and breath fresheners. North America is presently the largest market of men personal care products, with a revenue of US$36 billion in 2015. The region is anticipated to continue its growth at a notable pace, owing to health consciousness and awareness towards men's grooming. Market penetration of oral care products is relatively much higher in the U.S. due to extensive usage of mouth washes and breath fresheners among smokers and drinkers. Personal cleanliness products such as antiperspirants & deodorants are also popular in Canada owing to their regular usage among youth. In parallel, AMR expects Asia-Pacific to account for the highest growth rate in the overall market throughout the forecast period, owing to the upsurge in demand from countries such as China and India. The growth would be driven by the increased adoption of the different product categories, supported by the increasing disposable income. Furthermore, it is anticipated that demand for shaving products would experience maximum growth in the developing countries such as China and India."
Global duty free and travel retail faces bright future,"The sector, currently valued at a significant US$62 billion according to duty free and travel retail specialist Generation Research, had been growing steadily for the past six years, and while in 2015 it suffered a decline, the figures for the first quarter of 2016 show that the business is back on its upward trajectory. Total sales grew by just under 1% compared with the same period last year. Sales in Asia Pacific, a region that has for some time made a very significant contribution to the expansion of the sector, saw strong growth of 5%. The fragrance and cosmetics category is the main driver of growth globally and its sales were up 7.8% in the first quarter, while sales of wines and spirits were up by 4%. Sales on board ferries grew by 6.5%, while airport sales remained stable. TFWA president Erik Juul-Mortensen said that these figures allowed the sector to be cautiously optimistic. Within the wider travel and tourism industries, all pointers would suggest that this bullish prediction is justified. Air traffic forecasts project that the number of people taking to the skies will continue to boom. The trade association Airports Council International says that passenger numbers worldwide will more than double from 2015, when the number of air travellers reached 7.2 billion, to just over 19 billion in 2035 - a compound annual growth of 5%. The World Tourism Organisation's report for 2015 showed that international tourist arrivals were up 4% to reach a record of 1.2 billion, 50 million more than in 2014. ""This can only be good news for our industry, and all the indicators would suggest that we have plenty to be upbeat about,"" said Juul-Mortensen. ""This is a great sector to be in, and with growth rates that have been, in many years, the envy of many high street retailers, duty free and travel retail presents a wealth of opportunities."""
Make-up: The new supply-side challenges,"Premium Beauty News - What the heck is going on in the makeup industry? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - It is clear that many players probably underestimated, three or four years ago, the growing influence of the Internet on an entire generation for online purchases. And we also underestimated, of course, the power of people expressing themselves on the internet to praise the benefits of a particular product and whose legitimacy seemed insignificant at first sight. But, not only has this legitimacy continued to gain momentum but sales of products ""hence scrutinized and put forward"" have also dramatically increased. Gone are the times when classical purchases in department stores resulted from a voluntary approach, now have come times for spontaneous purchases, impulse purchases, selfies purchases, triggered by the talent, persuasion of a particular blogger or influencer. Premium Beauty News - Given this radical change in buying behaviours, the only sensible thing to do was to take action! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Yes of course, but it's not that easy when you have to manage research teams, marketing teams, for some of them plants and for all of them rather traditional distribution channels. Because meanwhile, ""internet players"" don't have to bother with all this. They move fast, offer special bargains, change their product lines or launch new ones in no time. There is no respite, you have hardly launched a counter offensive that you have to deal simultaneously with multiple and new attacks coming from all fronts. You therefore need to be very responsive, very flexible... and very competitive! Premium Beauty News - A ""revolution"" which obviously is impacting the entire industrial sector. Jean-Yves Bourgeois - It is the increasing acceleration of the subcontracting sector whose ""full service"" offer can only but attract new comers, and as an indirect consequence established industry players who have no other alternatives than to have recourse to it more and more. ""Time to Market"" and ""Innovation"" have become essential tools to stay in the game. Premium Beauty News - Does it mean the whole sector is going to switch to total subcontracting? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Not easy to predict but some say it. Nothing is sure, but some leading brands strongly think so. And for others, it is clearly the only way to quickly gain market share. Hence, there is a real re-balancing between manufacturers who are part of this subcontracting sector. Formulators / fillers are obviously the most sought-after. So much so that they are asked more and more to provide a full service, including packaging, accessories and even in some cases the POS equipment to set up in the outlets. Formulators / fillers have become, over the years, real trend setters. We are far from the times when a basic subcontractor only performed what he was asked to do. This sector has fantastically structured and equipped itself industrially speaking. It is now fast, innovative and full of creativity. And among packaging manufacturers, a lot of them are understanding that it's time to jump on the bandwagon before it starts gaining too much speed, by also remaining close to brand owners but also, increasingly, to formulators/fillers, by offering solutions and not just an industrial product, by also anticipating market demand, by being reactive and pro-active. In a nutshell, by staying at the forefront. Another true revolution to address! Probably the biggest of all, because existing industrial tools have not really been formatted for this type of challenge. Premium Beauty News - But as the saying goes ""tall oaks from little acorn grows"" and the same is true for small companies who will need an industrial strike force worthy of the name? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - That's true and that's what's reassuring for these manufacturers but nonetheless we are observing an historic shift. And it was very interesting to see the latest press releases of a number of packaging manufacturers such as the Albéa, Texen or Pochet Groups who were precisely oriented in that direction and have understood what it takes to stay ""in the game"". Premium Beauty News - You are offering a helping hand, which can only be grasped! In this context of hyper specialization of an industrial sector... ""niche"" trade shows are more than welcomed? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - ""Niche"" trade shows cannot be created everywhere! A true notion of ""industry"" must exist. It exists in premium packaging and the Luxe Pack trade show is a proof. It also exists for cosmetic ingredients and the in-cosmetics trade shows are a proof. And finally it also exists in the make-up industry and the 'MakeUp In' events obviously evidence it."
Travel retail needs to innovate and to tap into new technologies,"Last year Tax Free World Association (TFWA) president Erik Juul-Mortensen closed the TFWA World Exhibition & Conference with a comment on how buoyant the mood had been. And at this year's closing press conference, he said that despite the challenges the industry had faced, the atmosphere was still upbeat. Eventually, the event recorded a slight decrease in visitor numbers: 6,443 persons visited the show, down 2% from 6,558 last year. ""A healthy figure under the circumstances,"" said TFWA. However, according to TFWA, the number of visitors from the key categories of duty free operators, travel retail operators, landlords and agents was up from 4,625 in 2016 compared with 4,584 in 2015, with 1,811 companies represented compared with 1,788 last year. ""There are reasons for cautious optimism for the travel retail industry,"" said TFWA president Erik Juul-Mortensen who likened himself to former British prime minister Harold Wilson, who stated that he as an optimist, but always carried an umbrella. One key reason for optimism are growth forecasts regarding air traffic. By 2025, there will be more than nine billion air passengers, a 70% increase compared with 2015. During the TFWA World Exhibition & Conference, several speakers called for a new approach of the business that would take into account the change in consumption habits. According to Garry Stasiulevicuis, managing director of Counter Intelligence Retail, attitudes to luxury are changing. 'Luxury' is no longer about possession, but all about experience. The travelling population has changed, and there is a much younger travelling consumer coming through airports who wants different things and different experiences. CEO of Dufry, Julián Díaz González highlighted how a more experience driven, personalised offer was required to attract the all-important Millennial traveller. Presenting highlights of TFWA's recent study on the impact and influence of mobile technology and e-commerce on duty free & travel retail, Peter Mohn, founder and CEO of m1nd-set, highlighted that nine out of ten people use the internet at an airport. But what is interesting is that 31% of people said they were looking for information on brands and products to compare prices or to find out more by reading customer reviews. While in Europe 40% of passengers do this, in China well over half (56%) consult the internet when shopping at the airport. Similarly, a running theme at the inflight workshop at this year's TFWA World Exhibition & Conference was the necessity to innovate. Suffering a double digit decline, the value of the sector fell to US$2.64 billion in 2017, which is less than in 2007, nearly a decade ago. Airlines can't offer the same ranges as airport and they need to innovate constantly. Internet as a huge potential in this sector and can be a way to make flying and buying a real shopping experience."
Hong Kong: The eyebrow craze spreads amid increased social competition,"According to an ancient Chinese tradition, one's future can be read on its face. Stalls practising the face-reading discipline, which dates back more than 2,000 years, are still found in market streets and near temples in modern-day Hong Kong. A strong brow would translate to the person's ability to plan ahead, high cheekbones could point to power. Today, this tradition may be combined with aesthetic concerns, in order to improve people's chances in life. For instance, some Chinese face readers propose customers to pluck their eyebrows to help achieve their life goals. ""It's an instant change and you can change it for everyone,"" Mrs Li Chau-jing told AFP, describing her clientele as ranging from just a few years old to in their 70s. ""I can help a person in the shortest amount of time, by bringing them energy and happiness and the goal they want to reach,"" Li said. Mrs Li has been running her shop in the working class neighbourhood of Sham Shui Po for six years and its walls are covered with photos of her clients' eyes and brows. Women tend to come to her to solve emotional or relationship problems, men for better luck at work, she says. According to this former make-up artist, women tend to look for a way to solve their marital and sentimental problems while men want to boost their professional opportunities. For Mrs Li, straight brows will bring more luck and happiness than curved. ""If the brows are very straight, then those people will not have to suffer through many hardships,"" she says. Customer Edward Lam, a 35-year-year old technician for a television station, said he felt more energetic after having his brows modified. ""The biggest goal I have for fixing my eyebrows is to find jobs and to have better networking, and that my career will improve,"" Lam told AFP. ""I believe that the impression I gave was better,"" he said of job interviews since having his brows worked on by Li. While some may prefer eyebrow-plucking Li's proactive approach, others are happy to stick to tradition. Nevertheless, the eyebrows trend has skyrocketed in China, and more generally in Asia, in the wake of the South Korean influence, a country where social success, for men and women, would be increasingly linked with a perfect appearance. Salons offering eyebrow grooming have been mushrooming in China over recent years. Image-conscious urbanites can, for example visit Browhaus, a brow and lash grooming chain originally founded in Singapore in 2004 that has expanded to 40 outlets in 10 cities, mainly in Asia, but also in London and New York."
"Trends: UK and France, two converging beauty markets?","The UK and France are the two biggest European cosmetics markets after Germany (12.537 billion euros in 2015 for the UK and 11.357 for France, according to figures from Cosmetics Europe). However, consumption behaviours strongly diverge in the two countries, in particular for the prestige cosmetics segment. While French women have bought 1.6 prestige beauty product per person on average last year, the annual average is 2.6 for British women. The difference is especially noticeable for the make-up category since the British are buying twice as much as the French (1.2 per unit against 0.5 in France). Similarly, and contrary to stereotypical beliefs, French women buy less fragrance than British ones (0.7 units per person per year in France vs. 0.8 in the United Kingdom). ""Beyond overall figures, it is interesting to look deeper into the different categories to understand the preferences and the buying habits of each market. While the French spend less overall, they invest more easily in certain types of products such as anti-aging creams,"" says Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. According to NPD figures anti-aging creams account for 44% of total skincare sales in value in France, vs 32% in the United Kingdom. For their daily face care routine, British women seem to prefer make-up removers and cleaners, which represent 10% of the entire skincare category sales, the double than in France. While makeup accounts for 29% of total sales of the prestige beauty industry in the UK, this category is less important in France, where it accounts for only 15% of the prestige market. Makeup is the smallest category in France while it ranks in second position behind perfume in the United Kingdom. GRAPH While eyebrow makeup is a strong trend both in France and in the UK, when make-up is concern, French women remain loyal to traditional categories. Mascara accounts for 14% of sales in France vs. 9% in the United Kingdom and lipstick sales are twice as important in France as in the UK (18% of total makeup sales vs 9% in the United Kingdom). However, foundations are much more popular in the UK, where they account for the half of total makeup sales vs. 42% in France. Despite cultural differences in purchasing habits, the NPD report shows that the two markets are converging with regard to the latest industry trends. The craze for eyebrows and masks, the rise of hair care, the development of anti-aging skin care products targeting eyes and lips, for instance, are transcending cultural boundaries. ""Historical differences regarding consumption habits in France and Great Britain persist for traditional categories. However, should we look at the most recent trends, it is clear that the explosion of borderless digital trends and the influence of global brands and celebrities are transforming prestige beauty into an open and responsive market able to bear universal trends that transcend borders,"" concludes Mathilde Lion."
"""The beauty market is becoming greener"", Elfriede Dambacher","Premium Beauty News - How is the natural and organic beauty market evolving in Germany? Elfriede Dambacher - Generally speaking the entire beauty market is becoming greener. There are many gradations of green cosmetics. In Germany we have divided the beauty market into three segments: conventional cosmetics, nature-inspired cosmetics, and natural & organic cosmetics. Based on these segments we are able to depict the main market trends. Germany is the largest cosmetics market in Europe and also the largest market for natural & organic cosmetics in Europe. The market is showing a high level of growth. The year 2015 showed a turnover growth of 10 %. Natural & organic cosmetics have a market share of more than 8 %, whilst most European countries have a market share of 4- 5 %. The development of natural & organic cosmetics benefited from the German heritage of many organic brands. In German speaking countries this trend began earlier than in other European countries. And retail provided a good availability early on. Customer reach was expanded primarily by German drugstores. Along with nature-inspired cosmetics, green cosmetics account for more than 15% of the German beauty market today. Premium Beauty News - Younger consumers seem particularly receptive to the message conveyed by these products. What are the main consequences? Elfriede Dambacher - Younger consumers make high demands on organic brands. Next to efficiency and performance, design and authenticity are key factors of success with the youngest consumer segment. Young consumers are looking for their own brands and they shop differently. Stationary retail in Germany is not meeting those challenges appropriately. For consumers it is often easier to find attractive novelties online, which benefits international niche brands. They are making the market more attractive. Premium Beauty News - Digitalization is transforming the mainstream beauty market. What about natural and organic brands? Elfriede Dambacher - The market for natural & organic cosmetics is no exception. On the contrary, online retail improves the availability even for the smallest villages. And the young people interested in natural & organic cosmetics are web savvy and well informed. Online they can find reliable recommendations in no time. Of course this affects the entire market. Premium Beauty News - So far, no leading natural brand has emerged globally. How do you explain this lack of internationalisation? Elfriede Dambacher - The natural & organic cosmetics industry is shaped by small and medium-sized businesses. Initially, the main focus was on the use of natural resources for the R&D of the products. Processes and communication were neglected. But as the demand for green cosmetics is increasing, organic brands need a distinct profile and sufficient capital to succeed globally in the core markets for natural & organic cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - What will be the main topics to be discussed at the next edition of the Natural Cosmetics Conference? Elfriede Dambacher - We will discuss current topics that are relevant for the market. Two relevant aspects playing a role in the development of the market: There is a lack of strong brands and stationary retail is not picking up on the potential the market is offering. Also brands with a distinct positioning are gaining ground in the nature-inspired market and in the segment of non-certified natural and organic cosmetics. How these challenges can be met will be the focus of a multi-faceted program and leading international experts, trend researchers, lateral thinkers, scientists and retail companies. The International Natural & Organic Cosmetics Conference is considered the top event in fall and a must for all interested in the changes evolving in the beauty market. The 2016 edition of the Conference will take place in Berlin September 27-28. And next year the Conference will be held on September 26-27, 2017.

"Australia and New Zealand: A definitely growing ""beauty"" sector!","A few figures first! According to the survey of the Franco-Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, after a few years of decline, the Australian beauty sector was again on an upward trend in 2015 thanks to both perkier consumer morale and a rise in their disposable income. The sector's turnover is estimated at EUR 637.8 million (AUD 945 million). The market is expected to grow annually by 1.2% from 2016 to 2021, driven by the popularity of innovative, multifunctional and natural & organic products. The share of imports is very important since it represents 75% of the market demand. France is Australia's first supplier in perfumes and the second in cosmetics. According to recent studies, competition is expected to increase even more due to the growing interest of consumers for mass market products. Among the most significant market trends, anti-ageing cosmetic products are very popular among the Baby Boomer generation. Demand is also on the rise for so called ""holistic"" products and organic and natural products. Multifunctional products or ""DIY"" beauty solutions are also increasingly popular. All surveys highlight the fact that organic products are truly one of the strong points of ""Made in Australia"" cosmetics and obviously a key argument used by local brands to conquer export markets. The dynamism of the market is confirmed by Australian brands themselves. A proof of that is the performance of companies like Nutrimetics, SelfCare Corporation, Napoleon Perdis, Ere Perez, Inika, Natio or Sugar Baby. ""The dynamism of the Beauty sector is truly perceptible on Australian and New Zealand markets,"" confirmed Olivia Courtman, Product & Accessories Sourcing Specialist at Nutrimetics, a company that produces and distributes via its home sales network (40 000 beauty advisors) skincare products (80%) and make-up products, and that continues - no surprisingly - to enjoy a steady rise in its sales of colour cosmetics. The story is the same with the brand Ere Perez: ""We are on a + 20% yearly trend,"" highlighted Hiram Martinez, CEO. As for Sonia Amoroso from SelfCare Corporation (40 million dollars in revenue), specializing almost exclusively in the production of skincare products, ""with such high market demand, I was actually unable to allow myself a holiday break these past months!"" As for Napoleon Perdis, who last year refocused on the Australian market, now supplying over 875 stockists, David Jones and Myer, its own 85 stores are working at full capacity. ""There has been a constant influx of new brands in to an already highly competitive market,"" explained Petra Bergman, PR & Marketing Manager- Mann & Noble, ""giving the consumer infinite choice which in turn means beauty brands are constantly challenged to find new ways to stand out from the pack and connect with consumers"". ""We are about to launch 70 new products with our Inika brand we acquired two years ago,"" explained Lino Sinni, Marketing Director, Total Beauty Network. On the side of New Zealand the beauty market is now worth EUR 76 million (NZD 1.25 billion). From 2015 to 2018 a 1.2% growth in volume is expected thanks to the popularity of multifunctional, organic and natural, ""DIY"" products and sets (gift boxes). Imports account for 90% of the market. France is the leading perfume supplier and the country's third cosmetics supplier. Despite the country's geographical isolation and relatively small number of inhabitants, most major beauty brands are represented and their product range is varied. The economic fundamentals of New Zealand are strong, GDP per capita is catching up with that of other major Western European economies (with more than USD 31,000 in 2013) and unemployment fell to its lowest level since 2009 (5.8% of the working population in 2015). Note that New Zealand launched in 2005 a long term reform (through 2020) on its digital economy. And that in 2010 the country joined the top 10 of the most open economies to digital innovation. Indeed, due to its geographical remoteness, the Internet appears to be the best source for development. The government is investing heavily to develop its infrastructures: between 2008 and 2015 nearly NZD 4 billion (2% of New Zealand's GDP) were allocated by the State to develop infrastructures solely dedicated to digital economy. A common point to all these Australian and New Zealand brands, most of them rely on Asian sub-contractors (China) for their formulas and packagings. On the other hand they are thirsty for innovation and are constantly ""on the look-out"". Australian consumers enjoy spending. They have a high purchasing power, which has increased by more than 43% in 15 years, 15% higher than that of French consumers. Household debt is also high but domestic consumption is driving the country's growth. Consumers are demanding, increasingly sophisticated and aware of European trends. In Australia the purchase decision is determined primarily by the price tag. In addition, the growing interest of Australians for quality, and the growing impact of fashion phenomena fuelled by the media and advertising make ""genuine"" products and branded and high-range products particularly popular. Australian consumers - so-called early adopters, fond of new technologies - love novelties and alternative products. Like other people in the world, Australian and New Zealand consumers are increasingly connected and retailers of consumer goods must face strong competition from online players. In general, the premium sector is demonstrating unprecedented economic dynamism. Global market sales in 2012 were already worth some EUR 210 billion, a quarter of which was generated by French luxury industries. This leading position is being confirmed by exceptional sales increase across all luxury sectors. Indeed, the rising number of foreign tourists from Asia as well as their taste for luxury goods is a strong growth driver for this industry. But not just tourists! It is striking, to notice, for example in Sydney, the number of Asian people who have settled in the country in recent years. The luxury industry is expected to grow by 11.1% over the coming years."
Beauty retail: Bricks-and-mortar stores and online channels complement each-others,"The study, conducted on a representative sample of 1,000 individuals aged 18 and more, found that 57% of cosmetics buyers use the Internet to get more information about products. However, for 71% of them, brick-and-mortar stores remains the main purchasing destination. ""With the Internet, many of the customers who enter the store have a detailed knowledge of the products and they are therefore looking for something else, such as reinsurance, product staging, advices on complementary products. Customizing the experience through the relations with shop assistants thus becomes essential in beauty stores,"" commented William G Koeberlé, President of the FFPS and FEPD (European Federation of Perfume Retailers). Many consumers (43%) use internet to compare and get upstream information on the products and their prices. However, customers massively go to physical stores, to see the products (58%) or test them (41%). In addition to advices, the symbolic status of beauty products thus pushes buyers to brick-and-mortar points of sale (to see, touch, smell ...). However, the study also unveils interesting differences in consumer behaviour especially between generations. Indeed, while the Internet is the main point of contact for information on beauty products, it is also the preferred tool of women (72%) and for those under 35 (78%). On the contrary, men and those over 35 still use brick-and-mortar stores as the primary contact point with cosmetic products. With no surprise, internet purchases are mostly driven by price (50%), promotions (44%) and the possibility to purchase at any time (39%). ""Customers always have the final say. As far as beauty products are concerned, brick-and-mortar stores and online channels are complementary and developing an omnichannel business is a key factor of success,"" concluded William G Koeberlé, President of the FFPS and FEPD (European Federation of Retail Perfumers)."
MakeUp in New York: Attendance still going up,"""Sophisticated and changing textures are the key trends in formulas as well as nomadic and environmentally friendly packaging,"" said the organisers of the show. For this edition, close to 30 companies participated in the innovation competition and submitted 60 products including 43 formulas and 17 new packaging and applicators. Eventually, the jury selected 24 products, which were presented on the Innovation Tree at the centre of the trade show. One of the key formulation trends is the importance of pearlescent, metalling and glittering effects for the eyes. ""It is the big new trend today,"" explains Florence Bernardin, founder and manager of Information & Inspiration. ""In the wake of what happened a few years ago for the nails, the trend for pearlescent and glittering effects is quickly growing for the eyes."" Aircos, for instant, presented Countless Effect Eyeshadow, an enriched formula with pearlescent coated binder with a silky and airy texture thanks to the back injection technology. The Cosmetic Group USA showcased baked powders created in a jar, with pink and light metallic highlights. Another highlight of the innovation competition was the Matte Me Metal liquid lipstick by iTiT Cosmetics, with its matte metallic finish. MakeUp in new York was also the occasion to discover never seen textures: – Perfume Touch Up, a transparent solid fragrance with a texture that glides smoothly and effortlessly on skin, into a portable pencil packaging for easy touch-ups, – N24 Flower Lip Balm by Sunzhou Ante Cosmetics, a transparent the lip balm with a flower incrustation and real 24K gold chips to inside. The growth of the show allows the organizers of MakeUp in New York to look the future ""with serenity"". But it also forces the event to move to a bigger venue. ""At a time when many professional events in the beauty sector are going to overlap next year in New York and outdo one another, often in the same exhibition area, MakeUp in New York, like its siblings in Paris, Seoul, Sao Paulo and Los Angeles, will continue to be the exception in the Beauty sphere. Exhibitors and visitors know it, this and this is what makes and will continue to make MakeUp in New York a special event in a place of its own,"" announced the organizers."
The Russian personal care market bounces back,"""Many key international and local players confirm this trend and add that consumers haven't cut their budget but just became more rational in purchases,"" explain the organisers of InterCHARM, the largest perfumery and cosmetics exhibition in Russia, CIS, Central and Eastern Europe. Avon sales in Russia, for instance, increased by 25% in monetary terms and 13% in volume in Q1 2016. Henkel also recently increased its sales in Russia, after a decrease in 2015. Lush also said the demand is recovering: its revenue increased by 12% in Q1 2016, sales have slightly increased in volume terms too. Consumer goods market increased by 11.3% to RUB 7.79 trillion (USD 119.8 billion) during 12 month-period from April 2015 to April 2016, GfK reported. Personal care products account for approximately 6.6% of this market, or about RUB 514 billion (USD 7.9 billion). Price increases are not the only propeller of the rise of cosmetics sales. Consumers have become 6.1% more likely to buy personal care products. At the same time, the average spend per one purchase has not changed, says representatives of the market research firm. In 2015, sales of cosmetics and personal care products grew faster than other consumer goods (+18.9%). In 2014, these sales increased by 4.3% - slower than food and household products. This record-breaking sales were driven by perfumes and make-up products (+38% and +29% respectively). Body care also recorded impressive growth in 2015. According to Euromonitor, the segment grew by +19.3% compared to the previous year. As far as the hair care category is concerned, one of the key growth trends is the popularity of hair loss treatments and salon products that rose by 2.6% and 7.4% respectively. During the crisis, companies did not reduce the production of shampoos, a relatively stable consumable commodity. In 2015 the volume of local manufacturing reached 386 million units, which is 2.4% more than in 2014. Even the smallest segments of the market performed well: bath care increased by 4% (Euromonitor) and soaps grew by 11% (Russian Government Statistics). In parallel, the rise of foreign investments in Russia also illustrates the recovery of the economy. According to Ernst & Young, Russia ranked first in the world in 2015 regarding foreign direct investment projects, with the highest number since 2010. Germany is the leading foreign investor in Russia. According to the Central Bank of Russia, Germany's direct investments have increased four-fold in 2015, from USD 350 million to USD 1.42 billion. Other top foreign investors are: USA, France, Italy and China. During the first half of this year 25 international brands opened stores in Russia, almost twice more than the same period in 2015, global estate company Knight Frank reported. Moreover, no brands have left the market, and at least, 10 more operators are expected till the end of 2016. Among the newcomers are Holika Holika from South Korea, Urban Decay from the USA and Kiko Milano. The new drivers of the Russian cosmetics market growth will be discussed during the Retail Connect Summit organised during the InterCHARM trade show, which will take place in Moscow on 26-29 October 2016. On the radar of discussions are trends in perfumery, natural and organic products, Russian legislation, retail and e-commerce."
"Data: Women love lipsticks, mainly on Sundays","Perfect Corp., the editor of YouCam Makeup, the world's leading virtual makeup application, has recently published a series of data on the behaviour of its users regarding lipsticks. Indeed, the lipstick trial feature has been ranked as the #1 most used feature in the YouCam Makeup app for the past 6 months in the USA, in Europe and in Asia. Over 11 million women test virtual lipstick try-on's every week. And there are about 1.6 million lipstick trials daily. First lesson: The users of YouCam Makeup - mainly Millennials - go mad for matte! Actually, data from YouCam Makeup shows beauty fans like matte lipstick twice as much as glossy. The figures speak for themselves: almost twice (1.7) more females choose the matte option over the gloss option of the app. Data from YouCam Makeup also reveal how beauty lovers are mapping out their weekly lip colours. Sunday is the peak time of applying virtual lipstick. ""Female users are mostly using YouCam Makeup and trying on different shades on Sunday night (7-9pm EDT) to prepare their looks for the week ahead,"" explains Perfect Corp. ""Furthermore, starting from 3pm on Wednesday, the lipstick trial feature rises leaving us to believe that women are rewarding themselves or starting to plan their weekend lipstick hues."" Data collected by the application are also a good source of information about the hottest lipstick colours of the moment. Bright pinks and red shades, for instance, were the most popular colours in July. The app also allows mapping preferences. For instance, as far as the US are concerned, YouCam Makeup reveals that: – Females living on the West Coast apply nude shades twice more than females living on the East Coast. – Red shades still dominate across all of the US cities. – Females living in Miami prefer bright shades over pastels."
"US trends: ""Beauty Augmented"" and Beauty hackers","On the occasion of the release of this study, Premium Beauty News met the founder of the agency, Leila Rochet-Podvin who will soon be flying to New York again where she will lead, as part of the MakeUp in New York trade show, both a conference on the evolution of make-up trends and Indie brands in the US and a round table dedicated to the influence of these indie brands [2]. Premium Beauty News - You called your report, ""Beauty Augmented"", why did you choose this title? Leila Rochet-Podvin - Beauty Augmented refers to a beauty universe that is more and more ""augmented"", fuelled by increasingly digital consumption, a reflection of ourselves via selfies and a strong desire to use cosmetics differently. In this context, beauty becomes more assertive and the make-up market, particularly, is driven by points of reference that evolve towards greater hedonism, driven by new imaginaries, new creative brands, representations of new femininities, the whole of it fostering beauty conversations on social networks. As a consequence, the market has crossed the boundaries of imagination in a US make-up market that is rooted in the Entertainment industry. People speak more and more of ""Retail Augmented"" (""more experiential""), of Consumption Augmented (""savvier with Smartphones""), and now of Beauty Augmented. We were able to identify six beauty trends illustrated with boards and iconic products that we bought during our four trips to the East Coast and the West Coast since January 2016. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about some of the six forward-looking universes in the report? Leila Rochet-Podvin - In our report we started from the six traditional make-up universes to express the new ""augmented"" facets that will drive tomorrow's beauty market. Nude is one of the universes of reference, a major trend that emerged during the 2008 crisis, which consisted in doing without make-up and relying on invisible and ""unpretentiousness"". This universe has greatly evolved and ""augmented"" with the ""Shades of Nudes"" trend - a nude trend where colour has emerged. On the one hand with - sepia or chocolate - bold tones that accentuate features (rather than concealing them). A tone found in fashion but also in complexion shades (with the explosion of bronzers) or of lips (returning to the chromatic trend of the 90s). The other facet of ""Shades of Nudes"" is nude celebrating diversity - collections of nude shades were enriched to cope with the diversity of skin tones, to the recognition of multi-ethnicities and shades within the various local communities. It must be recalled that now in the US, there are more non-Caucasian births, and consumers regard brands' recognition of diversity as a sign of modernity, all the more for Millennials. Hence the lingerie brand Naja, launched a new ""nude for all"" line, with seven shades of nude to address all skin tones. Meanwhile beauty brands are now complementing their palette of shades (Sephora USA offers 37 shades for its new 10Hr Wear Perfection Foundation). Beyond foundation products, the recognition of diversity, addressed in the sub chapter ""nude diversity"" goes beyond the foundation universe and unfolds in the universe of skin correctors, concealers and even blushes. Premium Beauty News - In the US, the market seems to be driven by ""Indie"" brands, can you tell us more about this phenomenon? Leila Rochet-Podvin - Indeed, we no longer speak of niche brands, the new buzzword is ""indie brands"", i.e., new ""independent"" brands. These hyper-creative brands, usually with a good mastery of social network codes and taking advantage of the e-commerce channel or of concept stores, are those that challenge the codes. Millennials particularly, eager for alternatives, dote on them. Note that according to the NPD Group, results of make-up in the prestige sector were strongly boosted by internet sales, with a 30% [3] growth for make-up products in the first quarter of 2016. We called them the ""Beauty hackers"", because they divert the traditional codes of beauty in terms of packaging, distribution or textures. They are driven by an unbridled and very communicative creativity. Ridding this trend, there are brands like Milk MakeUp, which stemmed from a US creative collective launched in February 2016 or the brand created by the influencer Kylie Jenner, Kylie Cosmetics. In this report, we identified for our clients the brands to follow and our observations. The report, US Trends - Beauty Augmented on make-up is available since August 2016.

Marc Jacobs kick starts men's beauty trend for 'male polish',"Jacobs, who has long been a pioneer of eye-catching style statements, has been single-handedly reclaiming the 'man' in 'manicure' via regular social media posts documenting his penchant for colourful nails. He favours dark, moody shades such as purples, blacks and burgundies, adding a touch of grunge-glam to his everyday look. Social media users everywhere have since been embracing the #malepolish trend with renewed enthusiasm, with Instagram displaying over 1,200 images tagged with the caption. Although stars such as Marilyn Manson, Jared Leto and Jacobs himself are known for championing the gothic look with sombre shades, the Internet shows a glitzier side to the trend. From creamy pastels to glittering metallics, guys, it seems, are getting bold with their manicure choices. Many have adopted an artistic approach, with NYC graphic designer Samsonntag documenting a spray-painted aesthetic, while others, such as dancer and nail artist-in-training Ben Thomas, have channelled a love of all things scientific into intricate, prism-like designs. Whatever the colour, the rising popularity of the #malepolish movement is symbolic of a wider trend - that of the increasing interest in male beauty in general. In January, new figures predicted that the growth in the male grooming sector would drive a steady increase in the global haircare market over the next three years, with growing numbers of fashion-conscious consumers cited as the main reason for the boost. Male grooming has undergone a revival across the beauty industry over the last few years, boosted by the launch of high-profile products such as Clinique's Sonic System Deep Cleansing Brush, brewery Carlsberg's shampoo, conditioner and body lotion trio, and must-have products such as beard oils and scented moisturizers. #Malepolish is proof of just how much the face of mainstream men's beauty is changing."
Multifunctional and masstige cosmetics: Two major trends of the Brazilian market,"Despite current economic difficulties, Brazil accounts for 32% of the revenues of this premium segment in Latin America, followed by Mexico (23%), Argentina (15%), Chile ( 8%) and Colombia (6%). In Brazil, the premium market is driven by the fragrances, which accounted for 36% of the value of this sector in 2015. According to the market research firm, sales of premium personal care products in Latin America are expected to grow at an average rate of 5% per year by 2020, a slowdown compared to previous years when the segment registered an average of 8% real growth per annum from 2010 to 2015. Against this backdrop in which purchasing power falls, the public begins to look for quality products, but with lower prices, those products known as masstige. ""The consumer of beauty products in Latin America is facing a difficult challenge. With more education, infrastructure, with the internet providing greater autonomy and access through different channels, they are looking for quality products,"" says Fernando Cruz, senior analyst at Euromonitor International in Santiago. However, according to the expert, with limited purchasing power and slowdown in their economies, this consumer must search for alternatives to get the better quality products at lower prices. [1] Another important trend in the personal care industry is the use of special ingredients, says another market intelligence company that brings its knowledge to the exhibition, Factor-Kline. Elaine Gerchon, the company's project manager, says these product formulations, designed to improve performance, have grown from 40% to 45% in the global market over the past few years. ""This increasing popularity of multipurpose cosmetics has led to the increased consumption of special ingredients, which have multiple functions associated with a single ingredient. As an example, I cite the consumption derived from polypropylene glycol (PEG), which acts as a rheology modifier and has emulsifying properties,"" explains Gershon. [2] The Factor-Kline study analyzed the main regional markets – Brazil, China, Europe, India, Japan, Southeast Asia and the United States – into eight categories: surfactants, emollients, rheology modifiers, conditioning polymers, UV absorbers, fixative polymers, preservatives and emulsifiers. For the company, global expectations are for the personal care products ingredients market to grow at an annual rate of 2.8% between 2015 and 2020, exceeding US$10 billion by 2020. The UV absorbers category should lead the growth trend, followed by the category of preservatives and rheology modifiers. In 2015, in-cosmetics Latin America brought together 184 exhibitors from over 40 countries and 2,760 unique visitors. Now, with the repositioning of the brand and a wider range of exhibitors and visitors from all over this part of the world, the expectations of the organizers are even higher. ""We'll be playing host to about 3,500 professionals who will get to know over a thousand products of 200 exhibiting brands,"" said Daniel Zanetti, event director. The complete schedule of free Marketing Trends presentations is listed at www.in-cosmeticslatinamerica.com/en/education/education/"
Chinese app giant Meitu launches global fashion and beauty campaign,"Meitu, the third-largest developer in China and a top 10 global app developer on the Apple AppStore, is aiming to promote talent as well as brands within the fashion and beauty world with their campaign, via China's top social video-sharing platform, Meipai. #FacesOfFashion was first rolled out during London Collections Men earlier this summer, streaming events and footage to more than 100 million Meipai users in China. Models Eva Herzigova and David Gandy, One Direction's Niall Horan and actor Stanley Tucci all featured in the campaign's exclusive footage, which included backstage access and interviews throughout the event. Following the success of the move, Meitu is now planning to turn the campaign into an ongoing initiative, bringing it to fashion and beauty events throughout the US, Europe, Latin America and Asia. As well as bringing content to hundreds of millions of mobile consumers in China, the move will also increase awareness for Meitu's selfie and virtual makeup apps, which include BeautyPlus, MakeupPlus and SelfieCity. This is not the first high-powered publicity drive by Meitu; an earlier in-app promotion campaign with key South Korean beauty influencer and makeup artist Pony on its app MakeupPlus, alongside branded makeup looks, tutorials and livestreams on Meipai, led to over 730 million selfies being created using Pony's MakeupPlus looks. The success of the campaign inspired Meitu to help bridge the divide between east and west and satisfy a Chinese audience hungry for content from other markets. Meitu's apps, including MeituPic, Meipai, SelfieCity, BeautyCam, BeautyPlus, BeautyPlusMe, Airbrush and MakeupPlus, are installed on over one billion unique devices worldwide."
Flag-themed nail art: the surprise Olympic beauty trend,"Leading the way was Serena Williams, who has long championed bold style choices on court. The US tennis legend sported a miniature American flag on her forefinger during her women's third-round singles tennis match against Ukraine's Elina Svitolina last week, emphasizing the point with a US-themed scrunchie and a red headband. Switzerland's Isabelle Forrer matched her nails to her red costume during the women's beach volleyball qualifying match between Switzerland and Australia, adding a striking white cross to her ring fingers in a replica of the Swiss flag, as a reminder of her fighting spirit. Manika Batra made sure that all those close-up shots of her serving in her women's singles qualification round table tennis match featured the Indian flag, thanks to her colourful and eye-catching nail design, while Canadian Jamie Lynn Broder opted for an artistic, abstract style for the women's beach volleyball qualifying match between Germany and Canada, featuring a cute maple leaf print in pillar-box red on a white background. Gold medallist Katie Ledecky displayed her pride at swimming the 800m freestyle for team USA with a manicure that alternated red, blue, and white stripes. And finally, Marleen van Iersel managed to honour both her home country of the Netherlands and nod to the spirit of the games during the women's beach volleyball qualifying match between the Netherlands and Costa Rica, with nail art alternating the Dutch flag and the iconic five rings logo of the tournament. Team spirit? Nailed it."
Deodorant is key in the beauty routine of young Germans,"""At the beginning of puberty, young people experience their own body odour to be rather embarrassing or even disgusting - and the same goes for that of others. An unpleasant smell is to be avoided by all means. In extreme cases, adolescents and young adults are even mobbed because they smell of sweat - and they mob others because of their body odour,"" says IKW. In such a context, the study Youth undisguised [1] finds that most young people do not leave the house without deodorant. It is also a permanent companion in sports and school bags which helps to control some of the unpleasant sensations of the transition to adulthood. 83 percent of adolescents and young adults use deodorant once or several times a day. For 81 percent, deodorant can even contribute to strengthening their self-esteem. ""There is a psychologically interesting explanation for this: One's own body odour is closely linked to the emerging sexuality during puberty. During puberty, young people actually and figuratively get 'hot' more frequently. And the body odour gives this away. Deodorant is therefore not only used to conceal the personal smell and instead create a more favourable scent, but also serves to mask the treacherous pheromones. This provides adolescents and young adults not only with more confidence when dealing with friends. They can also play it safe when meeting the opposite sex, avoiding embarrassment and the risk of being rejected because people do not like their smell."" The connection between odour and the transition to adulthood can also be recognized from the fact that deodorants are often a bone of contention between parents and their children: parents often do not like the new scent or perceive it as extremely exaggerated - this is why young people frequently use deodorant in their own room or only after they have left the house. What did young people say: ""Deodorants are part of the day-to-day."" ""When I'm with my girlfriend, I do not want to stink."" ""We will leave a note on the table if somebody stinks: ""Buy yourself a deodorant."" – You may easily be mobbed."" ""Deodorant leaves me feeling safe."" ""My father always says that it stinks and that I use too much of it – I'm only allowed to use it in my room."""
Cosmoprof Bologna launches new B2B area,"Located in pavilion 19, the new area will gather: – the Extraordinary Gallery, Cosmoprof exclusive area dedicated to emerging and innovative luxury beauty brands and companies, – the Premium Perfumery zone, dedicated to masstige exhibitors and perfumes, cosmetics and toiletries, – as well as the International Buyer Lounge, where are organized meetings between Cosmoprof and Cosmopack exhibitors and selected distributors and brands. In collaboration with Accademia del Profumo and Cosmetica Italia, the Italian Personal Care Association, the Cosmoprime area will also include The Perfume Factory where all the industrial steps of the production of a perfume will be reproduced, from olfactory creation to maceration, from filtration to filling, packaging and cellophane wrapping. To celebrate the 50th edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna a fragrance will even be produced in limited edition. The Perfume Factory will also host the Accademia del Profumo Awards ceremony with a location designed for that purpose. Eventually, the new area will also host the Cosmoprime Forum, an educational program featuring workshops and round tables with a focus on present and future beauty trends and retail issues. Cosmoprime will open its doors to visitors from 16-19 March 2017, in conjunction with Cosmopack, the part of the fair dedicated to the beauty supply chain. According to the organisers, this timing ""will allow professional visitors to spend one more day in scheduling B2B meetings and increasing their network and, at the same time, business relationships between the beauty industry, exhibiting at Cosmopack, and companies of finished products attending Cosmoprime will be easier."" The 2016 edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna has been characterized by record numbers, with 2,510 exhibitors and more than 200,000 visitors attending the show."
"All4Pack to focus on European consumers' ""packaging experience""","The survey was conducted last May by the ObSoCo, in collaboration with the show's Expert Committee gathering a panel of major brand representatives, among 2,186 consumers in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. It aimed to define European consumers' ""packaging experience"", both from a functional and emotional perspective, considering the major challenges the packaging industry is facing today: personalization, application, fight against the carbon footprint, digitalization of points of sale, and e-commerce. The first of the main lessons to be learnt is that most respondents are favourable to innovation. 57% consider smart, connected packaging represents a real source of progress, including 71% of those aged 18-24. In the Beauty/Health/Luxury sector, which pays close attention to the product composition, for 31% of the people surveyed, it will help improve people's health and life quality. As for e-commerce-related constraints, more than half the respondents, all countries included, say they are in favour of reducing the environmental impact. But their design expectations vary depending on their nationalities: 43% of the Spanish and 38% of the French prefer solid packaging, while 33% of the Germans and 32% of the Italians would choose light packaging to reduce waste. This small gap is also generational, as lightness is the best option for young adults aged 18-24, while the 55+ are more favourable to the other solution. Still, for 35% of the people surveyed, the most important function remains the guarantee for a well-protected product or formula. The packaging information that mentions the product origin is also deemed essential. 32% of the French mainly see the packaging as a ""source of useful information on the product."" The most expected data is mainly the geographical origin, for 24% of respondents of all countries, while 19% of them favour the composition, and 18% the producer's identity. This function is also valid for the Beauty/Health/Luxury sector, since 27% of the people surveyed consider the packaging has an informative role. But for 16% of them, it is also the ""object that helps buy the right dose"", and 13% see it as an added value for products – a trend that is confirmed in the luxury segment. As it is so popular, innovation will be to the fore at All4Pack. Designed as the showcase of trends and new launches, the Pack Innovation will provide a global vision, with a selection of ten innovative packaging designs. The Best Pack area will be focused on connected packaging and e-commerce, in collaboration with international design schools. And the guests invited on the TV set will discuss the approaches observed as well as a prospective vision. Lastly, the 2016 edition will host the Pentawards Exhibition 10/10 as a world exclusive: a unique retrospective of the best packaging rewarded for their great creativity for 10 years in 10 categories."
e-beauty in all its forms,"And who are the main drivers and beneficiaries of this achievement? Women consumers. Most of them have now already acquired a few skills in new technologies, so they adopt innovations without any reservations. YouCam MakeUp, the free Android and IPhone application developed by the Taiwan-based Perfect Corporation company, was downloaded 150 million times in 18 months around the world. To adapt to the endless diversity of people and optimize the interaction between consumers and cosmetics brands, Alice Chang, founder of Perfect Corporation, wanted a platform dedicated to beauty that would gather three applications to apply any virtual makeup (YouCam MakeUp, YouCamNails), improve selfies (YouCamPerfect), and exchange on beauty with a social network for the beautysta community (Beauty Circle). YouCam MakeUp, the most popular of all three applications, makes it possible for users to instantaneously test the latest makeup trends and their shades on their faces, thanks to the augmented reality technology. Its strength is that it reflects a moving camera image and gives a high quality result. The application mainly seduces the Millenials generation in the United States, China, Brazil, but also France – 79% of women users are aged 18 to 34. The website receives about 15 two to four-minute visits per month, during which all users test 11 colours on average, at each session. The success of YouCam MakeUp also represents for brands a fantastic opportunity to enjoy direct access to 150 million potential customers. Partnerships help them take advantage of general information reports, like the most common wishlists saved according to the various regions of the world, or get more personalized information with competitions created in collaboration with women's magazines or relayed through the Beauty Circle community. The objective is to boost online sales on brands' e-stores, but the test/validation/purchase trilogy is convincing for both parties. Similarly, it is all about virtual reality with OTSTC Creative Biometric. Created in 2003, the agency is already working with Armani, Biotherm, Boots, Vichy/La Roche-Posay/Inneov, Dior, Givenchy, or Guerlain to offer virtual solutions, applications, or software for makeup, hair dyes, and skin diagnoses – all in real time. A real tool to enhance sales, the solution also applies to points of sale, where the products showcased can be virtually tested. The intuitive touch screen application mimics makeup gestures for a natural effect. As for LF Beauty, who aim to shape tomorrow's retail, they present a new technology based on a camera placed in different retail display spaces to detect consumers' hand movements and identify the products examined. The Link Influence company has adopted a different approach, by banking on collecting and analyzing data from the web. Their tool, Radarly, makes it possible to listen to conversations and comments made on websites' forums and social networks in real time. This raw material is retrieved, processed, and analyzed by a team of sociologists and research directors, and then sent back to customer companies. For R&D services on the look-out for trends, this information is a new godsend. ""There is a strong demand from cosmetics brands to better understand customer expectations. The luxury sector, which has been less in demand recently, is also getting increasingly interested in this technology,"" comments Laëtitia Amiault, Link Influence Sales Director in France. The company is also present in England and Germany, and has just purchased its counterpart in China, where the social web is used differently. In this overview of new technologies, one can notice the appearance of an essential data resource: sampling. Sample distributor Delpi, developed by Adelpi, delivers both samples and information reports on consumers to brands. Thanks to its interactive screen, this terminal informs users via different ways (videos, ad campaigns, pictures, product information…). And it is them who, on their own initiative, ask for the perfume or cosmetic sample of their choice, after filling in a quick questionnaire with their names and email addresses (the addresses are checked and validated in real time). A QR code can be added to learn more about the sample's journey and transformation into a product purchase. The connected Delpi terminals can be personalized and integrated to any type of environment (points of sale, parties, shopping malls, cinemas…). This 100% French technology is available on the national territory for now."
Brexit: What are the implications for the cosmetics industry?,"Of course, there will be many changes, but absolutely nothing has happened yet! The outcome of the British vote marks the beginning of long negotiations, and until the process is over, the United Kingdom remains a member of the Union, with all the rights and obligations that derive from this. In particular, EU law continues to apply to and in the United Kingdom until it is no longer a member. ""For our cosmetics sector, it means that all existing laws, regulations and guidelines remain in place exactly as they did before the vote - nothing changes,"" said the Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association (CTPA) in a release. ""In particular, it means that all of the cosmetics sold in the UK must continue to comply fully with the European Cosmetic Products Regulation, including requirements relating to safety, labelling and the ban on animal testing."" One can imagine, once the final decision for the exit has been made, that the United Kingdom's legislation will gradually differ from that of the European Union. It is plausible, but it is not the most likely hypothesis. In fact, it will mainly depend on the role the country will decide to play within Europe. Indeed, the reality is that the European integration process offers European States a wide range of options, in particular in terms of business relationships. The United Kingdom may, once again, become a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), similarly to Switzerland. This way, its goods would not be taxed as part of intra-European trade, and it would take advantage of the free trade agreements between the EFTA and third countries. Since the EFTA is not a customs union, the United Kingdom will still need to renegotiate its tariffs with all the countries that have not signed any agreement with this organization. The United Kingdom might even join the European Economic Area (EEA), as did the three other members of the EFTA – Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway – to maintain the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labour (the four freedoms at the core of the single market). [1] However, in exchange, the European legislation will need to be enforced in these areas. In practice, the British would then have to undertake to comply with what they have just rejected, meaning: the better part of European rules and standards. Or worse, they would no longer have a word to say regarding their content, since EEA members only have a right of consultation when it comes to drafting the European texts related to them. So, just like Switzerland, the United Kingdom might choose to get its relationships with the EU sorted bilaterally, by negotiating on a case-by-case basis the clauses on the free movement (or not) of capital, goods, services, and labour. As for the Swiss, this resulted in a massive convergence with the EU. ""The UK is still in Europe. We will not be relocating the country to Asia. Commerce and collaboration between the UK, EU member states, and the rest of the world will continue,"" highlighted Simon Birkenhead, Europe Managing Director of L2 consulting firm. However, nobody knows what the UK's future relationship with the EU will look like and the uncertainty is the real risk. ""We will be following the developments closely to ensure we give clear and consistent advice to members as the process of an exit unfolds. Undoubtedly there will be much speculation and many will 'jump the gun' in saying what needs to be done and by whom,"" CTPA Director General Chris Flower told Premium Beauty News. ""We will avoid that to ensure we continue to give clear and sound advice in a timely manner to aid clarity and not create confusion."" As a result, the United Kingdom will need to renegotiate both the conditions of its divorce and of its new relationship with the European Union, in a form that remains to be defined. ""At present, there are many possible options for this new relationship, but things will not be the same as before an exit,"" the Director General of the CTPA insisted. One thing is nearly for sure, the United Kingdom will no longer be the gateway to the European market for many cosmetics brands and suppliers, in particular from North America. It will no longer be considered as a first country to export to within the European Union, and it will no longer keep the Cosmetic Product Information Files required by the European Regulation, except if unlikely bilateral agreements are concluded in this regard. Now, that's a hard blow for many multinational companies settled in the country! In contrast, European companies surveyed by Premium Beauty News are rather optimistic. According to them, the impact on the cosmetics industry will be low due to the limited role of the country in this sector. However, a recession in the United Kingdom would necessarily affect the European market."
"Personalization and social media drive sales of U.S. beauty brands in 2015, according to Kline","""Personalization starts at the product level when brands like Skin Inc., Lancôme, or Mix-o-logie offer their custom beauty regimens or scents, and continues through personalized products suggestions offered by beauty apps or targeted marketing messages through various social media platforms,"" explains the market research firm. Both large and niche brands utilize the power of social media to connect with target consumers. Large brands like Neutrogena, Clinique, or Estée Lauder have become key social influencers as they turned to beauty social media celebrities to appeal to millennials. Smaller brands, such as Tarte, Too Faced, E.L.F. Cosmetics, Anastasia Beverly Hills, and IT Cosmetics, among others, often choose to make relationships by appealing to their target audience through the girl-next-door type of social stars. ""Smaller brands have a distinct advantage as they are very nimble and can listen more closely and adapt to consumers' demands quicker,"" comments Naira Aslanian, the research project manager. ""The fact that smaller brands, particularly in the makeup products class, grow the strongest confirms the power of social media levelling the playing field among large players with hefty advertising budgets, and small, niche brands that do not have the larger marketing budgets. It also demonstrates the power these companies have in terms of sales."" Recognizing the efficiency of direct engagement with consumer, large brands are also shrinking their traditional marketing and advertising budgets, indicating a move towards digital and social campaigns. Mobile devices play a crucial role in personalizing a consumer's beauty routine. Sephora launches its online Pocket Contour class, a mobile-only experience that helps beauty newbies gain knowledge of how to properly contour. Apps like Beautiful Me or Plum Perfect can digitally identify the shoppper's skin tone and suggest the ideal makeup match from the user's social media photos. Moreover, ""selfie approved"" products like Covergirl's Outlast Stay Luminous foundation, along with various bold lipsticks, are introduced due to the high impact of social media on consumers. Resonating with the selfie generation desiring bold lips and driven by innovative products, lipsticks and lip glosses is the fastest-growing product category, recording over 8% growth in 2015 in the US market. The key drivers are multi-functional/hybrid products like liquid lipsticks, which provide skin care benefits, as well as bold, long-lasting lip colour. With more men paying more attention to their personal appearance, skin care products for men record the highest growth of 9.5% in 2015. While skin care is driven by a gender focus, the fragrances category moves away from being gender-specific, especially niche scents."
The European cosmetics market returns to a more dynamic growth,"According to the figures recently released by Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics and toiletries market grew by +3.1% in 2015, compared to 2.1% in 2014. ""Our industry remains strong and shows signs of growth despite trying economic circumstances. Valued at 77 billion Euros, Europe remains the largest market for cosmetic products in the world,"" commented Loïc Armand, President of Cosmetics Europe. The growth was driven by dynamic sales in Switzerland (+12.4%), the United Kingdom (+10.9%), Romania (+8%) and Hungary (7.5%). As far as product categories are concerned, make-up was the most dynamic (+7.2%), followed by skin care (+3.4%), toiletries (+2.8%) and fragrances and perfumes (+2.7%). Hair care remain the weakest category but returned to growth in 2015 (+0.8% compared to -0.2% last year). Skin care and toiletries remain the most important product categories in Europe, followed by hair care and fragrances. On the occasion of the third Cosmetics Europe Week, which was held from 13 to 17 June 2016, the European association of cosmetic manufacturers, also presented the results of a study on the socio-economic contribution of the cosmetics industry. According to the report prepared by Risk & Policy Analysts Ltd. (RPA): – The vast majority of Europe's 500 million consumers use cosmetics and personal care products contributing to well-being and healthy lifestyles, and positive self-esteem every day. – The European export market (mainly from France, Germany and Italy) totalled 17.2 billion Euros in 2015, with France and Germany accounting for around 53% of total exports from Europe. – The strength of the entrepreneurial cosmetics industry lies in its mix of both big and small companies: there are 4,605 SMEs in Europe and this number is growing – At least 2 million jobs are supported across the European value chain, with 56% women and 44% men being employed in the cosmetics industry. – The sector is science driven with more than 26,000 scientists in the industry, covering a diverse range of scientific disciplines. ""Europe is the global flagship producer of cosmetic products. In 2015, the European cosmetics market was valued at 77 billion euros, making Europe the largest market for cosmetic products in the world. The industry make a significant contribution to the European economy across its value chain. It is estimated that the cosmetics industry brings at least 29 billion euros in added value to the European economy every year, of which 8 billion euros is contributed directly by the manufacture of cosmetic products (the remaining 21 billion euros is generated indirectly through the supply chain),"" said Cosmetics Europe."
Parisian department store Printemps Haussmann inaugurates the Avery Perfume Gallery,"The Avery concept was born in 2010 in London and created by a store inaugurated just a minute away from New Bond Street. Then, stores opened in Modena, Italy, and New Orleans, Louisiana, and the concept gradually spread across the world. Today, from Milan to Doha, and from Rabat to Moscow, all stores show different settings, but assert their own identity depending on their aspirations and the local environment. However, they do share some common points: mainly an atypical olfactory discovery experience combining the works of artists, creators, and new talents. The concept will now be introduced in France at the Printemps Haussmann department store in Paris. ""Avery has seduced us with its differentiated offering,"" explains Delphine Herve Turra, Beauty Market Manager at Le Printemps. ""They had a certain modernity and olfactory interest in their product selection, and we had the same requirements,"" she adds. Pending the opening of a new area dedicated to Beauty scheduled for 2017, le Printemps Haussmann will inaugurate a temporary 12m2 Avery Perfume Gallery corner at the store's entrance. A real curiosity room, it will showcase a scenography of bottles, prints, carefully selected objects, including a collection of ceramic sculptures to diffuse perfumes, and rare brands: the exclusive Avery lines, but also Re Profumo, Santa eulalia, So oud, Boadicea the Victorius, Andrée Putman, A Lab on Fire, Roads, and Agonist. Absolutely unique in France, The Fragrance Kitchen will be the flagship brand of the area and the inspiration for its theatrical identity. Created five years ago by Sheik Majed Al-Sabah, of the Kuwait royal family, who is very keen on perfumes and beautiful materials, it comprises 80 references and has already seduced many enthusiasts on the other side of the Atlantic. ""Le Printemps has always been able to make people discover new launches. It takes longer and longer for us to make our selection, as it needs to be increasingly more sophisticated,"" declares Delphine Herve Turra. ""We bank on brands that have the potential to develop in the long term. It is essential to take the time to get the concept settled and really correspond to our foreign customers' expectations, but also to make our aura shine forth to our French customers,"" she concludes."
Natural formulations and changing consumer habits transform US facial skincare and anti-aging market,"The overall facial skincare and anti-aging market experienced a 1.4 percent decrease in sales in 2015, falling to US$6.6 billion, with limited engagement from the aging Baby Boomer population impacting the entire category. Consumers age 55+ are the least likely to report usage of nearly every facial skincare product surveyed by Mintel [1], with one third (32 percent) not using any of the surveyed products (vs 19 percent overall). However, according to a recent report by the market research firm [2] consumer interest in natural formulations and changing cleansing habits present opportunities. According to Mintel, natural formulations have become central to the facial skincare and anti-aging market, as major brands and niche brands alike now feature natural claims on product packaging. Interest in natural beauty and personal care ingredients is on the rise, and natural product trends paired with the strong association between diet and skin is driving the emergence of food-based and probiotic facial skincare. Actually more, consumers are interested in milder, more natural formulations and those that shield against pollution as one in seven (14 percent) agree that pollution impacts the appearance of their skin. What's more, consumers also view lifestyle as an important factor in their skin's appearance, with many agreeing that factors such as hydration (44 percent) and diet (36 percent) impact skin's appearance more than using skincare products (26 percent). Another 38 percent agree that stress impacts the appearance of their skin, and as such, 30 percent of consumers look for anti-aging products featuring anti-stress claims. As a consequence, consumers are most likely to be using or interested in using products with vitamin C (85 percent), fruit based ingredients (78 percent), oatmeal (78 percent) and honey (76 percent). Further supporting this trend, 72 percent of consumers use or are interested in using products featuring probiotics. ""Consumers are embracing healthy, holistic living, and our research shows that these lifestyle changes are driving the facial skincare and anti-aging market. In such a saturated marketplace, products featuring natural formulations are standing out to consumers who trust identifiable and natural ingredients,"" said Shannon Romanowski, Category Manager, Health, Household, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. ""The link between diet and skin is evident, and as consumers increasingly associate their lifestyle with their skin's appearance, product formulations with added food-based ingredients and vitamins stand out among the competition."" Furthermore, Mintel research reveals that saturation in the facial skincare and anti-aging market is occurring as benefits in traditional moisturizers, anti-aging products and specialized products blur category segments. Products such as daily use moisturizers now integrate anti-aging benefits, leading to a decline in sales of strictly defined anti-aging treatments. In fact, while anti-aging is still the largest segment in the category, it saw sales decrease 6.3 percent 2014-15. Further, 21 percent of consumers do not use and are not interested in using anti-aging products compared to 18 percent of consumers who use them. While lip balm has been one of the most dynamic and fastest growing segments of the category, with sales increasing 55 percent from 2010-14, the segment faltered in 2015 as sales declined 3 percent due, in part, to competition from coloured cosmetics (e.g. tints, gloss, lipstick) with moisturizing and protective qualities undercutting sales. Reported usage of lip balm took a slight dip from 2014-15, dropping from 52 percent to 49 percent of consumers using these products. Meanwhile, facial cleansers continue to gain market share from the anti-aging segment. The cleanser segment is currently the fastest growing in the market, increasing sales 4.6 percent 2014-15 to reach $1.8 billion. Anti-aging products are also losing market share to moisturizers, which experienced an uptick of sales of 2.9 percent 2014-15, amassing US$765 million. As the facial cleanser segment increases market share, no-rinse cleansers are poised for growth. Mintel research reveals that while just 8 percent of adults currently use cleansing waters (also referred to as micellar waters), this increases to 14 percent of consumers age 18-34. And consumers view cleansing waters favourably, with many agreeing that they are refreshing (45 percent), safe for sensitive skin (43 percent) and more gentle (39 percent) than rinse-off cleansers. However, there are barriers to usage: nearly half (46 percent) of consumers perceive these products as more expensive than rinse-off cleansers and one quarter (28 percent) agree they have confusing usage instructions. ""While the facial skincare category has experienced tepid sales over the years, in 2015 we saw declines for the first time in five years. Moving forward, the category's success will rely on younger consumers and the growing facial cleanser segment, with an emphasis on natural, recognizable ingredients and innovation like 'waterless cleansing.' To broaden the appeal of these products, brands should be proactive in addressing concerns surrounding cost and usage instructions,"" concluded Romanowski."
MakeUp in Paris: An edition full of new features,"Eventually, the Seine River did not flood the Louvre and MakeUp in Paris opens its doors this week on the seventh edition of a trade show, which has established itself, even more this year, as the big European appointment in the global make-up sector. Yet this new edition is setting new records. 150 exhibitors coming from 19 countries - the biggest number since the creation of the show - will present visitors new ingredients, formulas, packaging and accessories dedicated to the make-up industry. Furthermore, one week before the opening, MakeUp in Paris counted more than 4,000 pre-registered visitors, the highest number ever. Among the new features of this edition, a very special highlight will be put on environmental issues. Many exhibitors participated in the green innovation contest organized by the MakeUp in Paris team and sponsored by Chanel Parfums et Beauté: ten formulation companies decided to submit a total of sixteen products while twelve packaging and accessory suppliers will present a total of nineteen products. The products selected will be presented to visitors in the MakeUp in sustainable area of the event. This area, located at the entrance of the show will enable visitors to better understand and therefore better anticipate environmental issues in the ""Personal care & Beauty sector"". Chanel Parfums et Beauté, the sponsor of this area, will take the opportunity to introduce its SEP tool developed with the company Pure Project, an open source tool available to all interested companies. MakeUp in Paris 2016 also opens its doors to the digital revolution which is shaking the beauty industry! With the Digital Beauty area, visitors will have the opportunity to discover digital solutions applied to beauty and make-up and meet the various service providers in the field. ""These can be very innovative companies in product design, distribution and customer relations, of consulting firms specialized in digital strategy,"" explain the organizers. Alongside the Digital Beauty area, a series of conferences will be proposed to get a grasp at the following key topics: – Give the product a different dynamic, with a 3D dimension; – Encourage the brand to express itself, and interact with a knowledgeable audience; – Offer an interactive, offline and online personal experience; – Reinvent customer relationship. In addition, the show will feature nearly twenty conferences led by thirty speakers on topics as varied as the everyday work of a MakeUp Artist, the expectations of the Distribution sector, the art of using an applicator, the extraordinary impact of a sample on product sales, the fantastic progress made by tools dedicated to Packaging Design, the training of students who one day will be in charge of managing these specific tools, and finally the dominating influence of environmental concerns on all these Beauty related activities, and more..."
Pack & Gift 2016 to focus on digitalization and customization,"Innovative materials, connectivity, 3D, new solutions and new technologies are reshaping the promotional offerings of tomorrow. This mutation of the market will be at the heart of the 9th edition of the Pack & Gift tradeshow under the Pack Fiction common thread. ""The field of expression for promotional offerings is increasingly vast, and Pack & Gift strives, year in and year out, to highlight these new trends, so essential in the quest to come up with ever more striking solutions,"" say the organizers. Formerly the preserve of luxury brands, promotional packaging today concerns every sector. Conscious that these offerings shine a real spotlight on their products, brands are paying more and more attention to them, and taking particular care not only in the creation of the promotional product itself, but also of its overall environment, and in particular the way in which it is presented at the point-of-sale. Buoyed by the new fabrication, printing and customisation techniques, the creative possibilities are endless. On the stands as well as in the conferences or by way of the organized events, the Pack Fiction common thread will highlight the avant-garde solutions that shape the promotional offerings of tomorrow and open up new prospects to advertisers. All these solutions will be futuristically presented in the Pack Fiction area. A jury of expert professionals will reward the best solution on 16 June 2016. Two categories will be awarded: – New Technologies. Rethinking packaging and promotional items through the prism of digital. Personalization, connectivity, scalability and 3D will be the watchwords – Design. Materials and shapes are revolutionized, innovative, flexible, durable, sensory, eco-design and transform uses.. Offering a natural link to the theme of the show, a Pop-Up Store will illustrate - with the aid of demos - the new possibilities for point-of-sale presentations, which today can be brought to life thanks to the new printing and customisation techniques. Furthermore, a Trends Wall will guide visitors in their choice of colours, with a patented smart system enabling them to determine colour schemes suited to their products, their markets and their target consumers. This area, designed as a place of discovery and interactivity, will be managed by the ColoriConseil agency, in partnership with Pantone and ColorPassport. These demo zones will be complemented by a programme of conferences that will address and analyse all of these topics, in particular the roundtables ""Packaging has its digital revolution"" and ""Packaging customisation: trends and instruction guide"" or a presentation Birchbox's customer loyalty techniques by François Morrier, Joliebox Co-founder and Europe Creative Director Birchbox. More than 3,500 visitors are expected on Wednesday 15 and Thursday 16 June 2016 at the Paris Porte de Versailles Exhibition Centre, Hall 5.2."
China Beauty Expo: Focus on latest beauty trends of the Chinese market,"With three fairs under the same roof (Cosmetics, Professional Beauty and Cosmetech), China Beauty Expo brought together more than 800 suppliers and over 1,200 international and domestic brands in 15 halls of the Shanghai New International Exhibition Center. The beauty supply chain (the Cosmetech part of the show) featured over 800 exhibitors - including Intercos, Cosmax, Kolmar, HCT Group, Greentech, Yonwoo, Kyodo Printing, Haasbel, WestRock, Weckerlecosmetics, Symrise, Fiabila, Keystone - attracted by the 3,300 local cosmetics makers (including more than 50 companies whose production is valued at over 100 million Yuan). ""Cosmetech at China Beauty Expo is the biggest gathering point for beauty packaging and suppliers in the world,"" claim the show organizers. As far as finished products are concerned, the organisers have increased the international scope of the show with 20 collective pavilions (Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Israel, Japan, Korea, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, USA, etc.) and a focus on Korean brands and the K-Beauty wave which is taking the Chinese market by storm. Besides local brands, this unique gathering is a great opportunity for identifying the main trends of the Chinese beauty market. Beyond the traditional skin-lightening and anti-spot products that are traditionally associated to the Chinese market but were not taking centre stage this year, cosmetic brands have multiplied face and body care solutions: anti-wrinkles masks, strengthening, hydrating and lifting products, or gadgets that stretch the face to hide wrinkles, scars and dark circles… Acne - the teenager's enemy, but also the one of rebel skin adults - was one of the brains' main are of focus. Some brands now offer sessions of injections and pulsation in salon to eradicate acne. Others remain in the daily creams and scrubs masks, which components are so-called ""green"" or ""natural"". Besides the usual moisturizing body milks and creams, brands offer new solutions in order to hydrate the skin, including electric portable foggers and formulas with actives encapsulated in nutritious balls and some time with gold particles. Taking care of one's hair with repair masks or treating shampoos remains a big trend of the Chinese market. New products to boost the hair growth are also increasingly popular, as well as laser hair removal to get rid of unwanted hair. For even whiter teeth, brands even offer you toothpaste with ""natural"" whitening active ingredients, or whitening services ""respecting the enamel"". This year again, many new brands have chosen to surf the natural wave. Without really guaranteeing truly natural products, a large number of brands communicate on the natural qualities of their products and do not hesitate to use green-washing or green-painting techniques. Brands also launching care products for pregnant women and babies (creams for sensitive skin and children's skin, products with active ingredient to ""naturally and safely"" protect babies' skin, ...). In the wake of firming-leggings and similar types of clothes, some Japanese brands have chosen to innovate in slimming-lingerie lines to reshape the body without the constraints of the old corsets. For more fantasy: temporary tattoos, jewelry and 3D gel nails, metal capsule nails, makeup from common to unusual pigments, implantation one by one of false eyelashes for more real volume ... WeChat Commitment! A big trend of this show is the will of all brands to engage passersby in their WeChat account with contests, free samples, promotions if they scan the QR Code ... WeChat and other social networks have become essential for the success of a brand in beauty products in China. And it is the major communication channel for Chinese brands in 2016!"
Alternative Fragrance & Beauty: a show with the looks of a concept store in the heart of Paris,"Premium Beauty News - You describe Alternative Fragrance & Beauty as a new generation show. Can you tell us a bit more? Julie Cartigny - The Carreau du Temple is a venue dedicated to urban lifestyles. It is a real breeding ground for projects right in the heart of Paris. Alternative Fragrance & Beauty perfectly fits this concept, although we also strive to get off the beaten track. The word ""show"" too often rhymes with hubbub, turmoil in the aisles, and lack of natural light. It is an exhausting experience, so we have decided to offer everyone a break, so they can discover brands in a different way. The scenery designed by the Cent Degrés agency makes this ""circular"" walk quite atypical, as every brand can reproduce their own worlds with specific decorative items. This way, Alternative provides brands with a maximum of opportunities to tell their stories. As influences, sectors, and markets are opening up, it also seemed important to us to open the doors of this event to all exceptional product enthusiasts. The late-night opening on the Friday night and the whole day on Saturday, June 18 will make it possible for exhibitors to create a bond with this public of beauty lovers, without any intermediates. The exhibitors willing to sell their products will be able to do it, and the general public will have access to about ten free conferences. Premium Beauty News - How many brands are you expecting? Julie Cartigny - Alternative Fragrance & Beauty will welcome more than 130 brands: 60% from the worlds of makeup, skincare, hair care, and accessories, and 40% from perfumery (alternative perfumery, home perfumery, and all types of diffusers). We will offer an exceptional overview of innovation in this sector, from slow cosmetics to the most sophisticated skincare products, and demanding perfumery. Again, the idea is to gather an international, original offering with different retail positionings targeting networks like department stores and concept stores, but also independent hotels, spas, organic networks, independent perfume stores, pharmacies, selective distribution, distributors willing to broaden their portfolios… Premium Beauty News - The Beauty Challengers Awards used to be organized at Beyond Beauty Paris. They will now be part of this new show, but have you changed the model? Julie Cartigny - The Beauty Challengers Awards is a widely recognized competition that has existed for more than 10 years. Many brands now enjoying a solid reputation have been supported by global experts who spend some of their time every year to discover tomorrow's beauty. This year, we have decided to open the doors of our offices – a whole week at the end of May – to about forty influential jurors (decision makers or influencers), as well as to approximately thirty well-informed consumers, who will vote to reward the best brands. Again, it seems crucial to us to strengthen the direct relationship with consumers. Premium Beauty News - Can you also tell us about your partnership with Olfactorama? Julie Cartigny - We are delighted to benefit from the energy of the Olfactorama team, who will award their own prizes to the best perfumes of the year on the night of June 17, in the Carreau du Temple auditorium. Olfactorama, who will be present throughout the event, have also devised an Olfacto Blind Test for the show, where professional visitors will be able to blindly assess the perfume brands present. A dedicated award will be attributed following a visitor vote. Again, that's a first! Several other areas and animations will be organized throughout the three days to make both professional visitors and the general public live new experiences and stimulate their senses by visiting the IFF/Cent Degrés/Procédés Chenel/AESTHETE/Sensorial studio areas… to smell, touch, taste… Premium Beauty News - How many visitors are you expecting? Julie Cartigny - We are expecting between 1,000 and 1,500 professionals, including 20% foreign people, and over 1,500 visitors from the general public, though this is difficult to quantify. Consumer expectations are changing, and so is the offering in points of sale. The new faces of the Brazilian beauty market On the occasion of the Alternative Fragrance & Beauty tradeshow, the editorial team of Brazil Beauty News (the Brazilian edition of Premium Beauty News) will put one of the world's biggest cosmetics market under the spotlights. The roundtable will be moderated by Kristel Milet and Vincent Gallon (BrazilBeautyNews.com) and will feature the Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in France, Helen Kupfer-Haas (HKH Exclusive Brand Boosting), Alessandra Tucci (Perfumeria Paralela) and Sabine Lubot (Aptar). The Brazilian market is transforming dramatically, and new opportunities are emerging for brands and retailers. Retail channels are evolving toward more complexity and variety, new brands are entering the market and consumers' expectations are changing and becoming more sophisticated."
Fragrance houses strive to better understand gen Y and Z consumers,"The so-called ""GENYZ"", that elusive slab of society spanning from generation Z's tweens to 34-year old millennials, is drawing the attention of fragrance suppliers around the world. In order to effectively aim their products toward this moving, highly connected and short attention-spanned target, fragrance makers Symrise and Firmenich have run studies to map out how they relate to perfumes and assist their industry partners in better planning their launches. Symrise's qualitative research with Gen-Z girls in four US cities unveiled five trend concepts: 'Pretty Please', 'Enchanted Rebellion', '#Funfashionista', 'Don't Worry, B-Happy' and 'Get Sporty'. 'Pretty Please' orbits around traditional romantic, feminine love - the Juliets of the new age. 'Enchanted Rebellion', on the other hand, is all about a somber, sensual and mysterious approach towards love; think sexy vampires and devoted werewolves exchanging bites over a distraught maiden. ""#Funfashionista"" is this generation's Sex and the City, fusing together female friendship and a high sense of fashion with an urban-chic backdrop. 'Don't Worry B-Happy' translates a happy-go-lucky attitude towards life, while ""Get Sporty"" was a concept suggested by the interviewees themselves as an expression of their relation to sport fashion. According to the team at Symrise North America, participants were asked which aromas were related to these core concepts and then crossed the data with a list of top-selling perfumes for this demographic. The results were used to create a new collection of fragrances for perfumes, shampoos and shower gels, allowing Symrise's clients to develop products specifically aimed towards female Gen-Z consumers. Mapping the consumer behavior of tweens and teens revealed the most ethnically diverse and connected generation to walk the Earth thus far. ""Their main influences come from friends, social networks and also from their parents,"" says Doreen Bucher, VP Marketing, Fine Fragrance at Symrise North America. Having grown up under heavy influence of the Internet and smartphone culture, they are hardwired towards innovation and display short attention spans. Nevertheless, they've quickly come to realize their buying choices affect other people's lives as well as the environment, and therefore demand transparency from their brands of choice. Although fragrances are not among the top priorities for this group of consumers, they still have an important role once suggested. When asked how they would spend US$ 100 and US$ 1000, clothes and shoes got the biggest slice of the pie, but fragrances weren't far behind. ""What's interesting is that at this age they are still defining who they are in the world, so the way they dress and the brands they choose are of high importance,"" says Bucher. The research also pointed out how most of the 14 to 17 year old girls targeted in the study struggle to express the kind of fragrances they prefer and find it hard to describe them in words. Interviewees vaguely ascertain that they're more inclined towards ""light and fresh, but no too floral"" scents. Curiously enough, they also claim to enjoy men's fragrances, coming as far as using male deodorants because they think they are more effective. Fragrance supplier Firmenich, on the other hand, focused their studies on millennials of 16 cities in 12 different countries, including Brazilian capitals Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Recife. The research was made in partnership with marketing intelligence veteran Archetype Discoveries Worldwide and relied on a sensorial methodology. The study was based on the Jungian concept of archetypes, and pledged to shed light on the subconscious expectations of a generation that is highly active on the virtual world, but passive on the real world. ""We needed to fully understand what is behind this behavior, how millennials truly feel and figure out what we can do to help our clients reach out for their hearts,"" says Daniela Cunha, marketing director at Firmenich Brasil. One of the company's exclusive products to come out of this research effort was the Harmony fragrance, which blends the freshness of the hundred-leaved rose, crystalline musk and velvety incense, resulting in a scent that evokes tranquility and wellbeing. According to Firmenich, the scent also references the current blurring of gender stereotypes."
The subtle sophistication of Iran,"In her introduction, the study's author reiterates the fact that its geographic situation and history shaped Iran very differently from its Oriental neighbours. As the cultural crossroads between Russia in the North and Africa in the South, the country has always been the meeting point of the Eastern routes. ""This is one of the reasons why a great variety of endemic ingredients can be found there, like saffron or the rose,"" Hélène Capgras explains. Its history, the richness of the Persian culture, the fact that it was at the forefront of modernization in the 70s, the shock of the Islamic revolution, or the Iran/Iraq war, all these factors have built the profile of a contemporary society between modernity and constraints. The 21 cultural, historical, sociological, or lifestyle topics chosen for the Brain for Beauty study give an accurate vision of the pillars of this society. Women or femininity is one of these topics, and it is recurring, in particular in the chapter about fire: this key element symbolizes Iran, born from the pre-Islamic religion known as Zoroastrianism, ""this very egalitarian religion that built the role of women within society and made it possible for them to have access to the status of Queen or Head of the armed forces,"" Hélène Capgras explains. Women also appear in the evocation of the ""7 princesses"" that embody the diversity of Iranian beauties, from the Kurdish influences in the North to the high cheekbones at the gates of Russia, the golden hair allegedly responsible for the victories over the Roman armies, or the matter complexions in the South, often with bright eyes… femininity is always reflected in the body's grace. Less lascivious than Oriental women, Iranian women look slim and thin. Today, this femininity faces restrictions and bans, but Iranian women deal with it with compromises: Hélène Capgras talks about a ""constant body fight"". ""In 1990, makeup was completely banned. Today, it has become a way for them to assert themselves through beauty. It is a positive mask that helps cope with the public space outside, such a contrast with private lives indoors, where people are freer,"" she describes. Men share the same approach of beauty, as depicted in the chapter about Heroes. This myth conveyed the notion of masculine beauty for centuries, and it is still visible today in the attention Iranian men pay to their image. ""The importance of well-known floral perfumes actually outdoes the powerful trails of the Middle East, in particular with the rose, the olfactory expression of femininity,"" Hélène Capgras emphasizes. Whether they be classics, memories of the 70s, or niche fragrances, perfumes are essential for both men and women. French and Italian brands dominate a market where counterfeiting is still common. And cosmetics and makeup encounter the same difficulties: ""there is an incredible variety of import brands, but the offering is still complex to decipher depending on the distribution modes,"" Hélène Capgras observes. And yet, new perfume stores and pharmacies are present, with a very rich offering in hair care: a whole chapter is dedicated to it in the study. Iran's young, educated population makes it a real demographic pot: if young people are confronted with restrictions and bans, they still manage to cleverly circumvent them to claim their own identity. Indeed, in conclusion to her study, Hélène Capgras highlights the extraordinary personality of this country in search for a modern Persian expression of luxury. ""This country radiates a subtle sophistication that can mostly be found in Beauty codes."""
United Kingdom: Face oils drive growth in prestige skincare,"The growing popularity of face oils is driving growth in the prestige skincare market in the UK, according to the NPD Group. The women's face oil market was worth £4.9 million (EUR 6.2 million) in 2015, and whilst this category accounts for just 1% of the total prestige women's skincare market, it reported double digit growth in 2015 where it increased by 30.8% compared to 2014. ""This demonstrates that innovation is key to the development and growth of new categories within skincare, it also reveals that there is real opportunity for further growth,"" says Teresa Fisher, Senior Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. Actually, the face oils category (which includes: facial moisturisers, facial cleansing oils, anti-ageing beauty oils) is among the most dynamic ones in the United Kingdom. The market of women's face oils has grown from £2.3 million in 2011 to £4.9 million in 2015, doubling in size in just four years. Treatment shave products for men, an emerging category reported sales of £4.7 million in 2015 growing 20% on 2014, demonstrating that men have adopted oils for shaving preparation as part of their daily shaving ritual. According to NPD, the market for prestige face oil products has been fuelled in part by the increased awareness of the product category. New launches in the facial oil sector in the past year include Elemis Nourishing Cleansing Oil, Bare Minerals Mineralixirs, Clinique Smart Treatment Oil and Kiehl's Daily Reviving Concentrate. However, the number of new product launches for face oils in the UK was just 15 in 2015, compared to the number of launches in the serum sector which was 45. Indeed, the serum market is more mature with sales of £49 million in 2015. Nevertheless, The NPD Group considers the face oils market presents a huge opportunity for brands. Furthermore, the trend for facial oils has extended beyond skincare to include new product launches in the make-up sector with Clarins Instant Light Lip Comfort Oil, Lancôme Juicy Shaker, Smashbox Photo Finish Primer Oil and YSL Rouge Volupte Tint in Oil. Best-selling face oil products in the UK in 2015 (alphabetical order) Bobbi Brown - Soothing Cleansing Oil 200ml Clarins - Huile Orchidee Bleue 30ml Clarins - Huile Santal 30ml Clinique - Take The Day Off Clns Oil 200ml Sisley - Rose Noire Huile Precieuse 25ml ""We are witnessing a new consumer who is increasingly turning to their peers for advice on products and take the lead from social media and bloggers. As a result they are willing to try new products and innovations, incorporating them into their beauty ritual,"" Teresa Fisher concludes."
"For Clarins, China is a pioneering digital market","Premium Beauty News - In China, you still mainly sell your products through department stores and spas. Why focus on digital technologies? Julien Chiavassa - Our online sales represent 15% of our total sales in China. This share is higher than the global average, which shows how advanced China is in the digital field, and in particular in the mobile field. Chinese consumers breathe through their mobile phones. And even if we still sell a lot via physical stores, the influence of digital platforms is getting stronger and stronger, as it impacts our offline activity more and more every day. Almost two thirds of our sales in physical stores are influenced by our digital points of impact. Our sales teams in-store and in e-commerce used to work separately, so we did not have any visibility or centralized database on our customers. Now, we want to get rid of this compartmentalization and send a coherent message through our distribution channels. We focus on the online content to develop the click & collect system, enrich the digital experience in-store, and make it more emotional. We aim at making the offline to online transition natural, because transactions are increasingly made online. Better knowing our customers helps us merge our online and offline loyalty programmes and improve our services. Premium Beauty News - How did you centralize your data from the various distribution channels upstream? Julien Chiavassa - Parallel to our physical network, our online sales in China are achieved by Tmall, the trading platform developed by the Alibaba group via Taobao (two thirds of our sales), our own Chinese Clarins website, clarins.com.cn (a quarter of our sales), and other retailers online. Our main challenge was to gather all our sales networks, making sure our system could handle all these different data. Then, everything changed with WeChat, the instant messaging application, which has become an aggregator, the essential contact point in China for anyone intending to do some brand communication, CRM, and loyalty programmes. In terms of marketing campaigns, we bank less on our website, and more on our official WeChat account. Once customers have been added to our database, we ask them to follow our official WeChat account, which provides us accurate knowledge of our recruiting platforms. Right now, we can learn how many customers are really present on all our networks. We can also determine how often new consumers are recruited by each network – Tmall is the best performing. And today in China, we can apply the same communication cycle to every new consumer, whatever their original channel. Premium Beauty News - Most of your turnover is achieved in Europe. Why have you chosen China to implement this cross-channel organization? Julien Chiavassa - China is the first market where we can develop our organization, due to its ecosystem. This market is really immersed in the digital world, mainly via mobile devices. The share of our media investments dedicated to digital technologies will have risen from 15% to 65% in two years in the Asian Pacific region. And it will have reached 100% in China. Given its specificities as an online environment – many Western websites are blocked – China offers the opportunity to adopt a local start-up approach, which actually makes things easier for us, as there is no need to adapt to this market if one already had a global installation. Besides, Chinese people are very enthusiastic, and our teams really committed. On top of that, our customers are always ahead of us: we keep trying to fill the gap between their expectations and what we offer them. As for the worldwide extension of this model, WeChat is the most popular messaging application in the Asian-Pacific region. We also plan to use WhatsApp in Japan and KakaoTalk in South Korea. Premium Beauty News - In terms of content, what do you feature on your WeChat account? Julien Chiavassa - In addition to brand and product information, we are trying to reach a certain balance with a lifestyle, less self-centred approach. And we endeavour to create an innovative content in coherence with the specific WeChat format, as it is very different from Facebook. We also work a lot on how to build a relationship with Chinese tourists abroad."
The face of European online beauty shoppers is changing,"""The online sales of beauty and body care products in Europe is set to grow more than eight per cent each year up until 2019. That means the online channel reflects four times the growth of stationary retail stores,"" according to Dr. Mirko Warschun, head of the Consumer Industries and Retail practice at A.T. Kearney for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. This is one of the key findings from the firm's current study of e-commerce trends for beauty and personal care products. Based on representative surveys of consumers in Germany, Great Britain and France, the global management consultancy company has been publishing this study annually since 2012. In addition to price - which is still the number one reason for online shopping - other purchasing criteria are gaining increasingly in importance: already half of those surveyed look for product information, customer ratings, tips and styling ideas. The study reveals that innovative applications such as online tests, mobile skin type apps, beauty forums and communities with expert tips, illustrated product reviews or complimentary samples with the delivery offer online retailers good opportunities for competitive differentiation. This is also a way to capture the 20 per cent of surveyed consumers who say they do not shop online because they need to see, feel and test a product. ""Retailers and brand owners who also give their customers a feeling for their products online are definitely ahead of the game,"" adds A.T. Kearney e-commerce expert Dr. Peter Pfeiffer. At the same time, British customers expect a high level of convenience. Nine out of ten feel a delivery time of no more than four days is acceptable. About half of those surveyed feel shipping should be free. However, if there are costs associated with delivery, 93 percent of the respondents said five Pounds would be the maximum limit per shipment. Overall, the study separated the target groups into five types according to age, monthly disposable income for beauty and personal care items (on-and offline), willingness to experiment and delivery expectations. The five groups are: Classic Beauty Shoppers (46 per cent), Natural Cosmetic Lovers (8 per cent), Health Conscious Shoppers (17 per cent) Fashionistas (9 per cent) and Beauty Junkies (10 per cent). ""Online retailers should use the differences among these consumer groups to tailor their promotions in order to attract Beauty Junkies and Fashionistas to new products or brands,"" according to Pfeiffer. Although these two segments make up the smallest share of shoppers at the moment, they spend two to three times more money per month on beauty and personal care products than the ""classic"" online customer. What's more, they enjoy a higher level of disposable income and are therefore more willing to pay for delivery and returns. In addition to product customization and tailoring ingredients and preservatives to specific customer needs, organic and natural cosmetics are a growing trend for online retailing in Europe: the majority of shoppers buy these products online, either exclusively or occasionally. However, in the U.K. so far it's only 37 per cent who occasionally buy these products online. The study also reveals that Amazon is clearly the market leader among shopping addresses when it comes to make-up, perfume or shower gel. In Great Britain, Amazon is followed by the drugstore chain Boots, which is also the third most important brand in the country. ""Online beauty shoppers are no longer looking at just price. They value the comfort of digital shopping, are looking for information and want to try new things. Customer knowledge is therefore becoming the key factor for success in online retailing since preferences are quite different depending on country and consumer segments,"" adds A.T. Kearney consumer goods expert Warschun."
Halal cosmetics: A growing global market but disparate certification systems,"""When an animal-based product isn't halal (""allowed"" in Arabic), or contains alcohol, it's not only forbidden to consume it, but it's also considered to be impure: you cannot use it on your face, or your skin,"" said Shaikh Ali Achcar, manning the stand of the Swiss-based Halal Certification Services (HCS) at the in-cosmetics tradeshow, which was held last week in Paris. Beside ethanol, the list of products prohibited under the Islamic law mainly includes animal byproducts: pork or pork by-products, animals that are dead or dying prior to slaughter, blood and blood by-products, carnivorous animals, birds of prey, land animals without external ears, etc. Actually, there are several ingredients that can be of concern to Muslim consumers eager to extend their respect of the Islamic law to cosmetic products. Possibly problematic ingredients include: allantoin, ambergris, collagen, elastin, ethanol, gelatine, tallow and tallow derivatives, snail slime, cochineal extract, etc. ""The majority of the consumers do not know if the product comes from animal-based ingredients or not. So when they see the halal product, they buy it,"" said Achcar. ""In the case of a company that has animal-based products and synthetic ones in the same (factory), we have to understand how they separate the production in order to avoid cross-contamination,"" he added. Achcar has begun to build a client base in the cosmetics industry, with HCS charging between 1,500 and 2,000 euros (about US $2,250) for its scientific team to analyse products. HCS also inspects factories to certify them as halal. A few years ago halal cosmetics were a niche market for a few small businesses, mainly in Muslim countries in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. But an industry worth around $20 billion (18 billion euros) in 2014 is expected to double by 2019, when it will represent six per cent of the global cosmetics market, according to the British market research firm TechNavio. The trend is boosted by the fact that ""some countries are developing regulations making it mandatory for cosmetic products to be certified halal,"" according to Monica Ducruet, who is in charge of regulatory questions for the Swiss group Givaudan's French subsidiary. Major beauty products companies are beginning to adapt to the trend. L'Oreal has had hundreds of its ingredients certified halal, and experts have checked its production lines turning out goods for the huge market in Indonesia, which counts 200 million Muslims. ""The fact that halal products can be traced back through the entire value chain is important for them in terms of quality assurance,"" German chemicals giant BASF said in a recent news release. The company has certified as halal 145 of its German-made ingredients destined for beauty and personal hygiene products. But Givaudan's Ducruet said companies were having difficulty standardising the certification. ""The problem is a lack of recognition between the different certifying bodies. Some countries, like Indonesia, have made lists of approved halal certifiers, but it's hard to have a certification recognised in several countries,"" she said. For instance, there are five large Halal certifiers in Germany, and state based systems in some countries such as Turkey and Iran, making it essential for brands to know their target markets before launching Halal products."
What is in people's minds when they buy organic cosmetics?,"Choosing to go for organic cosmetics usually implies a global, ""all-organic"" commitment. 85% of organic cosmetics buyers bought organic food over the past 12 months and confirm it corresponds to a will to change their lifestyles. This is conveyed by the fact that they focus more on their consumption pattern (wastage, waste management, carpool…), but above all, on their own physical fitness, for 86% of them, and psychological health, for 86% of them. This commitment is very contemporary, as organic cosmetics buyers adopted this lifestyle less than 5 years ago, for 70% of them, and often after they grew aware of the environmental or health impact. Their approach is boosted by the need to preserve their health (41%) and support environmental and ethical values (26%), but they also do it for their own pleasure (21%). Their choices are mainly oriented towards facial care, for 20% of them, and hair care (20%), and then body care (16%). The first profile corresponds to ""committed ambassadors"" for the environment. They are middle-aged, they have a good buying potential, and they represent 33% of buyers. Then, there is a group defined in the study as ""beauty addicts"" (25%): it is mainly composed of young women and motivated by a holistic vision favouring the price as the main purchase lever. The ""seniors concerned for their own health"" represent 21%, ""the animal advocates"" 12%, and there are 8% of hipsters, a group mainly composed of men. In addition, the study highlights the fact that these products are now more easily available, as purchases are equally made (30%) in supermarkets, pharmacies / parapharmacies, and specialized stores."
After a successful 2016 edition MakeUp in Seoul will launch an event dedicated to skincare,"With a number of exhibitors which was up by 20% compared to last year, the 2016 edition of MakeUp in Seoul started under the best auspices. Apparently, it met all the organisers' expectations. The number of visitors continued to rise, reaching a total of 2,416 this year with a net increase of Chinese and Japanese brands, according to organizers. Furthermore, more than 1,230 people packed the conference room over the two days to attend a series of conferences and get a complete run-down of the global make-up industry. ""Emphasis was put on China, Japan, Brazil and, of course, Korea with the presence of many personalities coming specially from these countries to discuss and exchange on the dynamism of the beauty industry. Questions were many and topics addressed were the subject of intense discussions,"" said the organisers. Mrs. Lee Eun-im, Director of the Hera Division - a brand part of the Amore Pacific Group - thus introduced the Seoulista concept, this Korean woman beauty who, like the Parisienne and New Yorker before her, now captivates the world. According to Eun-im, the Seoulista is an attractive woman who has a ""natural and well-honed instinct to see beyond beauty and fashion trends to create her own, inimitable style."" She is professional, sophisticated, and ""makes rational and informed decisions."" Crucially, Eun-im specifies, she is the ""only arbiter of her life"". The key to nailing the K-beauty aesthetic is a natural, healthy and flawless-looking complexion. Rather than using products to cover up imperfections, Seoulistas prefer to address the source of any issues, leading Hera to launch its new ""Age Reverse Cushion,"" designed for use on dull areas, such as around the nose and under the eyes. Additional products within the range include ""Hera Rouge Holic,"" a creamy textured lipstick designed for building colour with each application. The Hera brand, whose private lounge attracted many industry professionals was, for the third consecutive year, the partner of MakeUp in Seoul. The sensorial effects of cosmetic formulations was a key trend along the innovations presented this year by companies exhibiting at MakeUp in Seoul, including many shape-memory textures, and silky, satin or light effects. Considering the interest of the Korean market for beauty brands, the next edition of MakeUp in Seoul in April 2017 will be extended with a brand new event dedicated to skincare products: SkinCare in Seoul."
Esxence 2016: Flourishing niche perfumes in a changing future,"With a 26% increase over the last four years, according to The NPD Group, the niche market is as popular as ever. But is this dynamic capable of absorbing an ever growing abundance of brands and with a number of launches that seems to be increasing even more? Silvio Lévi, founder and director of the show estimates the niche perfumery potential to about one billion euros in Europe, with, he notes, however, great disparities between countries. ""All markets are not nearly as strong as Italy where, thanks to a large number of independent perfumeries, alternative perfumes can expect gaining 1,8% of the beauty market. While in France where, apart from Paris, the alternative network is very limited, this market share is only of 0.5%,"" he explained. Each year, after approval of a committee of nine experts, the show welcomes new brands or with developing ranges. The 2016 edition hosted about 200 brands including 15 newcomers. ""There was a massive arrival of new brands but with no true stories behind them,"" nuanced Johann Vitrey, director of Sesame, a retail company specialized in the Middle East. For him, the notion of niche should only be expressed in the plural form. ""There are different categories: perfume brands, conceptual brands around a story, heritage brands and finally experimental brands. Within these definitions, launching a niche brand should really involve some risk taking in order to offer never seen before or differentiating perfumes,"" he added. While in 2015, newcomers were often French and Italian, the 2016 edition confirmed the massive presence of brands from the Middle East (The Spirit of Dubai, The Gate, Amouroud, Hadara...) or operating in this market, indeed a big perfume buyer. ""Yet the arrival of this Oriental wave seems to be out of step,"" noted David Frossard, founder of Différentes Latitudes. ""Two or three years are necessary to properly develop a brand and unfortunately, within this time frame, the economic and political context has changed, the Middle East market has become less promising and consumers from this region are travelling less to Europe,"" he explained. A reference event for all international players in niche perfumery, Esxence 2016 perfectly reflects the flourishing creativity of this perfume sector with many facets but which is still questioning itself about its future."
Fragrance trends in Brazil: Toward a broader diversity,"The quest for new trends is what guides Brazilians' behavior in the fragrance scene. Brazil has been the world's largest fragrance market since 2010, according to data from Euromonitor, and it is characterized by the coexistence of different styles and microtrends. ""The speed that marks the current consumer society makes it challenging to predict trends,"" says Alessandra Tucci, fragrance expert and founder of Perfumaria Paralela, a company that specializes in innovation and strategy for the fragrance industry. According to Alessandra Tucci, Brazilians have a very particular relationship to perfumes compared to North Americans and Asians. ""Our culture perceives fragrances as a sign of personal care, beauty, enhanced self-esteem and even sensuality. While Asians are more reserved and perfume can be seen as invasive in some cases, in Brazil it is always welcome, as long as it is used with common sense."" Some trends become more popular than others depending on the consumer profile, she says. ""The trends in Brazil are aligned to Europe and the U.S., with a strong focus on fresh, floral aromas and scents enriched with fruit notes, as they are more casual and easy to please."" There is also a move towards gourmand fragrances, with sweetish, statement scents that consist primarily of edible notes such as vanilla, nougat, praline, meringue, coffee and chocolate. Tucci says they have been incorporated into perfumes over the last few years and have become a favorite among men and women of all generations. ""Vanilla scents have been completely integrated into male fragrances, as well as florals and fruits. This has contributed to bridge the gap between traditional gender-specific fragrances."" Alessandra says ingredients that were hardly ever found in this context, such as fragrant herbs with warm woods, bitter chocolate notes, and the contrast between mint and fig are now used in men's fragrances, which are equally popular among female customers. The generational aspect also has an influence on consumer perception. The striking and austere notes of the chypre family, for example, have been reinterpreted to appeal to the tastes of the modern consumer. Made from the combination of oak moss, florals, citrus fruits and patchouli, they have become more fruity, with less moss notes and a hint of gourmand chords. ""This has resulted in more sophisticated perfumes, with elegant, long-lasting and modern scents"", says Tucci. Tucci also points out a new way to wear signature scents - fragrance layering. Combining different fragrances is a common practice among connoisseurs and has been gaining popularity with consumers. ""Some companies use fragrance layering as their foundation, such as Jo Malone, which has recently opened its first store in Brazil. The brand encourages mixing and matching scents to create a truly unique scent."" Sophistication has been a challenge for Brazil, which in 2013 had only 7% its fragrance-spend going on premium fragrances, according to a study conducted by Swiss fragrance house Givaudan. Tucci also highlights the quick maturation of the Brazilian fragrance market, which has seen an increased demand and more discerning customers eager for novelty. However, she argues that it is necessary to facilitate access to unique products. ""In my point of view, a mature market requires a diverse distribution network and broad access to information. But we are on that path."""
MakeUp in Seoul to focus on trends and innovation,"With sales exceeding USD 7.3 billion (EUR 6.6 billion), Korea is the third largest beauty market in Asia and ranks 12th in the world. Moreover, by using on average 13.4 cosmetics daily, and this from their teens, South Korean women hold the world's record. The country is also the world's largest per capita skincare consumer. In the mean time, exports of Korean cosmetic products have reached USD 2.75 billion (EUR 2.5 billion) in 2015, a rise of +53.6% compared to the previous year. Korean beauty trends have been dominating the Western cosmetics sector for some time now, and the craze shows no signs of slowing. Korean beauty chain Aritaum now claims over 70 locations throughout North America, and L'Oréal Paris recently added its first cushion foundation to its repertoire, joining the likes of Lancôme and Dior in embracing the Korean phenomena. Korean e-sites such as SoKo Glam now bring the Asian nation's cult products to a global audience, with a constantly updated stock. US beauty brand Sabbatical Beauty is the latest to get on board, launching a Korean-inspired capsule collection for Spring 2016. Titled 'Breathe', the 10-piece collection offers products infused with skin-nourishing herbals inspired by Korean beauty. The success of Korean brands can be explained by the inventiveness of the suppliers in this sector. These suppliers et sub-contractors will meet up next week in the South-Korean capital on the occasion of the third edition of the MakeUp in Seoul tradeshow. This year, the show will focus on innovation staging an ""Innovation Tree"" that will highlight the 19 new innovative products selected by a committee of experts [1] among the 45 proposals submitted by 23 companies participating in the event. In alphabetical order, laureates are: Albéa, Aptar, Asadal Beauty Products, Bonne, Chromavis, FS Korea, Gotha Cosmetics, Intercos Korea, Red of View, S&P World, Strand Cosmetics, Yonwoo..., representing in total, 9 formulas, 8 packagings, 1 ""Full service"" and 1 make-up accessory. Concomitant to the trade show, a two-day conference programme will put a particular emphasis on inter-influences in terms of colour cosmetics between large countries such as China, Brazil, Japan and, of course, South Korea... How do they influence one another? What lessons can be learned from the trends, emerging in these countries?"
France: New record for perfume and cosmetics exports,"Despite the international slowdown in growth, the French cosmetics industry (perfumes, skincare, makeup, hair care, toiletries, etc.) is still developing worldwide: export sales of cosmetics companies operating in France rose again in 2015, with a 4.4% increase. The cosmetics sector's balance of trade – third positive segment of the French balance of trade, behind aeronautics and wine & spirits – has exceeded 9 billion euro for the first time. ""It is the image of French products associated with quality and know-how that help France remain the global leader in this sector,"" the FEBEA explains. The sector has also taken advantage of a highly favourable euro-dollar parity. Skincare products and perfumes are still the main drivers for French cosmetics exports, as these two categories represent 75.5% of the total French export sales, respectively 42.5% and 33%. If its weight does remain much lower, the makeup category proved very dynamic, with exports rising by 17% for lip makeup, 10% for eye makeup, and 12% for powders. The European Union remains by far the first Made in France perfume and cosmetics buyer in the world. In value, almost half of French exports in this sector (48.9%) is sold in European countries. On this market, the French industry kept gaining market shares, compared to its immediate neighbours, as its exports show a 5.8% rise, and its balance of trade with the European Union is also on the rise (+5.1%). Germany remains the first French perfume and cosmetics buyer, followed by the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy. Among the first five customers of the French industry, only the United States, ranked second, is not part the European Union. The relative dynamism of the American economy and the fact that the euro is weaker than the dollar have actually much benefitted the French cosmetics industry, whose sales to this country boomed by 15% in value, reaching 1.1 billion euros. Russia's economic difficulties and the collapse of its national currency had the reverse effect though, with a very significant drop of the balance of trade with this destination (-44%). In Asia, the situation is contrasted. Exports to China kept rising in 2015, with an 8% increase compared to 2014. But the slowdown is quite strong, as the rise had reached 16.5% in 2014, compared to 2013, and 17.5% in 2013, compared to 2012. As for sales to Hong Kong and Taiwan, they fell by 11.5% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to the previous year. Similarly, sales to South Korea and Japan declined by 8.2% and 6.8%, respectively. By contrast, French cosmetics imports from China, Japan, or South Korea increased a lot, even if the balance of trade with these countries remains much positive for France. Driven by the United Arab Emirates (+14%) and Saudi Arabia (+11%), the area of the Near East and Middle East showed a 12% growth in a year. Exports to the African continent rose by almost 3%, compared to 2014. Ultimately, Latin America took everyone by surprise. It returned to growth with a 3.7% increase for exports, for the whole 2015 year. As an example, despite the strong devaluation of the Brazilian currency and an economy in recession, French perfume and cosmetics exports to this country rose by 1.30%. Other countries in the area did even better, like Mexico (+12%) or Peru (+14.3%). ""The good results of the cosmetics sector can be explained by the diversity and quality of French production, which represent major assets for companies operating in France, as they can adapt and meet very diverse consumer demands and market conditions,"" concludes Patrick O'Quin, President of the FEBEA."
"The 2016 edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna welcomed about 250,000 visitors","""Cosmoprof is a trade show that is continuously growing: this year 250,000 visitors and 2,510 exhibitors (+ 5%) attended the show. Bologna lived extraordinary days: without presumption but with pride and satisfaction we can say that Cosmoprof is the largest Italian trade fair and the most important platform for the cosmetics industry, both in Italy and in the world, with editions in Las Vegas and Hong Kong,"" said Duccio Campagnoli, President of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. ""This year, we had to add 20,000 square meters of outdoor facilities."" Most of the show sectors recorded growth. The Green sector, gathering companies offering natural and organic cosmetic products, increased by 22,15%. The Hair and Furniture sectors grew up to 8.20%, while the Nail sector registered a 4% increase. Finally, the Extraordinary Gallery, the section that houses niche and high-end brands, has grown up to 39.09%. Eventually, Cosmopack, the section dedicated to the industrial supply chain (industrial equipment, packaging, contract manufacturers, sub-contractors, formulators, fillers) grew by 5.42% in 2016 and was attended by 21,900 professional visitors from the industry. The next edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna will take place on 16th-20th March 2017 (16th-19th March for Cosmopack and 17th-20th March 2017 for Cosmoprof) and will be the occasion to celebrate the show's 50th anniversary."
"Hybrid lacquers and innovative removal techniques boost sales of professional nail care products, finds Kline","The global professional nail care market is currently driven by two key areas of innovation - the products themselves and their removal techniques, explains Kline in just-published report: Professional Nail Care: Global Market Brief. In 2015, the market posted growth of almost 6%. The long-wear nail polish (also called hybrid or semin-permanent), which combines the benefits of gel and regular nail polish, appears as the biggest innovation since the introduction of gel-polish. The hybrid category posts a triple-digit increase in 2015, finds Kline's report. ""While this innovation is the key market driver, it is also leading to cannibalization of sales between product types, which causes several brands to suffer declines in sales for their nail polish product lines as loyal consumers shift to the use long-wear nail polishes,"" comments Agnieszka Saintemarie, the report's project manager. ""These products particularly target nail polish users, while gel users only use it for a shorter period of time, wanting to take a break from gels."" In parallel to the success of hybrid lacquers, innovation regarding removal methods is becoming increasingly important due to growing concerns from consumers over the use of acetone or fillers, which can damage one's nails. ""In response, brands extend their services by creating unique removal techniques, offering a wide variety of options from peel-off base coats to steamers, resulting in the removals experience witnessing most innovation in 2015,"" explains Kline. Steamers that warm up acetone-based removal solutions to create steam, which helps remove gels and acrylics, have been one area of innovation. Some of the products available in the market include Steam Off from The Painted Nail and Gel II's Steam Gel-Polish Removal System. Alessandro International creates its own nail clip. CND creates the Xpress5 Top Coat, which enables CND Shellac to come off in five minutes. A variety of the brands, such as Akzentz, Nubar, and Cuccio, have started offering foil wraps for the easy removal of soak-off gels and gel polishes. While booming in Western markets, hybrid nail polish and novel removal techniques are still in the early stages in the Asia-Pacific region, which is currently driven by nail art. For instance, in South Korea, filing continues to be the main removal method, and Bandi is the only local brand offering long-wear nail polishes."
South Korea's exports of cosmetic products continue to soar,"Korean cosmetic products are still doing it pretty good around the world. Actually, South Korea's beauty exports reached US$ 2.75 billion in 2015, an increase of 53.6 per cent over the previous year, according to statistics from the Korea International Trade Association (KITA). The country's cosmetics exports have enjoyed double-digit growth since 2010, surpassing the US$ 1 billion mark in 2013. This strong growth contrasts with Korea's overall exports that dropped by 0.2 per cent in 2015 due to the lack of global demand. Indeed, Korean cosmetic makers have been able to take advantage of the strong demand in the neighbouring Chinese market. Exports of South Korean cosmetics to China doubled in 2015, confirming the popularity of K-beauty in the country. Sales to China reached US$ 1.09 billion in 2015, accounting for 39.5 per cent of South Korea's exports of cosmetic products. ""The influence of Korean beauty brands is such, that the 'Seoulista' virus has stormed over all the Asian countries, especially China. This Korean beauty is truly staged,"" explain the organisers of the MakeUp in Seoul tradeshow, which will be held on 6-7 April 2016. Korean beauty brands now stand right behind French brands in China, but rank before Japanese (3rd) and US (4th) brands. Innisfree, the budget cosmetics brand owned by South Korea's beauty giant AmorePacific, is a good illustration of this success. It is now one of most popular Korean beauty brand in China. It has now expanded its number of stores in China to 100, since opening for the first time in 2012. After China, Hong Kong is the second destination of Korean cosmetics exports. In 2015, Korean cosmetics exports soared to US$ 663 million, a growth of 64.4 per cent compared to 2014. However, the downside of the K-beauty boom is that another business is booming in China: counterfeits of Korean brands. Beyond Chinese markets, Korean brands are also expanding in the rest of the world, primarily in the USA. In 2015, Korea's exports of cosmetic products reached US$ 663 million, up 56.1 per cent compared to last year. USA are now the 3rd destination for 'made in Korea' beauty products. Korean manufacturers are eager to quickly increase their global footprint by leveraging on their reputation of makers of quality and trendsetting products. The AmorePacific Group (Laneige, Etude House, Innisfree, Sulwhasoo, etc.) has recently launched in the Middle East, starting in Dubai, with the aim to rapidly grow in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran. The group also intends to launch some of its brands in Latin America. Similarly, Korean make up and skincare brand Toly Moly, which is already sold in Sephora's stores in the US will soon be sold in the beauty chain's stores in fifteen European countries. As far as Europe is concerned, while Korean cosmetics exports are still low they are growing quickly. In France alone, they rose by 140.3 per cent in 2015 to reach US$ 15 million."
"Iran: beauty, cosmetics, perfumes, and paradoxes","With a population of 80 million inhabitants, including 55% under 30, Iran is a growth-driving, dynamic market. The fact that international sanctions have been lifted and that the economic situation should therefore improve have made it even more attractive. But this country is not without its own paradoxes. For a thorough understanding of unknown Persia's trends and lifestyles, the study The New Faces Of Iran - Fashion, Beauty & Paradoxes first describes the historical, geographical, cultural, and social pillars that define the Persian civilization. As a tremendous cultural and historical cradle, the country that became an Islamic Republic after the 1979 Revolution, mainly defines itself according to its ancient origins. ""It is a Muslim country, but people consider themselves Persians and Iranians above all. It is essential to understand this subtlety,"" Nilufar Khalessi explains. Despite an embargo that lasted for decades, the major cities of Iran have been experiencing much progress, driven by the dynamics of a 2.0, highly-connected, Western-oriented young generation. However, the choices made by these young people show they will not let foreign countries dictate their consumption habits, as they actually prefer national goods. ""Young Iranians deliberately have not completely assimilated the Western culture, although they do know and master its codes, since they have integrated them. And we would make a mistake if we tried to force them into a mould,"" Nilufar Khalessi adds. As they are extremely educated – so is most of the population in large cities - Iranian women enjoy an important part in society. They are very present in institutions and play a crucial role, whether in the family or society. ""The status of women is different from what can be observed in many Arab countries. Even the way they wear their veils is more lax, as it does not completely frame their faces and allows for much femininity to be seen,"" Nilufar Khalessi explains. The study used portraits of women from Isfahan, Tehran, and Shiraz to shape the contours of a generation that has been playing with the paradox between their public lives, as they comply with the established Islamic laws, and their private lives, subverting these laws for more freedom, whether in terms of beauty or fashion. Women are deeply committed to this young generation's active and creative development, in all artistic fields. ""Iranian women hardly go out without makeup on, because the relationship with aesthetics is strongly developed,"" Nilufar Khalessi affirms. Therefore, it is essential for them to beautify their eyes, eyebrows, lips, and hair. ""In the city, the veil does not completely frame women's faces. It is a real distinguishing feature: half the hair is uncovered, so women work a lot on it, often dying it blonde, and they are not keen on naturalness"". Facial care focuses on ""zero defect"" choices to fight against pollution-related problems, acne, or oily skins. In addition, the study highlights the very strong relationship with plastic surgery, in particular rhinoplasty. ""They choose L'Oréal, Dior, Lancôme, and many other well-established brands for their daily consumption, although they also buy other products by interesting local brands to be studied,"" Nilufar Khalessi concludes."
France: Sales of prestige perfumery negatively impacted in 2015 by Paris attacks,"Despite a difficult environment for retail sales in France, the selective perfumery channel maintained a turnover of 2.9 billion euros in 2015. ""While in store sales of retailers' private brands continue to grow, sales of selective products are decreasing by no more than 0.9% in value over the year, according to The NPD Group, despite the impact of terrorist attacks in January and at the end of the year (-1.9% in December),"" said the French Federation of Selective Perfumery (FFPS). The decrease of prestige fragrance sales - fragrances account for almost two thirds of the French prestige market - at the end of the year slowed down the overall industry growth. Indeed, the makeup and skin care categories increased in 2015. According to the FFPS, the decline of perfume sales in 2015 (-1.6% in value) is explained largely by poor figures recorded in November and December, which are the most important months for this product category. The month of January 2015 was also particularly affected. However, sales of women's and men's fragrances did not react the same way in 2015. On the one hand, women's fragrances have collapsed with a decrease of 2.8%, in value. In this segment, only gift packs grew (+4 7%). On the other hand, sales of men's fragrances remained almost stable (-0.6%). In contrast, sales of high-end niche fragrances by independent brands or of the private collections of the main selective brands continue to grow strongly. However, their small market share - which is estimated between 2 and 5% - does not allow this segment to substantially impact the trend. Less subject to seasonal variations, sales of skin care products recorded their best progression (+0.6%) over the last two years. Similarly, and despite a difficult month of December (-1.1%), makeup products recorded their best performance since 2013, with an increase of 0.4% in value, boosted by lipsticks that grew by 8.5%. ""Selective perfumery retail chains maintained their turnover in 2015. Retailers have adapted to the changing market by offering consumers a multichannel purchasing experience, by maintaining accessible prices encouraging loyalty. The market was recovering before the November attacks that led to a reduction in visits to the shops during the year's last two months, which are the most important months of the year,"" said William G. Koeberlé, President of the FFPS."
US beauty consumers increasingly turn to technology during their shopping experience,"US consumers are increasingly becoming dependent on digital assistance in nearly all aspects of the beauty retailing experience. According to Mintel, two in five (39 percent) consumers are interested in using, or have used, a store-provided tablet to research beauty products available. What's more, one third (36 per cent) agree that they would be interested in using in-store tablets or their own mobile device to pay for beauty products. ""Smartphones and tablets are playing an increasingly pivotal role in the beauty retail experience. Brands should assume that their audience has a connected device at their fingertips at all times and should look to leverage behavioural research in order to better understand when and how consumers are using these devices,"" says Diana Smith, Senior Research Analyst, Retail & Apparel at Mintel. ""The beauty category is ripe for an explosion of technology-driven innovation. A great example of this is connected stores which allow consumers to shop how they choose while giving them unique ways to try out products on their own before buying, regardless of a salesperson's availability."" According to the market research firm, consumers are turning to technology as a cost-saving measure as well, with three in five (58 per cent) interested in mobile apps that provide beauty product offers to redeem in-store. Coupon redemption is popular among beauty retail shoppers as nearly half (47 per cent) have redeemed coupons using their smartphone or tablet when purchasing products in-store or online. Further, 54 per cent of beauty retail shoppers are interested in apps that allow them to compare prices. The beauty market's heaviest buyers, those who made 11 or more purchases in the 12 months ending October 2015, are the most likely to engage on social media with seven in 10 (69 per cent) saying they like to share their product experience on retailers' social media channels, double that of consumers overall (35 per cent). What's more, 71 per cent say social media posts encourage them to buy particular products. Mintel research reveals that the majority of beauty retail purchases are, in fact, planned with three in five (63 per cent) consumers buying items to replace/replenish products they regularly use. Planned experimentation with new beauty products is not uncommon as 30 per cent of consumers venture out with the intent of trying something new. However, spontaneity is also popular among beauty retail shoppers: half (52 per cent) are influenced to make a purchase that is most likely unplanned, with one in five (22 per cent) influenced by a sale or the opportunity to use a coupon. Another 14 per cent of beauty retail shoppers report unplanned purchases resulting from advertisements. ""The beauty category's heaviest purchasers not only turn to the internet and, more specifically social media, for inspiration, but they also are influential to others given their increased interest and knowledge of beauty items and brands. Brands should look to capitalize on these influential consumer advocates by giving them a voice and providing rewards for their endorsements. Taking into consideration the fact that many consumers plan their beauty purchases - whether to replace regularly used items or experiment with new ones - positive feedback from heavy users on social platforms could encourage potential buyers to move forward with a purchase,"" concludes Smith."
Beauty Success welcomes their first steps in Africa,"Premium Beauty News - Beauty Success is the first global perfume brand to settle in West Africa. What made you decide to focus on this region for developing worldwide? Stéphanie Chalard - We seized the opportunity we got when we met CFAO, the distribution leader in Africa: they were opening new shopping malls and were looking for beauty franchises with French brands and middle-range, affordable products. It appeared like the perfect union of two types of expertise, that of CFAO, with their deep knowledge of the region and logistics on the ground, and ours, since we are experts in selective perfumery and franchises. Premium Beauty News - What was your strategy to enter this market? Stéphanie Chalard - We relied on a very deep analysis of the competition and consumer expectations, but also of our partner brands. As for competition, there are a few small institutes, but products are mainly available other ways than via dedicated infrastructures. That is why the market is very exposed to counterfeiting. We are really the first global brand with which consumers can be sure of the products' origin. And this meets the expectations of the booming middle class: they seek affordable premium products and are mainly interested in makeup and perfume. Premium Beauty News - How did you adapt your offering? Stéphanie Chalard - These very strong expectations for masstige products encouraged us to highlight our private label, which is actually very successful. The segments the most represented are perfumery, makeup, and haircare, with a mix of French, international, and ethnic brands. Premium Beauty News - Can you already report on your results, even shortly after this opening? Stéphanie Chalard - The first results are very satisfactory and reassuring. The average buying basket amounted to over €60 last December. We first thought it was due to the impact of novelty and Christmas and New Year celebrations, but it kept rising in January. We have different types of customers, both expatriates and locals. And there is a new category of consumers now, with women that were not used to visiting perfume shops. The beauty salon also works very well, although there is only one treatment room for now. Premium Beauty News - What are your next plans? Stéphanie Chalard - Our partnership with CFAO will last 10 years, and we plan to open about twenty points of sale in a certain number of countries in West Africa. Our next project should be implemented at the end of the year. Premium Beauty News - What difficulties have you been facing? Stéphanie Chalard - Logistics are very complex, so CFAO's help and expertise is essential to us. Training and sales techniques are also tough to deal with. Premium Beauty News - What are Abidjanese women's favourite products? Stéphanie Chalard - Lancôme, Dior and Givenchy are very successful with their perfumes and makeup products, and so is our private label."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna: A 49th edition more global than ever,"With more than 2,500 exhibiting firms and 73% of them coming from outside Italy, the 49th edition of Cosmoprof promises to be more global than ever. Furthermore, the show will host 25 international National Collectives, with South Africa, Australia, India, Morocco and Indonesia among the newcomers. ""Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna goes from strength to strength and is becoming increasingly global. With the ground laid by a packed schedule of road shows introducing this world-leading format to the key international markets, each year Cosmoprof welcomes exhibitors from new countries, professional operators, researchers from the most experienced trend forecasting agencies and top buyers: a community which accompanies Cosmoprof not only to Bologna but also to the Las Vegas and Hong Kong editions,"" explains Duccio Campagnoli, President of BolognaFiere, the organiser of the show. ""This growing internationalisation is one of Cosmoprof's real strengths."" As far as visitors are concerned, the organisers expect the next edition will beat previous records, with a 19% increase in online pre-sales. Visitors from 150 nations are expected to attend the show. Last year the show welcomed about 248,000 visitors, including 79,000 from abroad. The organisers consider internationalisation as a vital ingredient of Cosmoprof, which is seen by cosmetics firms as a way to access both established and emerging players. The are therefore renewing the International Buyer Programme that will once again help set up B2B meetings between exhibiting companies and a selection of top international buyers. For the first time ever, the 49th edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna will also offer an exhibition area dedicated to domestic and international manufacturers and distributors of halal-certified products (which are ""suitable"" for Muslim consumers). Located inside the Natural Cosmetics pavilion, this new zone is part of the Halal Beauty Care & Spa project, developed in partnership with the Italian halal certification body WHAD (World Halal Development). ""With an annual growth rate of 12% worldwide (as high as 19% in GCC markets) and the number of potential consumers reaching one third of the world's population, halal cosmetics are a rapidly rising trend,"" explain the organisers of Cosmoprof. While halal cosmetics are most sought after by consumers in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, this trend also directly impacts international brands and manufacturers. Indeed, 80% of the cosmetic products sold in Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), for instance, are actually made in Europe, primarily Italy and France. Furthermore, as these products place particular emphasis on ""natural ingredients, the production process, fair trade and eco-sustainability, they are increasingly appreciated by non-Muslim consumers."" Among the exhibitors, Acumen International Trading will present Love Your Nails, a line of halal nail polishes, Cultivator Natural Products, which will present its line of hair dyes, Intercosmetica will showcase its numerous halal formulations, and Khadija Cosmetics, will introduce its halal makeup line. A total of fifteen companies will exhibit in this space."
Makeup and fragrances boost sales of prestige beauty products in the U.S.,"""The beauty industry has been growing at a rapid and consistent pace for the last few years, but what is happening below the surface, at the category level, is changing considerably,"" said Karen Grant, Global Beauty Industry Analyst, The NPD Group. ""For example, in 2015 we saw even more concretely how the roles of makeup and skincare are becoming intertwined. The immediate results of slimming, lifting, tone correcting, and radiance achieved by makeup face products is not only influencing consumers' relationship with makeup, but also with that of skincare."" The prestige market outpaced the U.S. mass [2] channel, where sales grew 2 per cent for total beauty in 2015, versus 2014, as per Nielsen. As in prestige the mass growth was driven by the makeup category, and both skincare and fragrance sales were down for this channel in 2015. ""Consumers are shopping for and using makeup differently, which is a factor in softer sales of skincare products,"" added Grant. ""Looking at some of the top performing brands, we're also seeing that consumers are increasingly drawn to emotional rather than functional appeal. This craving of a more sensory experience is having a positive influence on fragrance sales as well. Brands and manufacturers that win listen and find compelling ways to respond to the increasingly diverse crowd of consumers before them, who are being influenced and inspired by society in ever-changing ways."" The growth in prestige face makeup is accelerating, driven largely by concealer and other face products including primers and contour, highlighting, and sculpting kits - in line with the contouring and strobing trends which came to life in 2015. Eye brows continued to outperform the eye makeup segment, and lip colour saw the largest increases within the lip segment. For the first time, brown/nude lip colour shades surpassed pink or red as the leading colour. Within skincare, facial skincare growth slowed as age specialists and facial moisturizers experienced a drop in dollar sales, tying in with the blurring of lines between makeup and skincare. What is driving growth in skincare are smaller categories like masks, alternative formats such as oil, clay, and paper, as well as hair and sun products. Looking at fragrance, growth in juices outperformed the overall U.S. fragrance market in 2015, and home ancillaries such as candles have also performed well. ""Economic and generational factors are influencing how consumers shop for, view, and prioritize the beauty categories. The consumer base has changed demographically, socially, and functionally. This new base of consumers has more options than ever before, and they look for brands and products to work for them, satisfy their needs, connect with them on a more personal level, and embrace their values,"" said Grant."
"The complex marketing of ""probiotic"" cosmetics","The skin microbiota, this community of microorganisms that covers the human body, have multiple unexplored properties unexplored and a composition - so a genome - unique to each individual . Excessive hygiene or unsuitable care could weaken it. We can ""feed"" the skin microbiota using probiotics ( ""good"" live bacteria ) and prebiotics ( food for bacteria). If cosmetics companies shown interested for this for some time, there are many obstacles to face : as much in terms of wording as marketing. Indeed how to use living organisms in beauty creams, and ensure appropriate use. How to communicate on bacteria when the prevailing discourse pushes hygiene at its worst? AObiome has developed a product with living bacteria naturally present in our microbiome but which have disappeared due to an""over-developed"" hygiene. AO-mist can be stored for four weeks at room temperature or in refrigerator 1 additional month, and is applied as a last layer onto the skin, after application of the daily beauty routine. Shampoo, body and face cleanser does not contain live bacteria, but are without preservatives to not attack the skin microbiome. Another solution is to use ""de-activated"" bacteria. But can we still talk about probiotics (which theoretically are ""live"" bacteria)? That's why brands talk about ""probiotic tehcnology"". Aurelia Probiotic Skincare aims to help reduce inflammation to limit skin ageing. Glycoproteins from bifidobacterium, the probiotic used by the brand, helps repair, protect, monitor and support the skin cells by acting on the level of cytokines (inflammatory skin reactions responsible). All other ingredients used by the brand are natural and sourced responsibly and ethically or even organic. Aurelia Probiotic Skincare has a premium and scientific approach . According to Claire Vero, the founder, ""we have tried to educate the world of beauty, starting with journalists, bloggers and consumers. Probiotics are a new approach in cosmetics and we aim to have a clear and didactic approach."" And it seems to work since Aurelia Probiotic Skincare keeps being quoted in magazines ( Elle, Vogue , Grazia , Glamour , etc.) or receiving industry awards (35 since launch). ""Our brand is made known through the media but also through word -of-mouth because our consumers are very loyal. They have made the switch to our purely natural yet scientific approach and are seeing the results in their skin."" Since launching in 2013, Aurelia Probiotic Skincare became the fastest growing beauty brand at Liberty and already has its own ""corner"". The brand is present in France at Oh My Cream, and wants to expand in Europe (Italy, Spain and the Netherlands in particular). Another brand, Gallinée, will be launched in early March 2016. Its creator, Marie Drago is a pharmacist and wrote his thesis research on the use of probiotics in cosmetics. Gallinée aims at taking care of the microbiome with a triple complex prebiotic, probiotic and lactic acid. Objective: To regain a healthy skin by stimulating its basic functions, reforming the acid mantle of the skin by removing natural irritations and aggressions and stimulating the microbiome. The range La Culture will offer five products (Face Cream, Cleansing Foam, Mask & Scrub, Body Lotion and Hand Cream). The ambition is to come out with a full range including hair products to take care of the entire skin microbiota. ""The pH value of the skin is 5.5 on average, the idea is to find that balance with our complex pre-probiotics and lactic acid. The scalp is supposed to be an acid soil, and it is not anymore,"" says Marie Drago. The brand marketing tone is science-based and natural, and focused on well-being. Other brands use probiotics and claim it as his clinic with anti-redness range based on ""Lactobacillus helveticus"". Probiotics are still a sensitive issue . Brands and retailers are still cautious about it because it is not easy to hold pro-bacteria claims after attacking it for years. Some brands choose to direct their communications toward science, others towards natural. The consumers seek above all the results. On Aurelia Probiotic Skincare web site the most visited page are not ""scientific "" ones but clients' testimonies."
Body contouring procedures drive growth of the cosmetic surgery industry globally,"Globally, body-contouring procedures saw the biggest increase in popularity in 2015, increasing by 13.5 per cent. This category includes a wide range of procedures such as facelifts, tummy tucks, buttock augmentation and liposuction. This was followed by energy devices (such as the use of lasers), which jumped by 9.3 per cent, and cosmeceuticals. Breast implants increased the least, seeing a 3.9 percent growth worldwide. Experts predict cosmetic procedures to increase steadily on a global basis at an average rate of 8.9 per cent until 2020, at which point the market, which was worth $6.89 billion in 2015, will be worth $10.49 billion. The USA, which accounted for 45 per cent of the market last year, remains the biggest nation for cosmetic surgeries, with Europe claiming 24 per cent of the market and Latin America 9 per cent. The biggest change will be in Asia, which is expected to see its cosmetic surgery industry grow the most, at an average annual rate of 13.8 per cent between now and 2020. In contrast, Europe, which accounted for 25 per cent of the global market in 2014, will see its share diminished to 21 per cent over the next four years."
A first perfumed edition for Tranoï,"""There were regularly alternative fragrance brands participating in Tranoï in order to meet buyers from the concept and sophisticated fashion stores visiting the tradeshow,"" says Wouter Wiels, creator of Les Rives de la Beauté and director of Tranoï Parfums. The relocation of a part of the show in a larger venue enabled Tranoï to offer a larger space to fragrance brands. Tranoï Parfums aims to create an introduction between the buyers visiting the fashion trade show and a selection of contemporary creative fragrance brands. ""It seems obvious that many of the contemporary brands in high-end perfumery, as with the most exclusive stores in the world, only have to gain from finding new ways of connecting. Tranoï Parfums plans to enhance this opportunity and support the brands and buyers to maximize this potential and make it a sustainable reality,"" adds Wouter Wiels Gathering almost forty niche fragrance brands, the Tranoï Parfums area was located in the very centre of the newly added venue of Tranoï Homme & Preview, just in front of the show entrance. ""There is a real demand from the concept stores, from all these high-end outlets, which are visiting Tranoï and search for more exclusivity,"" explains David Frossard, forerunner of the niche fragrance business with his own multi-brand agency Différentes Latitudes. ""Owners of fashion boutiques have understood that niche fragrance brands can generate a real revenue, provided that shop-assistants are well trained,"" he continues. Given the recent profusion of alternative perfumery brands and the limited space available within the show, the organizers of Tranoï Parfums created a selection committee composed of Martine and Armand Hadida, Marie-Françoise Stoulz, Director of the beauty department of Le Bon Marché, Lionel Paillès, journalist, Philippe Di Méo, designer, David Frossard, and Wouter Wiels. ""Tranoï's regular visitors do not necessarily know much about perfumery, so it is important to guide them by narrowing our selection to truly beautiful brands"", explains Wouter Wiels. According to David Frossard, the aim of the selection was to support brands having a true identity. ""This is a category where we often find beautiful products, but lacking a vision and brand identity. As far as I'm concerned, I prefer brands with a story, with their own universe and a true artistic visibility, in short, brands that know how to make themselves desirable."" And to give substance to this speech, Philippe Di Méo, set designer for the project, created an artistic installation of sensory discovery - the ""Perfume Dressing Rooms"" – using the iconic raw materials of perfume that link fashion and fragrance. A second edition is already scheduled next June before the event crosses the Atlantic and settles in New York"
Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo get bigger and increasingly international,"""Cosme Tech Cosme Tokyo is now an Asian event, not only a Japanese event,"" says Hajime Suzuki, the show manager. ""As far as cosmetics are concerned, Japan is a very attractive market because of its size, but also because it is a real trendsetter in Asia."" Actually, the number of international exhibitors more than doubled compared to the previous edition. Numerous brands coming from other Asian countries, but also from Europe, Australia, the United States, Africa and the Middle East presented their products during the three-day exhibition. Among them, a high proportion of natural and organic cosmetic brands, a trend Premium Beauty News already pointed out at the previous edition. ""There's a strong demand in Asia for natural products, and while they still need to be educated, consumers are increasingly aware, about what does that mean in terms of quality and about the importance of certification,"" says Karen Kung of Naveen, a Taiwanese organic skincare brand certified by Soil Association. In the Cosme Tech part of the show, the section dedicated to packaging and ingredient suppliers, the number of international exhibitors was also on the rise while Asian operators remained, by far, the most numerous. ""Japanese are much more curious and much more interested in international innovation than before,"" explains Hajime Suzuki. Riding on this trend, the organizers say their aim is to double the size of the show by the next three years, and to gather a thousand exhibitors at the next edition in January 2017. ""We want our show to become the trendsetting centre for cosmetics in Asia,"" states Hajime Suzuki. To ensure its growth, the tradeshow relies on exhibitors and visitors from South Asia's dynamic markets - Thailand already had a large collective stand this year - but also on an increased participation of leading global cosmetics makers: Korea, Turkey, USA, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland. However, despite its attractiveness, the Japanese cosmetics market - as many others - remains a very difficult one, with specific codes and a high level of competition. ""There are a plenty product categories and very high quality requirements. As a consequence, ordered quantities are quite low,"" explains Tony Zhang, Sales & Marketing Director Asia at HCT. The organizers have invested heavily to facilitate business relations. ""We organised a briefing session for all international exhibitors on the eve of the opening on the particularities of the business in Japan,"" said Hajimi Suzuki. An online system to organise appointments before the show was also provided to exhibitors and visitors. ""It allowed us to contact agents and importers who interested us, and then to meet them at the show, it's very effective,"" explains Thierry Recouvrot from French brand Plantes & Parfums de Provence. The next edition of Cosme Cosme Tokyo Tech will be held from 23 to 25 January 2017."
BASF identifies 2017 beauty colour trends,"Following extensive market research, BASF's trend hunters have identified next year's lifestyle trends and carefully grouped together colours to reflect them. ""BASF's 2017 Color Trends consists of four distinct beauty profiles, each based on cultural drivers in the global marketplace,"" said Valérie Pian-Parison, Marketing Manager at the Personal Care business of BASF. ""We have been keeping a close eye on both regional and global developments as well as the latest fashion shows in order to help our customers create products and brand experiences that really resonate with consumers."" The Smart and Seamless colour collection appeals to people who rely on technology that integrates seamlessly into their everyday life, and long for beauty products just as smart. They prefer smooth lines, flawless finishes, and intuitive details. The powdery colour palette features neutral tones with lab greens, metallic hues and elegant whites, as well as nude and natural skin tones. In formulations, soft shapes, chalky consistencies and mousses contrast with a sublimely cool and marble-like feel. from a blue hue to a flash of violet. Evoking the lifestyle and legacy of Hollywood's iconic movie stars, Glam Now redefines beauty for the modern woman. Timeless elegance takes central stage in this collection, which showcases plush velvet plums, feminine pinks and nudes, dramatic reds, and midnight blues. A touch of modernity is added to classic colours, resulting in luxurious golds and rich coppers with a contemporary, metallic twist. The look is sophisticated and glamorous. The Alive colour trend catches the interest of the growing number of people who enjoy the vitality, diversity, and richness of nature. The collection is inspired by the succulence of fruit, the vibrant colours of nature in full bloom, the saturated greens of trees after summer rain, and the vastness and depth of the oceans and the sky. Its mood is colourful yet considered, its look playful yet discreet, and its feel is one of both dewy freshness and rich sensations. Mix and match, radical contrasts, pastel shades, and funky neon colours, Gen You targets the next generation of young girls who know no limits when it comes to creativity and expressing themselves. With the coverage of lipstick and the shine of gloss, vivid Pop of Pink Lip Lacquer is just one example of this trend's eccentric look."
Male grooming trend boosts global hair care sales,"Market research by Technavio has predicted that the global hair care market will grow at an annual rate of 3 per cent (Compound Annual Growth Rate) between now and 2019 to exceed USD 91 billion. [1] The trend for male grooming and the growing number of fashion-conscious consumers were cited as the principal reasons behind the growth, with the aging populations of developed nations such as the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, China, and Japan also boosting the sales of hair products. The Americas were the largest revenue contributor during 2014 with a market share of around 37 per cent. The US is the largest market in this region with a revenue share of around 15 per cent. Its aging population contributed to the growth of this region as a result of the early adoption of hair colours and dyes. Shampoos accounted for 34 per cent of the market share during 2014, the research found, and is expected to reach a market value of around USD 28 billion by 2019. Technavio predicts that emerging markets - Brazil, China and India - will be the fastest-growing regions in the shampoo segment. As far as shaving lotions and creams are concerned, the growth of the global market is even more impressive as Technavio predicts sales to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of around 7 per cent between 2016 and 2019 to surpass USD 8 billion by 2020. [2] The fact that men are becoming more fashion conscious and increasing willing to try new and innovative products is key growth factor for the market. Europe dominates the global market for shaving lotions and creams, with a market share of around 38 per cent. And, with 62 per cent of the overall market share, pre-shave products (shaving lotions, creams, gels and soaps) represent the main segment by product categories. Male grooming has undergone something of a revival across the beauty industry over the last few years, with hair care and skincare the main focus. Over the course of 2015, several high-profile products were unveiled for men, including Clinique's Sonic System Deep Cleansing Brush and brewery Carlsberg's shampoo, conditioner and body lotion trio."
The Korean beauty trends set to dominate in 2016,"Cushion foundation, which comprises a spongy formula that is applied to the face with a pillow to provide easy and flawless coverage, isn't going anywhere for now. The added bonus of integrated SPF protection, wrinkle prevention and antibacterial properties mean that this budding trend is sure to take over next year. French beauty brand Lancôme is leading the way and has carried its successful Miracle Cushion formula over to its Spring 2016 collection, playing on the Korean penchant for cult packaging by adding some sweet pastel cover art to its compact. Contouring has undergone many a transformation since first appearing on our radar some years ago. 2015 saw the birth of 'clown contouring' and 'strobing', but 2016 will be all about doing it the Korean way. The ideal face shape for many Korean women is a soft oval with a dainty chin, known as the 'V-line', and the look can be achieved by highlighting the center of the face, using concealer under the eyes and shimmery tints down the cupid's brow, the bridge of the nose and the chin, before shading the perimeter of the face to make it appear smaller. Check out beauty vlogger Luvableviet's tutorial for more information. As beauty fans become aware of increasingly limited water resources, many brands are experimenting with alternatives. Water-free skin care lines first came to our attention thanks to Korean brand Whamisa, whose collection relies on essential oils and plant extracts to hydrate the skin. Market research group Mintel recently predicted that water-free cosmetics will explode over the next decade, so watch this space."
Five wacky beauty trends that went viral in 2015,"""Bubble nails"" or ""hump nails"" had already been around for a while, but they had an online revival over the summer. The look involves sculpting acrylic gel onto the nail to create a dome shape which is then filed down to create a short, square and very arched shape, and it divided the opinion of nail lovers everywhere. This led swiftly to the trend for ""aquarium nails"" - a painstakingly time-consuming concept whereby two false nails are filled with oil and glitter to create a 'snow globe' effect for the fingers. The trend for Brony hair came from an unexpected place - 1980s TV show ""My Little Pony"". Led by celebrities including Katy Perry, Kelly Osborne and Georgia May Jagger, the look, which involves dyeing the hair the pastel and candy-coloured hues of the famous toy ponies, hit Instagram during the summer. Brony hair could be as simple as taking on a mint or violet all-over colour, or could be mixed up by using several different shades at the same time. Although the words ""clown contouring"" might sound like a joke, it isa pretty effective makeup technique. Beauty blogger BellaDeLune kickstarted the trend when she posted a video to YouTube showing how an extreme-looking theatrical clown base of makeup could be blended into a subtly contoured look. Beauty lovers everywhere pounced on the idea and women all over the world are now testing it out and showing off the results on Instagram. When supermodel Kendall Jenner lay down on a hotel carpet and arranged her hair into heart shapes, she probably didn't realize that her photo, which became the most liked picture on Instagram, would set off a craze for heart halos. But the cute snap struck a chord with hair and beauty lovers everywhere and before long, sentimental Instagrammers were delicately arranging their tendrils into romantic compositions and #hearthair was trending. The springtime trend for technicolor underarms was brought into the spotlight by pop singer Miley Cyrus, who posted a picture to her Instagram account showing her wearing a white crop top accessorized with some daring bright pink body fuzz. This led to a flurry of publicity and lots of beauty tutorials about how to set about jazzing up your pits, with popular colours including blues, pinks and purples."
Multi-masking drives growth in prestige skincare,"The Instagram and social media craze for multi-masking - the fact to use multiple masks simultaneously on different zones of the face - is stimulating a huge growth in the face mask market. While skincare masks account for just 1.6% of the total women's skincare market in the UK, the category reported double-digit growth in the YTD October 2015 where it increased by 22.8% vs. the same period last year to reach a total value of 6 million pounds (8.22 million euros), according to The NPD Group. Multi-masking mania - The mask market has witnessed steady growth over the past three years which accelerated in 2015 due to the popularity of multi-masking. In the UK, the market has increased from £3,890,385 in YTD 2012 to £5,977,414 in YTD October 2015. According to The NPD Group, growth has come from new launches and an increase in unit sales which rose to 187k unit sales in the YTD October 2015, rising 22.3% on the same period last year. ""Masks have been growing in popularity over the last three years, but the Instagram craze for multi-masking stimulated huge growth in the market. Customers began experimenting with two or three masks at one time and this trend really took hold in the UK. Emerging early in 2015, it has become the 'must-try' skincare trend of the year, it was pioneered by beauty bloggers and Instagram influencers who demonstrated the trend, sharing their pictures online. This frenzy of online activity saw consumers spending more on masks so they can experiment with this innovative method of treating the skin at home,"" explains June Jensen, Director U.K. Beauty for The NPD Group. According to The NPD Group, skincare remains a vital sector within the prestige beauty market. The total value of women's skincare market represents about 24% of the total British prestige beauty market. Specialist products like masks and cleansers are key to sustain the growth of the market. ""The recent growth in the mask market, fuelled by the trend for multi-masking is important in a number of ways. Firstly it's boosting the prestige skincare market by increasing sales, whilst ensuring that customers are exploring new products and experimenting with new lines in different ways. It also demonstrates the role that beauty bloggers and Instagram influencers have on the sales of beauty products,"" concludes Jensen."
"The ""MakeUp in"" concept is expanding across the Atlantic","Premium Beauty News - Success was the one expected at MakeUp in Sao Paulo! Sandra Maguarian - Yes another successful event! And you will agree that the task was not an easy one considering the current situation in Brazil. With a deflating economy and a deleterious political climate, MakeUp in Sao Paulo welcomed in two days more than 1,200 visitors! And all the exhibitors were delighted, because in spite of the situation, Brazilian and South American women in general use more beauty products. This market is holding up well and is even more resilient than expected given the general crisis in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - As for the United States, 2016 is shaping up as a very busy year in terms of Beauty BtoB events, with the launch of two new tradeshows. What do you think of what some call this ""overflow"" of trade shows? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Sandra and I are not really adepts of waffling. All these competitors do not deliver, in our view, a new concept in New York. With an interval of four months between them, the same year, what difference do you see between PCD and Luxe Pack New York in terms of positioning? In a one-month interval, what difference do you see between Cosmoprof/Cosmopack in New York and Cosmoprof/Cosmopack Las Vegas? Anyway, we have never compared ourselves to others. We really have very few exhibitors in common who made the distinction between both a long time ago, and, above all, very few visitors in common... Our core target remains Marketing and R&D teams. Premium Beauty News - Regarding MakeUp in New York, you chose another venue. Brooklyn is quite challenging! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Yes and it's a winning challenge! Getting to Grand Prospect Hall is very easy. Probably easier than to get to other places in East of South Manhattan. We made the experiment several times. There is a direct subway line that connects in 35 minutes Upper Manhattan to Prospect Avenue station, which is a few steps away (150 meters) from the venue we chose. Grand Prospect Hall is a beautiful, warm and friendly place with a garden and 250 free parking spaces. In addition, we will organize free shuttles, every half hour, from Central Park and Penn Station (for visitors coming from New Jersey). By telling the taxi driver to drive along the East River or Hudson River, it takes only 35 minutes with no traffic jams or traffic lights, to get to Grand Prospect Hall from downtown Manhattan. This is probably the reason why a lot of people working in marketing and development teams of major brands located in Manhattan, live in Brooklyn! And it is much easier to go from Kennedy Airport (where a lot of our visitors land!) to Brooklyn. We have already sold more than 70% of the show floor dedicated to exhibitors. All our loyal exhibitors are following us! And some ""key"" visitors even confirm: ""Go Brooklyn!"" Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Action in Los Angeles? Yet another challenge to take up! Sandra Maguarian - It's great and original! Everyone is so exited! Registrations for Conferences and Workshops are doing very well. The twenty five exclusive stand locations planned for a few number of suppliers were distributed in only ten days! Just have a look at the list of speakers taking part to the various round tables to convince yourself that we are supported by the biggest brands in the region. Chanel Parfums et Beauté also wanted to partner. Premium Beauty News - Too many shows spoil the shows! What is your opinion? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Competition is very healthy when it takes place in a fair manner. It makes things move in the right direction. But ultimately, it is up to exhibitors and visitors to make their choice. They are the final arbiter. We visit our exhibitors often and we listen to our visitors. They know it. And our unique positioning attracts both of them."
The 2016 edition of Cosme Tech & Cosme Tokyo is set to break new records,"Cosme Tokyo, dedicated to finished products, and Cosme Tech, dedicated to the suppliers of cosmetic brands, which will open their doors on 20-22 January 2016 in Tokyo, are continuing their expansion to become ""the largest comprehensive cosmetics exhibition"" in Japan,"" according to the organisers. Cosme Tech & Cosme Tokyo is expected to gather 700 exhibitors from 50 countries, a growth by 30 per cent compared to the 2014 edition [1]. ""One of the reasons of the powerful growth is an increasing number of international exhibitors, especially at Cosme Tokyo 2016. International Area is doubling its scale, gathering more exhibitors not only from Asia, Europe and America but also from Middle East and Africa,"" said the organisers. Of course, another attraction of the event is the Japanese market itself. Indeed, with consumers constantly striving for perfection and manufacturers and brands constantly reinventing and renewing their portfolio of skincare and make-up products, Japan and Korea have become key references for cosmetics brands in Europe and North America. Cosme Tokyo, the section dedicated to finished products, gathers a remarkable lineup of Japanese cosmetic brands, most of which are difficult to find at any other exhibitions in the world, in particular those belonging to small and medium size companies. Izavell Co., for instance, will showcase a whitening cream using a sake-derived ingredient sourced from a long-established brewery in Kyoto. For its part, C-Tec Co. will launch a water, alcohol and perfume-free serum based on ascorbic acid and a fermented rice extract. The surprising long fibre mascara by D-Up Corp. is another example, the more mascara is applied the longer eyelashes are, and it can be removed easily with fingertips and warm water. The next edition of Cosmo Tech & Cosme Cosme Tokyo should also confirm the dynamism of the natural and organic cosmetics segment in Japan. While more and more Japanese brands, such as Tree Of Life, Jujubody or Raco Ginza, offer these products, this area is still dominated by international brands and suppliers."
Four beauty trends set to impact global markets by 2025,"In a future where the line between human and technological device blurs, water becomes a protected resource, energy concerns ring true and natural ingredients take centre stage, beauty brands must innovate to stay relevant. Augmented human The line between human and technological device is blurring as smart technology puts people in greater control of their individual health and beauty needs. ""As consumers become increasingly familiar with using technology to track their health and well-being, they are looking for beauty brands to offer products and devices that boast similar functionality. New product development in augmented reality is providing the next step in virtual mirrors and real-time visualisation of the effects of beauty products on the skin and hair,"" said Vivienne Rudd, Director of Insight, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. Water: the new luxury Water is set to become a precious commodity as consumption outstrips supply. According to Mintel, the more consumers become aware of this, the more beauty brands will need to change how they manufacture and formulate products to limit their dependence on water. In this area, as for many other environmental issues, consumers are changing their habits and expect companies to do the same. Already, we are seeing the rise of water-saving beauty solutions such as wipes, dry shampoos, nonrinse body washes, and alternative toothpaste formats. But the next generation of products will work without any water at all. Power play Consumers are facing an energy crisis as the pace of modern life catches up with them. Aware of consumers' need to make long-term lifestyle changes to address falling energy levels, beauty brands are delivering products that put energy claims at the forefront of their message. This may include partnerships with producers of food and beverages. Gastronomia The saying goes, 'it's what's on the inside that counts'. Interest in natural ingredients is on the rise as more people dare to push up their sleeves and get involved in the process of creating beauty products. ""Traditional beauty and personal care remedies are moving into the mainstream as more and more consumers start to 'cook up' their own versions. Brands will need to shift their focus to highlight artisanal processes while also making it easier for consumers to make products at home. Looking at the decade ahead, we'll see brands borrow inspiration from the meal kits developed by food companies, propelling the subscription beauty box model to the next level,"" Vivienne concluded."
United Kingdom: A dynamic cosmetic market torn between promotions and innovations,"The UK market is depicted as dynamic and creative. Its distribution structure is quite different from the rest of Europe. With the dominance of Boots, which holds more than 2,500 drugstores, the competition on price is fierce with a market boosted by promotions. However, ""there are always opportunities to be seized. Consumers are curious and like novelties,"" explains Karine Tiano, Agent for cosmetic brands in the UK. ""The Anglo-Saxon culture, prompt to change, always open up an opportunity for a new brand. The retailers indeed play on novelty, on pionnering new products to bring in less famous brands."" Beyond drugstores (Boots, Superdrug), there are of course the department stores, specialty stores, many concept stores and independent stores, e-shopping sites and teleshopping. Fashion retailers are also taking a growing space in the market by combining cosmetics with the outfits and stimulating impulse buying. TopShop launched its cosmetic brand in 2010, including more than 69 shades of nail polish in 2011. Today the brand has partnered with BeautyMart, which created a real beauty shop in its flagship store at Oxford Circus. Launched in 2012 BeautyMart is present in store and online with an exclusive selection of iconic brands. ""The concept stores like The GoodHood store, BlueBird, Alex Eagle, or The Conran Shop, are also getting into beauty, to offer these products which are part of our lifestyle,"" says Karine Tiano. ""But for a brand, it is best to be among specialists and classic distribution like Space NK or Selfridges, or online with Net-a-Porter, feelunique, lookfantastic or CultBeauty"". Indeed, the English are the first online buyers in Europe. This distribution channel should not be overlooked. Another important distribution channel is teleshopping. The QVC channel, which is present in the UK for over 20 years, is the market leader. Consumers love new products , so they are not very faithful, and the price is the first factor in the purchase decision. Kiko has managed its presence in the UK with a price level in line with the market and well-chosen locations. The masstige seems however little appeal to British consumers, as demonstrated by the failure of Sephora few years ago. Consumers either buy in department stores or with specialists for luxury brands or from Boots or Superdrug for mass products."
More than 1/3 of Chinese online shoppers now buying cross-border,"On behalf of PayPal, Ipsos interviewed in 29 countries [1] a representative quota sample of adults (aged 18 or over) who own and/or use an internet enabled device. The research [2] investigated the online and cross-border shopping habits of consumers. The report confirms that China's consumer class is massively entering the global online ecommerce market. About 35 percent of Chinese online shoppers claim to have shopped cross-border in 2015, vs. 26 percent in 2014, while China's overall online shopping population saw modest growth (81 percent of online adults report having shopped online in the last 12 months in 2015, vs. 80 percent in 2014). A full 25 percent of online shoppers said they from US-based websites in the last 12 months. The next most popular countries are China (19 percent of online shoppers have purchased from Chinese sites) and the UK (14 percent). However, American shoppers infrequently shop beyond their own borders. While among all respondents surveyed around the world, 50 percent of online shoppers report making purchases from a website in another country in the last 12 months, only 22 percent of American online shoppers have done so. Of the 29 countries surveyed only Japan has a lower volume of cross-border shoppers, at 12 percent. On the contrary, Ireland, Austria and Israel are the most active cross-border shoppers with 86 percent, 85 percent and 79 percent respectively of online shoppers having made a cross-border purchase in the past 12 months. Cost is a consideration that both motivates and deters global purchases in 2015. Nearly three quarters (73 percent) of all cross-border shoppers surveyed cite better prices as the reason to make purchases cross-border rather than domestically, followed by notions of access to items not available in their own country (selected by 67 percent of cross-border shoppers) and discovering new and interesting products (58 percent). Shipping cost is of paramount importance to cross-border shoppers. Almost half (47 percent) of online shoppers say that delivery costs deter them from making international purchases (or making them more often). At the same time half of all online shoppers say that free shipping would make them more likely to buy from a website in another country. Shipping cost is the top reason for abandoning an online purchase from a website in another country, cited by 43 percent of online shoppers who have abandoned a cross-border purchase. In most regions, clothing and apparel is the most popular category for cross-border purchases. Travel & transportation, and Consumer Electronics, as well as Entertainment & Education usually rank 2nd or 3rd. Asia-Pacific is the region that stands out for its high interest in cosmetics and beauty products that are purchased across the borders by placing this category in second place. Source: PayPal"
"Young generations are recalibrating fragrance consumption, finds Symrise","Digital natives include Millennials (Generation Y, 19-36 year olds) and Generation Z (kids under 18 years old), they have grown up with the internet, social media and smart devices. According to several studies, their socializing, education, information gleaning and shopping behaviour differ considerably from that of earlier generations. In order to better understand their relationship with fragrances, Symrise initiated a primary consumer research on digital natives in four US cities - Atlanta, Los Angeles, Freehold NJ and Yorktown NY. The consumers were introduced to several visualized lifestyle concepts, preferences of the concepts and olfactive associations were determined. The results of this study led to the creation of five future trend concepts, with olfactive pairings, thus helping Symrise and its customers to understand and successfully address this generation. ""Leading this important initiative was exciting. We explored the young consumers' preferences across a spectrum of categories. They are a fragrance-savvy, fun, yet responsible generation, interacting with each other in ways, much different from the other generations. We are excited to share the process, findings and fragrances from this platform with our clients,"" says Doreen Bucher, Vice President, Marketing, Fine Fragrance & Specialty Bath, North America. ""Thanks to technology, young consumers are recalibrating various dimensions of fragrance consumption – purchase behaviour, moments of use, fragrance preferences and commitment to sustainability. Symrise strives to continually understand the consumption behaviour of this important demographic segment,"" concludes Usha Vijay, Vice President, Marketing, Symrise, North America."
The intimacy of beauty routines around the world unveiled,"A study conducted by RealityMine compares the settings in which personal grooming sessions take place in different international locations. The market research firm used eDiary data of 4,054 panellists from the US, Australia, France, Mexico and Russia. Globally, people are most likely to engage in personal care routines at 7AM and 9:30PM (Figure 1). However, in France and Australia the morning peak is a bit later, at 8AM. Each country also has smaller peaks during the day. Interestingly, in Mexico, the amount of people grooming stays relatively high throughout the day. During the same half hour as personal grooming, relaxing, having a meal and doing household chores are fairly common in every country. Relaxing is specifically popular during the evening routines, while having a meal – in this case breakfast – is common during the morning. The French are also likely to engage in hobbies (32%), and in the afternoon, the link between hobbies and personal grooming is specifically strong. Meanwhile, in Russia, drinking is the most common activity, as well as doing household chores, during the same half hour as beauty sessions. People worldwide are most likely to be on their own (80%) during their daily beauty routines. Although Russians are more likely to be with their partner (75%), children (64%) or pets (40%), than on their own. The company of a partner and/or child is not uncommon among other countries either, but it's clearly less significant than it is in Russia. Looking at other countries, Mexicans are distinctly more likely to be in company of siblings or other family (28%) - this may be due to the family-oriented culture where gathering for breakfast and in the evening for dinner is common. According to RealityMine, mainly positive or neutral emotions are experienced while people of all nations are grooming. However, tiredness is also widely reported, especially during the evening routines (37%). Nearly half of Australians reported feeling tired while they were grooming, however, they also reported happiness (63%) more than other countries. Interestingly, Mexicans feel distinctly more confident (42%) than the panellists from other countries. ""When comparing the data behind the half hour before a personal grooming session and the half hour when grooming actually happens, we can find an increase in positive emotions such as happiness and confidence in every country when beauty session takes place. Although evening beauty routines are often carried out when panellists report feeling tired,"" highlights RealityMine. In the same half hour as personal grooming, TV (45%) and mobile (44%) are the most consumed media channels. Australians and French panellists are the least likely to consume digital media, while printed media is slightly more common among them than other countries. While only 26% of French panellist used mobile during their personal care sessions, the usage among Mexicans was twice as high (53%). After TV, mobile and computer, radio is the next most popular media channel, with 21% tuning in during personal beauty sessions. Morning is the time of day when people around the world are most likely to tune in to radio while getting ready for the day."
"Mascara: A successful, slow evolution in Brazil","In Brazil, 32% of women regularly wear makeup, and mascara is an essential: with 38%, it dominates the eye segment (source: ABHIPEC). Albéa has been working on it with local and international brands present on the Brazilian market: they have developed a specific approach combining the formula, the packaging, and the applicator. And to best meet local expectations, the group felt the need to learn about these consumers' profiles, their purchase and use habits, and the makeup effect they wish to obtain. ""Thanks to our Albéa Tips Studio platform, which invents, develops, and produces all types of makeup applicators, every year, the Albéa Group designs about twenty applicators on the global scale. They can be fiber or plastic mascara brushes, brushes for the eyebrows, lipgloss or eyeliner applicators, etc. This study will help us quickly develop innovations specifically adapted to the Brazilian market"", Anne Rutigliano and Pauline Uhlen explain. In Brazil, the mascara offering is still quite limited, as can be seen with the number of brands, the number of references per brand, and the range of brushes or formulas. Brazilian women are more faithful to their brands than European women. However, they do declare they are interested in easy-to-use innovations designed for an efficient makeup result. The study made it possible to watch videos of 50 women and analyze their gestures and the application. Volume and length are their main expectations. Although they are used to the traditional shape of fiber brushes, which currently dominate the market, the women surveyed state they would actually welcome plastic brushes for their differentiating effect. The specificities related to the hot and humid climate, in particular the wide use of waterproof formulas, must also be taken into account to develop adapted packaging. Another specificity of the Brazilian market is that it has been traditionally supplied by direct-selling networks. As a consequence, word-of-mouth and tips on social networks are key factors to advise, reassure consumers, and make them purchase a product. Therefore, efficacy is essential, as it helps brands develop both a customer base and their loyalty. ""The first mascara solutions adapted to the Brazilian market will be showcased at the next FCE show in May 2016"", Anne Rutigliano and Pauline Uhlen announce."
Tradeshows: Smaller and more targeted events appeal to the perfume and cosmetics industry,"Putting an end, after 13 years, to the Beyond Beauty Paris tradeshow, Informa has decided to split it into two different events: the first one, Alternative Fragrance & Beauty, will be dedicated to emerging cosmetics and perfume brands and will take place on 16-18 June 2016 at the Carreau du Temple in central Paris, the second one, Beauty Factory, will be dedicated to suppliers, and will open its doors on September 13th to 14th 2016 at Palais des Congrès Paris. ""Much more than just a fair, Alternative Fragrance & Beauty will break the rules of traditional events and will host around a hundred participants carefully selected in an unusual and unique setting that was designed by the agency Centdegrés,"" claim the organisers. The first two days of Alternative Fragrance & Beauty will be dedicated to business meetings and to exchanges between brands, distributers, and international buyers (department stores, e-shop, concept stores, selective distribution and assisted sales, independent perfumeries, niche perfumeries, pharmacies, health and beauty stores, drugstores, alternative networks, travel retail, spas, hotel groups, boutique hotels), looking for something unusual. The last day will be open to the public: the exhibiting brands will be able to sell their products on site and to test their potential, but, more than anything, they will have the opportunity to establish a direct link with their customers and to forge an intimacy with the brand. Similarly, Tranoï, the event that has been revealing young fashion designers for 15 years, is seizing the opportunity of its move to a larger venue at the Cité de la Mode et du Design, in the East of Paris, to complete its offering with an area dedicated to perfumery and lifestyle, thus meeting buyers' expectations. ""The demand comes from the show's customers, stores, and concept stores, who have been asking for more perfumes in their shops,"" explains David Frossard, founder of Différentes Latitudes and partner of the project. About 40 brands selected by a committee composed of Martine and Armand Hadida, Marie-Françoise Stoulz, Director of the beauty department of Le Bon Marché, Lionel Paillès, journalist, Philippe Di Méo, designer, David Frossard, and Wouter Wiels, creator of the event Les Rives de la Beauté, are expected to take seats on 23-25 January 2016 in a central area designed and set up by Philippe Di Méo. It still remains - before January - to convince the brands that will need to meet the requirements of our selection. ""Tranoï's visitors do not necessarily know much about perfumery, so it is important to guide them by narrowing our selection to truly beautiful brands"", adds Wouter Wiels. ""The transversality of the two worlds, the good image of Tranoï, and the experience of the Hadida family, who also own the L'Éclaireur concept store, represent a good starting point,"" he concludes. Actually, these launches confirm the success of smaller fairs, less expensive for exhibitors, more practical and easier to access for visitors. As far as the supply-side is concerned, tradeshows such as MakeUp in Paris, then declined in New York, Seoul and Sao Paulo, or such as PCD, for packaging, and Cosmetagora, for cosmetic ingredients, have pioneered the model. The launch of Beauty Factory in 2016 and the launch of Cosmetic 360, this year, confirm this deep trend. Regarding finished products, the most convincing models were the Exscence and Pitti Fragranze events, both located in Italy and dedicated to rare perfumery, or Elements in New York, which recently partnered with Capsule."
Lipsticks and face make-up boost the prestige cosmetics market in France,"Being key elements for a successful ""photo ready"" looks, lipsticks and face make-up products are the two main drivers for the growth of makeup sales in France. Sales of lipsticks over January to August 2015 grew by 11% in the selective channel. Annual lipstick sales represent a total of 70 million euros and the segment is driven by innovation. Actually, the launches of the last twelve months (Chanel Rouge Coco Baume Rouge Dior, Lancôme in Love Shine Love, for example) account for 18% of all sales, up by 33% compared to 2014. However, existing lines also performed very well with a growth of +7%. The two lipsticks to the most that topped the sales from January to August 2015 are Rouge Coco Chanel (shade 444 Gabrielle) and Rouge Dior (shade 999 Rouge Ara). ""While 2014 was marked by the success of gloss, lipsticks are making a comeback in 2015 with products combining colour and treatment, providing anti-aging, soothing or colour fixative effects. Classic shades remain demanded,"" highlights Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at NPD Group. With an increase of 2% from January to August 2015, foundations and other face make-up products are the second key drivers of the prestige beauty growth in France. Two segments are boosting the sales complexion products: foundations, which represent a market of almost 102 million euros per year, recorded a growth of 4%, while, concealers, illuminators and contouring, grew by 5% compared to 2014, to reach more than 11 million euros per year. According to NPD, the selfie craze and the importance of images on social networks greatly impact makeup application methods as well as product choices. Highlighters / illuminators, and other products face make-up products are experiencing a revival, thanks to the popularity of application techniques such as contouring or strobing (maily based on the use of illuminators) that promise a flawless complexion, that are advocated by beauty vloggers and other online tutorials. Similarly, the claims ""HD Photo"" or ""Studio"" are more and more common for complexion products. ""What is interesting in the current narcissistic trend is that it allows the prestige beauty market to recover through the promise of a professional-class makeup for everyone. Conventional makeup products are thus being revisited for a perfectly photogenic application and final result,"" concludes Matilda Lion."
Alternative perfumery: where are we up to in France?,"Premium Beauty News - Contrary to other European countries like Italy, Germany, or England, is alternative perfumery experiencing difficulties finding its own place in France? How are things going to evolve? David Frossard - Fifteen years ago, only few fragrance lovers were interested in this type of perfumes. Today, the alternative perfumery concept has been integrated. It has become accessible, and the sector has developed its customer base, even if France is less open – historically and culturally – to pioneers in this field. So yes, the future can be promising, provided the concept is clearly defined and structural issues are settled. Johann Vitrey - Its future is controlled. As the cradle of perfumery and of the major selective brands, which belong to groups that also own distribution networks, France does not leave much room for artistic and niche perfumery: by definition, it is the property of small houses and – often independent – artists. It is tricky to find one's own place in a saturated country. François Hénin - Alternative perfumery has reached an interesting step, a phase of maturity, so it will need to express itself differently. The concept is actually getting a bit outdated, but some brands are thinking about further asserting their identity through the packaging or communication. The future will mostly be secured by retail and its development: this is the great revolution expected to make up for the lack of distribution of rare perfumes in our country. Premium Beauty News - How can this distribution be ""revolutionized""? François Hénin - Revolution might be triggered by the main operators, because it needs people willing to invest in the long term. And it is also, or actually mostly about remapping perfume shops in France. Jovoy, Ombres Portées, Sens Unique… there are initiatives: they are meant to try and get out of the Parisian circle to penetrate deeper into the country. David Frossard - This perfumery branch has no proper distribution network, only a few independent players, department stores, concept stores… it is very heterogeneous. The challenge will be to define in which channel this perfumery can work and develop. Things are already changing. Concepts such as Liquides, my perfume bar, attract department stores because they offer an exclusive shopping experience, and advice is given by real perfume specialists. There is growing interest from major distributors: for example, Sephora has selected a few alternative perfumery brands like Juliette Has A Gun [NB: Sephora has just opened a 3.0 store to highlight niche perfumes as well, with a broad collection of testers], Le Bon Marché has dedicated its perfumery department exclusively to this sector, the Printemps department store has devoted a large area to it, and Galeries Lafayette are going back to it with brands like Atelier Cologne or Ex Nihilo. Johann Vitrey - Absolutely. LVMH has adopted this idea of going back to the truth with its Small Is Beautiful store in St-Germain-en-Laye, in the west of Paris. The concept is definitely focused on customers, reception and service, and on a sophisticated product presentation. This very concept is a model, an example to be followed. It is a revolution I am ready to draw inspiration from. Another solution could be to open franchise stores in order to set up a direct network of several points of sale with its own trading group. Many have been thinking about it for a long time, and a few players did it, although it requires heavy investment for an uncertain return. There is also the idea of developing one's own network of wholly-owned stores, and I encourage brands to consider it. Not all of them, obviously, but those whose range is broad enough, and which have extension projects, and the potential to do it. It is a heavy investment, but it is exactly what French customers want: enter into a different world, a brand, and appropriate it. Premium Beauty News - Other than distribution, which difficulties is alternative perfumery experiencing right now in our country? Johann Vitrey - Today, nobody can come to an agreement on the definition of the segment itself, and this is the first difficulty. It is hard to find one's own place when the industry is not clearly defined itself. What is rare perfumery? Which brands can be considered to be part of it, and which brands should be excluded? Then, there is the size of the companies behind these brands. Beyond their creation skills, these people are usually not trained to regulations, export, or legislation. There is a lack of organization and professionalization. So, with Paris Parfums Rares, we are trying to provide solutions, and others are doing the same, for example through labels such as Différentes Latitudes and Comité Joséphine. Things are getting structured for a better organization. Lastly, there is the weight of selective perfumery in a shared network. The agreements signed by major groups' brands with independent perfume stores compel them to make a certain number of purchases every year, and this is really extremely tough financially, especially in this economic context. It prevents them from investing anywhere else, and obviously, in rare perfumery. David Frossard - It must be pragmatic and follow the market's rules. Increasing the number of launchings obeys to a strategy of linear profitability for brands with a visionary, well-defined approach. This contributes to the creative dynamics typical of the sector, but it must not make people believe anything is possible. It is up to distributors, retailers, and even the press, to sort things out and avoid those that claim they belong to creative perfumery, when they actually do not. A multitude of brands embark on the adventure, which makes buyers even more confused, whether they are professionals or end users, and prevents good brands from emerging. That is the reason why I created a label [NB: Différentes Latitudes]. It is a closed concept that guarantees a truly creative perfumery, a DNA, a story, a long-lasting concept. François Hénin - Indeed, niche perfumery already suffers from this fast-moving race. Brands with a real DNA are doing very well, as can be seen with the recent purchases by major groups. The last protection we have remains retailers, who do possess the knowledge and power to select real rare perfumery brands."
Kanebo launches first skincare line for over-60s women,"On October 16, 2015, Kanebo Cosmetics launched Twany Glow, a new skincare line mainly targeting women in their 60's from Twany, one of its core domestic skincare brands. Women in their 60s comprise 17% of the female population in Japan's and 40% of the total cosmetics-using population of women aged 15 -89. Furthermore, the per capita spending in households of the 60 - 69 age group is the highest, and money spent on cultural activities, leisure, and social entertainment is also higher than those in the younger age brackets. This generation is also highly conscious about beauty matters and has a positive attitude towards skincare. ""Women in their 60's belong to Japan's baby boomer generation, which has been at the forefront of mass consumption, and they care about their appearance. Our research revealed that 90% of these women use skincare on a daily or almost daily basis, which is a higher ratio than for younger generations,"" observes Yukio Makino, brand manager of Twany. Yet, due to the post-retirement decrease in average household incomes, a 2014 Kanebo survey reveals that women over 60 are inclined to constrain their cosmetics expenses without having to trade down to products of lesser qualities. Compared with women in their 50's, studies also show specific need of older women. After the menopausal years they experienced changes in their skin. The sebum content in the skin decreases, the skin's temperature can lower more easily, and conventional skin care items that place importance on moisturizing can no longer adequately address problems of dryness. ""Until recently in Japan, emphasis was placed on young and middle-aged customers and women in their 50's and older tended to get grouped into one big segment. But for women in their 60's - who represent the majority of Japan's cosmetics-using population - skin care that fulfills their particular lifestyles, spending patterns, and beauty needs is essential"" adds Yukio Makino. The Twany Glow line was developed to address the specific needs of skins that tend to have low sebum content. Five products are available for daily skin care: cleansing cream, facial soap, lotion, emulsion, and cream. These basic skin care items are priced slightly lower than conventional Twany cosmetics. Kanebo has also paid particular attention to the packaging design. Taking into consideration that the power to grasp can weaken with age, the package was specially made for easy grasping. The cap was made to open easily, and the bottle was devised to be less prone to slip out of the hands. To prevent breakage, the package is made of light-weight plastic in an easy-to-hold oval-shaped cylindrical form, and the screw cap is designed to open with fewer twists. Strategic parts of the bottle and the cap have been done in relief to prevent slippage. As far as distribution is concerned, Twany is sold mainly through free-standing cosmetics specialty stores, often found in regional cities or local shopping areas in larger cities."
"In Los Angeles, on February 3 and 4, 2016: MakeUp enters in action!","This new event, proposing a different format from the MakeUp In events organized so far, looks like a new stage for the Beauteam team. ""As we can see, explains Jean-Yves Bourgeois, the program of this first MakeUp in Action in Los Angeles places emphasis more on the conferences and workshops aspect than it does on products presentations by suppliers"". This side of the event will be purposefully limited, both in number of exhibitors and floor space. As for participants/visitors, access to the event will be free, but there will be a fee to participate to conferences and workshops. ""We have the ambition, emphasizes Sandra Maguarian, to organize an event that gives pride of place to quality exchanges between professionals and where education and knowledge sharing are the main goal."" This explains the two mornings of specialized workshops animated by experts who will have the possibility to use, at their convenience, a particular product of a particular supplier, to illustrate their point. And also the desire to privilege roundtables where interactivity between all stakeholders in the make-up industry will be key with a true commitment of local and international brands. ""This is a totally new concept we are proposing, explains Jean-Yves Bourgeois. The West Coast is the perfect spot for this. It is the place where all kinds of start-ups emerged. This region, with its level of creativity and dynamism, never stops surprising us! It was an obvious place to be and ride this wave!"""
"""Absolute customization may be the future of real luxury"", Bruno Cottard, VP Jean Patou","With its historical expertise in perfumery, its internal perfumer-creator, and its laboratory located in the heart of the golden triangle in Paris, the brand was predisposed to meet this expectation. The creation process requires both the work of a real dedicated craftsman and the commitment, in terms of time and thinking, of the customer. Thomas Fontaine, the Maison's perfumer, organizes five to ten meetings with the customer to become immersed in his/her story, discover his/her olfactory world, and convey this personality with a signature. ""All this requires to understand who or what the person is, unconsciously, and what he or she intends to show"", the perfumer comments. Several suggestions are made over a period of six months, depending on the raw materials selected, and always with the guarantee of exceptional quality ingredients. The rose/jasmine note of the Grasse region, so dear to Patou perfumes, remains the main theme that will give the original creation its Patounade. Then everything narrows down to the final outcome. The Maison takes care of the administrative and regulatory procedures and produces five litres of perfume, which are kept in a safe at the headquarters. After nine to twelve months, the proud owner pays 50,000 euros to receive a Jean Patou-designed, 100ml bottle made of Baccarat crystal, bearing his own engraved initials, arms, or monograms. The whole is featured in a wooden, leather, or fabrics box made by Elie Bleu, Pinel et Pinel, or Norline's workshops. ""We have estimated at about 4,000 the number of people that may be concerned by this offer, so it is not really a market, but it is still important for the prestige of a House of perfume like ours to make a unique high perfumery service available to people who can afford it,"" explains Bruno Cottard. The brand has already approached several people in Europe and the United States, and it intends to rely on word-of-""nose"" to reach customers endowed with an exclusive trail."
"Man buns, braids and bold colours among the top Google beauty searches this year","According to the recently published ""Beauty Trends 2015, Hair Care Edition (U.S.)"" analyzing the monthly volume of beauty-related search queries from January 2013 - August 2015, the man bun has emerged as one of the most-searched for hairstyles after appearing on the scene in 2014. Thanks to celebrities such as Harry Styles, Jared Leto and Leonardo DiCaprio, the trend spread like wildfire, and men all over the globe turned to the internet to recreate the look at home, turning to the search engine to find out ""how to grow a man bun"" and ""how to tie a man bun"". According to Google, 2015 saw men's hair queries overtake women's hair queries for the first time. Man buns aside, the other big searches were for ""Mad Men""-style comb-overs and fade haircuts, a gradient style that sees the hair go from longer at one point to very short at another. When it comes to women, one of the biggest rising search trends has been for braids, which have been given a new lease of life on the catwalks of late. Squared-off ""box braids"", which consist of multiple hanging braids weaved into the hair, and cornrow ""goddess braids"" which lie partially flat against the scap, are the hottest trends, based on the search data, with interest in both starting in 2013 and peaking this year. The braided look, which continued to reign supreme on the Spring / Summer 2016 runways, seems set to stick around for a while yet. The third major beauty search trend since 2013 has been for daring hair colours. The recent 'Granny hair' trend that took off this spring, inspired by stars like Kelly Osborne and Rihanna, means that searches related to grey and silver tresses are amongst the most popular. Purple has also been having a moment, with Katy Perry's Grammy Awards lavender hairdo this February sparking off a round of searches for the look. Rainbow hair has also made its mark, both in the streets and in online searches."
"Cosmoprof Asia 2015 to spotlight the natural, baby care and male grooming segments","The growing demand for ""truly natural"" products in Asia is evident in the number of companies at Discover Trends displaying a plethora of eco-sustainable and natural beauty cosmetics.

"Light, reloadable, customizable: the reload. mini-spray is designed to refashion perfumery","Testing, changing, moving: the 5ml mini-spray launched by reload labs. is just super-trendy. ""As people no longer put perfume on only once a day, in the morning or at night, consumers express the desire to do it whenever they feel like it, and small sizes have become very popular, only one person out of ten takes their perfumes with them when they leave home,"" explains François Turck, General Manager Europe of the French start-up. People want to be able to move with their perfumes; they want to discover, test, and change them: reload. targets both uses. The start-up had to face several challenges to manage to take perfumes out of people's bathrooms. ""The travel size solutions available until then were not very efficient,"" François Turck adds. What were their main flaws? They were not really waterproof, and consumers got tired of seeing their precious perfumes evaporate. So when it designed its mini-spray, reload labs. decided to focus on this aspect as well as on the various refill systems and the final appearance of the product. The idea was to develop a reloadable flask to be inserted into a spray packaged with an interchangeable, customizable case. Consumers can reload the flask with their own perfumes, either with the funnel provided, or with the valve designed to be attached to the perfume bottle pump, after removing the pump protection on the spray. They can also buy full refills to discover as many new perfumes as they wish, thanks to an exclusive patented system. And they can enjoy the same flexibility with the case. Although the original one is black or white, consumers will be able to purchase separate cases, and even create one in their own image on byreload.com, which features cases in different colours and with endless decorations: printed ones, others covered with leather, or made of aluminium or Zamak… The reload. reloadable mini-spray is available in its box for EUR19.90, and is provided together with its empty refill and funnel specifically designed to avoid discharges. As for the pre-filled refills, they cost 5 euros and are available from the dedicated piece of furniture in selective perfume shops, where empty sprays are also sold. They make it possible for consumers to test perfumes over time. The packaging containing the refills is marketed with a voucher that bears a single number, which enables to generate a EUR5 reduction voucher online when purchasing the real size product (as from 50ml), and therefore reimburse the cost of the refill tested. ""Our study results show we can consider a 15 to 20% conversion rate, which is much higher than any other recruiting tool,"" François Turck concludes. Partnerships have already been concluded with about ten brands (Issey Miyake, Arden, Kenzo, Givenchy, Hugo Boss…). In Europe, reload. was launched in early October in approximately twenty countries, in particular via the Douglas network (Nocibé in France), via Manor in Switzerland, and Ici Paris XL in Belgium and Luxembourg. It will be launched before the end of the year in the Middle East in partnership with the Chalhoub Group, and should be available in the United States in 2016. As for its debuts in France, Nocibé offers to test the eaux de parfum Jeu d'Amour by Kenzo, Dahlia Divin and Pi by Givenchy, Hugo Man, Hugo Woman and Bottled by Hugo Boss, and L'Eau d'Issey pour Homme by Issey Miyake. Reload. has thought about launching temporary collections with these perfume houses to increase brands' visibility: an exclusive, limited selection of references only available for a few months to discover fragrances in a completely innovative, unique way. In order to design its product, reload., a new player on the perfumery market, approached the Ileos Group, but also Arcade Beauty (formerly known as Bioplan) and Axilone for their know-how in the field of injection and conditioning. ""The company contacted us for our expertise in small size diffusers and our know-how in terms of full-service solutions"", explains Stéphane Frémiot, Senior VIP Sales Europe at Arcade Beauty, who initiated the project. The body, the pushbutton, the internal spring tube, and the interchangeable case make up the upper part of the spray. They are injected at Axilone Plastique, in their plant located in Auray, Brittany, France, and then they are assembled together. The Zamak base adapted to this upper part is supplied by another company, Pack-Man. ""The initial specifications were designed to make refills interchangeable, while guaranteeing efficient watertightness and quality spraying"", explains Virginie Muntaner-Verdeille, Key Account Manager at Axilone. ""We started from a first drawing provided by reload., and then we designed the spray. We had to integrate all the functional elements in an object that presented a lot of constraints in terms of size and design. We adapted the product to industrialization and gave reload. some advice on the materials to be used in this type of product."" We chose not to develop a new pump, but to start from an existing engine suited for a specific spray. It is the SP5 pump engine by Albéa, the mini-pump specialist, that was selected. Albéa designed a special connecting element which obtained a patent for its diameter and height in order to guarantee the unique nature of the refills. Lastly, Arcade Beauty is responsible for reloading the refills, installing the covers, and printing the batch-codes on the cases. And the result is displayed with furniture manufactured in France by Como. All in all, 200,000 sprays were produced to implement the concept, and 500,000 more will be available before the end of December."
E-beauty trends 2015: Towards an augmented use of beauty products,"Alcimed's first finding is that the word ""e-beauty"" covers a wide range of products with great differences from one another. There are for instance electronic tools to facilitate the application or the efficacy of products, as well as connected objects, beauty monitoring apps and communication and marketing tools developed by beauty brands. Electronic devices designed to facilitate the application of skin care products, increase their efficiency, ensure more appropriate use, or extend the effects, have multiplied in recent years. According to Alcimed, there are two main trends: on the one hand, the democratization of professional instruments, and on the other hand, the use of brushes allowing more efficient applications. Thus, electronic devices inspired from those used in beauty salons or dermatology offices are becoming available to the greatest number. ""This is especially true for devices using pulsed light or electricity to improve a specific aspect of the skin. Known and used by professionals for over twenty years, they are making their entry on the consumer market,"" said the consulting firm, mentioning the use of red light for anti-ageing purposes (""Luxury"" by Tanda) or of blue light for acne-fighting procedures (""Clear Rayz for Acne"" by Quasar), as well as small electrical impulsions to increase product penetration and stimulate cell regeneration (""Trinity Facial Toning"" by Nuface) or even laser hair removal (""Laser 4X"" by Tria.) The use of brushes to apply skincare is mainly a mechanical solution. Their number is growing, particularly in Europe, with various actions: exfoliating (microdermabrasion), cleansing (by micro-oscillations or ion pulses) or combining several actions to be increasingly multifunctional. ""New brushes, fully dedicated to makeup are being marketed. Inspired by the Korean trend of electrical application, brushes have a tip that reproduces the finger tapping in order to assure a more uniform application of foundations, BB creams, moisturizers, concealers, blush and bronzing powders. The Color Me applicators marketed by Eric Jimenez are a good illustration of this trend. Another major emerging technology aims at improving consumer's knowledge about the skin, its quality and its needs. Sensors in placed in devices measure parameters such as hydration, blemishes, colour, temperature, aging and environmental stresses (pollution and UV radiation), etc. The BeautyExplorer launched by Sony earlier this year is a perfect example of this trend. The device analyses the light that is reflected from the skin and provides its diagnosis. Tools measuring sun exposure such as Netatmo's June, or those that continuously measure several skin parameters such as the flexible patch that L'Oréal developed with the University of Illinois. However, innovations are not just about applying skincare products, they also include the user's experience. Actually, two main tracks are being explored. The first one consists in helping consumers during the purchasing act. Thanks to smartphones and electronic mirrors now make it possible to visualize skin problems when they occur, and to test make-up or hair products through interactive interfaces. The most striking examples are Panasonic's Beauty Mirror and the L'Oréal's Makeup Genius application. The second option consists in ensuring the safety and traceability through intelligent packaging. This is what provides Israel's start-up Visualead. To fight against counterfeiting, the company's Dotless Visual Code technology can control the authenticity of items provided the manufacturer has printed a smartphone-readable code on the product's packaging. Each code only works once, and cannot be reused or rewritten by counterfeiters. According to Alcimed, brands such as L'Oréal and Ferrero have already created millions of unique Visual Dotless Codes for their products in China. ""In light of the innovations that are already available, one can expect an explosion of electronics and digital tools on the cosmetics market and the use of increasingly original technologies. The devices of the future will surely draw their inspiration from areas external to the cosmetics arena in order to offer new and ever more surprising features, that will revolutionize our vision of beauty products,"" concludes Pierre Gadrat, Director of Alcimed's BU TIM."
Brazil set to take the lead on men's grooming by 2019,"A study conducted by the market research firm also shows that sales of shaving products, soaps and shampoos for men have totalled US$4.7 billion in 2014 – a 99.4% increase over 2009. The product mix is increasingly more diversified, and Brazil's cosmetics leadership will be particularly drawn by bath and shower products, which are set to grow by 111% between 2014 and 2019. Deodorants (+53%), hair care (+38%) and shaving products (+32%) are to follow. Marcela Viana, market research analyst at Euromonitor International, says the increase in income observed in recent years combined to new customers entering this market should bring Brazil to the top of the rank. Marcela points to the fact that manufacturers also play a key role in Brazil's strong performance in this market. ""The industry has been contributing considerably to this scenario by launching products targeting male consumers."" Men thus account for around 40% of Granado's customers. The Brazilian cosmetics brand has four men's grooming brands - Glicerina, made of vegetable glycerin bar soaps and body washes; Antisséptica, with antifungal and antibacterial products; Barbearia, whose highlight is a shaving soap for men who shave in the shower or sauna; and the dermocosmetics range Granaderma. Granado's marketing and sales director, Sissi Freeman, says the company has followed closely the behaviour of male consumers in Granado's 40 concept stores throughout Brazil. ""Product loyalty is an important feature. Our antiseptic talcum powder, which was Granado's very first product, has become a tradition passed on from generation to generation."" Brazil's cosmetics giant Natura also has a portfolio dedicated to male customers, ranging from perfumes and deodorants to creams, foams, moisturizers and hair care products. ""As well as practicality, men look out for efficiency and points of difference in the product composition. That is why the beauty industry has been investing in products with the latest technology. One of Natura's competitive advantages is that male customers can purchase products online through Rede Natura (Natura network), which meets their demand for quick and easy solutions,"" says Alessandro Mendes, product development director at Natura. Euromonitor's Viana points out that unlike women, men do not tend to be impulsive buyers - ""they are more careful and patient customers,"" she says. Christoph Mayer-Loos, co-founder of online men's grooming store Shop4Men, agrees with Viana. ""It is a demanding target audience, aged 20 to 45 years. Most often, the first purchase is a product that they have already tried. Once they discover more options, the next purchase is usually larger and includes different products,"" he says."
Selfies and strobing boost prestige makeup sales in the UK,"The total value of the British prestige beauty market is £1.2 billion in January to August 2015, which grew 6.4% on the previous year. Make-up represents a substantial part of the sector accounting for 32.8% of this market and has grown by 3.2% on the same period in 2014. ""Make-up is really driving growth in the prestige beauty market fueled by the popularity of the selfie. Pioneered by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, it's a trend we see across the board and make-up is essential to creating the perfect look. At the same time strobing, which emerged in early 2015, is the years' hot new make-up trend which is driving consumers to spend more on highlighters so they can experiment with this new way of accentuating the face,"" explains June Jensen, Director U.K. Beauty for The NPD Group. According to NPD, the three core segments of the makeup category have all reported double digit growth in the period January to August 2015, compared to the same period in 2014. The total value of face make-up is £206 million, up 17%; total eye make-up is valued at £101 million, growing by 13% and total lip make-up reported sales of £54 million growing by 16%. Foundation alone, which is part of the face segment, reported sales of £112 million and grew by 16% in the period January to August 2015, compared to the year before. This dramatic growth can be attributed directly to the continued popularity of the selfie. ""Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Beyonce and Cara Delevingne have inspired a generation of women to post selfies on social media channels such as Instagram and Facebook. Face, eye and lip make-up is vital to achieving a photo-ready finish and brands have responded with foundation and primers that reference the look people want to achieve using terms like photo-ready, camera-ready and HD. It's spurned a new sub-sector and is driving sales,"" explains Jensen. Strobing Emerging as a key make-up trend in 2015, strobing - a new make-up technique used to layer highlights on the face to create an illuminated complexion - has driven growth in the highlighter/illuminator sub sector by 48.5% in the period January to August 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Total sales of highlighter products in this period were £8 million whilst in the same period in 2014 sales were £5.5 million. ""Highlighters have witnessed an incredible amount of growth in the past year driven solely by the new trend for strobing. This has been a huge topic on social media, on beauty blogs and in the mainstream press. Brands have capitalised on this with new launches and focusing marketing on existing lines to drive sales in store and online,"" concludes Jensen."
Cosmoprof Asia to celebrate 20th anniversary and French cosmetics,"Benefiting from the high growing rate of the Asia-Pacific beauty and personal care market, Cosmoprof Asia has grown from a humble regional fair into what is today one of the ultimate annual destinations in Asia for professionals in the beauty industry. Since its inception in 1996, the event has expanded in importance and in size, having grown four times bigger. With 2,362 exhibitors from 42 countries and regions over 81,500 square metres of exhibition space (+7% compared to 2013), last year's edition reaffirmed its dynamism. In 2014, the tradeshow welcomed about 60,000 visitors, 64% of them originating from outside Hong Kong. ""The show has constantly adapted to changes in the industry and market and today reflects the entirety of the industry, offering visitors unrivalled access to the latest offerings in perfumery and cosmetics, natural and organics, packaging and raw materials, aesthetics and spa, nail, hair and accessories, all represented by major international and Asian companies,"" explain the organizers. To commemorate its 20th anniversary, Cosmoprof Asia 2015 has numerous special events and activities in store. At the front stage comes Spot on Beauty, a launchpad for new products that was initiated in 2014. An area of 3,700 square meters showcases the latest launches in cosmetics, skincare, nail and hair. In addition, new pavilion called ""Discover Trends"" will house exhibitors representing three emerging segments of the beauty industry – cosmetics for men, natural and organic products, as well as baby products. To enhance interactive learning during the show, a dedicated Trends Forum has been added to the Spot On Beauty area. Global research companies such as Euromonitor, Groupe Carlin International, Information et Inspiration and Kline will reveal their views on current and future beauty trends. After the success of last year, the charity initiative Boutique will be back: visitors can hand-pick a selection of travel-sized product samples sponsored by 20 exhibitors, to be presented in a customised gift box, for a small donation. All proceeds will go to a selected charity. On the occasion of this 20th anniversary, the 9th edition of the International Buyer Programme, a trade programme designed to give exhibitors and high-profile visitors the opportunity to meet and engage in pre-scheduled one-on-one meetings, will focus on Asian countries (China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea) and Turkey. ""Through its 20 year history, Cosmoprof Asia has bridged French companies and international buyers. Participation has included the likes of Laboratoires Ingrid Millet and Evoluderm, and the event has helped launch French products throughout Asia such as Kadalys' anti-ageing banana-based cosmetic,"" claim the organisers. On the occasion of the 20th Anniversary, 108 French exhibitors (39 are first time exhibitors) will participate in the show, and Business France and Cosmoprof Asia are creating the ""French Cosmetic Awards"" to honour French brands that demonstrate an innovative and creative approach to the Chinese market. A panel of judges will assess participating French cosmetics products on originality, innovation and excellence in communication strategy. The panelists will comprise representative from three French companies with established presence in Hong Kong - Caudalie, L'Oréal and Ann Jema, as well as retailers Mekim Ltd and Asia Spa & Wellness Ltd, and independent industry experts and Hong Kong celebrity beauty blogger, Ms. Queenie Chan. Cosmoprof Asia 2015 will be held from 11 to 13 November at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre."
Global cosmetic brands draw their inspiration from Korea and Japan,"Japanese women have exported the ""beauty routine"" concept that Koreans have developed and amplified. Then came the BB creams, now followed by compact cushions and facial treatment sheet masks. The quest for a flawless skin and for eternal youth is common to Japan and Korea beauty habits. Of course, the Japanese and Korean consumers differ in their approaches to beauty, their average age and their consumption preferences, however Françoise Hernaez Fourrier (full presentation available here below) insists on the reciprocal influences between these two countries, which are geographically very close and also benefit from their proximity with the huge Chinese market. ""Cosmetic products enter into China in the wake of the K-pop and Korean TV series,"" she says. However, Florence Bernardin (full presentation available here below) points out important differences related to demographics. ""Japan is truly becoming the market for anti-aging products and for seniors. Anyone looking for examples of products openly intended for more the 50+ should go to Japan to find them,"" she says. ""The Korean market on the contrary is still driven women in the 30s, but also by government subsidies and by the Chinese demand which strongly boost innovation."" In these fairly conservative societies, competition and the need to appeal to consumers constantly looking for new and highly efficient products, local brands do no hesitate to grow outside the box. For instance, in countries where cleanliness, hygiene and washing, are key cultural elements of everyday life, some cosmetic brands have successfully marketed products addressing the need to maintain the skin's microbiome in good conditions and offering to boost skin's ""good microbes"" by applying various kind of muds on the body. Nevertheless, the ritual of washing the skin before applying skincare and makeup, or before going to sleep, remains a key element of the beauty routine in both Korea and Japan. Korea's brand Etude House thus proposes a kit of 12 cleansing care products (one for each month) to adapt washing and meet the different needs of the skin to the changing climate conditions all along the year. Japanese and Korean brands are also increasingly interested in the rinsing and post-cleansing steps of the routine and are launching products that help to maintain a good skin hydration at that moment. This reinvention of washing also requires new approaches, in particular by replacing plain water with vegetable or floral waters. Among the other developments identified by Florence Bernardin, the progressive evolution of cushion products from makeup to skincare. These small ultra-soft sponges placed in airtight boxes that can be soaked with liquid formulations are also getting increasingly small so as they can be brought everywhere. A good illustration being Primera's new Baby Sun Cushion SPF32/PA++. With no more than 15 g, the compact fits easily in the bag of the mother who wants to reapply sunscreen easily on her baby's skin. Katalin Berenyi, co-founder of French-Korean brand Erborian, which imported the BB cream concept in Europe, insists on the differences between the ideal of Korean beauty and the European one. ""To create Erborian, we took inspiration from Korean beauty rituals and from the traditional herbal pharmacopoeia. And obviously, we studied trends and practices of contemporary young Korean women,"" she explains. ""However we have taken great attention to the adaptation of our products, including formulas, to the expectations of French women."" Indeed, while Korean women seek to remain eternally in their twenties and to a achieve a skin as perfect as that of a baby, European and especially French women, want a more natural beauty look. ""Making a mere copy of a Korean formula would not have worked."" It is a bit too early to predict whether, after the craze for French cosmetics and the revolution that Japanese designers brought on the market with the clear lines of their packaging, the ""Hot in Seoul"" label could become the ultimate selling argument in the world of beauty! However, the Land of Morning Calm has already acquired a strong influence within the cosmetics industry and now ambitions to compete with French brands in the Chinese market. According to the Korea International Trade Association (KITA), Korean cosmetic brands already hold 22.1 per cent of the market vs. 30.6% for French products.

French prestige skincare market bounces back from recession,"The prestige beauty channel in France returned to growth in H1 2015, increasing by 0.7 per cent in value. According to The NPD Group, this revival is based on a return to growth of the perfume and makeup categories, and mostly on a pretty rebound of the skincare segment (21 per cent of the beauty market) which contributes to more than half to the growth of the channel. ""With a growth of 1.9 per cent in value at the end of June 2015, the prestige skincare segment is driven by the rise of light textures such as serums and oils, the success of which is expected to continue over the second half of the year,"" says the market research firm. In a category dominated by skin creams, serums (the second segment of skincare by size) drive both short-term (+14 per cent in value in H1 2015) and long-term growth (+22 per cent vs 1st half 2011). They account for three-quarters of the growth of the skin care category without cannibalizing skin creams that remained flat after two years of decline. ""While more basic categories are in competition with other distribution channels, serums, which boast higher actives concentrations and benefit from the strong technological advances made by Prestige brands, are increasingly preferred by consumers. Lightness, ease of application and immediate effect are real assets to seduce French female consumers,"" explains Mathilde Lion, Expert Beauty Europe at The NPD Group. Like serums, oils are gaining momentum in the selective channel with a 44 per cent growth in the first half and sales exploding, especially within the anti-age segment. Because it is highly sensorial and particularly easy to apply, this category is conquering all skin care segments, from face to body care, including anti-aging, moisturizing, and sun care products. The success of dry and light formulas launched in pharmacies in recent years, has opened the way to a new generation of prestige products. Furthermore, the trend is driven by the search for naturalness, since oils are mainly composed of natural ingredients. ""Light textures are on the rise and this trend is a long term perspective with the arrival on the market of hybrid products combining the naturalness of oil and the technicality of the serums. 'Oil serums' for instance combine the nourishing power of oils and the freshness of serums. Fall 2015 should confirm this trend with the launch of innovations such as oil-in-gels or balms-in-oil,"" concludes Mathilde Lion."
MakeUp in New York 2015 unveils a series of hot innovations,"The 2015 edition of MakeUp in New York, the event dedicated to the suppliers of makeup brands, which was held on 9-10 September at the Penn Plaza Pavilion, was once again very busy, with about 2,500 visitors (a 15 per cent increase compared to 2014). ""The 110 exhibitors to MakeUp in New York, were able to see for themselves that once again this show was a much awaited event by top brands in the US make-up industry, an event that has never stopped carving a name for itself in the world of global business events dedicated to the beauty industry,"" commented the organisers. This year, the new accessories, packaging solutions and formulations presented by the exhibitors have been evaluated and selected before being showcased in a dedicated area, the salon's ""Innovation Tree"". Highlights this season include Sephora's new ""Double Down Brush Set"" by HCT, a patented 2-in-1 brush that can be converted into a double-ended tool by removing the larger head and attaching it to the handle of the smaller brush. This feature protects the smaller brush head from damage and debris, keeping it clean and safe for contact with the eyes. Preventing bacterial contamination is also the aim of the ""Tip and Blend Brush Collection"" by Pennellifaro, a brush featuring a rounded shape with a central tip in relief, on to which a small amount of liquid or cream foundation can be poured directly. Not having to put product on the back of your hand first guards against waste and contamination. Hygiene was also in the focus of US-headquartered supplier of makeup brushes Anisa International. The company showcased a range of cleansing products entirely dedicated to the cleaning of makeup brushes and applicators. According to Anisa, ""61 per cent of women clean their makeup brushes less than once a month or not at all, in particular because they take too long to dry."" Anisa also explains that uncleaned or improperly cleaned brushes can significantly impact product performance. The product solutions showcased by Anisa thus allow a deep clean or a quick refresh of makeup tools with a few seconds. As far as formulation are concerned, the ""Eyebrow Gel Volume"" by ABC Texture brings brows into the spotlight with a fibre-enriched, 30° angled brush that claims to facilitate precision, accuracy, evenness and easier application. As for the new gel-to-pencil eyeliner ""Liquid Like Gel Sensation EL"" by Alkos Group, it combines the precision of a liquid liner with the application and the result of a pencil. The fast-drying formula is waterproof, long-lasting and can be used on the outside and the inside of the eye. Contouring remains big business in the business, so the ""Art of Contouring"" tool by Faber Castell will no doubt prove popular. Described as ""a natural face lift in 3 steps"", the product reshapes and sculpts the features, with a highlighting element adding radiance and the blush aspect resulting in a youthful flush. And innovation isn't just for women. In line with the growth of the male grooming sector, there is plenty of development when it comes to guys' beauty products, as demonstrated by the new ""BB Cream for Man"" by ICC. The men's nail product has been formulated to reactivate the nail barrier and protect them from breakage and flaking due to the dehydration caused by exposure to solvents and surfactant. The special base is lightly coloured but not glossy, giving nails a ""healthy and natural look."""
MakeUp in New York to open its doors this week,"The event's organisers chose to place this new edition of MakeUp in New York under the sign of innovation and trends with a new animation, the Innovation Tree Products, that will reveal new products presented by exhibitors and selected by a committee compound of experts in formulation, packaging, full service and accessories. For its participation in MakeUp in NewYork this year, cosmetics packaging supplier Albéa has set up a Beauty Bar where famous professional makeup artist Jody Formica will offer free makeup sessions with easy-to-use temporary tattoos, for a fun, trendy and bohemian touch! Albéa and Jody Formica will also showcase the latest beauty innovations in make-up, including false lashes, eyebrow and mascara brushes. For the third time MakeUp in NewYork will invite its exhibitors and visitors to discover a unique exhibition, The Art of Beauty, featuring vintage cosmetics and make-up objects from the Camilli and Hattemberg collection, and organized by Le Musée à la Carte. This year, members of the CEW - a non-profit, professional organization with more than 8,000 members worldwide from 2,250 companies in the beauty industry - will be offered a private visit of the show that will give them and the exhibitors a unique opportunity to meet in a quiet and exclusive environment. Once again, MakeUp in New York is teaming up with the students of the cosmetics and fragrance marketing program of the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT). Virginia Bonofiglio and her students will present a history of American make-up from the 1920s to the 1980s, with a video presentation along with several period-inspired makeup looks on models. The presentation will take place on Wednesday, September 9th, in the conference room, from 10:15 am to 10:45 am."
Makeup in Sao Paulo builds on the success of the first edition,"Premium Beauty News - In a little more than three months will open the second edition of MakeUp in Sao Paulo. A much awaited event by the whole Brazilian cosmetics industry! Sandra Maguarian - Absolutely! The message that was passed on to cosmetics suppliers at the conference dedicated to Brazil, last June at MakeUp in Paris, by Mrs Nazish Munchenbach of Granado, Mrs Vanessa Machado of Quem Disse Berenice (O Boticario Group) and Mrs Maria Paula Fonseca of Natura, was clear: ""Come over, we need you!"" Remember also comments at the close of the first edition. Among the exhibitors, Arcade / Bioplan, Topline Products, Oxygen Development, Fiabila, Strand Cosmetics Europe, Faber-Castell, Geka-World, for instance, praised the high quality of the event. As far as visitors were concerned, we also received very good feedbacks from brands such as MakeB (Boticario Group) and Granado. Premium Beauty News - Despite a difficult economic context, analysts appear to agree that Brazil remains a country with a high potential for the cosmetics industry. What is your opinion on this? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Rather than engage in a hasty global strategy, Brazilian brands prefer to be part of this local growth and consolidate their position challenged by a stimulating international presence. A challenge, which they know is determined by innovation and the integration of technologies coming from all industry partners. Brazil has managed to become in a few years one of the world leaders in many Beauty segments. And the general economic downturn currently occurring after 30 years of continuous growth allows in fact to reflect on the longer-term taking into account the positive indicators and the emergence of new trends. Third largest cosmetics market after the United States and China, Brazil represents 9.4% of the world consumption of cosmetics and ranks first in the segments of Deodorants, Perfumes and Sun care products. Despite the apparent weakening of the Brazilian economy, the beauty and personal care markets seem to be playing their card better than most of other segments of the economy. Cosmetics are the country's most dynamic sector with a growth 3 times higher than the country's GDP. In the health, perfumes and cosmetics sector (HPC), the make-up category continues to rank third in the world's consumption, representing 7.7% of Brazil's cosmetics market with a homogeneous distribution of subcategories (nails 28%, lips 24%, face 24% and eyes 24%). 32% of Brazilian women regularly wear make-up. Premium Beauty News - Another key point, the distribution of cosmetics which was the exclusive preserves of ""door to door"" sales is changing! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - If direct selling remains the most widespread distribution model in Brazil, the development of infrastructures, the growing number of sales channels and the challenge offered by a growing pack of international competitors open today new opportunities and determine future issues. The discovery of the variety of make-up products is new to the Brazilian woman who still has simple consumption needs. The percentage of sales is lower than in other countries and often limited to lipstick, nail polish and mascara. This suggests an interesting potential for growth, provided however the consumer is offered a larger universe to discover. The attractiveness of Brazil has opened the cosmetics and make-up market to a varied and growing international competition. With 8% of imported products, the hegemony of local players does not seem however to be threatened for the moment, although the market share of subsidiaries of international companies producing in the country, should also be taken into account. Yet, the arrival of new competitors, has prompted Brazilian companies to react. The arrival of international brands was an opportunity to take inspiration and improve. Competition pushes local companies to step out of their comfort zone to give the consumer the choice of quality and creativity can only be a source of growth, they emphasize. The variety of the offer and novelty helping to educate the market, particularly that of make-up, generate a positive effect. While the influence of established international service providers can already be felt, each brand operating on the market calls for more options."
The Nordic natural cosmetics market benefits from ethical consumerism,"Denmark has the largest market for natural cosmetics in the Nordic region. According to a recent report by Organic Monitor [1], natural and organic products comprise 4% of total cosmetic and personal care product sales in Denmark. The country also has very high market share for organic foods, 7%; the highest in the world. ""Danish consumers are high spenders on natural and organic products because of ethical and environmental concerns,"" explains the consulting and training firm. Widening availability is also driving market growth. Natural and organic cosmetics are making inroads in department stores, beauty retailers, supermarkets, drugstores and non-retail channels. However, health food shops still have the highest sales share. Although imported brands are highly established, Nordic brands are showing a rise in market share. The Danish company Urtekram has taken market leadership. It has a strong market position in all country markets partly because of its extensive product range and distribution. It was the first company to launch Cosmos-certified organic cosmetics in the region. It also has products with the Fairtrade and Nordic Swan labels. Organic Monitor finds green labels are becoming increasingly important in the Nordic region. Consumers are increasingly looking for logos and symbols that represent ethical and/or environmental attributes. The Nordic Swan is most established for personal care products, recognised by over 90% of consumers. Ethical labels will be featured in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit Europe. Hosted in Paris on 21-23 October, at the Paris Marriott Champs-Elysées, an update will be given on the growing myriad of ethical labelling schemes for cosmetics & personal care products. Urtekram will be sharing its experiences with such labels at the summit."
Brony hair: the new trend inspired by My Little Pony,"""Brony"" hair is the latest style to take over Instagram. The look involves dyeing your locks the signature pastels and candy-coloured hues of the toy ponies, often mixing up different shades at the same time. Some stars, like Katy Perry and Kelly Osbourne, who is known for her violet crop, have been rocking the look for months, while others, such as model Georgia May Jagger, are new to the Brony scene. The daughter of Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall took to Instagram earlier this week to unveil her new 'mermazing' look, with a photo showing off her multitoned green, pink, purple and orange locks captioned ""Bronies with @alexbrownsell @bleachlondon Mermazing Hair colour."" The UK fashionista has kept her roots natural and left sections of her long blond hair uncolored to keep things choppy. Cara Delevingne was also spotted championing the look earlier this month when she stepped out with sugary pink hair. The actress turned out to be sporting a wig — a good idea if you want to test out Brony hair without committing — but her choice of color proved the trend is hot right now. Brony hair could be a natural progression from 'Rainbow hair', the trend that has been sweeping the Internet all summer. Thanks to celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Kaley Cuoco, graduated ombré styles that involve leaving the roots their natural colour and adding flashes of pastel or fluo tones to the bottom half of your tresses have been big news. The concept is both fun and practical in terms of regrowth."
Global Photoshop experiment unmasks beauty standards around the world,"The ""Perceptions of Perfection"" study, carried out by Fractl for the Online Doctor service from UK health and beauty retailer Superdrug, saw 18 female graphic designers around the world Photoshop the image of a model to reflect what they felt would make the image more attractive to the citizens of their country. According to the authors of the study, ""the results show just how much the 'perfect body' varies depending on geographic location."" While the Spanish and Colombian versions of the image closely represented the model's natural shape and look, designers from Venezuela and Peru favored a bustier image, with Argentina opting for a slimmer model. The US designer chose a slim but curvaceous shape, while the UK result was made more slender overall. The final result for Italy, home to voluptuous sirens such as Sophia Loren and Monica Bellucci, was surprisingly lean and leggy. Another country endorsing a wispy silhouette if the results are to be believed is China, whose submitted image featured an incredibly slim (if improbably busty) model. Once translated into real-life dimensions, the experiment's organizers estimated that the Chinese model would weigh just 101 lbs (around 46 kilos) and have an unhealthily low BMI of 17. Elsewhere in Asia, the Filipina designer manipulated the picture to cinch in the woman's waist, emphasizing her hips and chest. Hips were also on the menu in Egypt, while the South African representation was more straight up and down. The authors explain that the experiment aimed to ""better understand potentially unrealistic standards of beauty and to see how such pressures vary around the world."" The organizers explain: ""We focused on female designers, as we wanted a woman's view of what her culture finds attractive and to understand more about the pressures they face.""

Baking: the hottest new makeup trend,"It's actually the latest big makeup tend and a quick scan of Instagrammed photos tagged #bakingtechnique reveals scores of women captured with various amounts of powder patted all over their faces. Baking, in the cosmetic sense, involves wetting the skin after foundation and concealer have been applied by using a damp sponge to dust powder over dark shadows or areas of the face that you want to highlight. As well as highlighting facial features, it also sets makeup to keep your look fresh throughout the day. For perfectly baked under-eyes and covering up dark circles, makeup artist Heidi Hamoud recommends using an eye cream such as Bobbi Brown's Hydrating Eye Cream to prep. She then suggests using a thick, pigmented concealer and dabbing it on the under-eye area, before blending out any creases and tapping the area lightly with a face powder like Laura Mercier's Invisible Loose Powder to set the makeup. Former drag queen and makeup artist Mathias Alan also recommends using Urban Decay's De-Slick Makeup Setting Spray over foundation and concealer for the ultimate bake. Now it's baking time! Using a damp sponge, you can then apply a generous amount of powder under the eye, before leaving it to set for five minutes and dusting off the excess with a makeup brush. However, Hamoud's tip is to use a hard-pressed powder such as the Make Up For Ever Pro Finish Powder to go over the 'baked' area with a brush, using light flicking motions to smooth everything out, buff off the powder and provide extra coverage. It isn't just eye bags that can benefit from the approach — the technique can also be used as a method of contouring when applied underneath the hollows of the cheekbones and to the chin or down the bridge of the nose for a baking hot look."
Nearly six in ten US women check ingredients on their beauty products,"The ""Green Beauty Barometer"" survey [1] has revealed that the majority of US shoppers (59 per cent) read beauty product ingredient labels prior to purchase, while nearly 40 per cent intend to increase their spending on all-natural beauty products. ""For the last several years shoppers have become more conscious about what they put in their body through food consumption, and that's spilled over to a greater awareness for what they put on their body,"" commented Lisa Strain, co-founder of the Kari Gran skin care and makeup brand. Sulfates were the top ingredient to look out for, with 29 percent of participants seeking to avoid them. These were followed by parabens (22 per cent), synthetic fragrances (18 per cent), PEG compounds (15 per cent) and mineral oil (11 per cent). Women aged 35-54 are most likely to check the labels, with 65 per cent scanning the ingredients list of products. Sixty-three per cent of 18-34-year-olds do the same, as to 59 percent of those aged to 45-54. The age group least likely to read the label (52 per cent) was the 55-64s. Regarding future habits, it appears that natural beauty is becoming more of a priority for many women, with 39 per cent of participants claiming they will buy more all-natural beauty products in the next two years than they currently do. Millennials aged 18-34 are the most likely to spend more on all-natural beauty products in the next two years, with half of them claiming they will. This is compared to 44% of women aged 35-44, 34% of women aged 55-64, 31% of women aged 45-54 and 30% of women aged 65-plus. When asked how important it was to purchase all-natural products among particular beauty categories, skin care came out on top, with 54% of women claiming it is important their skin care product purchases are all natural. This was followed by all-natural hair care at 49%, makeup at 40%, fragrance at 31% and nail care products at 26%. A recent ""Natural Personal Care Global Series"" survey by market research company Kline found that the natural cosmetics market grew by 10.6 per cent between 2013 and 2014. Earlier this year a Nielsen survey found that 46 per cent of participants would be willing to pay more for a beauty product that claimed to be ""all natural."""
Bubble nails: The next big trend for fall?,"""Bubble nails"" first appeared in the US a few years ago, but they have been getting serious Instagram attention in the last few weeks. Also referred to as ""hump nails"" (if they boast an elongated tip), the trend involves sculpting acrylic gel onto the nail to create a dome shape which is then filed down to create a short, square and very arched shape. Typically, the bubbles (or humps) are painted in bright bubble gum colours and adorned with glitter, shimmer or, in some cases, fake pearls and gems. One of the most prominent advocators of the trend on social media is Texas-based salon Nails By Ann, which regularly shows off its innovative decorative techniques for bubble nails. Bows, studs and plastic flowers are all added to the already weighty-looking extensions. Some nail fans have been going crazy for the look, with users such as @coco_datvirgo_bihh posting messages of support to the salon such as ""These are perfect #humpnails #bubblenails @nailsbyann I'm in love"". However, not all beauty lovers agree on this. User @shes_sharkastic said: ""Yall are seriously getting your nails done like this on purpose tho?! For real? Like, really? #bubblenails #humpnails #acrylicnails #grosstrends #thingsthatarentcute #nasty"" while @_aleko_okela_ took it even further, saying: ""These nails are absolutely disgusting. wth is a humpnail? like what can you do with these? Who would want this on their hands? Who even thought to try this? I can't even! #ICantEven #humpnails"". One nail artist, @kbfancy_wancy, even posted a message asking clients to stop requesting the service, saying: ""Attention clients...oval, stilleto, square, coffin is the nail trend but DAnnG check out these bubble nails?! #won'tdothem #urexcusedtogoelsewhere #gumballs"" ."
Beauty's digital pure plays go physical on the U.S. retail market,"Birchbox, the pioneer of online subscription sampling, opened its first physical store in New York City in 2014, followed by its first holiday pop-up shop for men later in the year. The firm has also teamed up with Gap to bring Birchbox to seven U.S. locations through pop-up shops and recently announced it plans the opening of two new stores in 2016. Similarly, Violet Grey, which offers edited beauty collections online, opened a store in Los Angeles, while Credo Beauty, an online natural beauty retailer, also opened its first physical location in San Francisco, hoping it will be the start of a chain and become a multichannel retailer, as Mademoiselle Bio did in France. ""The flurry of online retailers entering the physical world signifies yet another paradigm shift in beauty retailing,"" notes Karen Doskow, Director of Kline's Consumer Products practice. ""While everyone else has been flocking online, online pure plays are becoming physical. Omni-channel retailing strengthens both ways as retailers and marketers strive to offer channel agnostic consumers the convenience of shopping in physical stores and online."" Amazon, the behemoth of all virtual pure plays, has also begun to go physical. In February 2015, the company introduced its first staffed on-campus pick-up and drop-off service at Purdue University. Amazon has also leased space in New York City which could possibly become its first retail store, as reported by the Wall Street Journal in October 2014. According to Kline, technology is also playing a key role in transformation of the beauty-retailing environment. Many physical retailers are working to blend online and offline together through technological enhancements, such as diagnostics tools like Sephora Color IQ, augmented reality mirrors, such as the iMirror, and online tutorials. Beacon technology that informs shoppers of information and special offers when in stores is implemented by all types of physical retailers during 2014. Despite its rapid ascension, virtual channels account for only 8% of total U.S. beauty and personal care sales while physical stores account for the vast majority, according to the Beauty Retailing USA report [1]. ""This movement underscores the continued relevance of bricks and mortar in an increasingly digital world,"" concludes Doskow."
Clowns are the hottest new beauty inspiration according to new viral makeup trend,"""Clown contouring"" is the latest trend to take off in the beauty world, and though it might sound like a joke, it is a pretty effective makeup technique. The phenomenon started earlier in the summer when beauty blogger BellaDeLune posted a video to YouTube showing how an extreme-looking theatrical clown base of makeup could be blended into a subtly contoured look. Beauty lovers everywhere have since pounced on the idea and women all over the world are now testing it out and showing off the results on Instagram. The process requires setting out triangular panels with 'teardrops' under the eyes, before adding a bold circle of bright pink blush and crudely over exaggerating the lip area. It started out as a bit of fun, but the idea comes from a poignant place. ""Even though you don't need this amount of makeup or any makeup at all to look beautiful, let's face it, makeup is fun and it's a way of expressing yourself,"" explains BellaDeLune in her video. She adds: ""I cannot tell you how many times I've been called a clown and been called many other names and been hated on because of the way that I use this art form."" Clown contouring sees classic highlighting and contouring techniques used on the nose and forehead, while wackier touches including recreating a poop emoji on your face which is then blended away, keeping things tongue in cheek. The fun has rolled over onto Instagram, where women have been posting videos and pictures of their own attempts — some serious and others less so. But Belladelune has started something, and several tutorials have cropped up on YouTube ever since her original post, including a step-by-step serious instruction film by SmashinBeauty and one by makeup artist Wayne Goss demonstrating the effect on men. Bustle has also posted a hilarious video of its editors trying out the look on themselves. Whether this trend is here to stay or not remains to be seen, but it's good to remember that when it comes to beauty, a little clowning around never hurt anyone."
Point Parfums Digital: Towards the uberization of distribution?,"The idea of distributing perfume or cosmetic samples, or even products in their standard sizes via automated machines is not new. Various concepts have already been tested with more or less success. However, Point Parfums Digital intends to go much farther by creating a link between the physical and digital worlds, thanks to a concept involving a kiosk protected by a world patent. And it seems the start-up is not the only one thinking about it. ""Since a tiny part of our capital (2,000 actions for 2.52 million) was listed on the Euronext Paris Free Market in early June, we have been approached by several distributors and brands,"" declares Patrick Tardif, founder and Director of the company. ""It is still a unique concept, as it makes it possible to smell a fragrance freely, buy a sample for 1 to 4 euros, and then be reimbursed for it and/or buy the bottle chosen online via the QR code on the packaging"", explains Patrick Tardif, who sees this innovation as the perfect example of how the digital world's assets can be efficiently integrated into physical locations. The now famous phygital retail concept is getting both brands and distributors enthusiastic. Patrick Tardif is well-known in the small world of French perfumery. In 1991, he created Process Blue, which quickly became the first franchise network of selective perfumery in France with 120 stores, before being purchased by Nocibé in 2000. He knows distribution very well and is convinced the selective distribution agreement in its current form will not withstand the expiry of the exemption regulation in 2022. ""Almost 1,400 new fragrances are launched internationally every year, which means several billion samples are distributed, but they miss their targets much too often, because distributors used them for something they were not meant for. Starting from a certain amount of money spent, the samples end up at the bottom of bags without any target, or without customers being asked whether they are interested in such or such product."" The Point Parfums Digital concept was tested on more than 45,000 consumers with brands like Azzaro, Clarins, Thierry Mugler, or Paco Rabanne, but also with very little-known brands on the French market. In the end, the conversion rate varied from 12 to 40% depending on the fragrance and location. ""Consumers want to smell perfumes before they buy them, because the scent is the main reason they will actually make a purchase. That is why online selling is doing poorly in perfumery. We offer brands an economical solution to get them closer to customers, and we offer customers a quick, convenient solution to test products and make purchases,"" Patrick Tardif emphasizes. ""Today, luxury is also being able to make customers gain time."" On top of it all, Point Parfums Digital boasts about offering manufacturers, brands, or distributors a cheap means – by comparison with the cost of a store – to reach customers. Indeed, the Point Parfums Digital automated kiosks fitted with touch screens only occupy a maximum area of 0.25m2. They can be installed as stand-alone machines or in groups of two, three, four, six, or even twelve in any passageway: commercial galleries, cinemas, train stations, subways… The company has already signed agreements with shopping mall lessors to implant its terminals in almost 200 places in France. And yet, today it intends to go much farther. ""There are 25,000 shopping malls around the world, not even counting airports,"" underlines Patrick Tardif, who is no longer just focusing on France. ""The success we knew when we got listed on the stock exchange, and the fact that we have been spontaneously approached since then made us rethink our strategy."" In short, with an increase in value of approximately 9 million euros (given the value of the securities currently listed) and a strong interest from major players of the industry and distribution, Point Parfums Digital has developed broader ambitions than the 3 million euros first intended to be raised to spread across France. ""We are three years ahead of our competitors. It is enough to start industrializing our concept and consider creating the first global network for perfume distribution,"" he claims. Therefore, the idea is to approach a group that will be able to develop the concept on the global level over a period of about ten years. As a matter of fact, Patrick Tardif has given an exclusive mandate to NFinance Securities to receive bids. ""Can you imagine the commercial potential of 20,000 terminals connecting consumers to online stores?"" As pure players like Amazon, eBay, Cdiscount, NET-A-PORTER.COM, or vente-privee.com are taking a keen interest in perfumes and cosmetics, and while brands are trying to increase their points of contact with consumers, this new concept might actually quickly revolutionize the way numerous perfume brands are sold!"
"""Skincare and perfumery drive the new dynamics of Beyond Beauty Paris,"" Claudia Bonfiglioli, Informa","Premium Beauty News - You have recently taken control of Beyond Beauty Paris with a renewed team and the ambition to revive the event. What is your diagnosis on the show's positioning? Claudia Bonfiglioli - When I joined the Informa Group in September 2014, I aimed at developing the Informa Beauty Division on the global level. After six months in Shanghai and the huge success of China Beauty Expo, I was able to see the European market from a new perspective and understand the weaknesses of the show's positioning over the past few years. There is an obvious need for renewal, which is why we decided to give it a stronger identity driven by two major sectors, Skincare and Perfumery, endow it with new dynamics, and renew with its DNA, which is mainly composed of beauty trends and innovation. Beyond Beauty Paris is the first show after summer, so it enables professionals to get back into the swing of things, discover new trends, get familiar with the new emerging currents, find different sources of inspiration, feel influences… It is an important event! Premium Beauty News - You have taken on several issues at the same time: a more dynamic programme of conferences, an emphasis on beauty trends… How is this going to take shape along with the usual Zoom and Beyond Beauty Lab? Claudia Bonfiglioli – The Zoom, our launching platform for emerging brands, and the Beyond Beauty Lab, whose theme will be Skin & Environment in 2015, are highly attractive and perennial areas, so they are obviously still part of the picture. In addition, as part of our renewal process, we must provide both the public and exhibitors with new highlights to complete the show's existing offer. Our programme of conferences – the Beyond Beauty Talks – has been reinvented! We have introduced a new branding to go back to the Beyond Beauty origins and opted for a more dynamic composition: on top of the traditional 45-minute conferences, masterclass series and round tables will be integrated into a programme that is already rich, and which is designed to enhance reflection, trigger debates, and make visitors take part in exchanges with all beauty players. It will be an opportunity to discuss topics like the new connected generation, the arrival of new pharmacy players and experts of galenics, the flood of home devices and connected objects, the reinforced presence of emerging markets, not only as players, but also consumers, the influence of Asia in the Western world… and all this in the presence of great names like Clinique, Erborian, Ioma, Chanel, BASF, L'Oréal, HEC Paris, and many others. As for trends, they represent the main thread of this 2015 edition, as can be seen with our exhibitors' products and services, our Talks, but also the new Beyond Beauty Trends area gathering styling and trends agencies like Peclers and Centdegrés. Premium Beauty News - The launching of Beyond Beauty Fragrance is another key element of the new Beyond Beauty Paris. How will the perfumery area be organized? Claudia Bonfiglioli – This year, it seemed essential to us that the perfume industry needed to be better represented, as it is little, or not evoked at all on French professional shows. Creating the Beyond Beauty Fragrance area was mainly a response to the rare perfume market, which achieved a 160 million euro turnover in 2011. The segment increased threefold in only ten years! The show will thus give the opportunity to this exceptional perfumery sector to express itself through various highlights: first, a dedicated exhibition area in the presence of about twenty niche brands, but also two masterclass days focused on artistic perfumery, a large round table with Thomas Fontaine, from Jean-Louis Scherrer and Patou, and lastly, an olfactory tour. We are very honoured to have been able to set up this project in partnership with Marie Huet and Johann Vitrey [2] and with the support of the Comité Joséphine. So, to start afresh after summer holidays, Beyond Beauty will offer a real odyssey in honour of auteur perfumery, and we are happy to organize the very first rare perfume meeting in Paris! Premium Beauty News - What about Creative Beauty, the part of the show dedicated to suppliers? Claudia Bonfiglioli - The area dedicated to the upstream part of the industry will definitely have its own place on the show! Ingredient and raw material suppliers, packaging and conditioning companies, formulators, private labels and OEMs, service providers for companies… they have all accepted the invitation. Exhibitors like B.Kolormakeup, Capsum, Baralan, Lablabo, Laboratoires Alpol, SICAF Laboratoires, Euro Vetrocap, and others will showcase their innovations and new expertise for major cosmetics groups and manufacturers to find inspiring ideas, new technologies and solutions to develop their product ranges. Premium Beauty News - In short, how would you define this new Beyond Beauty Paris show? Claudia Bonfiglioli – This year, Beyond Beauty Paris will mix trends and innovation with a 360° vision: from manufacturers to end users, from Europe to Asia, and from brands to suppliers. Our exhibitor offer and our programme of conferences complement each other, so visitors will be provided with a global vision of what the beauty world will have to offer tomorrow. But this new Beyond Beauty Paris has also taken a new direction towards the world of Perfumes…"
Survey: The top ten beauty trends of the decade according to British women,"The British Association of Beauty Therapists and Cosmetology (BABTAC) survey revealed that women in the UK think defined brows are the most stylish beauty look of the past decade, confirming several previous market analyses showing the importance of this trend. Stars including UK supermodel Cara Delevingne and US actress Camilla Belle have championed the trend and sparked brow envy among beauty lovers. Contouring, a makeup technique made famous by reality TV star Kim Kardashian, was deemed the number two trend. The concept uses foundations and concealers of differing shades to subtly sculpt the face by enhancing features such as lips and cheekbones, while 'slimming' other features such as the nose. Dark 'berry' lips claimed third place in the survey, with the Nineties-style look proving popular with beauty lovers today. This was followed by the classic red lip look, with smokey eyes proving to be the fifth most popular trend. Other looks that made the top 10 list include winged eyeliner, glossy lips, nude lips and drawn-on beauty spots. The least popular trend at number 10 was the natural look. A total of 2,844 British women aged 18-73 took part in the survey, with the majority claiming to have learned the techniques through trial and error. More than half confessed to watching YouTube tutorials online to improve their skills. This probably explains the success makeup sessions proposed by many brands and retailers. Here is a full breakdown of the most popular UK beauty looks of the last 10 years: 1. Heavy eyebrows 2. Contouring 3. Dark 'Berry' Lips 4. Pin-up red lips 5. Smokey eyes 6. Winged eyeliner 7. Glossy lips 8. Nude lips 9. Penciled beauty spots 10. Natural look"
Digitally-influenced sales to reach US$2.2 trillion by year-end,"Digital interactions are expected to influence 64 cents of every dollar spent in retail stores in the United States by the end of 2015, or US$2.2 trillion, according to Deloitte Digital's latest study, ""Navigating the New Digital Divide."" This figure has grown considerably from 14 cents of each dollar spent in brick-and-mortar stores in 2012, the first year Deloitte Digital conducted the annual study. A major shift that Cosmetics Europe President, Loïc Armand, recently pointed as a ""a real change of paradigm"". Deloitte Digital defines ""digital influence"" as the percentage of traditional brick-and-mortar retail sales impacted by shoppers' use of digital devices. Deloitte Digital has also identified a growing digital divide where consumers' digital behaviours and retailers' ability to deliver on those consumer expectations continue to diverge. ""Retailers often use the wrong metric–e-commerce sales–to indicate whether their digital strategy is working,"" says Kasey Lobaugh, principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP and Deloitte Digital's chief retail innovation officer. ""Last year, e-commerce sales represented US$300 billion, or just seven per cent, of total retail sales, while digitally-influenced store sales were over five times higher. Retailers that prioritize and design digital functionality with the sole purpose of driving sales in the e-commerce channel marginalize the consumer experience and risk ceding authority to competitors."" While the upward trend in overall digital usage has accelerated, this year's study uncovered dramatic new behaviours. Among consumers who use digital devices to shop: – Mobile influence is up, but price checking is down. Actually, consumers are advancing in their sophistication-using mobile more often for inspiration and idea generation earlier in their shopping process, and not simply as a price comparison vehicle. – Digitally-influenced consumers buy more and spend more. Consumers who use digital while they shop convert at a 20 per cent higher rate compared to those who do not use such devices. Consumers that access social media during the shopping process are four times more likely to spend more, and almost one-third (29 per cent) of those surveyed are more likely to make a purchase the same day they turn to social media before or during their shopping trip. – Not all categories are equal. Digital behaviour has evolved across all categories, most notably baby/toddler and home furnishings. – Consumers are hunters, not gatherers, once they arrive at the store. Nearly 8 in 10 consumers (76 per cent) surveyed interact with brands or products before arriving at the store. Shoppers now make buying decisions at other points, and even make purchases online to pick up in store. ""Retailers that fail to measure the influence of digital along the entire path to purchase can miss key indicators of performance and customer behaviour. Retailers should focus on designing and building customer experiences that play to how their customers are shopping for their products - rather than direct consumers to the point of purchase if what they really seek is inspiration or information,"" concludes Jeff Simpson, director, Deloitte Consulting LLP and co-author of the study."
Lipstick shade preferences around the world,"Heathrow Airport has just teamed up with World Duty Free - one of Europe's leading travel retailers - to release its first ""International Lipstick Colors of the Year"" report, lifting the lid on beauty trends in the world's 50 most stylish destinations, from Moscow to Sao Paulo, through London, Paris and New York. The variety of the results is somewhat surprising. In London, for example, the colour du jour is ""Caramel Nude"" — the linchpin of the city's easy-going makeup vibe (think off-duty model). Beauty lovers in the UK capital team their lippy with a strong, groomed brow and a flush of bronzer, with lightly tousled hair. The key is to not look like you've tried too hard. Things couldn't be more different over the pond in New York, where, according to the report, the classic ""Bright Red"" lip is still going strong. Polished, sassy and iconic, this is a look that women in the Big Apple are 'dressing down' with low-key eyes and a sleek blow-dry. Glamorous Dubai calls for a sultry feminine aesthetic — which explains the popularity of ""Rose Pink"" in the UAE. Inspired by recent catwalk looks from Tom Ford and Yves Saint Laurent, this colour can easily be vamped up with a smudgy dark eye and big hair for extra attitude. Asian skins require a slightly different hue, so it's no surprise that ""Sheer Coral"" is the most popular lipstick shade for travellers going to Shanghai. Makeup fans out East are wearing this look with a bold cat eye and a stripe of bright colour underneath the bottom lashes. Finally it's over to Paris, where the low-key London approach is being given a French twist in the form of ""Dusky Rose"" lipstick. Parisian women, who hate to look too made up, are rocking this feminine shade with just a dot of blusher and beautifully clear skin. To see download the report and see the most popular lipstick colours for travellers to the full 50 destinations, see here."
The European cosmetics and personal care market shows signs of recovery,"The European cosmetics industry has returned to growth in 2014, with sales rising by +0.5% in value, according to figures from Cosmetics Europe, compared to a decrease of 1.4% in 2013. The European market retail size [1] is thus equivalent to 72.5 billion euros total, about one third of the global market. Germany remains the main market in Europe (13,12 billion euros), followed by France (10,58 billion euros), the United Kingdom (10,40 billion euros) and Italy (9,39 billion euros). However, the four major European markets have recorded contrasted performances in 2014. While the United Kingdom grew by 5.3%, growth in Germany was limited to 1.6% and that of France to 0, 1%. By contrast, Italy remained in recession (-1.4%), as well as Spain (-1.3%). With the exception of hair care products (-0.2%) all product categories have risen in value, with colour cosmetics (+ 1.2%) and toiletries (+ 1.3%) being the most dynamic. Skin care and toiletries remain the most important product categories in Europe, followed by hair care and fragrances. Eventually, regarding external trade, France remains the largest exporter of cosmetics, well ahead of Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. According to Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics and personal care industry employs approximately 1,700,000 people including 25,000 scientists. Over the past five years, the industry has been able to grow direct and indirect employment by 2.3% or more than 39.000 workplaces."
"Well-being, good looks: comparative views on the latest beauty and food trends","Premium Beauty News - It seems beauty is being redefined, and well-being and vitality are playing an increasingly significant role in determining what is desirable and sexy. Leila Rochet-Podvin - Today, more than ever, beauty is a passport in contemporary life, as shown with the more and more narcissistic development of society, where self-image gets shared online, in particular among ""digital natives"". However, good looks are now intimately linked with well-being. Beauty is no longer only superficial, it is transcended. The new Grail is the naturally beautiful, healthy beauty, which is becoming the new definition of glamour. This can be seen with the boom of ""wellness gurus"" (Chico Shigeta in Japan, Henri Chenot in Italy, Dr Howard Murad in the United States) and new rising icons, the ""healthy stars"" that are now very regularly followed on social networks (Erin Heatherton, a yoga enthusiast, Jessica Alba, creator of The Honest Company, Gwyneth Paltrow, author of ""All is good"" and blogger for Goop, Elle Macpherson, creator of the new Super Elixir, a wellness supplement…). Béatrice de Reynal - More and more women and men know that what they eat, live, move… can be read on their skins and faces, but also in the way they move and are. Beauty is becoming holistic. It is the synthesis of a nutritional balance, a certain quality of life, food, skincare, and physical, intellectual, and spiritual activity… Beauty is the living part of our bodies: it can be seen, worked on, modulated, magnified. Premium Beauty News - You have identified no less than six trends categorized under three main themes: anti-industry, neo-industry, supra-industry. Is this the relationship with industrial modernity that best defines new consumption attitudes? Leila Rochet-Podvin – It is the age of hyperconnection and uncertainty about our (economic and global) world. Former (vertical, rigid, standardized) consumption patterns are changing. Consumers are turning more evanescent, polymorphous, and paradoxical – they have been revolutionizing the way they consume. So, we have defined three main trends to classify the changes in our industrial model, which are common to the food and beauty worlds: 1/ ANTI-INDUSTRY (by contrast with the mass model: it corresponds to a reinvention of the world around purity, nostalgia, and frugality) 2/NEO-INDUSTRY (which draws from the advantages of modern society to offer us more, for a more nomadic, YOLO – You Only Live Once – consumption model) and 3/ SUPRA-INDUSTRY (a more scientific, predictive, or even integrative trend, thanks to the power of new technologies, which also makes room for human beings). Béatrice de Reynal - However, paradoxically, nutrition and skincare are gradually becoming hypertechnical, ultra-sophisticated, extremely powerful, and all modern technologies like connector or scientific technologies, genetics, metabolomics, electronics and others are used to preserve and display the naturalness in each and every one of us. Premium Beauty News - You have wished to emphasize the synergies between nutrition and cosmetics in particular. This can be seen with active ingredients, but what about finished products? Leila Rochet-Podvin - Today, beauty, health, and well-being are intimately related, and we feed our bodies the same way we feed our skins. When a young woman is asked what is most important to have a beautiful skin, she answers ""drink water!"" first. Béatrice de Reynal - Our skin mirrors our health: it is an open book on our health, but also our personality, doubts and moods… Nourishing our beauty from the inside is an art that requires instinct, but also know-how. Premium Beauty News - On the contrary, the boundaries between the various universes are more rigid at the regulatory level. There is no legal definition of cosmeto-food, for example. What are the consequences? Katia Merten-Lentz - Law is quite ""rigid"" by nature. It evolves slowly, once professionals are already well-advanced on innovations and have set the tone for a new current. No doubt this is what will happen with cosmeto-food, if the trend gets confirmed. To this day, there is no legal definition of cosmeto-food: it is a bit like ten years ago, when we started talking about functional foodstuffs. However, the sector is regulated by the food's legal framework (labelling, advertising, and claims). And yet, significant areas of uncertainty remain as regards the way the EFSA reacted to the first marketing authorization applications for cosmeto claims… scientific demonstrations are going to have to be VERY solid! Premium Beauty News - Within this context, you are encouraging brands to be bold and give meaning to their products. Leila Rochet-Podvin - First, we invite brands to view things from a wider perspective, rather than just consider their own market and competitive sphere. Consumers are not split up like our industry. We should not stay stuck in our own worlds! What is occurring in the food sector has strong implications in the beauty world and should no longer be ignored. Besides, we are living in a great era, where anything is possible. In addition to ethical values, consumers have never left as much room for boldness and creativity. The road is wide open for innovation! Béatrice de Reynal - Our stomachs are getting smaller shares. People eat less, but want to eat better: better for health, for beauty, for pleasure. Cosmeto-foods have now become reality, and we should not miss this opportunity to satisfy demanding consumers who want to have it all: beauty, good taste, and pleasure."
MakeUp in Paris opens Thursday with a record number of exhibitors,"In parallel to exhibitors, the number of pre-registered visitors also sharply grew to reach about 3,500 persons, according to the organisers, just six days before the show. ""This new 2015 edition promises to be a great time! Not only by the quality and variety of suppliers but also by the influx of requests to visitors from around the world,"" they said in a release.

Global UV nail gel market to reach US$ 59.31 million by 2020,"UV gel nails are artificial extensions worn on the fingertips, and they use ultraviolet light to cure the gel during the application process. Usually, the gel stays intact for minimum three weeks without chipping and gives a natural look. The UV nail gel market is projected to record a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% between 2015 and 2020, according to a recent report by Markets and Markets [1]. The global UV nail gel market is therefore expected to reach 59.31 million US dollars in 2020. North America dominated the global UV nail gel market in 2014 and accounted for over 53% of the market size, in terms of value, followed by Europe. In terms of individual countries, the market is dominated by U.S. on account of increased demand for innovative and efficient products, followed by the U.K.. The rest of the world is expected to witness the highest CAGR during the next five years due the low base effect. Brazil in particular should emerge as the world's fastest-growing UV nail gel market. However, Asia-Pacific - primarily driven by Japan and China - is expected to witness a prominent growth rate due to the increasing fashion awareness and increase in per capita income. According to the market research firm, the key factors driving the growth of UV nail gel market include: the growth of the nail care industry, advanced technology in fashion, affordability and durability, growth of U.S. nail industry, and preference of gel over acrylics. The efficiency and superior properties of UV nail gel also contribute to fuel the demand. However, restraints for UV nail gel markets are exposure to UV light, high competition from nail polish major players and use of acetone while removal of nail gels. Methacrylate is the most commonly consumed UV nail gel, accounting for 95% share of the total market size, in terms of value in 2014. Actually, the main utility of using UV nail gel is its durability, which is hardly possible without methacrylate. Methacrylate is followed by acrylate with a market share of 5% in the same year."
What are the assets of skincare brands in France and the USA?,"When asked about their main expectations regarding a skincare product, US consumers massively opt for moisturization. ""The US market appears less sophisticated compared to France or even China where specific treatments appear much demanded by consumers. In China, in particular, specific treatments are boosted by the success of stain removers and lightening products,"" said Philippe Jourdan, the founder and CEO of Promise Consulting Inc. Being an American brand is a definite asset in the US market, as local brands record higher scores on all criteria: brand value, awareness and market share. In France too, domestic brands record higher scores than foreign brands. The brand DNA is another important factor of success in the skincare market. Both in France and in the USA, skincare specialists (Clinique, Clarins) dominate the market. However, luxury brand Lancôme performs well on both sides of the Atlantic. As far as China is concern, luxury remains the most important factor of success, with Chanel, Estee Lauder Shiseido forming the top three. ""In the US market the importance of being a specialist is mainly based on two criteria: the awareness and image. In France, being a beauty specialist is also a plus in terms of awareness, but this is less true in terms of image. The advantage of specialization is therefore more fragile in France,"" highlights Philippe Jourdan. In the eye of consumers, the most important features are: texture, high quality and efficiency / value for rice are the key assets for skincare products. However, one can note the importance of femininity in China. In France, the importance of good value for price is emerging as an important asset. ""French women want efficiency, but not at any price,"" explains Philippe Jourdan. Eventually, while the investment in branding appears highly correlated with market share in the US, this is less true in France where expert brands post good performances in terms of sales but show lower scores in terms of image."
Small-size beauty products appeal to French consumers,"Skincare, fragrance or makeup: all prestige beauty categories are concerned by this French craze for compact formats. According to The NPD Group, there are three key factors to explain this success: the price (a small size perfume costs between 40 and 45 euros vs. an average 62 euros for a 50 ml), the travel size format is in line with the needs of modern life, and the possibility to give in to the temptation to test new products at a lower cost. As far as fragrances are concerned, both the perfumery classics and the most recent launches have adopted the new sized packaging, aiming at attracting greatest numbers. In 2014, sales of feminine fragrances in 21-30 ml bottles recorded a 1% increase in units when the overall market fell by 2%. The situation is similar for men's fragrances, with an increase of sales by 2% in units in 2014 for small formats while the whole segment decreased by 5% over the same period. ""Small size products allow to target different buyers, which are less loyal to brands and are looking for new products,"" highlights Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. ""This is a real lever for growth and the trend has been accelerating sharply in the first quarter 2015, with sales of women's fragrances in bottles of 30 ml and less growing by 8% while the 31-44 ml male fragrances generated a 10% surplus of units sold compared to last year."" Makeup items also ride this trend, which is probably fuelled by the success of beauty boxes in this sector. For instance, The NPD Group points out the success of makeup kits usually offering a number of trial size products. After a harsh period, 2-in-1 products are also making their come back with sales increasing by 59% in units in 2014. The small-size revolution is also underway in the premium anti-aging skincare category. According to The NPD Group, sales of 30 ml and less formats grew by 9%, both in units and in value in, 2014. ""It's a small segment within the entire anti-aging market (4% of units sold) but it has a high growth potential,"" concludes Mathilde Lion."
Natural and organic cosmetics appeal to Asian consumers,"Asia has one of the fastest growing markets for natural and organic cosmetics. According to market research firm Organic Monitor, sales revenues are projected to exceed 1 billion U.S. dollars in the coming years [1]. ""The largest market is in China,"" highlights Organic Monitor. ""In spite of many green brands boycotting the Chinese market, it remains the most prominent in Asia. High-end brands are coming into the Chinese market, attracted to the rising purchasing power of its consumers. Japan has the second largest market for natural and organic cosmetics in Asia."" With a broader definition of natural and organic cosmetics, Future Market Insights values sales of these products in ASEAN countries [2] only to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2014 and expects it to reach 4,4 billion U.S. dollars by 2020, reflecting a CAGR [3] of 9.5%, according to. ""The ASEAN organic cosmetics market is expected to account for nearly 6.6% of the global organic cosmetics market by 2020,"" says the company in a recent report [4]. Thailand and Indonesia, accounted for 53.8% of the ASEAN natural and organic cosmetics market in 2014. Thailand is expected to dominate the overall ASEAN Organic cosmetics market, accounting for 29.3% market share by 2020. However, Singapore is expected to record highest CAGR 9.8% followed by Malaysia. According to Organic Monitor, concept stores are the most important channel for natural and organic cosmetics. ""Many brands - Western and Asian - are opening stand-alone stores or salons for their brands. The American company Aveda is the frontrunner, operating concept salons across Asia. A growing number of Asian brands, such as Forest Essentials, are also investing in concept stores to raise visibility and awareness of their product ranges,"" explains the company. In the ASEAN, the franchise outlet is expected to post double-digit growth and emerge as the dominating distribution channel for natural and organic cosmetic products. According to Future Market Insights, Department stores are predicted to hold second position in terms of CAGR. As the market is taking off, Organic Monitor finds greenwashing a major challenge for natural and organic brands in Asia. ""Asia is rife with brands making false natural / organic marketing claims, with some placing fake logos and symbols on product packs. As a consequence, there is a high level of consumer confusion about natural and organic cosmetic ingredients. Marketing is another major hurdle, with many brands not effectively communicating their green credentials,"" points out Organic Monitor. As a consequence, standards are becoming increasingly important, with a growing number of brands taking the certification route and many organic retailers requesting certification to 'legitimise' marketing claims of brands. According to Organic Monitor, Ecocert standards are the most popular, having the highest adoption rate amongst Asian brands."
Global consumer confidence increases in 2015,"Global consumer confidence was up during the first quarter of 2015, according to the Nielsen Global Survey of Consumer Confidence and Spending Intentions [1]. ""While confidence across global regions remained relatively stable in the first quarter, there is considerable variation across different markets,"" said Louise Keely, senior vice president, Nielsen, and president, The Demand Institute. ""In the first quarter of this year, the key emerging markets of Brazil and Russia saw large declines in confidence for the second consecutive quarter, with the drop in oil prices and the political instability in Brazil. China dropped another index point at the start of this year, which comes after a four-point decline in the previous quarter, reflecting the recent slowdown in GDP there."" Confidence increased slightly or remained stable in every region except Latin America. For instance, consumer confidence remained steady in North America (106) and increased one point in Asia-Pacific, posting the highest quarterly regional index score of 107. Confidence in the Middle East/Africa (96) and Europe (77) edged up one point in the first quarter, but decreased two points in Latin America (86) - the region's lowest score since 2011. However, global discretionary spending intentions declined or remained steady in the first quarter across all lifestyle categories measured. About three-in-10 global respondents (32%) planned to spend on holidays/vacations, new clothes (31%) and out-of-home entertainment (28%), quarterly declines of two, three and two percentage points, respectively. Global saving intentions, on the other hand, showed a slight increase from fourth-quarter 2014. About half of global respondents planned to bank their spare cash (48%). U.S. consumer confidence increased slightly in the first quarter, mainly driven by increased optimism regarding job prospects, while personal finance sentiment and immediate spending intentions declined. In Canada, confidence declined to reach the country's lowest score since 2012. Europe remained the least optimistic region globally, but there were several signs that green shoots were sprouting. Job confidence rose in 15 of 32 markets, while respondent's personal financial outlook increased in 18 from fourth-quarter 2014. Confidence for immediate spending intentions, while still comparatively low, increased in 19 markets. Italy and Greece, two of the regions debt-ridden and recession-battered countries, both showed confidence increases of 12-points in the first quarter. Italy's score of 57 was the highest for the country since 2011, and Greece posted a confidence reading of 65 - its highest level since 2009. In the region, only Germany (100) and Denmark (106) reached the optimism baseline level. They were also the only two countries in the region where half (50%) of respondents were confident about immediate spending intentions. Several other countries posted their highest confidence scores in several years: The U.K.'s score of 97 reached the highest level since 2006; Ireland (92) reached its highest since 2008, Spain (67) reached its highest since 2010, and Portugal (59) reached its highest since 2006. Conversely, ongoing geopolitical tensions between Russia and the Ukraine likely contributed to new confidence lows reported in these countries. Russia's index fell for the second consecutive quarter to 72, a level lower than its confidence reading at the height of the Great Recession, and the Ukraine's score dropped 11 points to 41 in the first quarter."
"Beauty devices still have room for growth in the U.S. but face many challenges, says Mintel","US women are most likely to associate cleansing (44%) and exfoliating (55%) benefits with skincare devices, as opposed to topical skincare products. However, while innovation around lower-priced items continues, many devices remain out of reach for the average female consumer, according to Mintel latest report on beauty devices in the USA [1]. Current users of skincare devices skew young, particularly for cleansing brushes which are most popular among US women age 18-24 due to several factors including skin needs (i.e. oily, more acne prone) and a general tendency to be more engaged in the beauty category. As may be expected, household income is a significant category driver, with those in the US$75K+ groups reporting above average usage of skincare devices. Across the board women agree that price remains a significant barrier when it comes to purchasing a skincare device. While innovation continues around lower-priced devices, many are still priced higher than the optimal price range for women (around US$50), according to Mintel data. More encouraging for the industry is that skincare devices have a broader audience among women who are interested in trying out new products, suggesting that the device market has room to grow. Incidence of skincare devices is low, with only a small percentage of women reporting usage across devices. For example, 6% of women have used a laser device and only four per cent have used an airbrush makeup applicator in the last year. Cleansing brushes generate the highest usage rates with 13% of US women stating they have used a sonic cleansing brush in the last year. While trial is low, interest in skincare devices is strong. Consistent with higher usage and awareness, both sonic (34%) and rotating (33%) cleansing brushes generate some of the highest levels of interest. Interestingly, despite very low usage, skin massagers produce the strongest interest among women with 36%. Outside of replacement (49%), cleansing brush users are motivated to purchase new devices by a variety of factors including special offers (28%), reviews (28%) and family/friend recommendations (26%). When asked what the top reasons for purchasing a beauty care device, 36% of US women referenced trying a product out and liking the results, while 30% were impressed with product results on someone they know. While women are seeking information, the in-store experience also remains important. Regardless of product type, skincare device shoppers are most likely to cite mass merchandisers as their top destination for beauty devices (55%). Online retailers are also a popular choice for 35% of beauty product shoppers, while 13% prefer to browse beauty products online and buy in-store, according to Mintel data. The next evolutions in skincare devices are coming in the form of technology and products that promise new benefits. According to Mintel Trend Second Skin, wearable technology is going beyond allowing consumers to be hands-free, it's helping people to monitor their health, and even maintain their appearance. ""We're seeing innovation in the category in two specific areas: tech and benefits claims. The latest innovations in skincare devices include mobile apps, smart devices and wearable technology, including cleansing brushes with a microchip that adjusts speed and cleansing time based on the user's skin needs and an iPhone-connected device that uses transdermal skin imaging to develop a customized skincare routine,"" explains Shannon Romanowski, Senior Beauty & Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. ""For consumers looking to target specific skincare needs, innovation comes in the form of benefit claims like wrinkle reduction or hair removal,"" she adds."
"""Customers in the Middle East are demanding, very connected, always seeking novelty"", Antoine Joujou, Chalhoub Group","Premium Beauty News - How is your Perfume-Cosmetics business doing in the Middle East? Antoine Joujou - The beauty sector represents 47% of our activity. It is a real growth driver on this market. Since the local population usually wears traditional clothes, makeup and perfumes are used to differentiate oneself, and people pay particular attention to them. The group is specialized in three fields, fashion, lifestyle and beauty, the latter being the most flourishing sector for us. This market has a huge potential in the Gulf countries, as it showed an 8.8% growth between 2013 and 2014 – and it is keeping up the pace. The main local consumers spend between 400 and 500 dollars per month on average on beauty products, and about 1,100 dollars per month on oriental perfumes, bakhoor oriental oils, and Western perfumes. Premium Beauty News – What growth has the Chalhoub group achieved on this market? Antoine Joujou - On the one hand, the Chalhoub group is the main distributor, with a very broad portfolio of international brands like Coty, Dior, or Puig; on the other hand, it works with retail stores such as Sephora and L'Occitane. It also invested in the creation of its own concept, Wojooh, which corresponds to local needs and aspirations. In 2014, Wojooh developed its own makeup line, ""Wow by Wojooh"", which is mainly dedicated to oriental women. The perfume and cosmetics activity of the group (Distribution + Retail) has been rising over the last few years, exceeding 10% per year. This year, we are expecting a strong growth, but less important than the previous years. Several factors contribute to the growth of the beauty sector on this market. Thanks to our research and development department, we constantly get relevant information about consumer trends and behaviour. This way, we can adapt our marketing strategies according to local consumers' tastes and aspirations. Premium Beauty News - And how is the market changing exactly? Antoine Joujou - Perfumes remain the key category in the Middle East, as they represent more than 64% of market shares. However, we did find a gradual change in the makeup segment, which has grown by more than 20%. This partly results from the dynamism of brands like Make Up Forever and Benefit, but also from retailer private labels, which offer very attractive ranges (Sephora, Wow by Wojooh). In addition, the nail, eyebrow, and complexion sectors are booming, although the fastest-growing segment has always been the eyes. Skincare is still a bit behind, but it does have some potential, thanks to innovation-enhancing brands like Clarins, Lancôme, Clinique, etc. Premium Beauty News - Why have you renamed your Beauty label? Antoine Joujou - We have changed the name of our Faces label for Wojooh, the literal translation of the word 'Faces', as it has always appeared on our logo, and it has always been used by our Saudi customers (our first market). This repositioning for Wojooh was part of a strategy to get closer to our customers and stand out against the competition. Our message is clear: we are proud of our roots, we are passionate about beauty, and most of all, we can provide beauty expertise in line with both our men and women customers' expectations. Premium Beauty News - You have created your own makeup line, Wow by Wojooh; according to which criteria was it developed? Antoine Joujou - Wow by Wojooh was launched in September 2014 after a two-year development process focused on finding the best type of product, texture, colours, and long-lastingness for the Middle East market. We wanted to meet the specific needs of this market and its very demanding women consumers. The brand is completely 'Made in Europe', for more credibility in terms of product quality. It has made a very promising start, and the Wow by Wojooh brand received a warm welcome from our customers, exclusively in our stores. Premium Beauty News - Have you found local brands have been developing, in particular on the perfume segment? Antoine Joujou - We have observed a craze for the perfumes that best suit local customs (oud, amber, musk): they have known a growing success over the past few years. The offering is both local (Hind Al Oud, Designer Shaik, Khaltat…) and international, with more intense lines and private collections that prove very popular with our customers (Gucci, Armani, Givenchy, YSL…). Premium Beauty News - Have Western brands changed their approach? Have you noticed any effort to adapt, and with which priorities? Antoine Joujou - Indeed, brands are now increasingly trying to attract customers from the Middle East. They really have to make the effort to adapt to this market if they want to penetrate it and arouse its interest. Adaptation must be done from a communication angle first, by complying with rites and bans (images censored, messages considered too suggestive). Then the offering must comprise more adapted perfumes and, lastly, the concept of stores and services must be unique to the region. Middle East customers are very demanding, very connected, always seeking novelty and exclusivity. This is all the more true for the beauty market. Premium Beauty News - Is there any room for new brands? Antoine Joujou - Yes, there is. Novelty is one of the most important criteria for Middle East consumers, so there is certainly enough room for new entrants. It remains to be determined how to get established over the long term, while gradually reinventing oneself to keep that 'novelty' factor alive. Premium Beauty News - Are you thinking about extending the presence of your Wojooh network to other markets? Antoine Joujou – We are actually trying to broaden our perspectives. We think we can benefit from the influence of the Middle East on a few emerging markets that share the same interests, tastes, or customs as the Middle East, and on which our concept would have more impact than a global chain."
The potential for growth in the MEA & Turkish beauty markets,"The Middle East is very complex and diverse, therefore posing significant challenges to beauty brands. Political and economic instability is one of the major obstacles to beauty sales growth in countries such as Syria and Egypt, although Saudi Arabia and Iran are thriving. According to marketing consultancy Butterfly London, which works with beauty brands in the Middle East, the population is young [1] and eager to try new brands, in particular international high-end ones, such as Chanel, Gucci and Dior. The premium segment accounts for 42% of sales in the Middle East, of which 42% is fragrance, haircare 25%, skincare 16% and make-up 16%. Andrea Visus, associate director, Butterfly London, commented on rise of the ""digital self,"" saying, ""Saudi girls love to express themselves on social media. They have several Facebook accounts and separate social networking profiles showing different personalised looks. They learn make-up tricks just so they can look good on Facebook."" Arabian men, too, tend to be extremely image conscious and a well groomed appearance denotes career success and social standing. Another aspect of consumer behaviour in the region is that traditions are strong and beauty secrets are passed from mother to daughter. As a result, staple products, such as bar soap, standard shampoos and toothpaste have high sales, according to Euromonitor in its analysis of the Middle East and Africa. Yet, it is the increasingly sophisticated youth demographic, growing urbanisation and the rise of the middle classes that is driving growth in premium fragrances and skincare. The MEA region has the lowest per capita spend globally on haircare at just $3 per annum. Euromonitor registered haircare sales growth of 11% in 2014 and the category represented 6% of the global market. The largest haircare market was Iran at $830m, followed by Turkey with $790m and Saudi Arabia, worth $650m. All witnessed double digit growth in 2014. Haircare sales in Israel were lower at $290m but its $36 per capita spend was the highest of any MEA country. Global brands from P&G and Unilever dominated sales value, though local brands were popular due to their lower price point. Conditioning and repair, oil/keratin and natural/organic/bio products were strong across all price bands. Halal cosmetics is a growth category, not only in the Middle East, but also in Europe, where Muslims account for 5-10% of the population. Halal certification requires adherence to the strict laws of Islam and there are many different Halal labels used across the world. For instance, there are five large Halal certifiers in Germany, and state based systems in Indonesia, Turkey and Iran, making it essential for brands to know their target market before launching Halal products."
The 20th edition of FCE Cosmetique highlights the Brazilian market dynamics,"Now representing the world's third largest cosmetics market, Brazil is banking on a continued growth of over 10% per year (+11.8% in 2014, according to the ABIHPEC), which could make it reach the second rank by 2020, behind the United States. However, the two-digit growth should be put into perspective, as the inflation has been quite significant for a while (+6.40% in 2014, and it might reach 7.5% in 2015, according to the IMF, before declining). According to the organizers, the two joint events gathered about 500 exhibitors, local and international ingredient, packaging, formulation, and tailor-made manufacturing suppliers, as well as industrial equipment manufacturers, whose presence illustrated both the innovation and trends presented to the 17,000 professional visitors expected. This edition highlighted the boom of several Brazilian players like Nanovetores, resulting from the craze for encapsulated actives on the market. The company is specialized in the encapsulation of natural actives in an aqueous environment, and came to introduce a wide range of ingredients and fragrances encapsulated in 200 to 300-nanometer particles designed to make it easier to apply face, body, and hair care products as well as textiles. As for sampling, the Brazilian company Adhespack showcased its new Self Sampling line, a whole set of automated sample distributors intended either for points-of-sale or event hosting. Then, the Arcade Beauty Group - created by the merger between Arcade and Bioplan - unveiled its new name and logo exclusively at FCE, as well as Proteo, a travel-size 50ml pack designed and developed in Brazil by Aptar. Arcade Beauty took care of the industrialization of the bag and filling. Once again this year, international tailor-made manufacturers took an active part in the event. Intercos and Weckerle were there, and Fareva Chromavis exhibited their new skincare line for the first time: Mystical Treatments is a series of formulas developed and produced to meet the specific needs of the Brazilian market. Among ingredient suppliers, Solabia, the French company established in Brazil, showcased its range of ingredients derived from the biomass of different Brazilian regions (Amazonia, Brazilian pampas, Cerrado, Mata Atlântica). And SEPPIC presented its brand new application laboratory dedicated to the Brazilian market. As the historical partner of FCE Cosmetique, the ABC (Associação Brasileira de Cosmetologia) jointly held its 28th Brazilian Congress of Cosmetology. Both professionals and scientists were able to spend the three days of the show discussing the main themes inherent to the technical developments of the industry: regulation-related issues, the increase in importance of the sun care segment, and the boom of nanotechnologies. Although it is challenged by the recent advent of specialized shows (In-cosmetics Brasil, MakeUp in Sao Paulo), FCE Cosmetique features all the segments of the industry and is to remain a key annual event for most Brazilian professionals. ""This event has a huge potential; it is relevant to the market and information on all levels is available here"", underlines Ligia Amorim, Managing Director of NürnbergMesse Brasil, the event organizer."
"Hair care: Sales in independent salons confirm the granny and co-washing trends, finds Kline","According to data from Kline PRO, a product-level database published quarterly by market research and consulting firm Kline in partnership with the Professional Beauty Association (PBA), hair colorant sales within the bright and silver shade groups are up 46% and 14%, respectively, in 2014. ""The 'granny trend' of women of all ages colouring their hair shades of silver and grey is more than a media craze,"" explains the market research firm. The Kline PRO's panel currently features about 1,000 independent salons and 8,500 chain salons. Kline said to plan to double the number of independent salons by the end of 2015, with the eventual goal being 3,000 independent salons. According to Kline, the data on independent salons is of particular interest to the industry's players, as this segment is harder to track and get a read on, yet is often the place where new brands and product trends appear first. Another trend validated by this data set is co-washing or ""conditioner-only washing"", which is the practice of cleansing one's hair with conditioner instead of shampoo. The purpose of co-washing is to preserve the natural oils of the hair while still gently cleansing. Data from the Kline PRO panel shows that the clarifying segment of conditioners - a type of conditioner that co-washers tend to prefer - has been growing exponentially. ""While still nascent and accounting for less than 1% of total conditioner sales in 2014, the clarifying segment posts the highest growth of all conditioner types in independent salons. Ouidad's Curl Co-Wash is among the leading items in the segment,"" highlights Kline. Functional hair care, or products that provide specific performance-oriented benefits like restoring hair or imparting shine, is another area where Kline PRO is reporting significant growth. In independent salons, products that address thinning hair increase by 22% in shampoos and 12% in conditioners in 2014. Nioxin, the leader within the thinning segment in the U.S., jumps 22% in shampoo sales. Sizable gains are likewise recorded by the Kevin Murphy Plumping line, ranking it third in dollar share in the thinning segment of both shampoos and conditioners. Other products contributing to growth in the functional hair care space include Pureology's Strengthcure in the repair/condition segment, the launch of Oribe Gold Lust Repair & Restore collection, and Redken's Blonde Idol and Color Extend lines in the colour care segment. Meanwhile, hair oils is an area that is losing some steam, with sales down 6% in chains and 5% in independents in 2014. Although the segment, which was pioneered by Moroccanoil, has reached maturity, some items experience rapid sales growth in 2014, including Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser's Invisible Oil, which triples in dollar volume."
"""We must determine the type of customer experience needed in the digital world"", William Koeberlé","Premium Beauty News - You have announced modernizing the selective distribution contract would be your priority throughout your mandate. What are your challenges? William Koeberlé - The regulation came into force in 2012 for a period of ten years, which takes us to 2022. It may seem far ahead, but one has to start working on it now, because it is the one element that structures our whole business. To me, the main challenge is customer experience: the same quality criteria must be satisfied online and in-store. Customers have already changed a lot compared to the time when we were discussing the current regulation, and they will keep changing a lot. The number of online buyers and customers that check websites before they buy in-store has significantly grown in five years. More than 70% of selective distribution customers use the Internet to get both information about products, prices and new launches, and advice, in particular via blogs. We have found that the more customers go online, the more they buy in-store and online. In addition, we have worked a lot with our suppliers to standardize product technical sheets, especially to homogenize the information available. The conditions are now in place for us to determine the type of customer experience needed in the digital world. How should products be presented online? How should the tips given on products be provided? If we do not work on this, the only variable will be the price, and we will destroy the dream created by our products. Premium Beauty News - The current regulation requires for an online retailer to also have at least one physical store to be accredited. Do you think this requirement is threatened? William Koeberlé - The question will inevitably be raised. To us, it is an important guarantee of service quality. Selective distribution provides products, but also advice, which means customers are listened to and can test products. But we have also found that customer behaviour changes very fast. Besides, the world of pure players is quite heterogeneous, and some of them are doing a good job. Our priority is to maintain the quality of customer experience, including on the web. As an example, the ""click&collect"" solution can be a very rich experience, if particular attention is paid to individuals, and personalized tips offered, when they pick up their orders from the store, or, by contrast, very poor and anonymous, if they have to collect their purchases from a box at a station. Hence the importance to define the criteria that will guarantee the quality of the buying experience in any circumstances. Premium Beauty News - You are saying the online customer experience is heterogeneous. But it seems selective distribution in Europe is very heterogeneous too! William Koeberlé - The level of the services supplied is not even, but it is quickly getting more uniform. One has to be aware of the fact that traditions vary a lot depending on the country; sometimes the drugstore-perfume shop background is extremely far from the French standards from which the regulation was inspired. But everyone is catching up with France. Moreover, brands contribute to this levelling upwards. By opening subsidiaries in most of the European countries that used to be entrusted to agents, they were able to control their distribution channels more easily. And it also allowed for a certain convergence in terms of selling prices. These changes were all the more essential since our customers travel more and more. Premium Beauty News - Your other main priority is training. William Koeberlé - Here is another key element of customer experience. Again, the fact that customer behaviour changes a lot is a real challenge! What can we offer to customers that already deeply searched the web before they came to the store? How can behaviour and point-of-sale digitization be integrated? It is important to go back to a ""training programme"" strategy, and maybe draw inspiration from the excellent results of apprenticeship and systems where school courses are combined with work experience in countries like Austria or Switzerland. Premium Beauty News - How do you think the market is going to evolve? William Koeberlé - In 2014, the French market declined (according to NPD) by 0.6% in value, and 4.2% in volume. But it should always be reminded that these figures neither take into account online sales, nor those achieved by private labels – although they are the ones that have risen the most. As for online sales, they have increased from 2% in 2008 to 5 or 10% today, depending on the brands. So, the market is actually showing some resistance, and is tending to grow in value, while remaining rather stable in volume, despite the arrival of new entrants like Kiko or textile brands, and the competition of players such as Yves Rocher or L'Occitane. Premium Beauty News - Don't you think prices have increased a bit too much in selective perfumery? William Koeberlé - The premium brands that have simultaneously increased their added value and prices are still growing in importance. They have managed to return to their DNAs, while reinventing their own codes and providing added value to their customers. Any rise must be justified by added value. However, the brands that were not able to do this, those that did not work or invest, but still increased their prices, are now bearing the brunt of the competition of private brands, whose offering has considerably widened, with very high quality ranges."
Hair care market shows healthy growth in the UK,"While the number of hair care products targeted at men has seen a sharp decline in the past year (-46% between 2013 and 2014 alone), new research from Mintel [1] has found that despite this, the men's hair care market is continuing to grow. Sales grew from £59 million in 2013 to a predicted £60 million in 2014 (USD 92 million or EUR 83 million). This healthy growth is expected to continue with value sales forecast to rise to £68 million in 2019. Long hair has been a mainstay in men's fashion and looks to remain. ""This trend has resulted in increased revenue for the sector and offers further opportunities for the men's hair care market to respond to changing fashions, with products designed to stimulate growth as well as manage longer hair. Styling brands could also offer tips and advice to encourage experimentation,"" said Roshida Khanom, Senior Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. However, when it comes to hair, the top three concerns amongst men is thinning hair, with over a quarter (27%) claiming this is a concern, whilst 24% say they're concerned about hair loss and one in five (17%) are worried about hair that is difficult to style. Highlighting these concerns, Mintel's research shows that when it comes to product innovation opportunities, a quarter (24%) would like to try products that stimulate hair growth, 23% would be interested in products that make hair easier to style, whilst one in five (21%) would be interested in products that thicken hair. ""Hair loss is a universal concern for men, although the reasons for being concerned about hair loss may be different. Younger men may find it harder to retain hairstyles, or experiment with different hairstyles as they lose hair. For older men, being concerned about hair loss may be more about not wanting to look older. Products that stimulate hair growth will therefore appeal to men of all ages,"" Roshida continues. When it comes to the women's hair care market, Mintel's research shows that consumers are trading up, with sales of prestige hair care products rising by 6% from £380 million in 2013 to £403 million in 2014 (USD 623 million or EUR 558 million). What's more, this has followed an increase in prestige product innovation with the proportion of new product launches with a prestige price point increasing to 29% in 2014 from 18% in 2013. Overall, the women's hair care market in the UK rose 2% in 2014 to £ 1.44 billion (USD 2,22 billion or EUR 2 billion), up from £ 1.41 billion in 2013. ""Women are willing to spend money on perceived better quality products. The growth in online retailers in particular is facilitating a move to more expensive products, as women use price comparison sites to find luxury products at reduced prices, sparking a 'spend money to save money' mentality,"" said Charlotte Libby, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. However, women are trading up to products with premium price points, the factors they feel have the biggest impact on appearance of hair it seems are primarily internal. Over half (57%) of UK women agreed that health, for example hormone levels, have a big impact in determining the appearance of hair, whilst a matching proportion (57%) said the same of diet, for example the consumption of fruit or vegetables or drinking enough water. In comparison, just a third (33%) agreed that the quality of ingredients found in hair care products had an important impact. ""Innovation in hair treatment claims can appeal to women looking to counteract and repair the effects of poor diet on the hair,"" Charlotte concludes."
"The first ""MakeUp in Action"" will take place in Los Angeles on 10 and 11 February 2016","A one day and a half event, articulated around conferences in the form of plenary sessions, focused on information, but also specialized workshops - real training sessions on all current key issues related to the make-up sector today - and finally, of course, high-level B2B meetings. ""An event, clearly, much awaited and even overwhelmingly supported by the entire professional make-up industry,"" highlighted officials at Beauteam. ""It's true that we had also strongly anticipated the move,"" explained Jean-Yves Bourgeois and Sandra Maguarian, ""by organizing some months ago, conferences at MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York, on the West Coast exception. A region, which has continued to prove in recent years, its dynamism and innovativeness. Truly a laboratory of its own, where startups have continued to flourish, to become major companies, eventually often acquired by large international groups. So much so, that a day does not go by without the opening of the sales office of a particular formulation company or a particular packaging manufacturer."" ""Four MakeUp in..., with a three-month interval: the formula looks consistent, efficient, inexpensive and convenient,"" highlighted Jean-Yves Bourgeois. ""And it is not about to change! On the other hand, there are other regions in the world that, one way or the other, prove their originality and dynamism in terms of research and developments. This make-up sector is anything but static. It is constantly evolving. The concept of MakeUp in Action is indeed the response matching this type of situation, with more than ever, this desire for exclusivity."" This first MakeUp in Action in Los Angeles should therefore reflect this hot bed of ideas and innovations that never stops on the West Coast. The exact venue and the full program will be announced in the next few days."
Distribution is key to the success of green brands,"In spite of high consumer interest, most sustainable products have low market share. For instance, natural products represent just 3% of personal care product sales in Europe. Organic foods generate 4% of total food sales in North America; the market share of ethical textiles and green household cleaning products is even lower in these regions, below 2%. According to Organic Monitor, a major factor behind the low market share is most green brands are focusing on specialist outlets. ""Few natural personal care products are in mass market retailers, whereas the channel generates over a third of cosmetic and toiletry sales in the US."" Green brands need to 'think outside' specialist retail channels if they are to broaden appeal. Aveda, for instance, has also been successful in the natural personal care industry because of its distribution strategy. Aveda is positioned as a professional hair care brand in salons and Organic Monitorresearch shows it is the premier brand of natural personal care products, with distribution in over 7,000 salons. A major challenge for green brands is channel selection: what outlets to focus on? To add complexity, the success of sustainable products in some channels creates competition. For instance, private labels marketed by mass retailers often 'cannabilise' branded product sales. Indeed, in many cases, the leading brands of organic products in North America are owned by retailers. In Europe, DM drugstores' Alverde has taken up high market share to become the leading private label of natural personal care products. Eventually, the complexities associated with distribution have led some green brands to set up their own retail networks. In the wake of The Body Shop, which pioneered the ethical retailer concept in the 1970s, a growing number of green brands such as Melvita and Korres are opening stores across the globe. Pioneering green brands / companies will be participating at upcoming 6th North American edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which will be hosted by Organic Monitor in New York on 14-16th May; they include Aveda, The Body Shop, Burt's Bees, Léa Nature, Hain Celestial, etc."
Over 60 year olds still have to be convinced by anti-ageing products,"The highest number of ""Later Lifers"" can be found in Asia Pacific, where in 2014 there were 508 million people over 60. Much of this can be attributed to China, which is the fastest growing ageing market with over 60s forecast to grow by more than 46 per cent between 2014 and 2030. Japan already has the oldest population, with a massive 33 per cent aged over 60. Japan is a model on the impact of this demographic shift. Western Europe also has a number of older populations, with Germany just overtaking Italy in 2014 in this regard. While most developed markets are relatively old, the US remains quite young, due to high levels of immigration. As far as beauty and cosmetic products are concerned, a range of socioeconomic indicators, including growth in the population and stable disposable income, highlights the growth opportunities that the over 60 year old consumer group offers. Although a growing number of claims from skin care, hair care, sun care and colour cosmetics target signs of ageing, Euromonitor's survey found that in the over 60 year old age group, bigger proportions of consumers use facial and body moisturisers without explicit anti-ageing claims. Only about 35 per cent of respondents on a global level stated that they used anti-ageing products in the three months prior to the survey. According to Euromonitor, there are gaps in the anti-agers market to address certain signs of ageing. ""Anti-ageing portfolios need to clearly segment the prevention / protection stages to target more mature consumers' needs through reversing the signs of ageing and offering cell renewal properties, as, for example, L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renew Night Cream has done."" Furthermore, only about one third of over 60 year olds have adopted a complex anti-ageing routine, and there is significant room to expand usage frequency in this growing and relative affluent consumer base.

"Skin care, Brazil and Asia drive the global cosmetics market, finds Euromonitor","The beauty industry remained largely resistant to strong economic and political headwinds, generating US $465 billion in sales in 2014, according to Euromonitor International latest data. With 5 per cent growth, the global market saw continued penetration of staple products in emerging markets, consumers upgrading to more superior products and the adoption of more extensive beauty routines across all product segments. China and Brazil remain the most promising markets with absolute growth expected to exceed US $10 billion by 2019. However, strong growth is also expected in Indonesia and India, as well as in the United States and Saudi Arabia. Argentina, Iran, Mexico, Thailand and Turkey also show excellent prospects for further growth. Skin care remains the largest segment across most markets, with global sales expected to reach over US $ 130 billion by 2019. ""Of all beauty segments, consumers continue to spend most on skin care items at $15 per person annually, compared to US $10 for hair care and $7 for colour cosmetics,"" said Euromonitor International's Head of Beauty and Personal Care, Irina Barbalova. ""One third of global beauty revenues by 2019 will come from skin care, compared to 23 per cent between 2009 and 2014."" Asian markets remain the main growth driver for skincare products. According to Euromonitor, 80 per cent of global skin care revenue gains by 2019 will come from Asia, with China set to account for 75 per cent of the total regional absolute growth. "" Indonesia and India will be the next growth frontiers to watch, with Indonesia expected to enter the top 10 global skin care markets by 2019,"" added Barbalova. However, the skin care market is not only growing but also transforming in terms of product diversification and exploration of innovative growth concepts. According to Euromonitor, technological developments have encouraged a demand for personalisation and unique product engagement, and Asia continues to inspire innovation in terms of new formats, textures and product benefits."
Record attendance for the second edition of MakeUp in Seoul,"The organizers of the 2015 edition of the MakeUp in Seoul tradeshow can congratulate themselves! Their forecasts, based on pre-registered visitors were confirmed by reality. The tradeshow dedicated to the suppliers of makeup brands welcomed 2,300 visitors (+28% compared to 2014), with a very sharp increase in the number of international visitors coming not only from South-east Asia (including China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, The Philippines, Hong Kong, etc.) but also from Europe and the North and South American continents. ""MakeUp in Seoul has become in just two editions, ""THE"" international meeting of the Asian make-up industry,"" highlight the organisers, who were also extremely satisfied by the number of participants at the different conferences and round tables. ""All major Korean and international brands had answered the call, at the level of speakers but also in terms of audience,"" they add. Furthermore, on the occasion of this second edition of MakeUp in Seoul, a jury of experts awarded fourteen innovative products, which were presented to visitors during the two days of the show, hanging from the branches of a ""tree of innovation"" specially built for the occasion. Visitors entering the venue could not miss this tree, which set the tone of this second edition of MakeUp in Seoul. ""Innovation was the one expected at each stand and at the heart of meetings and conversations between professionals. They had all made the trip for that and were not disappointed. Innovation, which was expressed on all stands, be it in terms of formulas applicators, packaging or accessories,"" say the organizers. For the second consecutive year, the Amore Pacific Group, through one of its most prestigious brands, Hera, successfully organized its presence and animations at the heart of the show. Many international leading brands, both European and American, took advantage of the event to organize during the event and also at the event their R&D and marketing meetings. Because Korea has become in a few years ""the place to be"" not only in Asia but also in the world for a sector in search of innovative and quality products. During the cocktail organized on the evening of April 15, Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, the organisers of the event, did not fail to express their gratitude to the Korean people for ""their welcome, enthusiasm, and the support they provided these past two years in the setting up of what has established itself as ""The"" unmissable appointment in the Asian beauty industry."""
Anti-wrinkle creams increasingly target bright young things,"This week UK retailer Boots in-house brand No 7 is launching its new ""Early Defence Skincare"" range, which has been specially designed for women aged 20-35 who don't need to worry about anti-aging just yet, but wish to keep young skin looking younger for longer. Consisting of Day, Night and Eye Creams, the series has been designed as a 'stepping stone' to help in the transition from everyday skincare to proactively delaying the signs of ageing. It features the brand's patent-pending daily protection technology, 'Double Defence', which works in combination with UVA technology to protect skin from the sun and environmental stress. The technology contains a combination of ginseng and mulberry to combat superoxides produced as a result of exposure to sunlight or pollution, vitamin C and lipochroman and Vitamin E which are effective against singlet oxygen, an incredibly damaging free radical produced by UVA exposure. The creams also contain rice peptides and alfalfa, which are effective inhibitors of age-accelerating enzymes (MMPs) in the skin. ""Protecting your skin from the sun and environmental stress is really important, particularly if you want to proactively delay the signs of ageing,"" says Dr Mike Bell, Skincare Scientific Advisor for Boots UK. ""With Double Defence technology we have created a powerful and broad-spectrum antioxidant complex which has been designed to neutralize damaging free radicals that cause the skin oxidative stress, helping you to keep your skin looking younger for longer."" Women in their twenties and thirties are becoming an increasingly important target for beauty brands when it comes to anti-aging. L'Oreal Paris has proven that it's never too early to start protecting skin with its Youth Code range of night and day creams, aimed at women aged 25-35 who want youthful-looking skin. Additional launches in recent years aimed at the demographic include Shiseido's Ibuki range, designed to help skin resist the stresses of daily life, and Nuxe's Nirvanesque range of ""First wrinkle creams"" for a pre-emptive approach to anti-aging."
"In the digital era, sample remains the most effective enrolment driver","In order to make a picture of typical buyers of prestige beauty consumers, vente-privee chose to focus on brand loyalty behaviours. In March 2014, the ecommerce company therefore interviewed 6029 women aged 18-54 years, in France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. All of them were vente-privee customers who purchased prestige cosmetic products during the last 12 months. The survey revealed two main types of consumers: the ""brand ambassadors"", who are rather loyal to brands and to the same skin care and makeup products, and representing 29% of the sample, and the ""brand explorers"", 32 % of the sample, who are more interested in new products. Mixed profiles, sharing characteristics of the two main types represent 39% of women surveyed. ""There is no correlation between age belonging to one category or the other,"" said Catherine Spindler, Vente Privee's Marketing Director. ""Brand ambassadors tend to consume fewer products that brand explorers, and their purchasing behaviour is more thoughtful, while explorers are more impulsive,"" she added. The vente-privee survey also unveiled the central role now played by digital sources in consumer information. ""For the categories of consumers, digital is now the main source of information for getting information on prices, new products, and the opinions of other women,"" explained Catherine Spindler. Apart from purchasing, 85% of ""brand explorers"" and 76% ""brand ambassadors"" said they surfed the web in order to compare prices. Furthermore, 79% of ""brand explorers"" read the opinions written by other consumers, vs. 62% of "" brand ambassadors "". The behaviour of the two groups mainly differs in their choices regarding information sources. ""Ambassadors"" first head to the brands' websites (30% vs. 17%), while ""explorers"" prefer paying visits to communities (blogs, forums, tutorials, videos). Regarding enrolment drivers, the survey confirms the key role of samples: 71% of ""brand ambassadors"" and 77% of ""brand explorers"" say they would switch products after testing a sample that pleased them. ""Testing new products with samples is the first enrolment driver. Tests top consumers' preferences for all product categories,"" Catherine Spindler said. Furthermore, makeup appears to be the most effective enrolment driver for loyal consumers. Indeed, 42% of ""brand ambassadors"" declared they would accept to change nail polish (vs 58% of ""explorers"") but only 10% would be ready to change from day cream (vs 40% of ""explorers""). More generally, the ""explorers"" are very sensitive to innovation, they watch advertisements, read magazines and blogs, and discover new products through boxes (21%). The ""ambassadors"" are more sensitive to the brand and look for reinsurance. However, price is an important issue for all women. The ""explorers"" are very sensitive to promotions, but even the most loyal ""ambassadors"" would consider changing product if it becomes too expensive. Eventually, vente-privee highlights that the results were the same in the four European markets which were surveyed."
Brazilian cosmetics market grew by 11% in 2014,"With sales of R$ 101.7 billion (USD 32.5 billion or EUR 29.6 billion), the sector recorded a nominal growth of 11% in 2014, compared to R$ 91.9 billion in 2013. ""This performance is associated with important factors driving the country's industry such as investment in innovation and advertising,"" says João Carlos Basilio, President of the ABIHPEC. Brazil remains the world's third largest consumer market for toiletries, perfumes and cosmetics, behind the United States and China, and far ahead from Japan, which ranks fourth. The Brazilian personal care industry represents more than 1.8% of the country's GDP and 9.4% of the world's consumption. As far as Latin America is concerned, Brazil's market share exceeds 53%. ""Without a doubt, Brazil is a major power in Latin America. The main customers for Brazilian exports of cosmetic products are Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia, and hair products are the most exported ones,"" adds João Carlos Basilio. The perfumery segment totalises more than R$ 17.1 billion (5.4 billion dollars or EUR 4.9 billion). While sales of deodorants reached R$ 11.5 billion. The Brazilian population is becoming increasingly aware about risks linked to sun exposure, thus contributing to strong sales of sunscreen products, which reached R$ 4.1 billion (1.3 billion dollars or 1.2 billion euros) in 2014. Mintel estimates that the category will grow by 14% in 2015. ""Although Brazil was already a leader in sunscreens, last year we expanded our leading position to the entire sun care category,"" highlights João Carlos Basilio. Among the main categories in which Brazil stands as the world's 2nd largest consumer products are men's, children's and hair care products. During the last five years, children's products achieved a compound average growth of approximately 14%, raising sales to R$ 4.5 billion in 2014. For instance, Brazil is the leading consumer of hair care products for children, representing 24% of world's consumption. Men's grooming products account for almost 11% of the whole personal care consumption in Brazil. Sales doubled in size in the past five years and reached R$ 11.1 billion in 2014. The performance of the hair care market was similar. Driven by hair conditioners, hair colours and shampoos, which together represent 90% of the hair segment, Brazil recorded net sales of R$ 21.2 billion in 2014 (6.8 billion dollars or 6.2 billion euros), an increase of 11% compared to 2013."
The French cosmetics industry confirms its global leadership,"With a trade surplus of around 8.9 billion euros, the cosmetics sector is now France's second biggest net exporter behind aeronautics (23.6 billion), but ahead the food industry (6.5 billion), according to figures released by the French trade association for cosmetics and beauty products (FEBEA) [1]. With an increase of 4% compared to 2013, exports of the cosmetic products are also those that have experienced the strongest growth in 2014, compared to the two other leading sectors (+2.5% for aeronautics and -8% for the food industry). For many years, France has been the world's largest exporter of cosmetic products. The country held 15.9% of the market in 2013, ahead of the United States (10.8%) and Germany (10.7%). France is the leading European exporter in this sector, far ahead of its competitors. French cosmetics exports account for almost a third of all European exports, far ahead of Germany. Another example is the size of the French trade surplus in the cosmetics sector, which is more than 5 times bigger than the Italian surplus (1.16 billion euros in 2014). According to the FEBEA, these excellent results reflect ""the richness and quality of the French cosmetics offer, which can meets the needs of a wide variety of markets and consumption patterns."" But where are French cosmetics shipped actually? Mostly to other European countries. Indeed, the European Union remains the first destination (48.2%) of exports. After Europe, Asia is the second destination for French cosmetics, with 16.9% of exports. Shipments to this region recorded the strongest growth (+11.7% in 2014, compared to the previous year) with China leading the way (+16.5%). France thus remains the largest cosmetics exporter in this region, despite intensive competition from other major players including Japan, Korea and the United States. Exports to the Middle East and to the United States also recorded significant increases: +7.1% and +7.6% respectively. Africa is growing slightly (+0.4%). By contrast, exports to Russia, Turkey and Latin America have decreased, in a context of ""economic and / or political and regulatory uncertainties,"" said the FEBEA. Unsurprisingly, skin care products and perfumes represent 2/3 of French cosmetics exports (42.3% for skin care and 33.8% for perfumes) in value. They are followed by shampoos and hair preparations (for a total 6.6%) and by eyes and lips colour products (6.5%). ""This growth is driven by the dynamism of a whole sector and an industrial network including SMEs, intermediate-sized companies and large groups. The results recorded by the French cosmetics industry abroad in 2014 show that the reputation and quality of made in France cosmetics, often at the edge of innovation, remain appreciated worldwide,"" said Patrick O'Quin, President of the FEBEA. However, the dynamism of the French industry on international markets is also another indication of the increased dependency of the European cosmetics industry from external demand. While most European markets record a sluggish growth or a recession (sales of cosmetic products decreased by 0.8% in 2013 in Europe), European manufacturers have no choice but to seek growth where it is located."
Beauty Success opts for Africa to accelerate its international development,"Beauty Success, the fourth selective beauty network retailer in France, already operates a dozen stores outside metropolitan France. Without slowing its development in its home country, the company wants to carry on the expansion of its network by focusing on internationalization thanks to its concept, now ready for export. The partnership with CFAO should enable Beauty Success to open about twenty new stores in the coming years in different countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The shops will be open primarily in shopping centres operated by CFAO in countries such as Cameroon, Congo, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Senegal. The first beauty shop will open in September in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. For its international development, the company said it had given priority to ""emerging countries recording high growth rates and structuring their retail environment."" The company intends to achieve this development in the same way that succeeded in France: by relying on local entrepreneurs interested in the franchise and master-franchise model and with a good knowledge of the perfume industry and beauty salons. For these African shops, Beauty Success will keep the architectural design as well as the same codes than in France. However, the product offer will be adapted to the country's specificities and to local consumption habits. To ensure the transmission of its know-how, the company will provide the same training than in France, and will also propose intensive training periods in its French sales outlets. The partnership with CFAO will enable Beauty Success to settle in luxurious shopping malls alongside other European retailers who also joined the company's brands pool, such as shoemaker San Marina, chocolate seller Jeff de Bruges, or food chains El Rancho and Baïla Pizza."
Seasonality is becoming a key trend of the beauty market,"The growth of cosmetic products developed to offer a targeted defence against the effects of specific weather conditions has been considerable over recent years. According to Mintel, over the past three years, seasonal products accounted for as many as 11.1% of all beauty and personal care launches in 2014, up from 9.8% in 2011. What's more, seasonal facial skincare launches rose from 0.5% of global launches in 2009 to 1.2% in 2014. ""Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of - and concerned about - how changes in the environment are affecting the condition of their skin and hair. Already, beauty manufacturers have started to go beyond taking simple seasonal approaches geared to public holidays or gifting occasions and instead are taking on the elements within their product innovation,"" explains Jane Henderson, Global President of Mintel's Beauty and Personal Care Division at Mintel. Highlighting a gap in the market, Mintel's exclusive consumer research reveals the strong global consumer demand for skincare launches that tap into changing seasons. Some four in five (80%) German consumers claim their facial skin needs change throughout the year and almost half (48%) of Chinese female facial skincare users choose products from different brands in different seasons. ""A new generation of winter care products offer additional care and hydration for the skin. These tend to target dry or very dry skin and mention cold, dry weather. However, the future will see the arrival of boosters that address cold, damp weather as well as the extremes of dryness,"" highlights Vivienne Rudd, Director of Insight, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. Furthermore, there are also strong demands for hair care launches that tap into the seasonality trend, with three in 10 (30%) Brazilian hair care consumers claiming they would pay more for products to protect their hair from sun damage. The seasonality trend also looks set to shape the future of the personal care market. Currently, nearly half (48%) of US sun care users express interest in gradual tanning body washes and 44% of US women who use soap, bath and shower products look for extra moisturisers in the winter months. According to Mintel there is also scope for products that appeal to the altered emotional needs of consumers as the seasons change. ""Conditions such as Seasonal Affective Disorder and the Winter Blues are now widely understood by consumers and the time is ripe for innovations that appeal to these ailments as well as products that appeal to people's optimism during the warm weather,"" Vivienne Rudd continues. Indeed, over a third (36%) of UK consumers said they felt less positive during the long, cold winter of 2012/2013 and 23% said the return of warm weather would prompt them to treat themselves to a new look. In particular, Mintel's research shows that this could hold real potential for fragrance manufacturers. Today, two-thirds (67%) of US fragrance users would be interested in scents that influence their mood or relieve stress and almost a quarter (23%) would pay more for them. ""The seasonal issue will have an impact on global launch programmes. With the seasons arriving in different geographic zones at different times, colour cosmetics brands will have to take a more time-sensitive approach to their seasonal colour stories, while skincare and hair care brands may have to stagger their launch programmes more accurately. Beauty brands will also take cues from localised seasons such as the Monsoon in South East Asia to launch relevant and eye catching products,"" concludes Vivienne Rudd."

Furthermore, the demand for high-end toiletries should increase strongly among Chinese consumers."
Which part of their bodies are Chinese and Brazilian women willing to invest more on?,"Although the relationship with beauty cannot be defined the same way in the two countries - it is all about pleasure and sensuality in Brazil, while China focuses on control and safety - several common features actually bring these two countries' consumer profiles closer. According to the study, the cosmetic market in China is growing fast and offers more and more sophisticated products, analyzes Laure Friscourt, Head of Consumer & Beauty Division at Ifop. It is to be noted that anti-aging products are widely represented, with 60 per cent to 70 per cent, and that the local, more and more premium Chinese brands are strongly developing. In addition, women mainly seek naturalness and guaranteed safety as a result of the high impact of pollution. Brazilian women expect these same benefits from cosmetics, in a country which possesses the largest wealth of natural raw materials and cosmetic actives. Brazil is unique in its approach of body hygiene and beauty. It is characterized by a great ethnic diversity, and it is also the country where the hair is king. Just like in China, it is a market that counts more and more premium brands and whose consumers expect to get a lot of advice. In Brazil, beauty lies in the way people seek both wellness and/or social integration, while it still often has to do with achieving a status of one's own in China, while finding an 'internal health-external beauty' balance. The study identifies six women profiles in both countries, ranging from over-committed women, who are quite numerous in Brazil and would do anything to achieve perfection, to the health-natural group, which gathers 21% of Chinese women. Then, in the middle of the mapping can be found two interesting profiles of women with a relationship with beauty that has not matured yet, in particular for 25% of the Chinese. The women were surveyed on the body parts they are the most satisfied and dissatisfied with, and those on which they are the most willing to invest. The results unveil the areas to be studied by cosmetics brands. And it comes as no surprise that the first clear result is the importance of the hair in Brazil, and of the eyes in China. Yet, when Brazilian women are asked which body part they are willing to invest more on, 58% of them answer their bellies. Then 40% mention their hair, followed by the lower part of their bodies (bottom and legs). By contrast, Chinese women declare they are willing to invest more on the upper part of their bodies: 70% of them mention their faces, 30% their chest, neck and shoulders. This contrasting approach can be explained by the different lifestyles and cultures, but again, it also conceals a common preoccupation. Indeed, even if they say they are not ready to invest more on this area of their bodies 'yet', most Chinese women also admit they are not satisfied with their bellies. A study of Russian and French women conducted in April 2013 by Ifop revealed identical preoccupations. The belly was mentioned as a main concern by 52% of French women, and by 40% of Russian women."
U.S. beauty shoppers increasingly tempted by other product categories,"The majority of U.S. women, 8 out of 10, shop for beauty products, but a 4 percent drop in 2014 brought the industry to its lowest level of shoppers since 2008, according to the Annual Beauty Consumer Economic Indicator, the latest beauty report from global information company The NPD Group. ""Consumer attitudes have changed, and beauty is viewed differently than it was in years past. Today, there is more competition among beauty brands and retailers, and more competition between beauty and other products, services, and even experiences, such as vacations, entertainment, and dining. The consumer's desires outside of beauty have become just as important as those inside,"" said Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. NPD conducted an online survey in November 2014 based on a nationally representative sample of women aged 18+, who were screened as beauty shoppers. The market research firm found that women continue to have a strong emotional connection to beauty products. Over the past seven years, the top driver for purchasing has been to feel confident, followed by feeling sexy. However, most beauty shoppers are moderately engaged in the category, reporting they ""regularly put some effort into their appearance so that they at least look presentable."" The study found an important dichotomy when looking at beauty shoppers' attitudes toward shopping and purchasing in today's economy. While about 50 percent of women report beauty products are the first thing they would cut back on if money got tight, an almost equal proportion say they would continue to buy beauty products in such a situation because the products make them feel better about themselves. Similarly, nearly half of women indicate they usually shop for beauty products that are on sale, while the other half reports that price is not the most important factor when shopping for beauty products. The contrast continues when looking at individual categories. Spending cuts in makeup and fragrance occur 1.5 times as often as in skincare and hair care, because the products are seen as for special occasions; however, if women were given an extra USD 100 of disposable income to spend on beauty, most would purchase makeup or fragrance products. ""These distinct differences among beauty shoppers keep us, as an industry, on our toes and can also be seen as a positive because they pose a big opportunity for the industry,"" added Grant. ""If the industry responds to the consumer in new and exciting ways, these opportunities will drive growth in 2015."""
Brazilian brands soon to capture the global market?,"Natura Brasil and Boticário, the two leading Brazilian groups in the industry, dominate the local market, in particular thanks to their direct-selling networks. They are ahead of the sector's world's giants like American company Avon, another direct-selling specialist, but also L'Oréal, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever. Despite their sizes, the variety of their offers, and the quality of their products, these brands are still little known or not known at all in other global markets. ""That's true, opportunities on the global scale have not been exploited enough by major brands yet, and not at all by smaller ones"", confirms Helen Kupfer-Haas, consultant and distributor of luxury brands on the French and Brazilian markets. ""They have been focusing on developing on their own market, which is tremendous, and in the booming Latin American market. That was their priority,"" she explains. These choices are confirmed by Nazish Munchenbach, Marketing Director at Granado, the historic and iconic brand of the country that has just made a noticeable entrance at the Bon Marché department store in Paris. ""We have only just started developing on the global level. We are only working with a few trustworthy partners for now, such as the Bon Marché, or Palmers in Greece, and we also have a few clients in Italy and Great Britain, but we are still focusing on Brazil, and most of our resources are dedicated to the local market"", she adds. And yet, Natura has embarked on an adventure outside the Brazilian borders on one of the most famously harsh markets: France. The brand entered the French market in 2005, where its products are available in a store, but also via a network of 2,000 direct-selling advisors and a website. It has a long-standing presence in the country, but it still remains relatively discreet in terms of visibility. Even if, because of logistics costs and constraints, conquering the world was never a priority until now, the slowdown in growth and the ever-fiercer competition on the local level seem to make brands think. By purchasing Australian brand Aesop, Natura Brasil has laid its hands on a company sharing similar values and possessing a network of wholly-owned stores on several continents. Today, the group declares it is ready to increase the number of its points of sale in France. However, Thierry Aubry-Lecomte, Managing Director of Natura Brasil in France, qualifies the idea of spreading all over the place: ""Humility and wisdom make us connect with the rhythm of the Earth and take shape on a sustainable basis"". Granado also prefers to remain cautious: ""a 145-year-old company can afford to take the time to do things the right way, without any hurry"", confirms Nazish Munchenbach. But what chance do these brands have to win the hearts of women consumers all over the world? No doubt they can, according to Nazish Munchenbach. ""Brazil has a huge potential. It is a country that not only inspires by its beauty and the richness of its culture, its nature and size, but also by the kindness and accessibility of its people. All this brings endless possibilities"", she explains. And Helen Kupfer-Haas confirms that ""thanks to its cultural mixing, Brazil has a universal appeal. It can reach all continents and, most of all, it rhymes with joie de vivre. As a matter of fact, beauty around the world is mainly personalized by Brazilian women today. They are the most beautiful ambassadors, starting with Gisele Bündchen, and the most well-known models come from Brazil. It is a true breeding ground. And it is not just their beauty that is appealing, as they have this 'brasilidade' aura of well-being, joie de vivre – a healthy mind in a healthy body that grabs people's interest all around the world. Major Brazilian brands should use this."" A universal beauty that embodies joie de vivre, a biodiversity that is unique in the world and rich in endlessly varied, natural ingredients, little-known beauty rituals… everything seems to show Brazilian beauty has everything to conquer the world. ""But in order to succeed, a Brazilian brand must focus on quality and innovation, and make no compromise on these two key success factors"", Nazish Munchenbach warns. The massive arrival of international suppliers and subcontractors in Brazil together with the growing sophistication in production tools and means should contribute to enhancing the global competitiveness of Brazilian cosmetics."
"MakeUp in Seoul, a catalyser","Premium Beauty News - More than thirty journalists attended the press conference you had organized last week in Seoul. A real success! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Yes indeed! And this year it was a surprise to welcome a strong Chinese delegation. Many articles have already been published on the internet. A press conference, which was, precisely, organized on the venue, where in a few weeks, will take place what promises to be the main event in the make-up sector of this beginning of year 2015. An opportunity for us to announce a 30% increase in the number of exhibitors and also a sharp rise in the number of visitors registered compared to last year at the same date.

Premium Beauty News - This second edition promises to be a great vintage! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Undoubtedly, yes! We will be welcoming this year first-time exhibitors from China, Europe and the United States during the two days of the show at the Conrad Hotel in Seoul. And I can already tell you that many high profile managers from major international brands have already announced they would make the trip. Some of these major brands said they would make of the South Korean capital city the centre of their make-up innovation and development laboratory. MakeUp in Seoul will be the perfect place for them to make their official announcements. During two days, the Korean capital city will be at the cross-roads of the best Asia has to offer in terms of make-up. Not to be missed... Premium Beauty News - The choice of organizing your Asian trade show in South Korea was therefore a good choice? How many visitors are expected? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Certainly the best Sandra Maguarian and I ever made. This country, every day, is proving its dynamism in the make-up sector, be it in the field of formulas, packaging or accessories. Many new products will be introduced during these two days. Innovations that will amaze visitors. Visitors, who, I insist, will be as usual the ones who really want to see our exhibitors, namely real decision makers. This is what makes the difference with other large-size international beauty trade shows. And this second edition will be the proof of the pudding. Because it is not the number of visitors that countsbut their quality. MakeUp in Seoul = Quality!"

"Korea, the new cosmetics giant?","The South Korean trade balance for beauty products was in surplus for the first time last year. According to South Korea's customs office, cosmetics exports reached 1.92 billion dollars in 2014, that is, an increase of 50.4% over the previous year. This is a spectacular reversal, considering that from 2001 to 2012, the annual deficit exceeded 400 million US dollars and only started to decrease in 2013. With imports totalling 600 million US dollars, mainland China is the top destination of ""Made in Korea"" cosmetic products. Other key importers are Hong Kong (USD 410 million), the United States (USD 160 million), Japan (USD 150 million), and Taiwan (USD 120 million), followed by Singapore and Thailand. Actually, the popularity of K-Beauty remains primarily an Asian phenomenon. However, the number of destination countries of Korean cosmetics is increasing regularly. After BB creams, cushion products are the new Korean trend to draw worldwide attention in the beauty sector. The term ""cushion"" refers to a makeup compact built with a specially designed urethane foam that contains and preserves a makeup liquid (usually a foundation, blended with sunscreens and skincare actives) applied with a dedicated sponge. Main advantages: it is easy to use and easily transportable. A pioneer in this product category, the Amore Pacific group started working on cushions in 2007. The group has 13 registered patents for cushions in Korea, China, Japan, the United States and Europe. In 2014, AmorePacific succeeded in automating the entire cushion production procedure. In 2014, AmorePacific sold 26 million cushions through its several brands (Laneige, Etude House, Innisfree, Sulwhasoo, etc.). According to a recent TNS Korea survey, 75% of Korean women have used or are currently using cushion products. However, these products also appeal to consumers from other countries. In 2014, AmorePacific's cushions increased by 140%. Once again, China is the main destination country: approximately 1.17 million units of Laneige BB Cushion were sold in China in 2014. Korean cosmetics manufacturers have patiently built their reputation by relying upon a highly competitive but quickly growing domestic market. ""Many Korean manufacturers have managed to seize this opportunity to create absolute jewels in terms of R&D and manufacturing capabilities,"" said JKH Wang, president of FS Korea, a supplier of packaging and makeup applicators. When asked by the organizers of MakeUp in Seoul, which will open its doors on 15-16 April 2015, JHK Wang added that Korean manufacturers now offer products whose quality and sophistication can not only appeal to Chinese consumers, but also US or European ones. ""The Korean beauty industry is very responsive, competent and passionate. To become leaders on the global market, we create and constantly look for new ideas and new products to create. We want to mark our time with our footprint in terms of creativity. To achieve this we need to strengthen partnerships between us and the various international market players,"" adds John Kwon, consultant for Cosmecca, a Korean contract manufacturer of colour cosmetics."
Cosmetic 360: the Cosmetic Valley details its ambitions,"""The market is driven by new product developments and launches with a strong desire for innovation and where there constant new challenges: within a 4 year span 30% of new products appear on the market and half of the products that will be on the market within the next five years are unknown today,"" said Marc-Antoine Jamet, President of the Cosmetic Valley. ""Innovation is essential and this new event will be a showcase for French innovation."" The Cosmetic Valley's leading team is convinced that innovation is the key to the attractiveness and international fame of made in France cosmetics. Building up on an increasing number of members, a network of 800 companies and eight universities including a total of 200 laboratories and 8,600 researchers over a territory covering three French regions (Centre, Normandy and Ile-de-France), they want to gather under the same roof what the best innovations of the cosmetics supply chain, from France and the rest of the world. Highlighting the originality of the concept, Jean-Luc Ansel says that ""each stand will be equipped with a hoarding describing the showcased innovation and not the name of the company."" Contrasting with the recent trend toward increasingly specialized events, Cosmetic 360 aims to gather a wide span of cosmetic innovations: functional packaging (digital packaging, antimicrobial packaging, interactive packaging combining LED and microprocessors...), new materials (ceramics, bio-based materials), new actives (molecules from the cosmetopea, anti-microbial natural raw materials, anti-pollution actives...), new testing and measurement equipment (contact free acoustic rheology, high-resolution ultrasound for cosmetic applications, ex vivo objectification...), new manufacturing equipment, new products (alcohol-free perfumed balls, customised cosmetics, connected beauty, augmented reality...). Managing more than a hundred research projects involving SMEs, large groups and academic laboratories, the Cosmetic Valley also intends to promote exchanges between these various operators. The organizers of Cosmetic 360 thus offer leading cosmetics groups the opportunity to participate in the event through dedicated open innovation spaces where they can have pre-arranged appointments to discuss innovative projects with companies picked up from a list produced by the organizers. For the other participants, ""start up desks"" at 2,500 euros, 4.5 sqm mini stands at 3,300 euros or 7.5 sqm stands at 5,200 euros should allow all categories of companies to take part to the event. Scheduled on 15-16 October 2015, Cosmetic 360 will be held at the Carrousel du Louvre on 3000 sqm and is expected to host 100 to 150 exhibitors for its first edition and about 4,000 French and foreign visitors, according the organizers' forecast."
Latest cosmetics trends from the USA,"""North America remains number one in the luxury business, and prestige beauty is also doing well with a +3% growth in 2014, according to NPD data,"" declares Leïla Rochet-Podvin. The latest acquisitions by Estée Lauder in prestige brands and by L'Oréal, with Carol's Daughter, can only confirm the fact that large groups share an interest in the premium market. ""The luxury beauty world is evolving significantly"", she comments. Makeup appears as the leading segment, with a +6% rise and dynamics that have shifted to the eye (+10%) and lip (+13%) segments, as the NPD Group confirms. Leïla Rochet-Podvin has noticed a change in the offer: ""What we have seen with nails is now expressed in the eye segment, with more sophistication in the eye makeup, a multitude of products designed to prime the area, and plenty of bold colours, graphics, perfect lines… After Nail Art, here comes Eye Art!"" She also notes that the customization phenomenon, which has already reached the mass market and the fashion and cosmetics sectors, is inviting itself in the makeup world. As an example, the Bite Beauty Lip Lab now makes it possible for New Yorkers to create their own lipsticks by choosing the finish, colour, taste, and packaging. Products from Asia have a growing influence and presence on the American market. These brands mainly come from Japan and Korea, entered the market through Lifestyle stores such as Urban Outfitters and are getting settled with wholly-owned stores in the large cities of the East and West coasts. Just like in Seoul, Tony Moly, The Face Shop, Club Clio and Nature Republic stores are sprouting up from Manhattan to San Francisco. ""Asia is a guarantee for American consumers: it is shown in the media as a centre of expertise, and rhymes with innovation and sophistication in beauty rituals. Given the substantial media coverage observed in 2014, some brands do not hesitate to focus their communication campaigns on Asian models,"" Leïla Rochet-Podvin analyses. Eclectic Beauty is the signature of this prospective vision divided into six universes and presented in the form of inspiration boards. ""'Eclectic', because there is a true desire to live a life of changes and self-staging. We have witnessed the birth of a chameleon beauty which gets shared and staged,"" explains Leïla Rochet-Podvin. The phenomenon is intensified by a younger generation fed on social networks, YouTube, and especially Instagram. ""Brands do not represent the major part of expression on YouTube: it is mostly content creators who speak up. Instagram is now playing a significant role, and all this puts an emphasis on self-image,"" she concludes. The agency has drawn six inspirational universes from this Eclectic Beauty to reflect both various visions of femininity and emerging products, niche brands, harmonized with these new lifestyles and consumption patterns."
France: Wide gaps in selective perfumery,"As the INSEE (the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) has found household expenditure decreased in 2014 for the second year in a row (-0.2% in 2014 after a -0.3% decline in 2013), it seems the perfumes and cosmetics sold through selective distribution channels [1] did not benefit from the recovery in the consumption of manufactured goods (+0.7% in 2014 after -0.6% in 2013). According to the NPD Group research firm, selective perfumes and cosmetics sales reached 2.9 billion euros in France in 2014, which corresponds to a -0.6% fall in value. Despite a disappointing month of December compared to 2013 (-0.6% in volume), perfumery is the only sector whose turnover has increased (+0.2% in 2014), and there was no important launch this year to support this growth. If prestige makeup sales show a -0.1% global decline compared to 2013, the situation in this category is far from homogeneous. Indeed, there is a strong increase in multifunctional makeup products sales (+128.4%), which cover makeup palettes comprising eye shadows, blush and sometimes even gloss, or lipsticks which also feature a blush function. Likewise, complexion products are quite popular among French women (+2.1% in 2014), contrary to boxes (-14.7%) and eye makeup (-4.6%). Selective makeup is enhanced by constant innovation and should thus grow again in 2015, if companies manage to attract young consumers, who see it as a major seduction tool. According to a survey carried out by beauty and wellness treatment booking specialist Balinea.com, almost half of women (47%) consider makeup as their main seduction tool on a date. And this idea is mostly shared by younger ones (57% of women aged 20-30, 55% of those aged 30-40). On the other hand, after keeping a high level for several years, skincare proved less trendy in 2014 (-3.8%). The cosmetics the most concerned by this decline are moisturizers (-7.2%), treatments designed for the eyes (-6.6%), and anti-aging skincare (-3.1%). According to the FFPS, once again, downtown and local perfumeries are those that suffered the most this year with a -5% sales decline in 2014, following the -9.8% collapse in 2013. However, their market share remains quite significant (14.5%). As for the chains that entered a new era in terms of concentration, with Douglas buying Nocibé, they still represent 76.6% of the market. According to the FFPS, they managed to curb the decrease of their turnovers in stores (-0.1%). All in all, it is actually the department stores (8.7% of the market) that show the best performance (+2.6%). By offering an ultra-luxurious customer experience, in Paris in particular, they seem to have managed to meet the expectations of well-off customers or of those that are willing to pay the price for an exceptional buying experience. The success of department stores on the ultra-luxury segment and the difficulties of traditional independent perfumeries also highlight the relative lack of data regarding the differentiation strategy adopted by some independent retailers that have chosen to specialize in alternative perfumery brands. Today, only few French cities do not have a perfume shop specialized in this segment, and all of them do not seem to have to fight to survive. Ombre Portées now counts an e-commerce website and five perfumeries throughout the French territory, and has announced the opening of a new store in Brittany for the first quarter 2015. As for Sens Unique, the iconic alternative perfumery based in the Marais quarter in the heart of Paris, it has just inaugurated a new branch in Caen, France. That is enough to justify further research!"

Premium Beauty News - How is the British packaging market evolving, in particular the prestige packaging market? Alison Church - The British packaging market is constantly evolving, it never stands still and this is definitely most evident in the luxury and premium markets. The packaging of a luxury item is almost as important as the product itself inside the pack. Where companies were looking to cut costs during the recession, the luxury and prestige goods markets were creating even more luxurious and eye-catching packs. The packaging of a luxury product isn't just to protect what is inside, but has to persuade the consumer to part with more money and has to represent the quality of the product. Prestige packaging is also moving towards 'the all round experience', trying to play on all of the senses, rather than simply focussing purely on the look and feel. It is becoming a common occurrence to find that sound and smells are intertwined within the packaging experience, introducing a whole new aspect to the industry. This may not be entirely new, but it is very much growing in popularity as an important consideration to all premium and luxury brands."
"U.S.A.: Prestige beauty sales grew by 3% in 2014, driven by the makeup category","The U.S. prestige beauty [1] industry reached US$11.2 billion and grew 3 per cent in dollar sales in 2014, compared to 2013, according to global information company The NPD Group, Inc. Makeup experienced the healthiest gain, 6 per cent, while fragrance dollars grew 2 per cent and skincare increased by 1 per cent. Over the full year, North America proved much more dynamic than Western Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom. Prestige makeup, skincare, and fragrance in the U.S. all experienced 2 to 4 per cent growth in average price. The lip segment was key to makeup's growth, driven by lip colour. Of the top 100 new shades on counter in 2014, pink surpassed red as the leading colour, bringing in 23 per cent more dollars. Sets and kits drove the growth for skincare, with anti-aging sets serving as the catalyst. Juices experienced the largest increase for women's fragrance, while for men it was gift sets. ""Beauty is an industry where consumers are willing to spend, and where the majority of them - more than 80 per cent of U.S. women alone - invest,"" said Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. ""While there is brand loyalty, consumers at the same time are always on the hunt for products that will perform better, and are willing to add to their routine if a product proves worthwhile. The industry is at an advantage in the U.S., a crossroads, where world beauty comes together in one place, and the innovation and types of products that connect with consumers, and satisfy their needs and desires, show themselves in a natural light."" The growth of the U.S. prestige market outpaced the mass [2] channel, where sales remained flat for total beauty in 2014, versus 2013, as per Nielsen. The skincare category, with 2 per cent growth, buoyed the overall mass market, while fragrance and makeup experienced dollar declines, by 4 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively. ""The beauty industry had a solid annual performance in a somewhat difficult retail environment, but there's still plenty of room for improvement and development,"" added Karen Grant. ""We saw that fewer consumers, especially beauty shoppers, cut spending in 2014. At the same time, 2014 reported the fewest number shopping for beauty in six years. This tells me that beauty shoppers are happy, but some may be seeking happiness elsewhere. This 'elsewhere' is in other products and services, as well as experiences; consumers today are not just pursuing 'products for me,' so much as they are seeking 'experiences for us.' The challenge for the beauty industry, therefore, doesn't lie solely in the products, but in fulfilling this sense of experience, and having both play together in harmony."""
The natural personal care market moves to truly natural products as sales continue to grow,"Sales of the global natural personal care market increased by nearly 10% in 2014, finds consulting and research firm Kline & Company in its imminent Natural Personal Care Global Series report. All regions continued to surpass the overall beauty market's growth during 2014. Brazil and Asia-Pacific remained the fastest growing regions during 2014, with both expanding at double-digit rates. However, growth in China is restricted due to formulation challenges, as well as animal-testing methods. Several Western brands, such as Weleda, Lavera, and Pangea, among others, have withdrawn from the Chinese market in protest. According to Kline, growing consumer awareness of synthetic chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries and the desire for truly natural products will continue to propel the global natural personal care industry. This segment's growth is projected at a CAGR of slightly less than 10% through 2019. However, the market research firm says products with natural claims but formulated with a high proportion of synthetic ingredients dominate the global natural personal care market, accounting for nearly 75% of the total market share in 2014. These natural-inspired are particularly popular in less mature markets, such as Brazil and some Asia-Pacific countries, where disposable income and consumer awareness regarding product ingredients are low. Even in mature markets, products that are only natural-inspired continue to prevail. However, consumer's awareness is growing, leading increasing numbers of consumers and retailers to select products containing predominantly natural ingredients. Following this trend, marketers have increasingly been reformulating with a higher proportion of natural ingredients in their products. In the United States and Europe in 2014, Kline's ratings system, which analyzes brands' naturalness on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being completely natural, uncovered shifts in the natural positioning in several U.S. and European brands, including Avalon Organics, Jāsön, Annemarie Börlind, and Melvita, all receiving higher ratings in 2014 when compared to prior years. ""These reformulations are the next natural step for companies aiming to establish strong natural concepts with high importance given to the trust between the brand and the consumers. Moving upward in the natural ratings is a great way for natural brands to gain acceptance from a larger consumer base in the mid- to long-term,"" explains Agnieszka Saintemarie, Project Manager, Consumer Products at Kline & Company. To cater to consumers' desire to be able to easily select the right product, some marketers are becoming more transparent in their communication about the quality level of ingredients, certification, and the company's values. However, consumers are willing to invest in these often pricey truly natural products but only if they deliver effective results. Therefore, marketers are increasingly focusing on product efficacy, highlights Kline."
Eyes and lips record the fastest growth of the U.S. prestige colour cosmetics market,"According to data published by the market research firm, sales of prestige eye colour products have grown by 10 per cent from November 2013 to November 2014 in the United Sates, while sales of prestige lip colour products grew by almost 13 per cent to 1.1 billion US dollars and 417 million US dollars respectively. ""The shift in where women focus their colour needs and desires is a natural one, and it will no doubt change again,"" said Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. ""Colour is key when it comes to makeup. It's the area where consumers play with fashion and are willing to experiment, as they seek ways to make bold statements and refresh their look."" Eyebrow makeup and eye shadow are two areas that saw the most growth within eye makeup in the 12 months ending November 2014 (34 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively), while lip colour grew by 13 per cent. In contrast, colour enamel prompted the nail segment's dollar decline, with a 10 per cent drop in sales. However, it is important to note that most nail colour products are sold in the mass and professional channels. ""Consumers are paying attention to the marketing focus around eye and lip colour, and responding to multi-colour pallets that have become more prevalent, but that is just part of the dynamic at play,"" added Grant. ""Marketers and consumers are seeing that makeup and colour are affordable ways to try what's new and in vogue. Much of the power lies in speed of response and putting that in the hands of trendsetters as well as the early adopters. This responsiveness to the consumer environment will continue to shape the future of colour in beauty."""
The growing influence of YouTube beauty vloggers,"Influence4you - a media and communication agency specializing in the relationship between brands and social media, blogging, and vlogging influencers - attempted to measure the impact of French YouTube beauty vloggers on the web. [1] The agency scrutinised several key data: the time spent watching videos or reading articles, the presence and influence in social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. From a strictly quantitative point of view, the balance struck is heavily tilted in favour of YouTube vloggers. The time spent (in thousands of minutes) on the main websites for women and on major YouTube beauty channels is roughly equivalent. Shortly speaking, the media influence of the leading French YouTube beauty vloggers is now as important as the leading websites for women. However, their audience is overwhelmingly aged 15-35 years, while websites for women connect with a much broader audience. The comparison of the number of followers and of engagement rates on Facebook, also shows that YouTube beauty vloggers are on equal footing with leading websites for women. However, as far as other social media measured by the study (Twitter, Instagram) are concerned, YouTube vloggers clearly dominate. ""Twitter is a privileged and popular communication channel for YouTube vloggers and for their viewers, which are younger than that of largest women's sites. Therefore, they are fully invested in social media that allow direct communication with their followers,"" say the authors of the study. Regarding Instagram, the difference is even more marked, with hardly any female sites having a number of followers matching the numbers reached by YouTube vloggers. Beyond the comparison between websites for women' and YouTub beauty vloggers, Influence4you also compared the influence between bloggers and YouTube vloggers. Once again, from a purely quantitative point of view, the preponderance of YouTube vloggers is undeniable: their influence on social networks seems much higher. However bloggers, which are somewhat older, have an established relationship with their readers and attract wider age groups. Bloggers also massively invest social media and many of them became influential YouTube vloggers. From the brand's perspective, blogs also have the advantage of an easier integration of advertisements. According to Influence4you: ""Bloggers and YouTube vloggers should be opposed as they appear as being somewhat complementarity."" To summarize, YouTube beauty vloggers now have a large audience and an unparalleled presence in social media. These quantitative assets add up to the unique characteristics of video media, which is rather well suited to the beauty and fashion sectors, and to the personal endorsement and intimacy, provided by the YouTube vlogger. However, their audience is highly targeted on the 15-35 years. For most mainstream brands, a media strategy that would only target YouTube vloggers would therefore not be optimum, as they may lose touch with large part of the market."
France: Perfume and makeup sales drive the prestige market,"""Once again, the French beauty market shows that its ability to resist in a difficult economic environment,"" said The NPD Group. According to the market research firm, sales of selective cosmetics decreased by -0.6% in 2014 (vs. -0.9% in 2013) and achieved a total turnover of nearly 2.9 billion euros. The year was marked by two major phases. The first half was marked by a significant downturn (-1.5 per cent), followed by a rebound in sales from August, thanks to a trend shift on perfumes and makeup in the second half which closed with a +0.1 per cent increase, despite the fact that December sales failed to reach expectations. ""The good news came from the perfume and makeup that were back on growth trail in the second half, in particularly with strong performances of women's fragrances driven by successful Autumn launches and by new additions to classic lines,"" said Mathilde Lion, beauty expert for Europe at The NPD Group. Fragrances, selective beauty's main category of (2/3 of total sales in value), drove the market with sales increasing by +0.2 per cent in value over the whole year. Despite a number of launches higher than in 2013, men's fragrances have not been that successful (-0.6 per cent in value over the whole year). On the contrary, women's fragrances have found their way to growth (+0.6 per cent), boosted by new launches and the success of flankers. ""Women's fragrances is the only category driven by innovation this year and brands' strategies were more focused on the launch of flankers - such as Black Opium by YSL, La Petite Robe Noire Couture by Guerlain and Kenzo's Kenzo Jeu d'Amour - rather than on the emergence of new concepts,"" added Lion. While the overall prestige skincare market decreased in 2014, makeup broadly maintained its sales with a limited decline (-0.1 per cent). The year also recorded a return to growth for complexion enhancers (+ 1 per cent) driven by foundations and concealers. According to The NPD Group, other smaller segments also met really enthusiastic consumers, such as eyebrow products, gift boxes, facial brushes, lip-glosses and multifunctional products. ""The French market is very mature and we cannot expect it to grow very strongly. However, with a lot of launches scheduled at the beginning of the year, we expect 2015 sales to be in line with the second half of 2014, but celebration periods such as Valentine's Day, Mothers Day, Fathers Day and Christmas) will be challenging and will give the mood for the year,"" concluded Mathilde Lion."
"Beauteam announces its first ""MakeUp in Action"" in Los Angeles in February 2016","Premium Beauty News - Why ""MakeUp in Action"" in Los Angeles and not simply ""MakeUp in Los Angeles""? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Simply because the format of this new event will be different. It won't be, strictly speaking, a trade show in its traditional form, but a formula that is best suited to the atmosphere that characterizes the beauty sector on the West Coast, a real melting pot in terms of innovation with a real business incubator, from which start ups continue to emerge and with some of them who can literally change the traditional background of the make-up market. ""MakeUp in Action"" in Los Angeles will take place on one day and a half. The first half-day will enable professionals to meet and discuss, clearly, do business. All day next, will be an opportunity to take part to several highly specialized workshops led by consultants, brands managers and suppliers. For those interested, business meetings will also be organized in parallel during the day. Premium Beauty News - Will suppliers be allowed to showcase, strictly speaking, their products? Sandra Maguarian - The cornerstone and leitmotiv of this event is innovation. Companies wishing to exhibit (on a voluntarily limited floor space) will be allowed to do so, on to the condition of only showcasing their most recent innovations. The core of the concept also stands in the richness of themes addressed during the various workshops and plenary conferences. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose to inaugurate this new ""MakeUp in Action"" formula in Los Angeles? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Because it is the region in the United States and probably in the world, the best designed for it. There are lots of very innovative small and medium companies. They need a platform to open up to the outside and, at the same time they are looking for new products, new applicators, new formulas, and new accessories. Yet surprisingly, this region of the United States is a bit closed in on itself. Yet it is open to the Pacific region, which has become the most dynamic area in the world. And then we must not forget the fantastic dynamics of make-up dedicated for the movie industry... Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Action in Los Angeles can only increase your international legitimacy in the BtoB make-up sector? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - The objective, for the Beauteam team is of course to increase the legitimacy that the sector has granted us so far. A legitimacy based on a true understanding of the market and its needs and as always aimed at being an efficient platform to discuss and do business. The huge advantage we have today, is this fantastic network that we have built across the world and that we can share. In Los Angeles, like in all our other events, professionals from around the world already meet and will meet more and more..."
Brazil: 60 new points of sale in 2015 for instant nail polish colours maker Esmalte Machine,"Freire invested in research and technology to develop the first machine in the world able to manufacture custom nail polish instantly. ""Esmalte Machine is the most modern, simple and clean way to create thousands of nail polish colours on the spot,"" says Cesar Jansen, expansion manager of Esmalte Machine, which was founded in 2011, in the Brazilian state of Paraiba. With a clean and futuristic look, the patented device is a portable and automated feeder that uses pre-made basic colours to create new colour combinations. Customers can choose from a catalogue of over 100,000 shades available in different versions, including creamy, shimmering and metallic - with or without glitter. The ""5Free"" version is free of the five top substances that may cause allergies: toluene, formaldehyde, dibutyl phthalate, formaldehyde resin and camphor. The empty bottle is then positioned inside the machine, the operator enters the number corresponding to the selected colour on the touchscreen display and, after three minutes, the nail polish is ready to go. Despite working with chemical components in high-traffic public spaces such as mall corridors, Jansen ensures there are no safety risks. ""There is no handling of chemicals. What happens during the process is a mixture of nail polish colors inside the machine. Neither the customers nor the machine operators have physical contact with any of the components."" ""Initially, our idea was to supply only the machine and its ingredients, but the business model has been so successful that we decided to turn it into a franchise network,"" says Jansen. Today, Esmalte Machine has 12 franchises operating in nine Brazilian states: Para (Belem), Paraiba (Joao Pessoa), Parana (Foz do Iguaçu), Pernambuco (Recife), Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro and Niteroi) Rio Grande do Norte (Fortaleza), Rio Grande do Sul (Porto Alegre, Pelotas and Santa Maria), Santa Catarina (Lages) and Sao Paulo (Sao Paulo). ""We are currently implementing four new franchises and our forecast is to inaugurate another 60 by December 2015,"" says Jansen. The initial investment to open a franchise ranges from R$ 70,000 to R$ 135,000 depending on the point of sale selected (from 4 m2 micro-kiosks to 25 m2 stores). Monthly sales are estimated between R$ 12,000 and R$ 30,000. One of the main advantages for the franchisees is the ability to deal directly with the market demand - there is no need to stock products or invest in colours that may not be sold. They also have the possibility to work as direct sales consultants by selling Esmalte Machine products to their customers via catalogue and delivering straight to their place. Nail polish prices range from R$ 12 to R$ 18 in the traditional version, which are sold in 8 ml containers. Slightly larger, 5Free products are available in 10ml containers and cost R$ 25. There are also gift package options with two, four and six bottles of nail polish. The nail polish category recorded sales of nearly R$ 600 million (EUR 197 million) in Brazil in 2013 according to Euromonitor - a 16% share of the global market, which totals US$ 5.9 billion."
"The Cosmetic Valley launches Cosmetic 360, the Parisian show for cosmetic innovation","The ""competitiveness cluster"" based in Chartres, France, has taken the plunge. A new trade show dedicated to cosmetic innovation and research & development should take place next October 15-16, 2015, at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris. ""It has been long since manufacturers started telling us a reference trade show was missing in Paris, an event that would be worth the reputation and quality of French cosmetic products,"" explains Jean-Luc Ansel, Director of the Cosmetic Valley. In other words, the current shows in Paris are thought not to completely meet the cosmetics industry's expectations. ""To me, it has to do with positioning. We need a show that highlights French know-how in cosmetics and concentrates on innovation, trends, and research,"" he adds. This new event is called Cosmetic 360, and will thus focus on innovation in all its forms: product innovation, packaging innovation, but also innovation in services and marketing. ""Everything that contributes to the success of the cosmetics industry, with a particular emphasis on open innovation and outsourcing,"" Jean-Luc Ansel specifies. The Cosmetic Valley has already booked 3,000 m2 at the Carrousel du Louvre in the heart of Paris, and is expecting between 100 and 150 exhibitors for its first edition. The show will be open to all companies of the industry with innovations to showcase, whether they be ingredient or packaging suppliers, full-service companies or even research service providers, whether they be French or foreign, and members of the Cosmetic Valley or not. The date was chosen to make Cosmetic 360 an extension of COSM'innov, the scientific and academic event organized every other year in Orléans, France. ""We do not aim to host a big show, but a qualitative, highly technical, high-standard show. We will be selective when choosing the exhibitors,"" explains the Director of the competitive cluster. ""In the long run, we want all companies seeking cosmetic innovation around the world to know that this is where they will find it."" In order to succeed in this launching, the Cosmetic Valley relies on its network of international partners, among others. The Japan Cosmetic Center (JCC) and the Italian Polo Tecnologico della Cosmesi are said to have given their support. And the cluster's partners in Colombia and Quebec have also been approached. In France, the Cosmetic Valley endeavours to unite the profession around its project (FEBEA and the Société Française de Cosmétologie, the French Federation of Beauty Companies and the French Society of Cosmetology, are part of its board of directors), but given the tight deadlines, the competitive cluster has chosen to go ahead and not wait. And the support of a few French cosmetics giants seeking to highlight their excellence in research constitutes another advantage. ""It is really a new trade show concept. We have thought about a new positioning adapted and open both to the large groups willing to present their research projects and interested in open innovation, and to the SMEs willing to showcase their technologies. Of course, there will be a substantial conference programme, but also B2B meetings organized beforehand,"" Jean-Luc Ansel concludes. Now it remains to convince everyone of the relevance of the Cosmetic 360 concept, as the event schedule is already quite busy. There are numerous competitors indeed: Cosmeeting and Creative Paris are scheduled next September 15-17, 2015, and still rely on brands-suppliers synergy. Informa, the organizer, recently restructured its teams, which are now managed by Claudia Bonfiglioli. As for the Luxe Pack show, which will be held in Monaco less than two weeks after Cosmetic 360, it seems unassailable in the prestige packaging sector. And PCD (February 4 and 5, 2015 for the next edition) is already claimed as the show for packaging innovation and cosmetics distribution systems. To be continued."
Top three fragrance trends in 2015,"Niche fragrances to become more popular According to Nicholas Micallef, the rising popularity of niche fragrances is the first noticeable trend for this year. ""Consumers will continue to look for an effective identity and ability to relate emotionally and personally to a fragrance and in line with this, industry players are formulating fragrances with alternative ingredients,"" says Michallef, mentioning sea salt and saffron among such ingredients. Estée Lauder's recent acquisitions of Le Labo and Frédéric Malle illustrate the attempt of big players to tap into this market segment. However, the explosion of niche fragrances in the market also means that competition is intensifying. In order to address this challenge, Nicholas Micallef recommends fragrance players ""to sustain their niche intent and avoid commoditising the scent."" Increased personalization Increased personalization is the second trend identified by Euromonitor International. Referring to the recent My Burberry launch by Burberry, which allows consumers to monogram bottles of the fragrance with their initials, Micallef notes that brands increasingly allow consumers to personalise fragrance bottles. We recently pointed out similar initiatives from Serge Lutens, Atelier Cologne and Guerlain. Innovations in retail experiences Eventually, the third trend pointed by Euromonitor International is the increased competition between department stores and specialized retailers to enhance the consumer purchasing experience through new retail formats. According to Micallef, an illustration of this trend is the fragrance library opened at New York's Saks Fifth Avenue. In the library, consumers can learn more about fragrances and the heritage behind them. Euromonitor's analyst also points out standalone stores of brands such as Chanel and Dior where consumers can find a wide product mix featuring key heritage fragrances, as well as fashionable new items or best selling ones. We could also add the exclusive collections that top fragrance brands have been developing during recent years. Watch the video here below our at: blog.euromonitor.com"
Double-digit growth for prestige lip colour products in the U.S.,"""The trend of women seeking to make a bold makeup statement continues as marketers showcase lips more prominently than seen in prior years,"" said Karen Grant, vice president and global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group, Inc. ""A red lip is both 'on trend' and classic at the same time. For the holiday celebrations, it is not only bold, but also fun, festive, and can't be missed."" With total lip makeup sales being up for the 12 months ending November 2014, growth in lip makeup is not limited to lip colour or a single month. Lip products are among the primary drivers of total prestige makeup growth, which is the overall prestige beauty leader. According to The NPD Group, the use of lip colour has risen with younger women in particular, and the appeal is based on both fashion and function. Sales gains in this category are driven primarily by increases in unit sales, as the average price spent on lip colour has remained relatively flat over the past year, pointing back to spending behaviour of a younger consumer. In November 2014 alone, almost 1.8 million prestige lip colour products were sold in the U.S., a 22 per cent increase over November 2013. According to NPD's 2014 Makeup In-Depth Consumer Report, lip colour is currently the preferred lip product among consumers, and 33 percent of women use it more than once a day. ""Lip colour can totally transform a woman's look, and even affect their mood; that's a lot of benefit for something that costs around $20,"" added Grant. ""The value proposition of lip colour is very emotional, as well as practical, even for women on a budget. Messaging that taps into the consumers' desires can capture them, regardless of the season."""
German men seek skincare to defy signs of aging,"According to the report [1], German men are increasingly image-conscious, leading them to seek skincare products that meet their age-based needs. Both anti-wrinkle formulations for older men and milder formulations for sensitive younger skin are growing in popularity, as is the desire among 25-44 year olds for preventative products to delay the initial signs of aging. Men are becoming more aware of the need for skincare as part of a daily ritual, and manufacturers have responded with a range of products designed to help men look and feel their best. ""The German skincare market is evolving from being more female-oriented to presenting a sizeable opportunity to target men with products that meet both their individual and age-based needs. However, manufacturers will still need their products to offer great value, as men are more likely to seek functionality over indulgence and will opt for effective skincare products,"" says Sam Allen, analyst at Canadean. Canadean data shows that the desire for better value is high among consumers in Germany. With sophisticated private label skincare emerging in the market, manufactures must ensure that they highlight the superiority of their products in terms of formulation and ingredients. By reassuring consumers of the effectiveness of any claims their products make, such as anti-aging and anti-wrinkle formulations, brands can encourage consumers to seek value through trading-up for the best experience. Consumer perceptions of private labels are changing, highlighting the need for brands to promote value, both through lower pricing and premium offerings. ""Many consumers now believe there is little difference between more expensive and premium branded skincare and private label alternatives, and manufacturers must defend their market share from further erosion,"" Allen concludes."
2014: Year of the strong brows,"If fashion and beauty fads come and go in endless cycles, strong eyebrows are a good example of this. During the 1980s, Brooke Shields wore hers proudly, just as Cara Delevingne does today, inspiring teenagers everywhere to copy the look. The trend should reinforce the surge of eyebrow products, already pointed out by The NPD Group. As early as last year, the craze was well underway in the UK as the Scouse Brow, the dark, thick yet overly manicured style worn by a certain type of British reality TV star. But the trend truly took off in the rest of Europe in 2014. Between January and October 2014, French women have spent about 4 million euros in eyebrows makeup products (+22% compared to the same period last year) [1]. This year, strong brows were all over magazine covers and runways, and in light of the Spring/Summer 2015 shows - from the rainbow brows at Badgley Mischka to the abundant brow piercings at Rodarte - the trend shows no sign of stopping. Clearly, thin and subtle brows are out, at least for now. Like any major beauty fad, strong eyebrows have been good for makeup brands' business. Total sales of brow products rose 31% in the US, 52% in the UK and about 20% in France in the first five months of 2014 (compared to the same period in 2013), The NPD Group reports. While most cosmetics makers have always had a few brow pencils in their catalogs, the selection is now more impressive than ever. Eyebrow kits and palettes are the new must-have items, and new services are popping up everywhere to train clients on how to shape and perfect their arch (Benefit's Brow Bar, for example). For even more proof that big brows are all the rage, one simply has to type ""Cara Delevingne brows"" into Google. In addition to multiple blogs and social network posts paying tribute to Burberry's favorite supermodel, makeup fans will find a host of tutorials on how to achieve her look."
Perfumes: Combining fragrances for even more personalization,"The mix & match solution by Comptoir Sud Pacifique was a pioneer in the 70s. These creations usually contained only one flower and few ingredients, which made it possible to recreate an olfactory pyramid, and enabled well-informed people to compose as many of their own creations as they wished. When Valérie Pianelli bought out the brand four years ago, she brought the concept back to the forefront and offered smaller, 30 ml sizes for a multitude of combinations. Jo Malone's Fragrance Combining™ is inspired by the same concept: one chooses their favourite Cologne among the fruity, floral, woody, or another category of the collection, and then combines it to another, fresher or warmer, to vary the effect. And with their creations made ""in situ"" and on demand, Le Labo or Ex Nihilo also bank on perfume personalization. The recent acquisition of Le Labo by Estée Lauder shows the growing interest in these concepts that cultivate the difference. Their public often yearns for olfactory emotions, and enjoys both seeking a differentiated perfumed identity and getting involved in the creation process. ""We live in a hedonistic society, and creating one's own perfume puts people in a good mood"", Valérie Pianelli emphasizes. Sophie Roger, of Parfums d'Orsay, notes that ""the concept is intended for customers able to understand what this can reveal"". And among them can be found Middle East women consumers, who represent a flagship market in prestige perfumery, and for whom fragrance alchemy is a tradition. The Arabic origin of the word Alchemy is actually Al Kimiya, the name of the new Parfums d'Orsay line of combined fragrances. Amber & Musk and Oud & Wood, two extracts with intense hints to be matched or not, depending on the moods and the seasons. Whether they target curious customers or others familiar with the concept, all these brands share the fundamental notion of guidance. ""Even if some mixtures are more obvious and well-known than others, we ought to give customers the means to learn how to make them"", Valérie Pianelli concludes."
"UK self-tan market driven by youngest generations, reveals Mintel","UK young men are amongst the country's highest fake tan users. Over a quarter (27%) of 16-24 year old men have used this product category. According to Mintel [1], fake-tan usage is only slightly higher amongst women aged 16-24 (29%) and 25-44 (24%). Moreover, it seems male interest in self-tan doesn't stop there - across all consumer groups, males aged 16-24 are the most likely to have used salon spray with tan (20%), compared to a national average of just one in ten (9%). Meanwhile, over the last 12 months, almost a quarter (23%) of 16-24 year old men say they have used a pre-tan accelerator, while the same number (21%) have used a sunbed or tanning salon. Some 12% of the same group have used gradual tanner, while 8% have used oral tanning supplement - again proving to be the highest group of users. ""High usage of self-tanning products amongst young men suggests that they may be aspiring to recreate looks inspired by celebrities. With summer becoming a distant memory, and as the nation gears up for a wet winter, our research suggests that young men are looking to extend the summer look with a year round tan,"" said Roshida Kahnom, Senior Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. In terms of overall usage of self tanning products, on average 16% of Brits have used self tan in the past twelve months, followed by gradual tanner at 15%. One in ten (10%) have used pre-tan accelerator, while the same number (10%) have used tanning oil or lotion without SPF. Just 7% have used oral tanning supplements. Mintel estimates the UK self-tan market at £60 million in 2014. ""With self-tanning products traditionally associated with unnatural results, older people may be less willing to try it. Additionally, self-tanning products can be tricky to apply, which may make it difficult for older people who tend to have looser and less hydrated skin. Product innovations in self-tanning for older people, designed for looser skin, could make it more appealing to older people,"" Roshida continues."
"Perfume, 10 tips for a successful launch","1 • Pay particular attention to coherence Price, positioning, creation, distribution channel… everything should be measured, calibrated, and mutually dependent. It is essential to ensure a good mixture of these elements. 2 • Define your target If you know your target, you know your customers: it justifies everything. The market research should be accurate. 3 • Do not neglect distribution Before initiating the project, it is crucial to consider your distributors as committed partners. If they do not highlight the product, it will not come out, nor will it sell… 4 • Be clear Not only on the appearance, but also in your message. The bottle and the name should be easily recognizable and related to a specific story. 5• Create an identity It is very positive for a juice to be instantaneously recognizable, but it is also very rare, as Angel, N°5, or Shalimar are… Above all, a perfume's identity is olfactory, so the creation should stand out to exist. 6 • Tell a story The point is to create an emotion in relation to the fragrance. Great perfumes take us on a journey that means something to us. 7 • Stick to your time Being at the forefront is a good thing, but you should take into account it can take time for the product to position itself on the market. It is essential to evolve with your time, because a product that is TOO innovative might be judged a bit TOO retrospectively. 8 • Be legitimate Many brands originally not in the perfume sector are stepping out of their traditional sphere to reach this new Eldorado. Beware not to try and shake up the codes too much: make sure you are legitimate in your olfactory world and avoid ""business at all costs"" or ""SKUs for new"" strategies. 9 • Do not ostensibly copy your competitors! In the perfumery sector, it is very hard, even impossible to identically reproduce a formula. But openly trying to get close to it reveals a lack of creativity, which usually fails. Juice, bottle, concept… you should ensure you know your competitors to avoid unintentional copies (everything is known, everything is felt). 10 • Choose the right moment! It is better to wait for the right moment to make yourself heard or… to know how to be cheeky, but it is risky!"
Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong: Simply huge!,"This show is a phenomenon of its own..., which once again, this year, has demonstrated the overwhelming rise of the Asian subcontracting industry in all areas, whether in the packaging, formulation or full service sector. Probably never before have so many plastic processing and filling specialists been seen together before across all sectors, not to mention the plethora of electronic manufacturers, who are fully investing the sector of connected beauty, and never before foreign pavilions have brought together so many exhibitors from around the globe. During the first two days of the show the aisles were packed with visitors and finding one's way right from the entrance hall at 9:30 a.m., most of the time was nothing short of a miracle. Stands were everywhere. You could see that organizers had struggled to meet demand. To keep up with the flow of visitors, many temporary lanes had been hastily set up with barriers. Organizers had also opened a new hall called ""Spot On Beauty"" with some 150 new exhibitors spread over 3700 sqm. First observation, the impressive surge in the number of suppliers in the make-up industry with an obviously steadily growing number of packaging converters trying to outdo one another in ingenuity with airtight compacts, mascara, lip gloss or lipstick applicators. Not to mention make-up accessory suppliers of all kinds. And competition promises to be tough! Second observation, the number of full service companies that have mushroomed everywhere and offer the full array of services expected by hundreds of new brands that have emerged on Southeast Asian markets in recent months. The same phenomenon can be seen in the skincare market with an ever increasing number of new players. A much coveted Southeast Asian market, to say the least! Wandering in the halls dedicated to foreign pavilions, was enough to be convinced. The centre of gravity of the growth of the global beauty industry has truly moved to Southeast Asia and probably for a long time. Industry players in the United States and Europe will have to be particularly inventive, flexible and dynamic, to withstand such a surge. Fortunately, the Asian regional market is active enough to monopolize this huge industrial power, but for how long? Especially as there is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of quality and productivity for local companies. For many European and American companies, this is no time to rest on one's laurels. The Asian wave is already at the corner! For its next edition of Cosmoprof Asia will celebrate its 20th anniversary and open its doors on 11th-13th November 2015."
Italian consumers put on make-up to counteract signs of aging,"A recent report from Canadean [1] finds that desire for anti-aging products is greatest among Italians aged 45-54, with over a quarter of their make-up consumption motivated by this need. As the country's population is aging rapidly, the number of consumers aged 45 and over will increase from 48.6% in 2013 to 51.3% in 2018, further driving demand for make-up with age aligned properties. ""To ensure the effectiveness and longevity of make-up, Italian consumers look for products that match their skin best,"" says the market research firm. For example, the skin of young adults tends to be more oily and prone to acne, but as consumers age their skin becomes drier and requires additional moisturising and nourishment. Moreover, aging skin is prone to age spots and fine lines that older consumers want to hide. According to Veronika Zhupanova, analyst at Canadean: ""Consumers will demand for make-up with age-aligned properties. For example, the younger generation will seek for oil-control ingredients that give their skin a matte look and hide acne marks, while older consumers will prioritise products with 'lifting' and 'firming' functions. Older generations will also pay greater attention to the ingredients they already know, such as collagen and retinol that prevent skin from the aging process."" ""To produce age-specific make-up, manufacturers should seek for inspiration in skincare products which explore these needs and provide constant innovations,"" adds Canadean. Currently, the demand for make-up that meet age-specific needs is greatest in facial care, which reflects how consumers associate healthy and glowing skin with a youthful appearance. To tap into the trend further, manufacturers should extend their anti-aging skincare products into eye and lip make-up. ""Due to different age-related skin needs, manufacturers should consider designing products for different age groups more explicitly. However, they should not forget that consumers put on make-up for beauty reasons, which means that functionality of make-up should remain secondary to its decorative properties,"" Zhupanova concludes."
Emerging markets to impact FMCG trends,"According to Canadean, the next wave of emerging economies will have one of the deepest impacts on global consumer markets in the next five years. ""Companies have already seen the value in setting up innovation centres in emerging economies to help tailor their products to consumer needs. However, innovations from emerging economies are now also transmitted back to developed countries,"" says Ronan Stafford, analyst at Canadean. The market research firm values to up to US$1.66 billion worldwide in 2018, the impact of changes in consumer behaviour and industry practices in countries such as Mexico, Thailand and Egypt, and innovations from these countries that are transferred back to developed economies. Canadean also found that brands see the new markets in Latin America, Asia and Africa as a frontier for packaging innovation and exciting new flavours. ""We increasingly see pack formats developed to keep costs low in emerging economies used to target austerity-minded consumers in Europe. Meanwhile, consumers are now highly aware of global culinary trends and want more experiential flavours. This means that Far Eastern and African flavours and ingredients are high in demand,"" Stafford says. ""The more big brands invest in targeting consumers in Lagos, Jakarta and Hanoi, the better they will meet the value and experience-seeking needs of consumers in New York, London, Madrid and Sydney,"" he adds. According to Canadean, women aged 45 and over from low and middle income households in urban areas will be early adopters of innovation arising from companies investing in the next wave of emerging economies. Manufacturers therefore need to simplify formulations. ""This includes strategies such as using fewer ingredients to lower costs or investing in lightweight packaging that is still robust enough to withstand poor quality supply chains,"" says Stafford. ""These opportunities in the next emerging economies need to be targeted now, or companies will lag behind their competitors on not just opening up new markets, but in better meeting the needs of their current customers,"" he concludes."
High-end cosmetics in China,"Chinese consumers no longer see cosmetics and beauty products as an unaffordable luxury, dedicated to some the happy few, but as current consumption goods or even basic necessities. Today, the Chinese cosmetics market represents more than 134 billion yuans (more than 17 billion euros), compared with only 200 million yuans (26 million euros) at the beginning of the 1980's. International brands are leading the industry: they occupy 54% of China's cosmetics market. The American brand Procter & Gamble is ahead, followed closely by L'Oréal. Then come the Japanese group Shiseido and Unilever. As a result of the tremendous rise of China's cosmetics industry and despite the numerous barriers to trade, foreign brands are rushing into China and competition becoms ever tougher. The main foreign investors in the cosmetics market come from the United States, France, Japan, South Korean and Germany. Chinese consumers are fascinated by Western high-end brands and trust them. This explains the success of foreign brands in the cosmetics sector, and their domination on the market compared to Chinese brands. However, the Chinese market is evolving very quickly. Local brands are gaining ground and most of them aim to market high quality products as well. Beyond their admiration and fascination for high-end Western brands, Chinese consumers are, above all, looking for quality offers and the trend is towards cosmetics products based on natural ingredients. Chinese customers are becoming increasingly demanding and desire to find products that perfectly meet their expectations. French and foreign cosmetics companies have an interest in penetrating the market by asserting a high end positioning: this strategy will allow them to develop their business under optimal conditions in China. Demand remains high and often unsatisfied in China's second- and third-tier cities. In terms of cosmetics offers, make-up and perfumes seem to hold an untapped potential: according to some studies, about 90% of Chinese women use cosmetic creams, while only a third of them use make-up and less than 10% wear a perfume. Thus, Estée Lauder now focuses on make-up and perfumes to attract Chinese customers and gain vacant market shares. Estée Lauder is also preparing the launch of several fragrances, only dedicated to Chinese customers. Furthermore, the US group, well known for its specific developments adapted to the needs of particular countries, has already launched Nutritious, a brand dedicated to the Chinese market. L'Oréal, for which China has become one of the most important markets, aims to conquer 250 million new consumers by 2020. The group has recently decided to stop selling its mass-market brand Garnier - which is its second brand in terms of turnover - in China. Garnier had never been a great success in China: not high end enough to arouse the average and wealthy customer, and not low cost enough to attract other Chinese consumers, constantly looking for discounts and good deals. Unlike India, where L'Oréal has penetrated the market thanks to Garnier and its general public positioning, in China, the group has found its place on the local market thanks to a high end positioning strategy, by playing the card of affordable luxury. In terms of distribution, L'Oréal has decided to sell its products in major cosmetics distribution chains and hypermarkets, but essentially with a seller dedicated to customer advice, in order to be distinguished from cosmetics mass-consumption products and maintain its high end image in Chinese customers' mind. The group adopts the same positioning strategy with its make-up brand Maybelline, leader in in China. Another illustration is the success of US group Amway in China, especially thanks to its cosmetics products offer, marketed under the brand name ""Artistry"". Thanks to a wide range of skincare and make-up products, the high-end brand has succeeded in reflecting a prestigious image in the Chinese customers' mind. In China, Artistry does not play the card of affordable luxury. On the contrary, the brand aims to be only affordable for a very wealthy customer. Actually, this positioning strategy appeared very efficient in a country that records an increasing number of wealthy and very wealthy individuals."
Consumers turn towards anti-pollution cosmetics,"According to the market research firm, there was a 40% rise in the number of beauty and personal care products launched carrying an anti-pollution claim, between 2011 and 2013 in the Asia-Pacific region. This has raised APAC's share of global beauty and personal care launches holding anti-pollution claims from 22% in 2011 to 27% in 2013. Furthermore, Mintel's research shows that many consumers are looking to wash away the effects of their surroundings in particular, as the number of soap and bath products launched in the APAC region carrying an anti-pollution claim grew 63% between 2011 and 2013. In addition, hair product launches carrying anti-pollution claims have grown 61% while skincare launched with anti-pollution claims grew 46% over the same time period. ""As awareness of the effects of pollution grows, we are seeing the expansion of beauty products that shield from its effect, with an increasing number of consumers living more urbanised lifestyles, looking forward we expect to see a rising number of beauty and personal care products launched carrying more specific anti-pollution terminology, that specify the sources and composition of the pollutants,"" commented Emmanuelle Moeglin, Global Fragrance and Colour Cosmetics Analyst at Mintel. Whilst the APAC region has seen particularly strong growth of anti-pollution beauty products, this claim has also posted strong growth globally. Between 2011 and 2013 there was a 10% rise in the number of beauty products launched carrying this claim around the world, with a 60% rise in the number of soap and bath products launched with this claim, a 31% rise in hair products with this claim and a 22% rise in skincare launches carrying this claim. Although demonstrating smaller growth in comparison to other categories, skincare products are still the most likely category to carry an anti-pollution claim, with 3.7% of skincare products launched globally in 2013 holding this, up from 3.2% in 2011. Moreover, there are a growing number of eye care products being launched carrying an anti-pollution claim with 7.2% of eye-care products launched so far in 2014 carrying this, up from 3.9% in 2012. Mintel has identified growing consumer awareness of pollution to be a key trend for 2015. Indeed, in the UK, 83% of adults feel lifestyle has a big impact on skin and 22% of women look to cleansers to protect their skin from the environment or pollution. Older consumers are a particular target, 31% of UK women who use facial skincare products use a moisturiser to counter the effects of pollution or the environment on the skin, but the figure rises to 48% of women aged 65 and over. ""In 2015, pollution will become a key media focus. The cosmetics industry in particular has been awakening consumers to the immediate, visible, personal effects of pollution. As a result, we can expect protective claims against PM 2.5 [1] and others to grow in product marketing in skincare and cosmetics in general,"" concluded Richard Cope, Senior Trends Consultant at Mintel."
Brazil's obsession with image boosts make-up sales,"The value of the make-up market in Brazil will increase from BRL 7.1 billion (US$3.2 billion) in 2013 to BRL 13.4 billion (US$5.1 billion) by the end of 2018, found Canadean in a recent report [1]. Despite the stagnation of the rest of the economy, which has been registering negative economic growth in three of the last four quarters, the market of beauty and cosmetic products in Brazil is remaining buoyant. ""This shows that the Brazilian make-up market is booming - even in times of low consumer confidence and in poorer areas of the country,"" says the market research firm. According to Canadean, the average consumer of beauty products in Brazil is young and female: Brazilian women applied a make-up product 24 billion times in 2013, accounting for 85% of all make-up applications. Moreover, women aged between 16 and 34 carry out 40% of make-up applications. ""Young women seek a professional image in the workplace and are more willing to experiment for special occasions. They are also more likely to follow the fashion, regularly changing their make-up look to keep up with the latest trends,"" highlights Kirsty Nolan, analyst at Canadean. Selling products directly to consumers away from a fixed retail location is very popular in the Brazilian make-up market. Direct sales provide an enjoyable experience for consumers, as they can take a little time out to browse the catalogue and build a good relationship with their local sales representative. Catalogue order companies such as Avon and Natura are leading in direct sales. Those companies can not only offer consumers a good range of products straight to their door at affordable prices, but they also have more control over profit margins. ""International make-up brands need to adopt some of these principles in order to succeed in the Brazilian make-up market. Products need to be affordable and attainable for young women. Effective channels of distribution, such as agreements with established direct sellers or relationships with local shops and salons, are the key to success,"" concludes Nolan The dynamism of the make-up market in Brazil is promising for the organizers of MakeUp in São Paulo, a B2B tradeshow which will gather the suppliers and subcontractors of the makeup industry (packaging, formulas, full-service), for the first time in Brazil on December 03-04, 2014."
Luxury and digital: creating dreams while remaining down-to-earth,"Most luxury players initially viewed them with much scepticism - they were too often limited to online selling - which made it difficult for digital technologies to impose themselves in a world where customer satisfaction first has to do with giving advice and providing personalized services. In practice, and despite numerous attempts to make an impact, few tools and applications did revolutionize the buying experience in this sector. ""Many experimental tools were launched, but most were not quite finalized yet, and they did not work well,"" underlines Jean-Bernard Debreux, founder and CEO of The Illegal Factory, a production company specialized in digital marketing which works for Dior, Philips, or Toyota, among others. However, this specialist of augmented reality is convinced the technologies available now are mature. ""The turning point came with the improved capacities of the smartphones used by customers today, which represent the most convenient medium for new functionalities."" Yet, brands still need to have a clear vision of the service they intend to provide customers. ""Technology for technology's sake is just devoid of interest,"" adds Jean-Bernard Debreux. Too many solutions are designed mainly for communication and are thus not efficient with consumers. There is often a discrepancy between the promises made by digital technologies and the reality experienced by customers. In the luxury sector, it is just not possible to make this type of risky experiments. Two great trends can be observed today: the installation of applications for customer service and follow-up in stores, and the dematerialization of the fitting phase. ""In all cases, the digital tool must really create a new experience and represent an actual advantage both for customers and the brand."" For example, thanks to augmented reality technologies, a brand can send its VIP customers an invitation card so they can visualize the products on their mobile devices, smartphones or tablets, in real virtual stores that offer an ultra-realistic 3D version of the products, and in particular the correct perception of their real size. Beyond directly commercial applications, digital technologies can also contribute to building a brand's world. To Ludovic Jokiel, co-founder of the MUTT sound design agency, the sound atmosphere in sales outlets is a key element of the buying experience. ""Today, the technologies available make it possible to adapt the sound atmosphere to what is actually happening in the store, and even to the profiles of the customers present at a given moment,"" he explains. However, as entertaining as they can be, these technologies often imply to collect personal data, some of which are rather sensitive because they concern physiological characteristics such as the skin colour, the nature of the hair, etc. ""The companies that market or use this type of tool must pay attention to strictly abide by the law as regards the protection of personal data,"" warn François Klein and Matthieu Bourgeois, associate lawyers at the KGA law firm. Here are some of the points laid down in the Loi informatique et libertés [1] in France: – Clear and loyal information for the user on the purpose of data processing and on the addressees that will receive them. Such information can be mentioned in the Terms and Conditions for Use the customer will be asked to accept before using the application – The necessary procedures involved with the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), the French independent administrative authority for data protection – The technical and legal safety measures to be taken as regards data processing and storage Similar rules are applicable in most European countries. If the digital dream has already come true for brands, they do need to remain down-to-earth to avoid any bad surprises."
Natural and organic cosmetics boom at Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech 2014,"The 2014 edition of the Cosme Tokyo (finished products) and Cosme Tech (suppliers) tradeshows, which were held on 20-22 October at the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition centre, gathered 542 exhibitors from 37 countries/regions and welcomed more than 20,700 exhibitors. ""We grew the number of exhibitors by 50% compared to last year,"" says Hajime Suzuki, Group VP International Sales & Marketing, at Reed Exhibitions. ""Furthermore, the number of international exhibitors has doubled,"" he added. This increased was especially noticeable in Cosme Tokyo, the event dedicated to finished products, with brands from Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Korea, the United Kingdom or Thailand. ""This evolution is linked to the Japanese market itself. As the Japanese population is ageing and decreasing, Japanese companies are changing their mind with regard to foreign markets,"" explains Suzuki. ""Both companies and consumers are increasingly interested in novelties coming from abroad."" This year all conferences therefore enjoyed a simultaneous English translation. And as per last year, the organizers invited several delegations of international buyers, mostly from ASEAN countries. Another amazing novelty of this edition of Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech was the dramatic surge of natural and organic products, both in the section dedicated to brands and in the section dedicated to suppliers. According to the organizers, this evolution corresponds to a real trend in Japan, where various outlets dedicated to natural cosmetics have recently opened, such as Cosme Kitchen, which offers European and Asian natural and organic brands, as well as its own line. ""There is a real interest from consumers,"" confirms Valérie Lemaire, Director of the certification company Ecocert Greenlife, for which Japan is a booming market. However, the subtle differences between sustainable, natural and organic products remain quite esoteric in the mind of the great majority of Japanese consumers who hardly know the different certifications. According to Minako Suzuki, Marketing Manager at Weleda Japan, ""the interest in natural products has increased considerably after the earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear problems, but Japanese consumers are very sensitive to trends and natural brands with a small notoriety need to invest in communication to enhance the loyalty of their clients."" Suppliers are also addressing the new demand but meet some difficulties in formulating organic and natural cosmetics due to the lack of certified ingredients available locally. D.S.A. has been one of the first to focus on these products by importing made in France formulas adapted to Japanese needs. ""Currently, natural anti-UV are the products that interest the most our customers,"" says Alexander Saidot, President. Merry Do Beauty Products also opted for the importation of natural formulas from Italian, French and Polish partners. However, the company recently created Organic Earth, a subsidiary dedicated to this market, which now operates its own factory. ""The phenomenon is new in Japan, but the late development of the market could turn as an advantage as the quality of natural formulations has made significant progress,"" said Junko Shiraishi. For the next edition, the aims of the organizers are to continue to strengthen the internationalisation of the event and, of course, to welcome an increased number of exhibitors, thanks to the growing popularity of the event, particularly in Asia. In order to have a larger exhibition space, the dates of the combined events are changing again and the next editions of Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech will be held on 20-22 January, 2016."
Beauty Success and Passion Beauté join forces to weigh on the French market,"Another step towards the increasing concentration of the French selective perfumery: the two biggest independent retail networks, Beauty Success and Passion Beauté, decided to create a joint venture, Beauty Alliance France, to consolidate their purchases and coordinate their trade marketing plans. Each of the two founding entities owns half the shares of the new structure, which will be co-managed by Philippe Georges for Beauty Success and Jean Pierre Dry for Passion Beauté and led by a steering committee of eight people, four from Beauty Success and four from Passion Beauté. Thanks to this alliance, the market share of the two retailers exceeds 10%. ""The required threshold to weigh on the sector,"" said the two leaders. Beauty Alliance France, the result of the union of the two retailers ranks fourth in France, with a market share of about 11% in 2014 and 450 beauty shops, including 400 beauty salons, employing 2,400 staffs and a cumulated turnover estimated at 330 million euros in 2014. In a context marked by the recent acquisition of Nocibé by Douglas, creating the leading French retail network in terms of doors, Beauty Success and Passion Beauté probably had no choice but to agree on what they call themselves an ""alliance of common sense."" Today, the three leading beauty retailers in France - Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé-Douglas - represent 75% of the market, all of them enjoying a European or global size. Beauty Success and Passion Beauté also expect the competition from e-commerce to increase, in particular from pure players such as Amazon. ""The digitization of points of sale and the creation of an effective CRM also involve heavy investments. These are key issues and cannot afford to be left behind,"" says Philippe Georges. Beauty Alliance France also becomes a member of Beauty Alliance International, the European umbrella organization for independent beauty retail networks in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In Germany, the Beauty Alliance gathers 900 beauty shops, ranking second behind Douglas, and holds 22% of the market. Of course, this success inspired Beauty Success and Passion Beauté to create Beauty Alliance France. Both retailers intend to leverage on their assets (proximity, sense of service and entrepreneurship) to become a valuable alternative for beauty brands. ""Our two networks are mostly established in medium and small cities and enjoy a good geographical complementary. Strongly rooted in their territories, our entrepreneurs have a very good knowledge of their customers,"" highlights Philippe Georges. The two leaders bet on a significant growth in their market share from 11% today to 15% in 2019, with a turnover of 420 million euros. The obligation made to Nocibé-Douglas by the French anti-trust authority to sell 38 stores, including 25 franchisees, could help the Beauty Alliance France to reach its ambitious goal. ""The new Alliance would be happy to welcome these entrepreneurs,"" commented the two managers."
"""Our ambition is to become the online beauty leader"", Flavien d'Audiffret, Amazon France","""At first, we intended to satisfy our customers who often look for high-end and prestige brands on Amazon.fr. So it is in a spirit of differentiation from the other Amazon shops that we decided to create Beauté Prestige,"" explains Flavien d'Audiffret, Manager of the Beauté and Beauté Prestige shops on Amazon.fr. Right now, a thousand products and 40 brands, including 18 from France, are available online. Most of them are niche and/or very high-end brands rather than the usual big names of the selective channel: Parfum d'Orsay, Miller Harris, L'Artisan Parfumeur, Heeley, Frapin, or Erno Laszlo, Codage, and Argentum in skincare, and David Mallett and Massato in hair care. ""We wanted to build a sales showcase of local brands to differentiate ourselves"", specifies Flavien d'Audiffret. While Euromonitor foresees a 3.3 billion dollar increase for luxury perfumes by 2018, and Harrods is inaugurating its prestige Salon de Parfums, Amazon aims at defending a voluntarist vision: making prestige products which are not widely distributed available to the largest number of people possible, with good service quality and delivery in one day. ""We are proud to be able to make these brands more accessible, as they are distributed in a very selective way, and some of them are hardly or not present in France, like Rouge Bunny Rouge"". Each of them remains in its own world. ""We endeavour to recreate the brand's environment, its design and history, a description of its products, and to offer its whole range. It is not Amazon's marketing strategy that prevails, but that of the brands we reproduce as best we can,"" Flavien d'Audiffret declares. The initiative is under close scrutiny by independent distribution channels, as it conveys the American giant's clear determination to get the first rank in online beauty. ""This sector grows at a 30% rate per year on the Internet, and although our traditional categories (books, DVDs…) are still significant, Beauty is definitely emerging on Amazon. Our ambition is to become the online leader on this market, as is already the case in the United States"", asserts Flavien d'Audiffret, who promises to widen the brand selection over the next few months. As the first month has come to an end, the assessment is mostly based on the feedback from brands. Amazon affirms their partners are greatly satisfied and directly committed and associated with the future website developments. As they are limited by a narrow channel of independent perfumeries, these brands see in this new network a growth opportunity that is hard not to seize given the difficulty to solve the equation of economic profitability. However, not all comments were positive, as some brands consider the image of Amazon does not correspond to their positioning. Now Amazon still has to talk consumers into ordering products they do not or hardly know. ""New customers who did not use to buy anything on Amazon are now led to visit our online store due to the buzz, which is really satisfactory,"" notes Flavien d'Audiffret. Web users are guided by several functionalities and tips from beauty editors to make a choice, but for them to make a real discovery there is now a ten-product box available in both sales and miniature formats, and Amazon offers it for orders of 60 euros or more. This selection from the cosmetics and perfume brands present on the Beauté Prestige Amazon e-shop will be available until out of stock."
"Boundaries between mainstream and multicultural beauty brands to blur, finds Kline","The proportion of women members of the so-called ""ethnic minorities"" - such as African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and mixed-race people - is increasingly important in the United States and they are expected to become the majority around 2040. According to Kline & Company, the rapidly growing ethnic populations have given way to intensified competition among beauty brands. Some multicultural beauty marketers are trying to break boundaries between general and multicultural beauty. For instance, brands such as Carol's Daughter are positioning away from being an exclusive ethnic brand to target a broader audience, regardless of ethnicity. This holds particularly true in the natural personal care segment where ethnic hair brand Shea Moisture is now rebranding to become suitable for all consumers. ""This widening approach helps move multicultural brands beyond the ethnic section of the beauty aisle to sit side-by-side nationally advertised brands,"" comments Donna Barson, Senior Associate at Kline's Consumer Products practice. ""However, this audience expansion needs to be done without alienating long-time consumers who might feel deserted if they feel like their brand no longer speaks exclusively to them."" Concurrently, mainstream brands continue to develop tactics to capture a growing percentage of the ethnic personal care market. While mainstream brands have long reached ethnic consumers via the use of spokesmodels and targeted advertising, many brands now use beauty advisors who speak the language of the local ethnic community, whether it is Mandarin, Vietnamese, or Spanish, to create a greater connection with these consumers. Thanks to globalisation, some also launch products targeting certain ethnic groups in the United States that are simultaneously released in that group's country of origin. According to Kline, the movement of mainstream companies into the multicultural space will not only open possibilities of more mergers and acquisitions in the coming years, but it will also be beneficial for consumers as they will be provided with a wider array of products targeting their needs. Smaller multicultural companies will also need to innovate in order to gain sales and create a niche for themselves or position themselves for a potential acquisition. In the 'Multicultural Beauty and Grooming Products: U.S. Market Analysis and Opportunities' report, Kline forecasts the ethnic beauty market will continue to face intensified competition from general cosmetic and toiletry brands until the end of the forecast period in 2019, and the fine line between mainstream and multicultural markets will continue to blur."
Sales of natural cosmetics boosted by consumer awareness and innovation,"While their definition of the products category is different, Grand View Research and Kline are reaching the same conclusion: sales of natural and organic cosmetics are growing faster than the rest of the beauty market. According to a post by Kline's VP of consumer products Carrie Mellage, the global natural and organic personal care market has registered double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive year since Kline began reporting the segment separately in 2007. ""Growing consumer awareness and increasing efficacy of natural personal care products continues to attract consumers who are looking to move away from chemically processed personal care products. Plant-based ingredients were once enough to entice consumers; today a product's function and efficacy are now regarded as at least as important as the ingredient source by many consumers,"" she says. According to Grand View Research, skin care was the largest product segment in terms of revenue in 2013, accounting for over 32% of the global market. Hair care was the second largest product segment and accounted for around 25% of market share in terms of revenue in 2013. ""Increasing awareness among consumers regarding harmful effects of synthetic products on the body coupled with high appearance consciousness has fuelled the demand for organic skin care products. In addition, frequent product launches and widening of distribution channels is further expected to raise the demand,"" confirms Grand View Research. While North America and Europe are currently the biggest markets, Brazil and Asia are the fastest growing regions both up around 15% in 2013, according to Kline - although these markets regularly enjoy high growth across the overall market. ""The steady rise of the segment in Europe and the United States, where the natural personal care market is one of few areas showing sustained high growth, is perhaps more notable,"" underlines Carrie Mellage. According to Kline, in 2013, Europe saw a 6% uptick in natural personal care sales, more than double the pace of the total personal care market, which is estimated to have increased by about 3% in 2013. Likewise, the natural segment in the United States surged by 7% compared to a mere 2% rise for the overall beauty market."
Trends: Towards hair free bodies?,"For today's men, hair removal has extended past a simple shave of the face. According to a new research from Mintel [1], 50% of all Brits admit there is more pressure nowadays for men to remove or groom body hair. Over the last 12 months, some 55% of men say they have removed hair from their head, this is followed by the pubic region at 29%, chest at 13%, underarms at 12%, back at 9%, bottom at 6%, arms at 5%, legs at 4% and feet 2%. Just 30% of men say they have not removed hair from their body in the last year. Additionally, a quarter (25%) of Britain's men admit to removing hair from their eyebrows. ""It is becoming increasingly commonplace for men, particularly under-30s, to remove hair from their body as behaviours once described as metrosexual are becoming increasingly mainstream,"" said Charlotte Libby, Senior Beauty Analyst, Mintel. Overall, one in five (19%) men claim they feel expected to remove hair from their torso, while around the same number (18%) say they feel the pressure to remove hair from their underarms and 13% from their legs. Furthermore, it is younger men in particular who are feeling the pressure to achieve a hair free body, with some six in ten (58%) 16-24-year-old men agreeing they feel pressure to remove or groom body hair, compared to 22% of over-65s. And while 42% of Brits believe it is fashionable for men to have beards, almost the same number (39%) say they feel pressure from others to keep their facial hair neat and tidy. As many as six in ten (59%) consumers believe it looks unprofessional for men to have an ungroomed face in the workplace. Of course, it is not just men who are feeling the pressure to remove hair, almost three quarters (73%) of all UK consumers believe there is more pressure nowadays for women to remove body hair. Indeed, just 8% of women have not removed hair in the UK in the past 12 months. Some 82% of women remove hair from their legs, while a further 78% remove hair from their underarms and 57% from their pubic region. And it doesn't stop there, the quest for a hair free body sees a further 15% removing hair from their arms, 7% from the feet, 4% from the chest, 3% from their bottom and 2% from their back. The impact of charitable and other initiatives such as 'Armpits 4 August' and 'Hairy Legs Club' that have tried to initiate a trend towards un-groomed body hair and a more natural look appears quite limited. In terms of sales, whilst the UK men's shaving and hair removal market was impacted by price promotions and fashion leading away from a clean shave in 2013, it has returned to growth with sales of an estimated GBP 624 million (about EUR 794 million) in 2014, up 2.1% from sales in 2013 which reached GBP 611 million (EUR 777 million). ""Innovation in the shaving and hair removal market continues to focus on male-oriented products, with a particular trend towards male body hair removal and a return to tradition-inspired shaving and facial hair grooming,"" Charlotte Libby continues. The NPD Group also noted during the summer that sales of women's grooming appliances, like electric shavers and many other in-home personal grooming and hair removal devices, are rising in the USA. ""Inundated with promises of being hair-free by way of a plethora of products and services on the market today, women are compelled to seek smooth skin,"" said Debra Mednick, executive director and home industry analyst, The NPD Group. ""However, the cost and inconvenience of repeated waxing, laser, or other hair removal services outside of their home may have women looking for simpler, more affordable options."""
Rare perfumes seeking recognition,"Although there have been numerous creations, there is a tough financial equation to solve for many brands. To David Frossard, distributor of niche perfumery brands under the Différentes Latitudes label, creator of the Liquides Imaginaires fragrances, and Director of Liquides, the Parisian independent perfumery, ""very high-end perfumery definitely has a great potential"". However, the economic viability of a great number of brands launched over the past few years is actually an issue. ""The market is getting more and more mature, and the suction effect resulting from the interest of department stores in this segment is over"", he explains. The difficulty to combine confidentiality and profitability thus forces brands to remain cautious despite the phenomenal development of niche perfumes over the past decade. Indeed, if it is now possible to create lines large enough and in small volumes, most of the time it results in prices exceeding 100 euros per bottle in store, which is much higher than the average price in a classic selective perfumery. For this price, the number of potential customers cannot but be reduced! And skimping on quality is just not possible. The main value of this perfumery segment is based on its choice of excellence at all levels. ""Lovers of beautiful fragrances want flawless products, they expect small niche brands to position themselves at least on the same level as large groups' brands, but to offer originality as well"", underlines Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, the creator of Parfum d'Empire. Yet, originality represents an additional risk. In order to reduce it, alternative fragrance brands widen their collections to try and cover as many tastes as possible. ""We need to be original and segmenting. We do not do blockbusters that will please as many people possible, but a collection with very qualitative and really diverse scents,"" confirms Brigitte Wormser, who works at Beauté Prestige as the manager of Atkinsons, a brand distributed in about thirty countries through a very selective network. The numerous French brands that try their luck on this market need to turn to export to be successful. Contrary to Germany or Italy, and despite the recent openings of specialized outlets, French distribution is almost entirely controlled by big chains. According to Nicolas Cloutier, the co-founder of Nose, a Parisian retailer specializing in niche fragrances and skincare products, other factors can explain the difficulty to distribute exceptional perfumes: ""the wholly owned stores of several brands, the weakness of the perfumery concepts, the exorbitant rights to a lease, the social security contributions and operating expenses, which add to the already fragile profitability… Besides, the French used to be rather conservative when it came to their choices and values, while Anglo-Saxons were more driven by the risk and importance of being different. Things change, luckily!"" Are they going to, with the arrival of Amazon as a new player? The online sales giant has just inaugurated a platform dedicated to selling confidential perfumery brands in France. ""They're just not the right people"", says Nicolas Cloutier. However, David Frossard disagrees and sees it as an opportunity to satisfy the ""very connected"" customers of the alternative perfumery segment. To Marie Huet, General Manager of Parfums d'Orsay, ""it's really motivating to see a player like Amazon get interested in us, and it's certainly no coincidence."" Together with the four important personalities of alternative perfumery in France – François Hénin, founder of Jovoy, Ana Estevane, co-founder of Perfarium, Luc Gabriel, President of The Different Company, and Nicolas Chabot, President of Le Galion Parfums – Marie Huet will be very keen to federate, represent, help, defend, and promote the whole sector through the Comité Joséphine. The association is accompanied by a commission of experts (journalists, perfumers, conditioners, distributors), and is named after Joséphine de Beauharnais, Napoleon Bonaparte's wife, who was passionate about science and botany. It aims at helping consumers choose better, helping brands communicate better, and helping distributors and outlets better identify the ""authentic brands of rare fragrances"". Those that satisfy the criteria of the quality and commitment charter of the Comité Joséphine [1] will be allowed to join the committee and obtain its quality label."
Makeup resists crisis and appeal to ready-to-wear brands,"Sales of prestige beauty products (brands sold in specialised beauty stores and in department stores) in France declined by 1.5% in value in 2013, after a drop of 0.9% in 2012. However, while sales of skincare products and fragrances declined by 1.7%, makeup ended the year on steady sales. Furthermore, as sales of makeup products grew by 1% on the first eight months of 2014, said the NPD research firm. ""In the long term, it is the category that progressed the most in the selective perfumery channel, growing by 15% between 2006 and 2013,"" says Mathilde Lion, beauty expert at NPD. According to NPD, sales of prestige makeup products in France are expected to rise by about 1% in 2014. Make-up sales remain strong despite the crisis. ""The rise is moderate in value, due to the development of low cost ranges by new players, but sales in volumes are boosted by numerous innovations and new products,"" says NDP. This is the case for mascara brushes or eyebrow gels. While nail polishes benefited from a widening of ranges and colours driven by new fashion trends that encouraged repeated purchases from consumers. In addition, thanks to very low entry-level process, makeup products benefits from impulse purchases. ""Makeup remains a little and reasonable indulgence that one's still considers as accessible,"" said Ms. Lion. Finally, the last factor that helps these products resist crisis is that, thanks to make-up ""one's can buy luxury brands at a reasonable price,"" she added. Besides prestige brands, the French make-up market is captured by mass market brands (L'Oréal Paris ...), and by beauty retailers' (Sephora, Nocibé ...) and mass market private label brands (Carrefour's Les Cosmétiques Design Paris, Intermarché's Labell Paris ...) as well as by the more recent brands launched by textile brands such as H&M, Zara, Camaieu or, lately, Etam. Impacted by consumption cuts made by French consumers, the ready-to-wear market recorded declining sales for six consecutive years, some brands therefore perceive the makeup market as offering alternative growth opportunities. Accessories (leather goods, jewellery and beauty) help read-to-wear brands to recruit new customers, to increase the frequency of store visits and to stimulate additional sales, and therefore to rise the average purchase. Eventually, ""there is still room for new players in the makeup market, as illustrated the recent success of Italian brand Kiko. Clearly, there are market shares to conquer in France,"" in particular in the low cost segment, deems Yves Marin, consumption specialist at Kurt Salmon."
Beauty & Cosmetics: Four trends to be followed,"Customization Helga Hertsig-Lavocah, Trend Manager at Hint Creative Consultancy, deciphered the agro-food industry, which abounds with concepts that it seems could be adapted to the cosmetics industry. The democratization of 3D printing offers unprecedented individualization perspectives. Practises such as adding a dose of actives or transforming a product through a mixture are increasingly used in the tin and drink departments, with launches such as Shake Me by William Saurin or Teavana® Shaken Iced Teas. Chrono-cosmetics and natural harmony Nature is more than ever an important source of inspiration. ""We are getting beyond products stuffed with natural ingredients to turn towards seasonal concepts that can adapt to the skin's specific needs in spring, summer, autumn, or winter, as can be seen with Dong Fang Ji Dao or Arimino Mint Shampoo. In addition, recovering a healthy, depolluted skin by imitating what Nature does best in this field constitutes a strong quest in Asia, but also in most large cities throughout the world. Specific ingredients like garlic, detoxifying mushrooms, or the lotus flower are getting widely used for their renowned depolluting action,"" explains Florence Bernardin, the founder of Info & Inspiration. Communities revolution Today's consumers, and in particular younger generations, are revolutionizing the buying act. ""Women consumers look for disinterested opinions and advice on the Internet before they buy. Blogs' influence on purchases is stronger than the women's press: up to 23% compared to 7%. The democratization of the Do It Yourself also encourages women to watch tutorial videos and learn how to put on their makeup or do their hair. There are 14 million beauty videos on YouTube, and influential people such as Michelle Phan gather up to 7 million followers, whereas brands, despite a strong presence on the market, reach only 500,000, at best,"" underlines Géraldine Cohen, founder of social shopping website The Beautyst. In the USA, the NYX makeup brand reached a turnover of 100 million dollars in ten years by investing neither in the media, nor in advertising, nor in offers. It is an example of success of a pure digital company, and it has just been bought out by L'Oréal. Older consumers On the other hand, women consumers are aging: ""one woman out of two is now aged 50 or more,"" explains Stéphane Soudillat, of Little Less Conversation. And ""86% of them claim they don't understand ads and conclude they must not be destined for them. Yet, the buying power of this age group is of 87 euros per year for a face care product: that's 15 euros more than women aged 40-59 and 47 euros more than the 25-39 age group."" Whether in Asia or North America, a few great players in the cosmetics industry have already seized the opportunities arising from these new demands by offering innovative products and unique marketing concepts. To be continued…"
Haircare claims increasingly align with the skincare sector,"""Haircare has become an exciting space for new product developments, manufacturers are trying to convince consumers that they should adopt a haircare regimen to match their skincare regimen and they're doing this by using a new lexicon, learning from other categories and extending formats into new segments. Claims inspired by skincare and colour cosmetics, such as anti-ageing and product featuring light-reflecting technology, offer exciting growth opportunities for the haircare market,"" said Emmanuelle Moeglin, Global Fragrance and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel, in a speech at the Cosmeeting tradeshow in Paris. According to Mintel's Global New Product Database (GNPD), ""Brightening"" and ""Illuminating"" is the fastest growing claim - with the number of new products carrying this claim globally shooting up from 21% of all global haircare launches in 2010 to 46% in 2014 [1]. The research from Mintel has found anti-ageing haircare has huge scope but is yet to match skincare in this arena – while 27% of facial skincare global launches in 2014 were anti-ageing, only 3% of haircare global launches carried this claim, suggesting opportunities for growth in the haircare sector. Indeed, when it comes to anti-ageing ingredients in haircare, Mintel reveals that almost half (46%) of UK consumers are interested in using them and an additional 19% would pay more for them. Meanwhile, a quarter (26%) of French haircare users notice some changes in their hair as they get older, but just 25% of users remain unsure of the benefits of using anti-ageing haircare products. ""Anti-ageing will increasingly move into haircare and there is scope for a far higher use of biomimetic ingredients especially in stimulating hair growth, offering anti-hair loss and volumising solutions,"" suggests Emmanuelle. The potential of the anti-aging claim in haircare is confirmed by another research focusing on haircare consumption habits of Black consumers in the US [2]. According to Mintel, 42% of Black consumers have tried or would be interested in trying anti-aging hair products. In keeping with the trend of combating the effects of aging, 30% of Black consumers have used or are interested in haircare products that treat baldness and thinning, while 46% have used or would be willing to try colour or tint products. ""The movement toward natural hair - whether natural hair weave or all-natural styles - is making Blacks a lot more conscious about the ingredients they put in their hair. They are looking for ingredients that are natural, restore damaged hair, and make their hair healthy - and they're looking for results. Anti-aging products that include natural ingredients and promise to deliver on restoration are sure to appeal to Black shoppers,"" explains Tonya Roberts, multicultural analyst at Mintel. Finally, also taking inspiration from skincare, customisation in the haircare market is set to continue to grow in popularity as consumers show strong demand for these products. Indeed, in France, three in ten (29%) women express an interest in buying customised hair treatment products designed for their hair needs. ""New entrants in the haircare sector are responding to a rise in demand in customisation by offering customised shampoo, blending bases with concentrated serum and resulting in a made-to-measure haircare products. As consumers increasingly look for a personalised products, we expect this trend to expand into mainstream haircare in 2014 and beyond,"" concludes Emmanuelle Moeglin."
"Mascara, the makeup star","""If there were only one, it would be mascara. It is the one essential makeup product to all women, even the most inexperienced,"" underlines Hélène Lefur, professional makeup artist and trainer. And sales statistics are here to prove it. ""Of our whole catalogue, mascaras are the best-selling products in the 40 countries where we distribute our brand,"" states Anne Delleur, President of Arcancil, the French expert brand for eye makeup, whose story is closely related to compact mascara. ""This represents over 24% of market share in value, in France and on the international scale,"" she adds. The phenomenon is driven by the nude trend. ""The craze for a polished, natural complexion urges women to highlight the gaze that intensifies personality traits. Lashes, and eyebrows as well now, which constitute a booming segment on all markets, and are also worked with mascara, must be treated almost in an artistic manner,"" explains Leïla Rochet-Podvin, Director of Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation, the consulting agency in beauty innovation. Consumers are guided by blogs and tutorials, and are getting familiar with more and more accurate application techniques. Mascara is one of the essential elements of this collection. According to Euromonitor, worldwide sales increased by 4.6% between 2012 and 2013 (2.1% in Europe). Arcancil confirms this rise in all countries, except for Japan and Korea. ""Yet, Asia is actually the continent that has been enhancing the impact of brushes on the market for about ten years, especially with colour brushes,"" notes Florence Bernardin, Director of Information & Inspiration, and Cosmetic Market Analyst for Asia. ""However, mascara is put under pressure by the boom of false eyelashes. They are very easy to put on for Asian women, and they offer many advantages. The real challenge for mascara is to obtain the same results in terms of effects and long wear"". Volume expectations remain the most significant, especially in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. Asians prefer curves and separation for a fan effect. And the main suppliers share this view. ""Our best-selling mascaras are those that claim more volume,"" declares Pilar Gonzalez Gomez, of Geka, which has just launched RunwaySTAR, a brush fitted with five nubs to increase volume, and four-edged bristles at the tip for a push-up effect. As for Albéa, the market leader confirms the volume effect represents ""80% of the world's demand on average, with variations depending on the region."" However, according to Aurélie Émond, Marketing Director for Cosmetic Rigid Packaging, ""mascara has a special place in the kingdom of makeup: products get launched at a phenomenal rate, and promises for volume, length, thickness, curve, and all their combinations make women dream…"" Hence the need to pay very close attention to every single product component, and to brushes in particular, which require real technical wizardry, though it remains too little-known. ""Indeed, imagining or developing a new brush is always a technical challenge, whether it be made of fibres or plastic. The goal is to manage to create a perfect brush-formula-bottle trio."" At the last Cosmopack show in Bologna, Italy, the group unveiled My Style, a range of four fibre brushes adapted to the various effects of length, volume, definition, or curve wanted. ""The brush is a vehicle for communication, it must express the mascara's makeup promise,"" Aurélie Émond insists. As for colours, classic black remains the star on all markets, although it is being challenged by blue or purple in a few countries keen on colours, such as Brazil. Fluorescent or neon colours have a marginal impact, and target the younger ones for occasional uses. The avenues for progress involve effects and finishes, whether sequined, shimmering, pearly, or tear, which the Japanese are crazy about. ""There are many expectations, but the technological response is still disappointing,"" Anne Delleur comments. The demand for volume is getting mixed with expectations for eye care mascaras, already available on the natural segment, as can be seen with the 100% natural Organic wear CC Curl + Care mascara by Physicians Formula, which Leïla Rochet-Podvin found out in the United States. To celebrate its 80th anniversary in 2015, Arcancil will relaunch their mythical compact mascara. The resolutely vintage Cake mascara will be enriched with a formula containing soothing, protective and repairing beeswax. ""We are going to focus our launches on eye care over the next three years. It represents the future of mascara,"" Anne Delleur concludes."
Mascara: a long tradition of innovation,"Mascara is probably For the past years, mascara constantly reinvents itself and continues to surprise and propose innovations. Here is a short historical overview on the main evolutions of the market. Since it was invented in the 19th century by Eugène Rimmel, who used a bulk made of petroleum jelly, mascara has been evolving and transforming almost constantly. In 1923 appears the cake mascara, sold for the first time with a brush as applicator. In 1957 Helena Rubinstein creates a lotion-based cream formula. Mascara-Matic, the first mascara wand and tube applicator is launched. It is the ""first automatic mascara that needs no brush"". In 1959, Maybelline launched the first filaments twisted brush (spiral brush). Then, in 1964, the American brand creates the first mass market tubed mascara: Ultra lash mascara. As for the first moulded brush using thermoplastic elastomer, it was launched in 2004 by the Beiersdorf group for its Nivea Beauty brand. One innovation has been succeeding to another at a fast pace! Mascara is an area of intense innovation: there are actually more than 2,500 patents filled worldwide, be it for packaging, formulas or for new application systems. Formula protection has been heavily investigated, with patents on the use of airless packs for mascara, or on antibacterial brushes. It is true that mascara is one of the most used makeup products in the world and the variety of tastes opens unlimited opportunities to manufacturers. In the U.S., where innovation drives sales, claims are getting increasingly sophisticated. The quest for perfection and eternal youth is also noticeable at the level of eyelashes. Even in Asia, where they compete with false eyelashes, mascaras are not outdone and are seeking to find a new dimension in particular by offering mini brushes to catch all the little lashes, or by treating lashes with anti-aging serum effects, etc."
MakeUp in New York is opening its doors today!,"Premium Beauty News - Figures posted regarding this fourth edition are impressive. How do you explain this ever growing interest one year after another? Sandra Maguarian - The evidence is there! The concept that we have developed in New York, Paris, Seoul and now Sao Paulo, corresponds better to the expectations of the entire professional beauty industry. An event, above all, professional but most of all personalised and friendly. This fourth gathering in New York, which promises to be a success is the result of many months of work and complicity with the suppliers in this industry but also our visitors, in this case their customers, so that each minute of their presence at the show is as profitable as possible. The high profile and the involvement of many big names in the industry, taking part to conferences is a big investment for us but an essential one. Premium Beauty News - From the outside, people don't always realize the huge amount of work it requires. Jean-Yves Bourgeois - I think it's actually does no harm to remind people of the work such an event involves upstream during the twelve months preceding it, and this, at all levels. Especially when you know that its concept is based on the idea of ""full service"". We take care of everything....: the booths, their furniture, the conferences, the events, meals and of course the cocktail party...., which this year will bring several hundred people together. All this mobilizes a lot of people, requires a lot of meetings and trips abroad. The success of MakeUp in New York is clearly the result of four years of work. It is also the result of a global work which started in Paris and continued in Seoul and now Sao Paulo. Premium Beauty News - What do you think of the operation organized by Cosmoprof that will start on the eve of your event to continue during the first day of your show? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - You know, Sandra Maguarian and I have always been in favour of a healthy competition, and we always will. But clearly, this event does not look like it. Coincidentally enough, it was announced a few weeks ago and organized concurrently to MakeUp in New York. Coincidentally enough, it will address mainly themes that relate specifically to the make-up industry. Coincidentally enough, the organization has planned to take in charge, it seems, some of the participants' hotel rooms, participants who, coincidentally enough, for the vast majority of them, happen to be our customers... That's quite a lot of coincidences at once, don't you think? Premium Beauty News - How is the year 2015 shaping up for your four events? Sandra Maguarian - It looks excellent! At a time when precisely other organizers continue to extend their reach to other areas, including ours, we are in fact going strengthen the ""exclusive"" aspect of our shows. MakeUp in Sao Paulo will be positioned exactly that way with the main stakeholders in this industry that are in the process of establishing themselves in this part of the world. MakeUp in Seoul is also looking extremely promising. Not only are Korean companies supporting the event (to note that the Amore Pacific Group has asked to be the preferred partner next year again!) but the share of 'foreign' companies continues to grow. As for MakeUp in Paris, I'm afraid there isn't much to say, aside from the fact that this new 2015 edition promises to be a huge success. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the exhibitors and visitors who everyday renew their support to us."
"Skincare: the future of personalisation is in the lab, Canadean says","Many skincare brands have already responded to the need for individualism by offering their customers in-store skin consultancies to detect their skin type and match them with the right product. Now the first movers in skincare are taking personalisation to a new level when they offer laboratory tests and individually labelled products. A new survey from Canadean [1] finds that many British customers are prepared to go far to find their personal skin cream match: 45% of UK adults say that they are interested in the laboratory approach to personal skincare, and many of these say that they are prepared to go to a specialised laboratory, and would even prefer this compared to getting their personal product from other channels such as department stores or filling out online questionnaires. Of those interested in personalised care products, 54% say they are ready to provide blood, skin and hair samples to be tested in a laboratory, 51% would be interested in giving a DNA swab samples, and 52% would like to go to a medical dermatologist consultation. Preparing skincare products according to individual recipes takes time, and consumers will most likely have to wait to get their products made. According to the survey, consumers are prepared to wait for up to a month to receive their product. 59% of consumers are also prepared to pay a premium for such products. ""Over 22 % of skincare consumption by volume globally is driven by individualism, and with the development of new technologies, manufacturers have opportunities to take it to a whole new level. Factors such as allergies, genetic predisposal, nutrition, climate and exposure to the sun are all individual needs perfect for tailoring,"" explains Veronika Zhupanova, analyst at Canadean. In Russia, I.C. Lab offers consumers individually-made skincare products, produced with personal skin characteristics in mind. The customers are invited to the laboratory, where their skin is tested, and in a few weeks they can collect the product made specifically for them that not only satisfy the needs of the skin, but it also features their surname on the package. At the moment, the brand is presented in Russia and the Ukraine. The cream is set at a premium price: Costs 3000 RUB for 15ml eye-cream (around 50 pounds or 63 euros). According to Canadean, the trend is also picking up slowly in the UK where Nivea launched last July its 'Face Facts Boutique' for the new Cellular Anti-Age range. The rolling booth was set up in a number of UK shopping centres providing consultations using a new technology to analyse the customers' skin, advise on the best skincare routine and answer any skin-aging questions."
"Brazilian lifestyle inspires the cosmetics industry worldwide, Mintel reports","According to Mintel, 16% of the launches inspired by Brazil were found in France, and 14% in the UK between August 2013 and July 2014. Following them, are the US with 12%, and Japan with 10%. Brazilian influence in the cosmetics sector is seen largely on the ingredients platform, with products featuring one of four key claims such as ""Brazilian"", ""from Brazil"", ""sourced from Brazil"" or ""inspired by Brazil"". The global hair care market also appears as increasingly inspired by Brazilian products. For instance, Mintel notes that while previously the vast majority of hair care product launches specifying the use of salt-free formulations were found in the Brazilian market, this is slowly changing. In 2011, Brazil represented 95% of these launches, while the rest of the world accounted for 5%. However, in 2013, Brazil accounted for 86% and the rest of the world, 14%. ""Brazil has traditionally been seen as an incredibly rich source of natural ingredients but today it is an inspiring beauty market in its own right. The Brazilian determination to look as good as possible whatever the cost is driving the country's beauty market forward. At the same time, blending elements of Brazilian culture and lifestyle with popular naturals such as açaí and cupuaçu is an attractive approach for consumers in other countries. The next two years will see the Brazilian influence spread even further and deeper as beauty companies build on the after-effects of the Fifa World Cup and the run-up to the Rio Olympics in 2016,"" says Vivienne Rudd, Global Director of Insight, Beauty & Personal Care, at Mintel. While Brazil is showing its importance on the global stage, it still has scope to further grow its own market. For instance, the Brazilian skincare market is characterized by basic claims, such as moisturising and hydrating, present in 77% of the variants but only 66% of global launches. Issues of sensitivity and safety will help to move Brazilian skincare forward as evidenced by the popularity of the dermatologically tested claim, present in 40% of skincare launches in Brazil but only 26% of global launches. Meanwhile, claims like brightening and illuminating and paraben-free, which are popular globally, are found in 25% and 21% respectively of the global new product launches, are not even part of the 10 top claims in the Brazilian skincare market, when considering products launched between August 2013 and July 2014. In addition, Mintel's research reveals that 27% of Brazilian consumers use facial skincare products mainly to improve the texture of their skin, 25% use them to treat and prevent acne and 23% to minimise the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Indeed, the skincare market is performing well. Sun care, growing on a rate of 12.5%, and body care, 12.4%, categories are set to be two of the country's fastest growing subcategories between 2012 and 2016, well ahead for example of facial skincare (6.3%). Underlining the growing importance of sun care, Mintel forecasts that it will overtake facial skincare in terms of value by the end of 2014, recording sales of R$ 2,177 million (US$ 0.94 billion) compared to facial skincare sales of R$ 2,146 million (US$ 0.92 billion). ""There is clearly scope for more sophisticated claims in the Brazilian market. Dermocosmetics and hybrid products such as tinted sunscreens, sun protecting foundations and multi tasking BB/CC creams will increasingly use enhanced claims of protection, prevention and personalisation, unlocking the potential of the facial skincare category,"" adds Vivienne Rudd. However, there are also opportunities to be found in hair care - the male consumer is very keen on looking after his hair. Indeed, Mintel's research reveals that 61% of Brazilian men use shampoo daily, compared to 27% of women, and 61% of men use styling products everyday (compared to 41% of women). Furthermore, 44% of Brazilian men use a hair treatment every day, compared to just 23% of women. However while 33% of male hair care users choose male-specific products, only 2% of hair care launches in Brazil, in 2014 up to July, targeted men."
"Sample subscriptions significantly influence makeup purchases, reports NPD","Making consumers pay for samples may pays off long-term for manufacturers and retailers. Actually, among women who subscribe to makeup sample subscription programs, 83 per cent were influenced to buy the full-sized product, according to the 2014 Makeup In-Depth Consumer Report, The NPD Group] from The NPD Group. ""The idea of offering samples has been around for some time, but sample subscription programs are a fresh way for manufacturers and retailers to engage with interested consumers and monetize their sample programs, while consumers discover brands or products they may not have been aware of previously,"" said Karen Grant, vice president and global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. ""Women strive to find a makeup product that works for them, and when they do, that is the primary reason they become loyal to it."" Most women like to self-test products without pressure, and samples give them that ability. Take home samples are the second most popular makeup shopping preference, over things like salesperson explanation and personal consultation, but retailers are finding new ways to incorporate samples into the shopping, and even purchasing, experience. According to the market research firm, one in five makeup users have received a makeup sample in the past year, primarily from retailers (17 per cent). Women under the age of 55, specifically the 18-34 year olds, are most likely to report receiving a makeup sample in the past year. Makeup samples strongly influence purchase decisions for about one-third of women, while over half are somewhat influenced by these samples. The 35-54 age group is the most likely to be influenced by samples, indicating opportunity that goes beyond the youngest generations. ""Sample subscriptions are still relatively small in their reach, but their potential impact on the makeup industry is significant. Incorporating this method of product discovery into a marketing and sales strategy can uncover new consumers and expand on target audiences,"" added Grant."
US lip cosmetics market set to reach $1.4 billion this year,"After experiencing a 2% decline from 2011-2013, the US lip cosmetics segment posted gains of nearly 9% between 2012 and 2014, with sales poised to reach nearly 1.4 billion U.S. dollars (1.06 billion euros) this year [1], according to new research from Mintel. While lip cosmetics still account for the smallest percentage of total colour cosmetics sales, it is currently the strongest performing segment in terms of growth, compared to 6.4% growth for the facial cosmetics market ($4.8 billion) and 4.2% gains for eye makeup ($3.4 billion) during that same time period. Lip cosmetics are used by the vast majority of US women, with nearly nine out of 10 (87%) reporting usage. Lip balm has the highest overall penetration, with 60% of women using it, followed by lipstick at 58%, although there is a definite generation gap. The 18-24 demographic uses lip balm to lipstick to the tune of 72% vs 50%, while the over 65 senior set uses lipstick over lip balm 82% vs 45%. Of those who use lip cosmetics, 67% look for moisturizing/hydrating claims while 61% seek out long-lasting lip wear and almost half (48%) are swayed by lip softening properties. ""Lip cosmetics have the highest overall reported use among colour cosmetics. Lip balm, lipstick, and lip gloss all have similar rates of penetration, suggesting that many women rely on a suite of lip products depending on the occasion or desired look,"" says Shannon Romanowski, beauty and personal care analyst at Mintel. For lip cosmetics as for other colour cosmetic products, users strongly rely on mass brands. However, prestige brands are gaining ground in the segment of facial products. ""Forty-four per cent of highlighter/illuminator users purchase from a prestige brand compared to only 24% of lip gloss users who bought prestige,"" points the market research firm. ""Facial cosmetics, in general, are viewed as higher-risk purchases - women want to be sure that products are appropriate for their skin type and tone and therefore rely on in-store samples and consultants for guidance. On the other hand, users of lip cosmetics, especially lip balm, are more inclined to purchase from budget brands in comparison to users of facial and eye cosmetics. Lip products are likely perceived as low-risk purchases. Ultimately, retailers are challenged to help women navigate the sometimes overwhelming colour cosmetics category, especially when it comes to higher-risk-and higher-priced purchases such as facial cosmetics,"" Shannon adds."
Women pay more and more attention to their eyebrows,"Sales of eyebrow products are skyrocketing in the UK, the USA and in France, according to recent figures published by The NPD Group. Sales of prestige brow products accounted for £6.5 million in the period January to May 2014 in the UK, reporting a rise of 52% on the same period in 2013. However, the growth of the brow market is not confined to the UK as a similar trend exists in the USA where sales reached $57.6 million over the same period, growing by 27% compared to 2013. In France, sales of brow products reached almost 2 million euros from January to May 2014, a growth of about 20% compared to 2013. In comparison, the next star performer in the make-up category in the UK is lip liner, which grew by 27% and is followed by eye shadow which grew by 19% compared to the same period last year (YTD May 2014). ""Falsely abandoned, eyebrows are now the subject of a real attention and of sophisticated beauty rituals, both on the catwalks and at home. This is a relatively new makeup habit for French women compared to other markets such as Asia and this is great news for the industry,"" said Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. Both in France and the UK, brow pencils remain the most popular products in this category. In the UK, aside from two powders, 8 out of the top 10 selling brow products in 2013 were brow pencils. In France, 9 of the 10 best selling brow products were pencils. In France, ""there is a craze about eyebrows beauty and it goes beyond what products can offer, it impacts the entire industry with, for example, the proliferation of eyebrow bars and corners (Benefit, L'Atelier du Sourcil) and of beauty offering to dye and to makeup women's eyebrows, and addition to simply shape,"" Mathilde Lion concludes. Much more than a fad, we may be witnessing the emergence of new beauty practices."
"Beauteam settles its ""MakeUp In"" concept on four continents and launches ""MakeUp in Action""","Premium Beauty News -You achieved a remarkable performance in just five years! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Nothing can be taken for granted! However, we demonstrated that there is room for a professional event dedicated to the make-up segment. A concept of its own where quality was one of the main founding criteria: quality of exhibitors, quality of visitors, quality of the organization, of conferences, of animations. Contrary to the natural tendency of some show organizers, we don't intend to ""grow for the sake of growing"" and especially not to disperse ourselves too thin. This strategy ""of being global and of encompassing everything"" only benefits the income of organizers and certainly not that of exhibitors who placed their trust in a concept, and deserve to be supported on the long-term in their markets conquest. Premium Beauty News - Can we speak of a selective event concerning MakeUp in Paris, New York, Seoul and soon, Sao Paulo? Sandra Maguarian - I prefer calling it ""exclusivity"". Visitors and exhibitors are the ones who tell us so every year: ""Don't increase in size!"" They are right. This is what makes and will continue to make all the attractiveness of our events. And we have already indicated that we would limit next year the accessibility to our four MakeUp In events, whether in Paris, New York, Seoul or Sao Paulo. Premium Beauty News - Why not diversify the show, like others do? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - I am convinced that it would be a strategic error! Our unique positioning - the exclusive gathering of suppliers of makeup packaging, applicators and formulas - allows us to attract an overwhelming majority (65%) of visitors coming from brands' marketing teams. This is what makes the originality and value of exhibiting at the ""MakeUp In"" shows. In the field of make-up, which is in itself very close to that of fashion, what matters are the marketing teams, because they reflect on the product and design it, for the year to come or even the year after. It is a wining strategy on the mature and innovation driven markets where we are settled. In particular because it puts packaging and applicators and brushes under the spotlights. The R&D and purchasing departments of beauty brands therefore enjoy a unique opportunity to have a 360° view on the whole chain of suppliers in the makeup industry. As a rule, we will refuse to set foot in a field that isn't ours. It is always risky for organizers: ""Grasp all, lose all."" There is a risk of losing your soul by tackling too many goals at the same time. Premium Beauty News - Why is your concept so different than others? Sandra Maguarian - The assets of the ""MakeUp In"" concept, that can be summarized in a few words: ""Targeted, Close to customers, Efficient, an Optimum Cost/Contact, Service"". This notion of ""service"" has also become fundamental. Exhibitors when they pay for their stand, are expecting more than just a booth space. They want a ""comprehensive service"", with the assurance of being well treated with all due respect. A ""comprehensive service"" which includes their stand and a specific environment, as well as meals, conferences, animations. Everything is important. The end with ""Take your stand and please don't comment on it!"" Premium Beauty News - You're also launching ""MakeUp In Action"". Jean-Yves Bourgeois - We have been working on it for several months. The idea is quite simple. Our four events in Paris, New York, Seoul and Sao Paulo are and must stay dedicated to one continent. However, there are sometimes, in some of these continents, one or several areas where there are enough business opportunities for the make up industry and where it would be useful to organise business meetings. The first MakeUp in Action will be held at the beginning of 2015. Where? It will be a surprise…"
United Kingdom: Mass-market colour cosmetics to challenge prestige products,"With 93% of UK women using colour cosmetics, total sales grew to £1.5 billion in 2013, an impressive 6% increase on 2012 sales which reached £1.4 billion. According to Mintel [1], Sales of mass-market colour cosmetics in the United Kingdom are set to hit £1 billion in 2014, with prestige sales additionally predicted to reach £552 million. Notably, it is prestige sales which have seen the biggest growth, holding a 35% share of the market in 2013 (£531 million), up from 34% in 2012 (£491 million), highlights Mintel. Mass market's share on the other hand has fallen from 66% in 2012 (£939 million) to 65% in 2013 (£986 million). ""However, as savvy shopping behaviours continue in the beauty market - and innovation is matched by mass-market brands - the prestige share of the market is unlikely to see continued increases by the end of 2014,"" says Charlotte Libby, Senior Beauty Analyst at Mintel. ""Prestige brands can encourage consumers to trade up with smaller size products, offering a more purse-friendly method of trialling products. Mass brands can also focus marketing communications on their product formulations, dissuading consumers that more expensive products are the only choice for advanced formulations."" Within the prestige sector, it is eyebrow definers that top the colour cosmetic choice with one in five (22%) users choosing a prestige branded product over a mass-market or budget brand. Sales of eyebrow products reached £28 million in 2013, an impressive 42% increase on 2012 sales which were valued at £20 million. With a quarter (25%) of UK women now using eyebrow definer, this growth looks set to continue with sales predicted to reach £31 million in 2014. Further to this, Mintel's analysis shows that brand loyalty amongst prestige colour cosmetic users is strong, in particular for foundations and base products. Despite its low penetration in the prestige sector, as the creativity of nail polish has become increasingly fashionable and accessible, the nail colour cosmetic segment continues to grow from strength to strength. Sales of nail polish surpassed lip colour for the first time in 2013 with the former reaching sales of £244 million and the latter £242 million. Whilst this marked a 6.6% increase for nail polish sales, they are predicted to reach £284 million by 2014, with the lip sector expected to grow to just £244 million in 2014. Seven in ten (69%) British women now use nail polish, compared to just six in 10 (59%) women in 2013. Today, usage peaks at 16-24 year olds with four in five (81%) of this age group using nail colour. Rather than having a firm favourite, almost half (48%) of nail polish users wear four or more shades, with purple being worn by half (48%) of nail polish users, closely followed by baby pink (45%) and dark red (42%). In the rest of the colour cosmetic segment however, the palette is becoming muted with a third (33%) of UK women who use eye, lip or nail colour cosmetics saying they only use natural-look products, with this attitude having no age bias (32% of 16-24-year-olds and 33% of 55-64-year-olds). ""In 2013 fashion began to move towards a more natural look with 'no-make-up-make-up' becoming a popular trend. This has continued into 2014 with the #NoMakeupSelfie nominations on Facebook and products to enhance natural skin instead of covering it,"" Charlotte Libby concludes."
"""The natural cosmetics market needs strong brands"", Elfriede Dambacher","Natural and organic cosmetics have had ample growth rates for years. The segment is growing globally. How do you evaluate this trend? Elfriede Dambacher [1] - Natural and organic cosmetics have become a self-evident part of the cosmetics market. So it is not a trend which will ease off, but a trend that clearly depicts that natural and organic cosmetics have arrived amidst our society. To what do you attribute these changes? Elfriede Dambacher - The requirements of consumers are changing. What was once an ecological avant-garde looking for alternatives to the usual cosmetics products has turned into a widespread social current. These consumers live by new values and are looking for products that work for them, are harmless, health-wise and also do not pose a risk to the environment. This is affecting the markets and has alerted the entire cosmetics industry. How much influence do natural and organic cosmetics have on the development of the cosmetics market? Elfriede Dambacher - In the beginning the influence was limited, because the natural cosmetics market was not of interest to the entire cosmetics industry. In the last few years more activities were noticeable. The entire cosmetics industry was experimenting. Products were green-washed, natural brands bought out. What is necessary for success? Elfriede Dambacher - Consumers expect natural and organic cosmetics to work as well as other cosmetics, but also have the additional benefit of ""nature"". To achieve this, much research was done. New products were developed, which today convince with texture and effectiveness. Skincare now offers modern textures providing a pleasant sensation on the skin, all without silicone oils. Today, natural products are convincing, but consumers also pay attention to the authenticity and credibility of a brand. Transparency is needed and the story behind the products is important. Are natural and organic cosmetics going to continue to grow? Elfriede Dambacher - The cosmetics market at large is going greener and natural and organic cosmetics have gained new customers. This affects the entire cosmetics market. But the market requires strong brands, implementing new ideas in retail. The classic marketing strategy is not sufficient anymore. What is put in the shopping basket is determined only by the consumer. The challenges for natural and organic cosmetics will increase. Therefore the emphasis of the next Natural and Organic Cosmetics Conference [2] will be future-oriented solutions. International experts and futurologists will take a closer look at the natural and organic cosmetics industry, the challenges it needs to meet and how to successfully master these challenges."
Russia: sales of cosmetics keep on fast-growth path,"Experts interviewed by the organizers of InterCHARM Moscow, the largest trade show dedicated to the beauty industry in Russia, CIS and Eastern Europe, estimate that sales of cosmetic and perfumed products in Russia have kept the same pace in the first half of 2014 compared to the same period last year. ""As far as Professional Hair Products are concerned, the Russian market has been constantly growing over the last few years, and with this growth all problems and issues related to mature markets naturally followed,"" said Barex Italiana's Carlo Baiesi. ""Nevertheless the cultural attitude towards cosmetics, the curiosity for novelties and the openness to new techniques and products still make Russia a market where investments and efforts are well rewarded."" According to RBC research, in 2013, the Russian cosmetics and perfumery market grew by 11% and approached USD 15 billion (EUR 11,1 billion). Figures provided by Rosstat, the Russian Federation's State Statistics Service draw a similar picture: sales of perfumery and cosmetic goods would have grown by 14.1% in 2013 versus 13.2% in 2012. Such outcomes are really impressive particularly when compared with the European market where sales of cosmetic products showed a 0.8% drop in 2014. Figures in some individual EU member states are even worse: the Spanish and Greek markets declined by 3.6%, the Italian market by 1.2% and France by 0.4%, while Germany, the biggest market within the EU, has demonstrated a modest upturn of 0.6%. In the context, exports have become the main growth driver for cosmetics makers in the EU. The importance of the Russian market has progressed accordingly. Russia accounted for 3.4% of the global cosmetics and perfumery market in 2013, reported AT Kearney. Imported personal care products accounts for over than half of the Russian market and in the luxury segment imported cosmetics and perfumes represent between 70 per cent and 100 per cent of the market. The main importers of perfumery and cosmetics goods in Russia are France, with a market share of 24.4%, Germany (11%), Poland (6.9%), Italy (6.8%) and the USA (6,2%). The Chinese share in the overall import volume reached 2.6% in 2013. France remains the leader in the perfumery segment with 58.8% of the products imported in Russia in value terms. In 2013, the volume of imported perfumes rose by 23.3% versus 2012 to USD 293.3 million (EUR 216.2). Great Britain holds the second place with 8.7% share in 2013 (USD 43.5 million). The volume of fragrances imported from this country increased by 24.3% in 2013. Italy holds the third place with a market share of 7.6% (USD 38 million). Last year, Russian perfumery imports from Italy were 51.4% higher as compared to 2012. Spain ranks fourth with USD 28.1 million and a 5.6% market share. In value terms, imports of perfumery products from Spain rose by 23.4%. The United States have pushed up their perfumery supplies by 89% reaching the fifth place. Their share in total volume of perfumery import reached to 5.4% to USD 26.9 million (EUR 19,9 million). As regards the imports of colour cosmetics, the leaders are France, Poland and the United State. In terms of popularity, eye make-up retained the first position in 2013, i.e. 14.6 % of the volume of imports of cosmetics or USD 128 million (EUR 94.7 million). 21.8% were imported from Italy, 18.2 % from France and 13.5 % from Poland and 11.7 % from Germany. Lip make-up follows with 10.1% (USD 88.2 million); the leaders in this category were France (30.2%), Poland (15.8%), Germany (12.9%) and Italy (12.1%). As far as nail care is concerned, imports grew by 6.2% in 2013 to USD 54.7 million (EUR 40,5 million). The leaders: the United States (18.5%), France (18.0 %) and Turkey (17.0%). Eventually, imports of hair care products, one of the key segments of the Russian perfumery and cosmetics market, grew by 7.4 % to reach USD 354.1 million (EUR 262 million) in 2013. The undisputed leader among the exporters of hair spray is Germany with a 64.4% market share, enjoying a leading position in the segment of hair care with 26.3 % of imports in terms of value. The second and third places belong to Italy (14%) and France (9.7%). Despite that Russian producers pose a serious competition to their Western counterparts in terms of shampoos; the share of imports is still high (37%), leaders being Romania (42.3%), France (13.7%) and Italy (8.8%). ""Beauty is beyond politics,"" commented Ruslan Abdrakhmanov, Marketing Communications Manager at InterCHARM Moscow. ""Sales of cosmetics and perfumes in Russia are driven by the country's economic development. Russia features 15 cities with a million-plus population and 145 million people in total. The retail industry grew by 23% in 2013,"" he concluded. How to register cosmetic products in Russia? The handbook Safety of perfumes and cosmetics.

"Cosmetic innovation: China - Brazil, the winning match","""There is certainly a lot to put and think in common, from a very global standpoint"", Florence Bernardin underlines, ""Chinese and Brazilian women both have an oily skin that is exposed to the sun and pollution, they have the same desire for naturalness, and a very strong relationship with water and hygiene"". There is thus a great need for light, fluid or aqueous textures resulting from these common protection and purity expectations in Asia. These non-greasy textures are also popular in Brazil. As an example, sun care ranges now offer very specific ""toque seco"" products with a dry skin feel, such as those by La Roche Posay, Avene, L'Oreal, or Vichy Capital Soleil Toque Seco SPF50… Mists and light sprays are ubiquitous on sun protection markets in China or Korea, and have become so in Brazil as well, though they are mainly destined for the body (see Sundown, Oboticario, Natura, Neutrogena, Dermage, Nivea, Golden Plus…). Foams are extremely popular in Asia, and are now appearing in Brazil, where they provide lightness, sensoriality, but also homogeneity, because they are tinted. This is an interesting aspect that may, this time, be applied to Asia (see Dermage Photoage Mousse FPS50+, or Vichy Capital Soleil BB Aera-Mousse FPS30). The anti-dark spot approach, already firmly established in Asia with the whitening ranges, is being mass-marketed in Brazil with the arrival of Vitamin C-based formulations, which even out the complexion while increasing the skin's elasticity. Whitening and anti-aging are thus joining here… (Granado Loção facial Hidra C FPS 15, Dermage Improce C20, L'Oreal Revitalift Clareador, Vichy Liftactive Serum, or the new RoC Serum/Gel Creme C-Supérieur Concentrado 16 %). Following the example of Asia, the Brazilian market is also very concerned with dark circles: we should soon see new vitamin C and/or retinol-based products, such as Natura's Chronos Pharma Serum Intensivo Clareador Antissinais. Florence Bernardin notes that, in order to offer Brazilian women mascaras worth their lashes, a next step may be inspired from the Asian smudgeproof formulas that resist against lower lid sebum (preventing panda eyes), but also against ambient humidity, and which are to be removed with hot water. From a more global standpoint, she foresees a very promising momentum in this segment. ""It is still a small market, but its creativity and product diversity are very interesting"". With Quem disse Berenice?, the Brazilian Kiko which belongs to the O Boticario group, customers can buy different brushes for different effects, but for the same mascara. ""This multi-directional approach reminds us of the Korean creativity on the segment"", and of course, ""the huge nail varnish market links the two continents"", Florence Bernardin concludes."
"Customization of perfume bottles, a trend of the times","The success of rare and exclusive fragrances, which are available in a limited number of outlets, has demonstrated the desire of some purchasers of luxury perfumes to regain the feeling of exclusivity that modern perfumery has lost with massification. According to Nathalie Pichard, consultant and founder of the company [TopNotes], ""there is a real trend to get back to the basics of luxury that are rarity and exception, but also remarkable craftsmanship and know-how."" French fragrance brand Serge Lutens, for instance, likes to do things big. The brand offers its customers the services of an engraver to write down their initials or their name on the bottle of the perfume they selected. The price is 31 euros for one initial, 46 euros for two initials, 61 euros for three and 77 euros for a name, plus the price of the perfume. At Atelier Cologne, it is possible to engrave its initials or its first name on the leather case of travel size fragrances (30ml), which is given for any purchase of a 200 ml size. For 20 euros, the customer can select the colour of its case from seven colours. As for the engraving there are two fonts available. Customers can also opt for golden or silvered letters and a vertical or horizontal engraving. However why only write initials or a name when one's can write anything else? That may be the theory of Guerlain regarding engraving. The legendary fragrance brand, which has been offering this service for many years, has indeed become a reference in this field. The number of characters that can bee engraved depends on the size of the bottle but the price of the service (25 euros) remains the same whatever the customer decides to write. Up to him to find inspiration. ""Ultra customization is a strong societal trend, boosted by social networks and the selfie phenomenon is one of its manifestations,"" says Nathalie Pichard. The generalization of this trend is expected to continue, driven both by the growing consumer demand and by technological innovations that will reduce the cost of customization and lead to more variety and sophistication. From this point of view, the advent of 3D printers opens new horizons."
"For Iran's women, makeup speaks volumes","Everyday wearing of makeup is probably more common in Iran than in some liberal western countries. It is a rare opportunity to parade one's beauty without fear of official censure. ""Iranian women wear makeup as soon as they get up in the morning. Even if they feel ill, they know that they must look beautiful in the street,"" says Tina Zarinnam, 30, a fashion designer. The French luxury brand Lancôme recently announced a return to Iran after decades away, inviting around 400 industry insiders and artists to one of the biggest hotels in Tehran to celebrate its comeback. It was the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that a major Western brand - Lancôme is the number one luxury line of the L'Oreal group - had been launched with such fanfare. No American cosmetics brands have been sold on the official Iranian market since the US imposed a trade embargo in the 1980s. US and EU sanctions on oil and other industries remain in force in Iran despite an interim deal aimed at eventually ending the nation's nuclear standoff with the West, but many foreign businesses have blamed the restrictions for hampering trade. Makeup professionals estimate that Iranian women buy approximately one tube of mascara per month, dwarfing the one every four months bought by the French. Lancôme is presented in Iran by the Safir perfume chain, a leading official distributor of beauty products. Created in 2010, the chain now has nearly 20 branches across the country. ""It's a booming market, which is roughly several hundred million dollars,"" a brand representative says, adding that this amount is split between its own distribution and the grey market. Only 40 percent of Iran's market is controlled by official distributors. The rest is divided among bootleggers who operate in parallel in bazaars and small shops that import cosmetics and makeup illegally, says Pegah Goshayeshi, Safir's chief executive. Imports are costly as regulations are strict and various government officials must approve a product before it can be placed on the market. Wearing makeup does not violate the laws of the Islamic republic, however, because Islam does not prohibit perfumes or cosmetics. ""The Prophet Mohammed himself used perfume,"" Goshayeshi says. Makeup is also a form of personal expression in a society where compulsory wearing of hijab requires women to cover their hair and their body in loose clothing when outside, regardless of their religion. Tastes in makeup vary in different parts of the country. In northern Iran, a coloured mascara and perfumes with a flowery fragrance is preferred, while women in the south tend to buy black mascara and stronger, more musky perfumes. Iranian men are also gradually leaning toward using more cosmetics. ""They take better care of their skin, because they want to look younger,"" Goshayeshi adds. In a country affected by a severe economic crisis, partly because of Western sanctions, makeup is considered expensive but it is often a small salve to help forget everyday problems. ""Makeup has an impact on the one who wears it ... I put on makeup because I love it. I enjoy wearing it. It makes me feel fresh and calm,"" says Forough Heidari, a 42-year-old physiotherapist. And the Iranian market is by no means saturated. ""There is still room for luxury goods in the medium or low-end market"" despite the presence of 20 Iranian and foreign brands, says Vista Bavar, founder and director of the Caprice brand. ""Iran has a large youth population, most of whom still live with their parents. They do not have to care too much about expenses"" and can spend a lot on beauty products, she adds."

Beauty according to Millennials,"Premium Beauty News - In the wake of a previous study of Generation X in 2012, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation is now investigating Generation Y. Can you picture it for us? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - Indeed, in 2014 the spotlight is on their 18-25-year-old daughters, representing the youngest of the so-called Millennials or Generation Y. [1] They are young adults, who grew up in a world of Internet and mobile devices, they consider social networks as part of their everyday lives and do not make a clear distinction between what happens in the real world and what happens virtually. They have been affected by the economic and environmental crisis that impacts their future outlook and prospects in life, compared to their parents. Let's not forget, for instance, that in France 24% of young workers aged 24 or less are unemployed, nevertheless their amazing resilience (and LOL state of mind) leads them into a new consumption model more focused on experience sharing and entrepreneurship. Those intending to appeal to this generation have to renew the old marketing models. Premium Beauty News - What makes its perception of beauty so different compared to previous generations? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - Women belonging to this generation have a very specific relation to femininity, since their image is easily shared on the net. Their relations with beauty and beauty products widely differs from earlier generations, since most of them were applied skincare products during their youngest years. They are hyper-informed, they appreciate singularity and have their own information sources. As far as personal care products are concerned, they also have specific expectations in terms of beauty, and brands do not always address their needs correctly. Generation Y is also a strategic target because its members are fond of beauty products, despite limited budgets. We have even asked them about the contents of their purse and their bathroom to better understand the ""social beauty"" picture of this target. Premium Beauty News - The report deals with France, the USA and South Korea. How did you collect the information? Why are these different areas so illustrative of today's beauty? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - First of all, we collected data from the source as we visited New York, Los Angeles and Seoul in order to better understand this generation and see how brands or retailers interact with these women. In addition to various expert testimonies (nutritionists, dermatologists, bloggers, …), the study results from extensive literature research, and includes a survey conducted online among 300 young women aged 18-25 in France, South Korea and in the United States. There were many open questions that helped us to better identify meaningful insights. We chose to focus on three areas: France because it is our country, Korea because K-Beauty has a strong influence worldwide, and in the USA because its is a one of the main markets for the cosmetics industry. Premium Beauty News - Could you provide us with a short description of the study's contents? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - The study features the following chapters: 1/ #Who is Gen Next - Their sociological portrait, 2/ #Brands & Luxury - Their relations with branded and luxury products, 3/ # Femininity & Beauty - Their relations with femininity and beauty, and, 4/ #Boards & Prospective - A prospective outlook on four visions of femininity and beauty in the future. To discover the study, we propose a one hour and a half presentation at our client's office, together with an optional creativity workshop."
MakeUp in Sao Paulo in six months!,"Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Sao Paulo! Some would be tempted to add: At last! Sandra Maguarian - The concept had proven its worth in Paris, New York and Seoul. It had become absolutely necessary to organize MakeUp in SaoPaulo. Especially since players in the sector, were often asking us... ""So, when are you organizing something in Sao Paulo?"" Premium Beauty News - What has changed over the past two years, to enable you to eventually organize MakeUp in Sao Paulo? Sandra Maguarian - In the space of two years, many international manufacturers decided to set up a foothold in the country with this argument in mind: ""we need to settle here to help develop the market!"" With the ""MakeUp In...» concept, in a way, we support them in this ""market creation"" strategy. It was the right time. Premium Beauty News - More than 2.7 billion dollars! This is the most widely accepted figure for estimating the make-up market in Brazil. Quit enough to attract the attention of many companies. Sandra Maguarian - Two hundred million inhabitants, among which slightly less than a half are women, Brazil is more than ever at the centre of the global development of the make-up sector. And it's not just Brazil. The entire South American continent is concerned with this development, with in particular, countries like Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Argentina. Premium Beauty News - With still very specific distribution channels in Brazil? Sandra Maguarian - That's right, today, the bulk of sales still relies on door to door sales, but other distribution channels are developing rapidly. There are about 7,000 chain stores and more than 53,000 independent. A network that several leading international brands have decided to invest systematically and successfully! There is also the power of communication represented by the internet. You should see the number of bloggers who express themselves, for example, on nail polish. Maybelline in Brazil now has over 300,000 fans on its Facebook pages. The potential is there. 85 million Brazilian women use make-up products every day and they are using them increasingly! They are much better informed and have rising incomes. But it is important to note that MakeUp in Sao Paulo will be the MakeUp trade show intended for the whole South American continent."
Ecommerce: Strong growth expected for FMCG by 2016,"According to Kantar Worldpanel, ecommerce will account for USD53 billion of global FMCG sales by 2016 - an increase of USD 17 billion (47%) on the current USD 36 billion. [1] The report, which is based on an analysis of the purchasing habits of 100,000 shoppers in ten of the biggest online consumer packaged goods markets, forecasts that ecommerce will account for 5.2% of global FMCG sales by 2016 - up from 3.7% at present. The report predicts that Asia will be the next major growth market. South Korea will continue its lead position with online accounting for 13.8% of FMCG sales by 2016. ""Today, 55% of Korean shoppers buy online, an exceptionally high figure that is not matched by any other country in the world. Online FMCG market share will continue to grow rapidly in Taiwan and China to achieve 4.5% and 3.3% share of the total FMCG market respectively,"" Kantar explains. At present, the UK is the trailblazer of the European online FMCG market. British online shoppers buy on the internet once a month and their carts are five times bigger than offline (in most countries online shopping carts are twice as large as their offline equivalents). However, the impressive growth of the click and collect offer in France, referred to as ""Drive"", will see France overtake the UK by 2016 with 6.1% vs. 5.5% of market share respectively. These forecasts present a prime opportunity for retailers and brands. Current online shoppers, typically middle and upper class, tend to favour branded products over own-label making it an ideal platform for brands. In France, 55% of online consumers re-use the same list for each trip making its essential for brands to secure a place on shopping lists if they are to benefit from this forecasted growth. ""Although online only makes up a small share of FMCG sales at the moment, all countries are witnessing considerable growth. The future belongs to retailers and brands that see the bigger picture and leverage the opportunities provided to broaden their target markets. Being a slow adopter has the potential to significantly damage sales and erode market share,"" highlights Stéphane Roger, Global Shopper and Retail Director at Kantar Worldpanel. In order to win market share in very different local retail environments, retailers and brands are deploying various strategies to impulse purchases, to make online retail more fun and the latest techniques in convenience shopping."
USA: Ultra-gentle skincare products on the rise,"U.S. consumers are highly interested in ultra-gentle skincare products and, consistently, the whole category is shifting toward more products positioned as gentle or appropriate for sensitive skin. According to Mintel's Global New Products Database (GNPD), sensitive skin claims represent 25% of total skincare claims thus far in 2014 [1], compared to 15% in 2009. Furthermore, 71% of facial skincare users say they are interested in ultra-gentle products. Sales trends also reflect this move towards gentle skincare products. Mintel estimates that sales of sensitive / gentle skincare products are more than USD 202 million (EUR 148 million), with the majority of sales coming from the facial cleanser and facial moisturizer segments. Sensitive and gentle skincare products are also capturing a greater percentage of facial cleanser and moisturizer sales. ""While facial skincare products have typically highlighted the addition of ingredients such as vitamins and botanicals, the category appears to be moving toward highlighting what's not in the formula - fragrance, dyes, etc.,"" says Shannon Romanowski, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. ""This move toward gentle skincare is a reflection of consumers' desire for performance combined with increased concern and awareness regarding what is being put on their skin."" Consumers seem to be big fans of the pared down approach, as almost a quarter (24%) of facial skincare users say they look for products with natural, organic ingredients. 22% seek out products that are free from certain ingredients like parabens or fragrances and 21% are interested in items that are designed specifically for sensitive skin. ""While future growth is expected to remain slow, there are opportunities for more customized and convenience-driven product options. Value-added products that enhance health and wellness, extend usage occasions, or tap into the convenience-driven mindset of male and multicultural shoppers stand to gain,"" adds Shannon Romanowski. ""In addition, a consumer shift toward gentle skincare benefits also reflects an opportunity, especially among women and Black consumers."""
Rise in exports helps European cosmetics sales to remain stable,"Sales of the European personal care sector have decreased by -0.8% in 2013 compared to the previous year. Total sales for the 28 member states of the European Union, plus Norway and Switzerland, reached EUR 72 billion in 2013. Sales in Spain and in Greece decreased by 3.6 per cent, and by -1.2 per cent in Italy. In France, sales of personal care products declined by -0.4%. On the other, the German market grew by +0.6 per cent. Germany (EUR 12.896 billion), France (EUR 10.542 billion) and Italy (EUR 9.936 billion) remains the main EU markets for cosmetics (retail sales prices). All the market categories declined within the EU in 2013, with fragrances recording the strongest fall (-2.3 per cent). Simultaneously, extra EU exports increased strongly to reach EUR 16 billion for 2013 [1]. In total, the European market represented almost one third of the global market. ""2013 was a pivotal year for our association,"" Cosmetics Europe Director-General Bertil Heerink said. ""In a year of economic challenges, the European cosmetics and personal care industry remained economically stable."" Considering the value of the Euro, the strong level of exports was a good surprise for European leaders. ""That made us convinced that the quality of European cosmetics is still very much in demand all over the world,"" Mr Heerink told Premium Beauty News."
"Austerity is the watchword for affluent Americans, study says","The luxury market in 2014 might be more challenging that initially anticipated. ""My read of the outlook and attitude of affluent consumers says marketers should hope for the best, but plan for the worse,"" cautions Pam Danziger, president of Unity Marketing and author of a new report, The Luxury Report 2014. ""In particular, Unity Marketing foresees American affluents adopting a new attitude of austerity with a trend toward simplicity and making due with less, rather than aspiring for extravagance and indulgence."" Unity Marketing's latest Luxury Report 2014 tracks affluent consumer spending and purchases of luxury and high-end goods and services since the recession in 2008 through 2013, based upon surveys conducted among more than 1,200 affluent consumers every three months. The survey analysis shows that throughout 2010 and 2011 affluents went through a recovery period where so-called pent up demand boosted affluent spending on luxury. However, since 2012 spending has been slowing as affluents' consumer confidence has taken a downward turn. Despite the rising values of their houses and stock portfolios that measure wealth, affluents are choosing to conserve those gains, rather than spending extravagantly like they did in the run up to the recession and immediately afterwards. For example, the average amount affluents spent on luxury goods and services in any three-month study period during 2013 was down 23.2 per cent from 2012 levels. And the prospects for 2014 show affluents remain cautious about future spending on luxury, with nearly 80 percent of n=5,001 affluents surveyed in 2013 predicting they will spend the same or less on luxury during 2014. "" Austerity is the watchword for affluents' attitudes in the current market, which reflects a return to simplicity and a back-to-basics lifestyle. Luxury marketers need to position their brands with respect for this new attitude. They must demonstrate how their brands deliver a values-based return on investment,"" added Danziger . While the developing countries have enjoyed the most attention from growth-hungry luxury brands, U.S. households remain the largest buyers of luxury goods and services in the world. However, the wealthiest U.S. consumers are giving up conspicuous consumption and status symbols that proclaim one's wealth to embrace brands that give them bragging rights to how smart a shopper he or she is. ""Marketers can no longer assume that affluent consumers are willing to spend up without a compelling reason and luxury marketers need to modify their positioning and branding to match the new normal luxury lifestyle. The recent recession has reshaped the American economy in ways that will affect us for decades to come. Affluent consumers no longer feel like wearing a symbol of wealth, knowing that the American middle class has been severely weakened from the recession. Most affluents, both the HENRYs [1] (income $100-250K) and Ultra-affluents ($250K+), would rather throw their lot in with the 99 percent and avoid the conspicuous consumption that characterized luxury in previous years,"" Danziger concludes."
"Makeup trends: Faster, simpler, prettier","It is essential in all makeup cases, and a flagship eye makeup product: mascara has shown to be recession proof, and is used every day by a great number of women. Whether they prefer a curl or longlash effect, the main thing they wish to do is intensify their look with mascaras that can draw people's attention. For Luxcos, the trend is definitely towards seeking an immediate and fast effect, with greater simplicity and an easier application. ""The first benefit consumers seek is volume, most of the time with an additional effect,"" underlines Christophe Delas, Director of Luxcos. ""All-in-one formulas are also increasingly popular: our best seller formula, Lash Attract, is part of this category."" Days are increasingly punctuated by professional, family and leisure activities, therefore people are constantly trying to gain time, and consumers want efficient and simple products. "" Mascaras with immediate effect are thus extremely popular, that's why we developed Plump My Lashes, a formula that instantaneously curves lashes. Our R&D laboratory is currently focusing on new formulas to apply more product even faster,"" continues Christophe Delas. Consumers also like products that can be removed with hot water, which again has to do with gaining time and simplifying the makeup ritual. The mascara colour also plays a significant role. According to Luxcos, consumers want blacker and blacker products enriched in pigments for an even deeper look. Objective: maximum seduction in less time. So the Luxembourg company now holds a patent for the use of an ingredient able to intensify the colour of its mascaras: the ""black maker"". Naturalness seems to be to the fore this summer, with mascaras in line with the natural colour of eyelashes: brown and amber are back, as well as mascaras for lashes and hair. At MakeUp in Paris, Luxcos will thus showcase fluid, gliding textures for supple lashes, or various finishes (wet, matte, vinyl) in line with this need for discreet sublimation. Eyeliners have not been left behind, with the ever fashionable black ones adorning themselves with vinyl reflections, or ultra-bright colours for an unforgettable style. At MakeUp in Paris, Luxcos will reveal the Bahia collection, formulated with rich shades of intense blue or pearly green pigments. As for lips, Luxcos considers consumers mainly aim at differentiating themselves with innovative textures that are pleasant to wear and last long. ""As for lipgloss, we are done with sticky formulas: the trend is now towards comfortable and creamy textures. Liquid lipsticks, long-lasting lip lacquers and glosses such as our Everlasting, which can be worn for eight hours, have not been left behind, nor have double effect hybrid formulas,"" underlines Aurélie Ignaccolo, Marketing Manager at Luxcos. Lip inks make a good compromise between lip colouring, a light texture and long wear, and are also very trendy. ""They offer an alternative solution to classic red lipsticks, and maximum comfort,"" concludes Aurélie Ignaccolo."
Top perfume brands are multiplying collections,"The first exclusive ""collection"" proposed by a famous brand was discreetly launched by Prada in 2003, and it did not make the headlines. However Dior, with Colognes, Armani Privé, or Hermès, with Hermessences, quickly followed, and so did Guerlain, Estée Lauder - up until the latest one - and L'Atelier Givenchy, with a collection that now counts seven ""haute perfumery"" fragrances as a tribute to haute couture. There are now almost 25 collections available for only 14 brands, including 7 for Guerlain, 4 for Tom Ford and 3 for Armani, which makes it 169 perfumes to this day. However, the variety of references does not prevent the creation of a common world in which rare and precious scent lovers recognize themselves: an identifiable olfactory world, a discreet marketing campaign, premium ingredients, minimalist packaging with dominant shades of white, black and gold… The olfactory world of these collections is dominated by flowery (40 %) and woody scents (24 %), but there are also many oriental (21 %), hesperidia and Chypre fragrances (5 %). By definition, and out of a desire for more variety, they cover all nasal fields, except maybe for marine scents. Isabelle Ferrand stresses the favourite raw material in collections is iris, which can be found in numerous compositions. As for olfactory trends, it is the Oud that is the most frequent: it is inherent to all collections, except the collection by Chanel. Leather, incense, patchouli, rose and jasmine have also greatly inspired composers. Makeup ranges, skincare creams, candles, new perfume substrates… The collection offer is getting more diversified now, and brands are opening more and more wholly owned stores with VIP services. This is the birth of a new luxury dimension in which the great names of perfumery manage to maintain their positions."
MakeUp in Paris will held its fifth edition next week,"In five years, MakeUp in Paris has managed to carve a name for itself. While there were 31 exhibitors in 2010, for the first edition, the 2014 event will gather 111 companies, out of which 22 never missed a single edition. The main reason for this success, according to the organizers, is that ""an entire industry, from ingredients to formulas, including packaging and accessories, had a strong desire for it to happen."" Today, MakeUp in Paris has grown as the unavoidable annual event for the makeup industry and the organisers are determined to celebrate this fifth year! On this occasion, the Polo Cosmesi, the Italian association gathering the main Italian players in the make-up industry, will invite visitors to taste regional culinary specialities at their bar located in the Delorme hall. To note that the Kusmi Tea brand whose teas, through the delicacy and subtlety of their flavours have been a delight to gourmets since 1867, will also have its dedicated bar set up in the Lenôtre hall, inviting visitors to discover the many possible variations around tea. Not to mention the Vitacoco water, an ultra-moisturizing coconut water that will be offered for tasting at the bar located in the Gabriel hall. Also, Strand Cosmetics Europe will be celebrating 50 years of innovation and creativity, in particular through a participation in the private tour of the Louvre Museum, and Oekabeauty will be recalling, among other things, its hundred years of activity on a dedicated panel in front of the conference area. About 12 conferences on topics as diverse as intellectual property, microbial protection, the power and influence of blogs, the make-up codes in Japan, Korea and France, or, intuition as an aid to decision-making and a driver for innovation. For instance, a conference hosted by Marielle Belin and Jean-Louis Prata will be devoted to ""Neuroscience and Innovation"" or ""How to innovate and keep clients passionate on the long term?"" (Thursday June 12th, 11:30 am - 12:15 pm). Facing highly individualized consumers, how can R&D and Marketing teams take advantage of this new deal? To offer its participants a comprehensive overview of the make-up industry, MakeUp in Paris will be opening for the second year in a row its ""ingredients"" area, MakeUPigments, a pole of presentation and animation exclusively dedicated to make-up ingredients suppliers. As per last year, exhibitors and visitors will be invited to an educational and sensory discovery of make-up colours. Eventually, the organisers of MakeUp in Paris are expecting about 3,000 visitors, which would be a new record!"
Marionnaud extands its Click and Collect service throughout France,"After having launched digital applications, in particular in its Champs-Elysées flagship store in Paris, in store delivery is a new step forward for Marionnaud, which wants to become an omni-channel retailer. ""Consumers are changing their shopping habits and Marionnaud is taking care of them in this move,"" the retailer underlines. The main lines of the new service are quite simple: the consumer orders her (or his) products on Marionnaud's online shop, then chooses the store where to get the products delivered. When the products are delivered, the consumer receives an email and can pick them up. All the 8,000 references of the online shop can be delivered through the click and collect service, which ""entirely free."" Once in the shop, the customer does not leave with a postal parcel but with a Marionnaud bag, just as after a shopping session. ""We opted for a personalized approach to Click & Collect,"" says Carole Barkatz, e-commerce manager at Marionnaud. The shop assistants that hand over the order can thus provide all the information the clients may need about additional products. According to Marionnaud, within a few weeks, the new free service was a resounding success with Click & Collect representing more than 20% of all online orders in March. Marionnaud sees this service as a customer loyalty tool but also as a way to recruit new clients and as a good opportunity to enhance traffic in many of its outlets."
World luxury market to enter a maturity phase,"The reports presented last week in Milan by the Altagamma Foundation and consultancy firm Bain & Company confirmed the world luxury market has reached a maturity and stabilisation phase with moderate growth expected this year, around the same level as in 2013. Healthy growth trend ""We are entering a new phase for the sector, one I would define as a new normal,"" said Claudia D'Arpizio, Director of Bain & Company's Milan Office. ""The absence of explosive phenomena in the short term, as China has been in recent years, and at the same time the greater capacity to react to the crisis in the mature markets is resulting in a more stable and healthy growth trend, of between 4% and 6% at constant exchange rates in the next few years"", she adds. The growth rate was +6.5% at constant exchange rates in 2013 (+2% at current exchange rates) and +5% at constant rates in 2012 (+10% at current exchange rates). Altagamma forecasts a constant growth rate of around 6% for 2014, similar to that of last year. US and Asia drive growth As for the geographical markets, the US is once again the engine for growth while Europe is bolstered above all by tourist consumption, even if the consumption of the Russians has fallen on the domestic market and in the main European capital cities. Chinese consumers are increasingly important on both the domestic and overseas market (from Japan and Korea to Australia, South East Asia, the US and Canada) while the Japanese are finally spending again on the local market. Japan has demonstrated consistent real growth but with a negative exchange rate effect. Continental China is lacking in dynamism, Hong Kong and Macau are doing fine, South Korea is still not very dynamic, while South East Asia, and Indonesia in particular, is enjoying strong growth. ""We expect a growth rate of +9% in Japan, +8% in the Middle East, +7% in Asia, +6% in the Americas and +4% in Europe, while for the Rest of the World we forecast growth of +7%,"" comments Armando Branchini, Vice Chairman of Altagamma. The luxury market is increasingly guided by ""consumer flows and segments of consumers influenced by tourism, by the behaviour of various nationalities, and by fluctuations in exchange rates which alter consumption patterns,"" Altagamma concludes."
China Beauty Expo: main trends of the 2014 edition,"CBE features three major exhibition areas: Cosmetics China, dedicated to cosmetics, skin care products and perfumes, Cosmetech Shanghai, dedicated to equipment, packaging and ingredients, and Beauty Shanghai, dedicated to professionnal brands sold in beauty salons, spas and outlets specializing in nail and hair products. CBE is a unique opportunity to learn about new beauty trends in China. This year's edition was marked by the emergence of several very ambitious Chinese brands, most often created by Chinese suppliers and subcontractors who have upgraded their expertise in product design and market knowledge by working for major Asian and global brands. This new generation of Chinese cosmetic brands are learning from the example of Herborist, the premium brand of Jahwa Group, the largest cosmetics company in China. Their strategy consists in promoting their products trough celebrities, investing and building up on the ""made in China"" and even ""made better in China"" claims. Eventually, we have seen about fifty emerging Chinese brands at the show. Besides Chinese brands many other Asian players participated in the show. Korean brands are the most aggressive in terms of packaging, branding and price positioning, while Japanese brands rely on sober, refined and elegant designs and claim their knowledge of the needs and expectations of Asian women. Compared to Asian companies, relatively few European brands made it to Shanghai to challenge the Chinese market. Regulatory and administrative barriers, as well as market access costs may have discouraged them. In order to facilitate the entry of new comers, Informa, the organizer of CBE imported the Zoom concept, which has been developed on the Beyond Beauty Paris show since 2003. Organised for the first time within the expo, Zoom Asia was dedicated to innovative fragrance and beauty brands from western countries whishing to tap into the Asian markets. They met with key Asian retail buyers and wholesalers in a dedicated space. ""We had approximately 100 potential agents and distributors for China who came to our booth during the three days of the show as well as lots of interest from direct buyers and from the local media. We would certainly recommend it as a great showcase for international companies looking to gain a foothold on the China market,"" said Rocky Mammone, CEO of Majic Beauty. China Beauty Expo: Key figures 2014 – 252,200 visitors from 80 countries and regions – 6,433 booths up to international standards (+12.5% from 2013) – 1,837 companies (+10.9% from 2013) – 127,000 sqm of exhibition area, in 11 halls – Media coverage by over 80 local and international TV channels, magazines, newspapers, major websites and opinion-makers blogs – Increased presence of country pavilions exhibition area (France +53%, Germany +36% from 2013), several countries represented (Italy, Spain, Singapore, Thailand, Korea…)"
Makeup: What are the main growth leverages for prestige brands?,"""Our findings show that the same strategy cannot be applied equally to mature (mainly Europe), emerging (Asia) or specific markets (USA),"" says Philippe Jourdan, University Professor and founding partner of Promise Consulting. The company focused on makeup brands sold in selective retail channels, defined as including brand owned retail networks (Kiko, Body Shop, Yves Rocher, etc.), department stores, beauty chains (Sephora, Marionnaud, Douglas, etc.) and Duty Free stores. A quick ranking of brands according to their ""overall business performance"" - a composite indicator that takes into account penetration, market share and brand loyalty - shows a strong heterogeneity depending on the country where the products are sold. The performance seems to depend on the brand's DNA: brands deriving from the fashion industry are predominant in Europe, while in Asia, those deriving from cosmetic brands and (or) from local brands prevail. In the United States two types of players are vying for market: brands deriving from the skin care world (Clinic, Estée Lauder) and those that can be described as ""makeup pure player"" (MAC) and, more generally, the makeup artists brands. In France and in Korea brands deriving from the haute couture world record a stronger notoriety in makeup than other brands, in particular because of the privileged position occupied by Dior in France and by Chanel in Korea. However, in the United States makeup artist brands (MAC, Bobbi Brown, Nars or Laura Mercier) are resisting to haute couture brands. As far as image is concerned, brands derived from the haute couture world - because of the prestige and quality associated with their name - sill enjoy a certain advantage over other brands, both in France, in the United States and in Korea. However, the haute couture origin does not guarantee a bigger market share in the make-up market in the United States due to the historical presence of Clinique, the leading beauty and makeup brand. Researches conducted by Promise Consulting also showed a strong correlation between makeup brands' ability to attract (their image) and their market share, notably in France and in the United States. In France, makeup brands that have their origin in the fashion industry make the best use of their image in terms of sales. In the United States, the two performance indicators - image and sales - are at their highest level with makeup artist brands (MAC) and with brands derived from the world of skin-care (Clinic). Makeup artists are probably taking advantage of their partnerships with haute couture designers (Peter Philips in backstage of the Chanel fashion show, Pat McGrath with Dior, etc.). As of skin care brands, they have been innovative in bringing the two worlds of care and complexion (CC Cream). For selective makeup brands, as for perfume or skincare brands, image thus appears as the aggregation of product characteristics (quality) and statutory (""brand used by celebrities"", ""used by makeup artists"") and symbolic (""an iconic brand"") criteria, regardless of the country."
"""The Japanese cosmetics market is increasingly attractive,"" Hajime Suzuki, Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo","Premium Beauty News - The dates of Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech were changed from Summer to Autumn in order to get more exhibition space available. What are your goals regarding the number of exhibitors and visitors? Hajime Suzuki - Our aim is to gather a total of 600 exhibitors at the next co-held editions of Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo, which represents an increase of 60 per cent compared the previous shows in 2013, which gathered 368 exhibitors. With more than five months left before the show, about 80% of the exhibition space is already sold and we expect it to be fully booked before the show starts. We expect about 15% of the exhibitors to come from overseas, but the proportion could reach 30% for Cosme Tokyo, the event dedicated to finished products. So far, registered exhibitors come from 26 countries or regions [1]. As for visitors, our aim is to host 30,000 people, which represents a 50% rise compared to the previous year. It is an ambitious goal, but we have been achieving such tremendous growth ever since the launch of Cosme Tech. More international visitors are expected to participate in the event, especially from other Asian countries where made-in-Japan cosmetics are very popular. Premium Beauty News - What will be the main events and innovations of the 2014 edition of the shows? Hajime Suzuki - Within Cosme Tokyo 2014, we are launching an International Area that will become one of the main features of the event. Overseas exhibitors will showcase their products, besides made-in-Japan cosmetics. As per last year, Korea and Thailand will be represented in national Pavilions, but on a larger surface. This year, Belgium and Switzerland will also have national Pavilions and some more are still expected to join. In addition, there is a special pavilion for overseas companies who do not have importers in Japan, which is called ""New Comers to the Japanese Market"" Pavilion. As the Japanese market is strongly rebounding and import cosmetics are becoming increasingly popular, more and more international companies want to test their products at the show. We help companies participating in this area by conducting special promotional actions targeting importers and distributors in Japan. Regarding Cosme Tech 2014, we are launching a new ""World Ingredients Pavilion"" dedicated to overseas companies that do not have a Japanese office yet. This area will gather new comers to the Japanese market, in particular start-up or smaller companies. We aim to encourage a wider range of overseas ingredients suppliers to challenge the Japanese market. Interests for new and advanced ingredients are increasing among Japanese consumers, especially in growing categories such as anti-aging and natural/organic. Thus, cosmetics manufacturers are eager to find new ingredients. The Japanese market is increasingly attractive. Premium Beauty News - What about organic and natural cosmetics? Hajime Suzuki - Actually, organic products are one of the fastest-growing categories at Cosme Tokyo 2014. There is a dedicated ""Organic Zone"" but organic cosmetics/toiletries are exhibited in almost every zones. Overseas products are dominant in this category, which is one of the reasons international exhibitors are increasing rapidly, especially from European countries and Australia, but also from the Middle East, Africa and Asian countries. The trend is also prominent in Cosme Tech: many ingredients and OEM suppliers will showcase innovative natural and organic ingredients or formulations. Premium Beauty News - The Cosme Tech show is dedicated to suppliers. How is this part of the event evolving? Hajime Suzuki - Cosme Tech 2014 is expected to account for about 60% of the total of exhibitors. It is almost fully booked already and we are trying to prepare some additional space by re-adjusting the layout. Cosme Tech has already become one of the largest exhibitions in Asia for cosmetics OEM and packaging suppliers, and it is still growing. Regarding the Container/Packaging Zone, 8 of the top 10 manufacturers of cosmetic containers in Japan have already decided to exhibit. Regarding the OEM/ODM Zone, more than 100 exhibitors are expected to present their services, including Japan's top player Nihon Kolmar and Italian company B. Kolor Makeup & Skincare. Premium Beauty News - How is the Japanese market evolving for personal care products? Hajime Suzuki - Japan is one of the world's largest cosmetics market and the world's largest market for skincare. The Japanese economy is strongly rebounding and consumer spending is going up, especially for luxurious items including high-end cosmetics. The economic context explains why more and more European brands are exhibiting at Cosme Tokyo. Most of them have strong assets in categories that are growing in Japan, such as premium, organic and anti-aging cosmetics. The demand for premium ingredients and services from Europe is also increasing in Japan and could boost Cosme Tech. Quality is very important for Japanese consumers and European products have a very good image. I'm convinced more European companies will join us to challenge Japan's attractive market."
What will be the face of the organic cosmetics market in 2025?,"After several years of double-digit growth between 2007 and 2011, organic food and cosmetic markets are now experiencing a slowdown. The prospective study, commissioned by Organics Cluster - an association gathering the different operators of the organic sector in Frances' Rhône-Alpes region - and Cosmebio, aimed at helping industry players to better understand what are the propellers of these markets and to anticipate possible developments. The first scenario proposed in the survey (""Emerging Organics"") outlines an organic cosmetics market quite similar in 2025 to what it is now and still struggling to organize itself. According to this scenario, the increasing number of private initiatives, the complexity of brands' claims, the confusing profusion of labels and the lack of mass marketing, will limit the development of the segment and small and micro organic businesses will face stiff competition from large marketers of conventional cosmetics. In this context, according to the authors of the study, the winning strategy is to provide consumers with more transparency and traceability. On the contrary, the second scenario (""Central organics"") outlines the importance of the organic cosmetics markets betting that organic products will become a true safe haven amid repeated health and environmental crises. Widely recognized and supported by national and European authorities, the operators will successfully unite and organize themselves through virtuous contracting methods, driven by citizens willing to pay for good health. Social and environmental responsibility (CSR), as well as ethical approaches - in particular in the supply chain - will then become a factor of success. The third scenario (""liberal organics"") draws the lines of a liberal and financially driven organic cosmetics market. Within a difficult economic environment, companies would join forces in order to become more competitive. Major cosmetics groups, increasingly involved in CSR, would massively buy small and micro businesses in the organic sector. Marketers would communicate on ""natural"" cosmetics and insist on the availability of their low priced products in nearby supermarkets. In this case, the winning strategy is to provide a more accessible and innovative organic cosmetics. The fourth scenario outlines a ""suspect organic industry"" with diluted principles and no real specificity. The assumption is that more stringent regulations will force conventional cosmetics to a greater respect for the environment. In parallel, scandals impacting organic cosmetics may also weaken the sector. Consumers would divert to other values, such as local purchase for example. In this context, the winning strategy is to maintain a close and trustful relationship with the consumer. While it is difficult to deem which one of the four scenarios is most likely to occur, each of them helps to discern what are the key issues and the main market drivers of organic cosmetics market and to better understand its current difficulties."
Exports drive the growth of the Italian cosmetics industry,"The recession of the Italian personal care market continued in 2013 to EUR 9,500 million, a decline of 1.2% compared to 2012, according to recently released figures from Cosmetica Italia. According to the trade association, this recession, which remains modest compared to the crisis the country has been facing since 2007-2008, confirms the counter-cyclical nature of the sector. However, some channels are particularly sensitive to the economic context and suffer more than others. This is particularly the case of professional circuits: sales in hair salons have plummeted by -8.4% and sales in beauty parlours declined by -5.5%. In this context, only the direct sales channel (doorstep sales or mail order sales) pulls out of the game, with an increase of 4.4%. Sales also rose in pharmacies (+0.3%). In this context, the turnover of Italian companies rose by +2.6% to reach 9.3 billion euros in 2013, mainly boosted by sales in foreign markets, which reached 3.2 billion euros in 2013, increasing by +11%. On the contrary, imports increased by only +0.8%. ""Continuous investment policies in innovation and development have enabled Italian companies to gain competitive advantage in international markets, where there is a significant increase in sales, including in volume, indicating a competitive and reliable offer,"" says Cosmetica Italia. As far as cosmetics are concerned, France remains the largest customer and the leading provider of Italy, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain and Russia."
What do beauty bloggers expect...,"Capucine Piot (Babillages), Sophie Strobel ((dé)maquillages), and Alexis Toublanc (Dr. Jicky & Mister Phoebus), were gathered on April 18 for a breakfast with the communication, media relation and community managers of beauty brands. Organised under the auspices of the FEBEA, the meeting was conceived as an opportunity for the three bloggers to share their experience and expectations about the way beauty companies communicate with them. A blog primarily reflects its author's personality, tastes and interests. The FEBEA's three guests were the perfect illustration. On the Babillages blog - created seven years ago - Capucine Piot deals about beauty issues with a very personal point of view. ""I am very much of a girl next door,"" explains Capucine. She carefully makes the pictures illustrating her posts and regularly uploads beauty tutorials on her YouTube video channel. With over 10,000 visits per day, Babillages is one of the most influential French-speaking beauty blogs. Capucine Piot thus successfully monetized her blog, in particular thanks to partnerships with beauty brands. A trained biologist and cosmetologist, Sophie Strobel enjoys about fifteen years of experience in the beauty industry. Her approach of beauty issues consists in deciphering them. She does not monetize her blog, which is much more ""a hobby, that adds up to an already busy work and family life."" Since 2010, Alexis Toublanc is one of the two authors of the Dr. Jicky & Mister Phoebus blog, fully dedicated to perfume. A very different world, considering its speech than beauty blogs: smaller readership, many exchanges with peers, slower publication pace, ""because it takes time to know a perfume and be able to write about it."" Customize relationships While Alexis Toublanc does not feel overwhelmed by the demands of brands - ""regular but not excessive"" - he nevertheless appreciates personalized relationship with brands. Actually, he sees this as a key factor of success: ""It is obvious that a blogger enthusiastic with classic, traditional or historical fragrances will feel hardly pleased by an avant-garde scent,"" he says. This is also a key issue for Capucine Piot and Sophie Strobel, even if their experience differs from Alexis' one since they have to face countless requests from beauty brands, and may have difficulties - despite their efforts - to reply quickly to all of them. In such conditions, poorly targeted or inappropriate requests have many chances to be merely ignored. ""When I'm called 'Babillages' rather than by my first name, or when I'm sent shampoos for blonde hair, chances to emerge at the top of my priorities are obviously declining,"" said Capucine. ""Personal and friendly contacts are important things. And customization is the key to success. Some brands took the time to make a fact sheet on the needs of each of the bloggers they are working with. They know that I have dry skin and hair, and that it is useless to send me products for oily skin,"" she adds . ""We are also very active on social networks, it is important source of information for brands eager to better know the bloggers,"" says Sophie Strobel. An attitude that has nothing in common with ""the whims of spoiled little girls,"" points Capucine Piot. Simply, bloggers are not journalists and the most common error among beauty brands seems to treat them in the same way. ""We do not have the same needs or the same expectations,"" insists Sophie Strobel. Bloggers are primarily consumers. For sure, they are expert, informed and skilled consumers, but they just test products, speak about products and give their opinion with their own sensibility as a consumer would. ""While excessively scientific or technical contents generally bore them, as they bore their readers, they are nevertheless keen to identify superficial speeches,"" warns Sophie Strobel . Furthermore, most bloggers have another activity besides their blog and are not as available as journalists may be. Brands that target them must take that into consideration when organising events if they want to have a chance to see them. Of course things get a little more complicated when considering that some journalists are also bloggers. However, for Sophie Strobel that just demonstrates that ""they are two very different activities that can be complementary."""
Brazil: The cosmetics market boosted by hair care,"According to Euromonitor, despite the context of an economic slowdown, Brazil is now the third largest market on the global scale, all segments included, behind the United States and China. As the world's largest market in the perfume and deodorant categories, Brazil's growth is also boosted by hair care and the extremely dynamic conditioner segment in particular. According to Mintel, it represented 9 % of all hair care launches last year in the world, ahead of the United Kingdom (8 %) and the United States (7 %). According to the same source, this market is expected to achieve a two-digit annual growth over the next four years to reach US$12.45 billion in 2017. In 2013, shampoos and conditioners represented a market estimated at US$2.92 billion. The usage rate of shampoos in Brazil is amongst the highest in the world, as 91 % of Brazilians declare themselves as users: that is as much as in France (91 %), and more than in England (89 %). Christopher Lindlsey, the Global Skin Care analyst at Mintel, explains this partly results from a number of new product developments that was hardly ever seen anywhere else in the world, with an offer that is perfectly adapted to local diversities and specific regional claims. ""Developing anti-aging claims could add value to the market in the future"", he adds. According to Euromonitor, Brazil is still dominated by the mass-market, though it is gradually turning towards the premium segment, particularly with the rise of perfume and skincare product sales. Lastly, direct sales are starting to lose ground to brands sold in stores, as can be seen with L'Occitane's success, one of the fastest growths among international brands in Brazil."
Men's cosmetics boom in BRIC countries,"What's behind the global boom? Catherine O'Connor - Consumers in BRIC markets are experiencing increasing demand for men's grooming and cosmetic products due to pressure to look good in the workplace and their personal lives. Needs vary by country, with men in China and India being more receptive to cosmetic products. How does the market look in India? Catherine O'Connor - The use of make-up by males in India is startlingly high, with men consuming 46% of make-up by volume. This is driven by both cultural and religious phenomena; for instance, kohl is a common eye make-up applied by men on special occasions. Is the situation similar in China? Catherine O'Connor - Chinese men are similarly large users of make-up, accounting for 38% of consumption. Over a quarter of this consumption is motivated by a desire to meet the needs of their lifestage, with working men feeling a heightened pressure to look fresh and professional. Demand is high for products that minimize signs of tiredness, such as concealers and eye highlighters. What are Brazilian men buying? Catherine O'Connor - Brazil's image-conscious culture is increasingly posing high beauty demands on men as well as women. Men account for 45% of the skincare market in Brazil, with demand for facial care and depilatories on the rise. This consumption is driven by a desire for products that offer beauty benefits to meet the needs of mens' age, with anti-agers and revitalizing skin creams proving popular. Is Russia the same as the rest of the BRICs? Catherine O'Connor - In Russia, use of make-up among men is far lower, accounting for only 12% of the market by volume. This reflects a greater social prevalence of traditional notions of rugged masculinity, with the majority of Russian men viewing cosmetics as feminine products. Successful male grooming products in Russia will be marketed around their potency and convenience, as can be seen in the popularity of wipes and products with long-lasting claims. What are the global trends? Catherine O'Connor - Beauty trends that originated in Asia are now increasingly popular in Western markets, as can be seen in the recent launches of male BB creams from major manufacturers. The most successful products will, however, be marketed around function rather than beauty, with Western men more abashed about seeking beauty goals than their Chinese and Indian counterparts."
Clarins make-up wears Brazilian colours for summer 2014,"""Beyond the fact that the entire world will have their eyes riveted on this country this summer, choosing Brazil as a source of inspiration and creation made several reasons coincide, starting with the significant role of make-up in this country,"" underlines Suzy Lebert. Cobalt blue echoes the typical vibrant colours of this country, and gives the pitch to the eye palette with bright coral and amber shades. Vibrant Black and Blue are also available in the Truly Waterproof range of 12-hour continuous hold mascaras. ""In Brazil, everything is important in make-up, your look, mouth and complexion. We thus worked with this goal in mind, while remaining truthful to our will to sublimate women naturally, and not to transform them"". Lips can wear the Lip Balm Crayon, available as a limited edition in five colours, and which both provides a coloured transparent effect and hydrating care. The skin is lit up with a compact powder with lucky charm prints of Brazilian bracelets, and the iridescent oil nourishes and brightens without any excess. ""But the more profound reasons that guided us towards choosing Brazil are elsewhere. As a plant expert brand seeking to preserve life and populations, Clarins' DNA is naturally associated to this country. We source several of our ingredients in this region, and in 2013 we committed to responsible beauty practices by taking part in a programme aiming to protect a native community in Amazonia. The price of each The Essential palette was paid back to this community, as make-up is deeply rooted in their culture. Again, wearing make-up is part of Brazilian codes at all levels of the population,"" concludes Suzy Lebert."
New challenges for marine cosmetics,"If the sea air strongly enhances the development of marine cosmetics, in particular through extensive research and the formulation of new, ultra-powerful actives, the breeze may well intensify, and winds may become even more favourable. Indeed, new markets are opening downstream, and there is a reorganisation in distribution channels. While Asia as a whole - and not only Japan - is culturally favourable to the beneficial effects of seaweed and other natural planktons, many other countries are getting increasingly interested in the sea's benefits, including when they are available in the form of skincare creams. The claim of naturalness remains key to enter the market, in particular in Brazil and China, whereas people in Russia are more sensitive to fast efficacy promises. As for French brands, it is both the origins of the Label France and the historical expertise in thalassotherapy that make a difference. Thalgo's growth mostly comes from exports. The brand is now present in 90 countries thanks to the development of their spas and day-spas. Similarly, Phytomer has achieved a two-digit growth over the past two years, with 75 % of their turnover resulting from exports, and a presence in 80 countries. The professional channel of beauty salons and thalassotherapy centres in France remains the main path to reach women consumers. ""There is this idea that consumers are actually discovering the benefits of marine cosmetics, because these are not necessarily a first choice,"" sums up Stéphanie Leclere, of the Bio Carnac brand. Nevertheless, distribution channels could get more diversified and gradually include selective counters, which are still poorly supplied in this type of products. ""Marine cosmetics could be a growth-driver much beyond the professional channel, and it would definitely have its own place in selective ones because it has a truly different offer,"" explain managers at Daniel Jouvance. The brand has been suffering from the decline of distance selling, its original channel, and is thinking about entering the retail business. They have had the same idea at Algotherm. ""Although the relationship with consumers is closer in beauty salons, we are gradually opening up to pharmacy and healthcare networks,"" highlights Angélique Labbé, Product Development Manager for Algotherm. The sector of marine cosmetics should be able to both rely on and give more value to its own differences. If it benefits from a favourable image, it does remain quite unknown to the public. ""Deep abysses, skin dehydration… the sea both scares and attracts people. It's up to us to explain and reassure them, as well as to come up with the right, convincing and differentiating arguments"", affirms Laure Courpotin, Marketing Director at Daniel Jouvance. ""It's up to us to make our microalgae more 'glamorous'."" And this is exactly what the Breton brand is working on: at their customers' request, they are now trying to add shapes and colours to these micro-elements in communication documents. Reluctance also comes from the quality of seawaters, and therefore of the ingredients derived from the ocean. This new concern results from the massive discharge of all kinds of pollutants all around the world. Manufacturers have been multiplying promises of meticulous sourcing to guarantee raw materials were taken or grown in the purest waters. At Thalgo, a brand that has otherwise undertaken to adopt environmentally friendly practices, actives are sourced according to the results of a scanning operation carried out to spot the most relevant areas, and are thus selected for their quality. Bio Carnac and Algotherm draw their own materials from the Iroise Sea, a world reserve of biosphere labelled by UNESCO, where the concentration in ions and minerals is quite high thanks to strong currents. Similarly to Daniel Jouvance, Phytomer has been working on the culture of marine microorganisms. ""We manage to make microorganisms work in such a way that they can reproduce their active molecules in laboratory conditions, and all this is done using green methods,"" explains Mathilde Lagarde, of Phytomer. Apart from the quality of raw materials, the sector of marine cosmetics also makes more and more commitments in relation to environmental protection. Algotherm's newest solar range Algosun is the latest example of this trend: it protects the skin while preserving the ocean's ecosystems. According to brand managers, 25,000 tons of sun creams are spread across the oceans every year, which threatens coral reefs and marine species. Therefore Algotherm has developed a partnership with French magazine Thalassa to raise public awareness of the toxicity of sun products. They also offer a unique, ""Ocean Respect""-labelled line which they guarantee is harmless for the marine environment. Formulation, distribution, communication… the beauty of the sea is definitely sending promising signals."
High tide for marine cosmetics,"An increasing number of brands now pre-empt this territory, and their origins tend to get more diversified. Similarly to the leading French pioneer brands, most of which come from thalassotherapy (Thalgo, Algotherm, Biotherm, Phytomer…), other signatures are gradually settling in the various segments of the field: among them can be found Algenist, Bio Carnac, O2Mer, or H20+. Even the most premium segments are concerned, as can be seen with Crème de La Mer (Estée Lauder Companies). ""It is a growth-driving trend because it provides a huge potential to be exploited,"" declares Laure Courpotin, Marketing Director at Daniel Jouvance, one of the pioneer brands of the sector, which banked everything on the power of microalgae 30 years ago. Mathilde Lagarde, Marketing Director at Phytomer, underlines the revival this sector has been experiencing for four or five years: ""Marine cosmetics have existed for a very long time, but they were a bit outdated. Now, scientific progress, especially in biotechnologies, has proven so tremendous over the last few years, that we have come to achieve more efficacy thanks to new actives and enhanced performance. We have observed a renewed interest in this field, and both the media and sales outlets are allowing it an increasingly central part."" Brands rely on the fundamental principle of the similarity between blood plasma and the composition of marine ingredients (seawater, seaweed, microalgae) to claim that cosmetic products based on marine actives exhibit unequalled affinity with the skin. This represents a major asset to stimulate research work on such biodiversity, whose properties and immensity make it exceptional. ""Marine organisms are subjected to extreme living conditions which compel them to develop unique resistance properties,"" explains Isabelle Guichon, Scientific Communication Manager at Thalgo. ""It is possible to find sugars derived from particular marine bacteria which are three to four times more effective than hyaluronic acid"". And there is a vast territory still to be explored. ""There are bright prospects in terms of discoveries, if we keep in mind there are from 25 to 30,000 seaweed species around the surface of the globe. Brittany shelters 800 of them, but only about fifty are actually used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food-processing industries,"" comments Angélique Labbé, Product Development Manager for Algotherm within the Batteur group. As a result, while the marine cosmetics sector keeps claiming its naturalness, it is also becoming increasingly more high-tech. ""We gradually offer a stronger technical value with more and more high-level benefits,"" confirm Stéphanie Leclere and Virginie Rio, of new organic brand Bio Carnac. On the one hand, there is the argument of proven efficacy; on the other hand, there is that of naturalness. Marine beauty thus works in perfect harmony with the market's core trends. The offer gets richer, and ranges get more diverse and position themselves on anti-aging expertise in particular. As an example, Crème de la Mer launched their Perennial Brown and Blue Algae-based Lifting Contour Serum (€265) at the beginning of the year. Algotherm also provides their own global anti-aging solution with the Algotime Expert range, a line composed of five products derived from a combination of four types of seaweed (Undaria Pinnatifida, Ulva Lactuca, Dictyopteris Membranacea, Alaria Esculenta). Ultimately, Daniel Jouvance offers a sea treasure with the Isochrysis microalgae, which they nestled within the Océâge Idéal products for a youthful appearance."
Cosmopack and Cosmoprof open their doors this week in Bologna,"""Rather than a 'fair', we prefer to talk about a ""showcase"" of trends, innovation and research, which are the cornerstones of the event, » explains Dino Tavazzi, CEO of SoGeCos Spa, the subsidiary of Bologna Fiere organising the event. ""We are investing a great deal in order to have an increasingly qualified audience of visitors in Bologna,"" he adds. For instance, road shows have been organized with the aim to promote the event abroad, specifically in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, United Arab Emirates, Japan, Peru and Singapore. For this edition, the organisers have working on setting up several international buyer delegations, in order to ensure an influx of buyers from India, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, the USA, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Iraq, Russia, South Africa and all of Europe. Thus, a total of 300 buyers have been invited to the event to attend pre-arranged meetings with more than 540 international exhibitors, with a total of over 1,700 planned meetings. The programme embraces all the sectors represented at the event. The organisers are also continuing their huge investments in Cosmopack, the event's section dedicated to the suppliers of the cosmetic industry. After having completely revamped the exhibition area dedicated to this section last year, they decided to move again its opening date. Cosmopack will therefore open on April 2nd, two days before the rest of the event, ""to help international visitors make the most of their visit and allow exhibitors to enjoy increased visibility."" Major events and installations are also on the agenda for 2014. Following the success of ""The Lipstick Factory"", the special initiative which brought together the whole lipstick production chain at the last edition, 2014 will see the creation of a new installation: ""The Powder Factory"". Visitors will be invited to a journey into the development and production of makeup powders, from manufacturing through to packaging. And the powder compacts produced during the event will be ""carbon-neutral"", claim the organizers. Cosmopack will also offer riche programme of conferences in the Trend Forum area, including presentations on colour trends by Beautystream (April 3rd, 12.30 pm), on the future of retail, by Centdegrés (April 3rd, 02.00 pm), on Brand Image, by Dieter Bakic (April 3rd, 04.30 pm), Beauty In Brazil, by Nelly Rodi (April 4th, 2.30 p.m.), or What's Next In Asia, by Information & Inspiration (April 5th, 12.00 a.m.)."
AS Watson restructures Marionnaud,"As sales prestige beauty sales continue to slow in several European countries, Marionnaud has initiated a drastic restructuring of its network. The retailer, which counted more than 1,100 stores in 11 countries in Europe, is closing several points of sale to focus on the most profitable stores. Marionnaud is therefore pulling out entirely from the Polish market with the closure of its 21 perfume shops in the country. Watson says the group wants to ""focus its activities on other Central European markets, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania."" In the Iberian Peninsula, the group is dramatically reducing the size of its retail network. Following negotiations with the employee representatives, Marionnaud Iberica has announced its intention to focus its business on 43% of its network. As a consequence, a total of 73 stores - 69 in Spain and 4 in Portugal - out of 128 will be closed. At the end of the operation, Marionnaud will be present in Spain and Portugal through 55 stores and will employ 330 staff, compared to 660 previously. The crisis, which has hit the two countries since 2008, has led to a significant contraction of the selective beauty market and recovery is yet to come (sales declined by -7% in 2012 and by -2.1 % in 2013 according to The NPD Group). Conjointly to this restructuring, the group's top management has entered a transitional period. In France, where Marionnaud has accelerated the renovation of its 531 stores and reopened its flagship store on the Champs-Elysées, Eileen Yeo has succeeded William G. Koeberlé as the new CEO. Mrs Yo was previously co-CEO Marionnaud France since her arrival in the company in 2013. After more than 8.5 years in the Group, William Koeberlé will leave it definitively this summer to pursue ""personal projects"". During this transition period, he will monitor public affaires issues for the company, according to AS Watson. The Marionnaud group was acquired in 2005 by the world's leading retailer of health, beauty, fragrance and cosmetic products, AS Watson Group, a subsidiary of the Hutchison Whampoa-Group. At a press conference at the end of February in Hong Kong, Hutchison Whampoa's Group Managing Director Canning Fok said there is no plan to sell this division in which the group will continue to invest. However, Hutchison Whampoa has indicated that the Marionnaud business would be excluded from the future IPO of approximately 25% of AS Watson & Co shares."
"After Paris and New York, the reasons behind the success of Makeup in Seoul","Premium Beauty News - So, what is this miracle recipe? Sandra Maguarian - The ingredients in this recipe were first, enthusiasm, passion, adventure... MakeUp in Paris, followed by MakeUp in New York and now by MakeUp in Seoul are clearly causing this ""special something"", this tremor, which are little or not at all felt in bigger events. It is true that the affective, almost carnal side of the event is easier to develop when you're dealing with fifty or a hundred exhibitors. But the ""compact format"" of the event does not explain everything. Our industrial partners, who decide to embark on the adventure by renting some exhibition space, quickly find out that their presence is not just a matter of square meters. We really want to involve them throughout the duration of the event, which they accept enthusiastically. Workshops, special animations, conferences are among the many means they have available to take part to this great two–day celebration dedicated to make-up. The balance we chose between formula manufacturers, packaging specialists and accessory manufacturers is also no mere coincidence. By highlighting first the content, then the container and finally the accessories, it is the entire visitorship configuration which is targeted. It is clear that the content is what marketing services are mostly interested in and they prove it every year by massively attending our events each year. This is an important element! Not to say very important! It gives these marketing teams the opportunity to discover, touch, test, admire, what will make the uniqueness of the product they will be launching in the future. But that's not all! The fact to keep on providing everyone with similar of very similar stands, by promoting finally what should really be, that is to say the product, is what seduces the visitor, namely the client. Focus on key points! Premium Beauty News - Figures alone are impressive if you look at the ratio on the number of visitors/number of exhibitors! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Yes that's an interesting fact to highlight. This ratio is incredibly profitable to us. 2,600 visitors in Paris last year for 80 exhibitors...; 1,600 visitors in New York for 65 exhibitors and 1,800 visitors in Seoul for 32 exhibitors! A contact cost difficult to beat, don't you think? Especially since the average cost of a fully furnished stand that includes, in addition, the food service for two days, and even the cocktail party on the first evening is particularly competitive. Premium Beauty News - The story of MakeUp in Seoul is in line with its two Paris and New York sister events? Sandra Maguarian - It's true! In any case, what prevailed first was the speed of decision, the responsiveness of industry stakeholders who immediately decided to join us and, admittedly, the also very quick success of the event. In the case of MakeUp in Seoul, Jean-Yves Bourgeois and I wish to thank in particular the Korean men and women who helped us make a success of this first edition. We were very proud to organize MakeUp in Seoul and the feedback we had in terms of expressions of support and very concretely in terms of help, was particularly impressive. Everyone wanted this first edition to be a success and it certainly was beyond all expectations. This is a real concentration of innovation and professionalism that the 1,800 visitors were able to appreciate for two days in Seoul. Premium Beauty News - Paris, New York, Seoul....What's next? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Our legitimate ambition is to make each of these three events, a major regional event. For MakeUp in Paris in June, the region is Europe, for MakeUp in New York in September, the region is North America and for MakeUp in Seoul in March, the region is Asia. There are already many events around the world... too many some will say! We mustn't be getting too much of a good thing. Besides, we don't consider ourselves as competitors to the rest of the event organizers! We are not in the same league, be it in terms of price or in terms of exhibition space, or, simply, in terms of concept. Even if we believe that our assets are real, the fact remains that the first quality that an event organizer must have is humility. And we are very attentive first and foremost to the wishes expressed by industrial partners who accompany us."
Top beauty trends in North and South America,"From Argentina to Venezuela, Euromonitor's e-book highlights the 5 top trends in each of the 15 countries featured. These trends include: the growing popularity of BB creams, the growth of nail products, the importance of skin care products, despite the variety of preferences, the key role of direct selling in many countries. BB Creams have seen increased popularity in countries such as Brazil and Mexico as multifunctional face cream debuted in the market. In Brazil, these creams can be more expensive but are still performing well because consumers perceive them as multi-functional and find it cheaper to buy one slightly expensive product versus multiple items separately. In 2012, L'Oreal's Garnier brand launched the first BB cream in Mexico and since then several premium and mass brands have also launched BB creams, contributing to a wider product offering within the country. Nail Products are still very popular in markets such as Argentina and the Dominican Republic. In Argentina, nail colour has taken over lipstick as the guilty indulgence for women and nail products are the best performing category for beauty and personal care in the country. Despite a decline in beauty and personal care sales in the Dominican Republic, nail products are the big winner with growth in both volume and value with innovation and colour ranges strengthening the trend. Skin Care in Chile is seeing new innovation through product development and technological advances. New anti-ageing products are continually appearing on the market, targeted at both female and male consumers. Meanwhile, Canada's growing immigrant population has a strong preference for products with skin-whitening properties and therefore is not satisfied with what Canadian retail has to offer. This is creating opportunities for imported brands and ethnic retailers to drive category growth. Within premium skin care, Costa Rican consumers use cleansers, toners and creams as part of their regular facial care process, which ranks them among the top three countries in terms of per capita consumption of these products in Latin America. Direct Selling in Bolivia is relying on traditional advertising strategies such as TV commercials, print media and billboards to promote their products to consumers. This new shift proved successful though, as many large companies continue to grow in the market. In Ecuador, direct selling is growing the fastest in actual terms of all channels in 2013 and it is the largest distribution channel among beauty and personal care products. According to Euromonitor, ""direct selling will bring products to a wider range of socioeconomic classes over the next five years and will push consumers to try specialized products."""
UK: an atypical distribution,"The first specificity is the considerable weight of mass market with the importance of Boots drugstore network. With more than 2,500 outlets throughout the United Kingdom, and a beauty-related turnover of 2.17 billion pounds sterling (i.e. 35 % of the health and beauty activity) [1] , Boots compels brands to offer endless discounts, thus making the market increasingly harder to access for newcomers. Boots also distributes premium brands in a few ""more selective"" stores. The distributor's sales have even been strongly stimulated by this segment, in particular thanks to exclusive brands such as Smashbox. Lastly, they also offer a very wide variety of products under their own brands, which largely contributes to their success: their No7 line is the best-seller on the British market. As for the selective market, Debenhams remains the leader of the health and beauty segment. The department store chain is growing more and more ingenious to retain its consumers. Its strategy is to be present everywhere, all the time, and with new launches, both to adapt to the current culture of instantaneity and meet consumers' changing needs. Debenhams is now very present on the web, in particular with a dynamic e-store, and they launched their own beauty blog three years ago to guide women consumers when buying their cosmetic products. ""On the year it was created, the blog counted more than 70 million pages seen, and there are 350 million today… The idea with this editorial content is to provide readers with information on all product tests and all elements which may facilitate the act of purchase"", explains Sarah Sian, Beauty Editor of the British chain. Thanks to her educational software (videos, articles, etc.), Sarah invites women consumers to get familiar with products and thus avoids any deterrent to purchasing (fear of asking questions, of showing one's skin defects to a shop assistant, etc.). The blog is linked with the store, which resorts to numerous sampling campaigns and, of course, accepts the Debenhams loyalty card. This strategy seems to be quite effective, since Debenhams online purchases increased by 46.2 % to represent 13.2 % of 2013 total sales (only 9.3 % in 2012). British women consumers globally seek and appreciate interactivity with brands. They like learning and searching for information themselves, and they look for efficacy promises beyond aestheticism. ""Women are seeking more and more powerful products, and long-lasting, multifunctional ones represent the main trends"", underlines Sarah Sian. Therefore they prefer eye shadows that last longer, even though they are more expensive, and moisturizers which exhibit several properties such as BB or CC creams. Demand is also quite high for organic or natural products. ""Hence the success of the bareMinerals brand"", explains Sarah Sian. All in all, the market is relatively dense and largely dominated by French and American groups' brands (Procter & Gamble, L'Oréal, Chanel, LVMH, Estée Lauder, Coty, etc.). Newcomers often manage to emerge by using alternative distributors such as Space N.K. and/or very high-end networks. Others try to create a more direct and close relationship with consumers and are able to rely on the sales power of specialized TV channels in particular. Sarah Cross, one of the founders of young brand Code-Beautiful, aimed to ""create attachment to the brand and ensure consumers' loyalty from the start"". Given the overabundance of the beauty product offer, many women value recommendations and advice. Code-Beautiful has thus chosen to be distributed in beauty salons, on QVC, the teleshopping leader channel, and through a network of exclusive distributors as well. The brand also strongly invested in social networks to try and create a personal bond with its customers."
Brazil: fragrances sector set to continue growing rapidly,"By 2013 Brazil was already the most valuable fragrances market in the world, worth more than US$6 billion. This is built on the back of high per capita consumption as Brazilians use, on average, three times more fragrances by volume than consumers in the US, the next most valuable market. Not only is consumption of fragrances already high, it is also set to grow quickly with both men and women using high volumes of fragrances, and often looking to treat themselves to new and novel experiences. Meanwhile, Brazil's population is young and increasingly affluent. ""These three pillars - a broad consumer base, experience-seeking consumers and a young affluent population - will be the basis of the market's continued rapid growth,"" highlights Canadean. [1] According to the market research firm, opportunities exist to target men and women with both mass and premium products. Actually, fragrances consumption in Brazil is broad, meaning manufacturers have a variety of consumer groups and price points they can target. For instance, men play a prominent role in the Brazilian fragrances market, consuming 48.7% of fragrances by volume. Furthermore, consumers in the poorest 50% of households consume almost as many fragrances as those in the richest 50% of households. This means there are opportunities for almost all product types and price categories to succeed in the market. Regarding consumption motivations, Canadean has found that when Brazilians come to select what fragrance to use, 25.5% of consumption by value is the result of consumers seeking to either affirm particular visions of femininity or masculinity, including the use fragrances to deliberately break gender stereotypes. Meanwhile consumers' desire to experience new or novel scents are a key motivation behind the consumption of just under a quarter of all fragrances in Brazil by value, while the desire to treat oneself is also important. Almost 100 million people, half the total Brazilian population, are aged between 16 and 35. In addition to their large numbers, these consumers use fragrances more frequently than consumers in other age groups. ""Add in their growing spending power, with GDP per capita in Brazil growing by over US$4,000 between 2007 and 2012, and young Brazilians will drive rapid growth in the market,"" the market research firm concludes."
U.S. prestige eye makeup market grew 9 per cent in 2013,"While fragrance sales remained flat last year, skincare and makeup were the main contributors of the U.S. prestige beauty market growth, revealed The NPD Group. Eye makeup products, in particular, benefited from consumers' growing interest in less traditional items. In a dynamic U.S. prestige beauty market [1] that grew by 5 per cent in 2013, makeup experienced healthy gains of 7 per cent, with sales of prestige eye products reaching US$ 1.1 billion (+9% compared to 2012). ""US consumers are embracing the art of eye makeup with the addition of products that go beyond the usual staples to their beauty tool boxes,"" said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group Inc. ""Today, less traditional items are emerging in importance. Eye brow products are leading growth and, in the larger segments within eye, enhanced benefits are the aspects fuelling increases."" For instance, multi-benefit (+9%), volumizing (+11%), and long wear (+18%) products helped to drive the 2013 dollar sales growth in prestige mascara. Primarily, eyeliner growth came from pencils (+7%), long wear (+11%), and waterproof options (+10%). ""Long wear is a theme that carried throughout eye makeup, showing sales growth in the eye brow products (+21%), and shadow (+9%) as well,"" highlighted the market research firm. In general, the average selling price of prestige eye makeup was 3 per cent higher in the 12 months ending December 2013 than it was in the prior year. Eye shadow (+6%), brow (+4%), and liner (+3%) products experienced the largest increases in average selling price. With the exception of mascara, long wear products are garnering higher average selling prices than their counterparts in all segments. ""Definition that lasts is important to today's beauty consumer, looking to enhance their eyes with minimal repeat application, and they are willing to pay more to get it,"" added Karen Grant. ""It has long been said that 'our eyes have the ability to make a statement without saying a word' – eye defining makeup just turns up the volume."""
Mature women drive French fragrances sector,"The fragrance market in France is dominated by the mature generation, particularly women aged 45 and over. Female consumers are responsible for 54% of fragrances usage by volume, with over 60% of female consumption by mid-lifers (45-54 year olds) and older women (aged 55 and over). This is a third of the total market volume. Meanwhile, consumers aged 45 and over also lead consumption by men, accounting for 40.7% of total male consumption and 18.7% of total consumption by both genders. [1] With an ageing population, the importance of these groups will only increase: by 2018, there will be 1.8 million more consumers aged 45 and over in France than there were in 2013. According to Canadean, this ageing population will also create opportunities to encourage brand switching. For example, over half of consumption by pre-mid lifers (aged between 35 and 44) is a result of using fragrances once a day. In contrast mid-lifers and older consumers use fragrances far more often: over 60% of their consumption by volume is a result of consumers using fragrances more than once a day. This transition from less frequent consumption to more regular usage will be a key point for marketers to encourage consumers to switch brands. Indulgence is the most important of 20 consumption motivators Canadean tracks, driving 44.5% of consumption by value. The next leading motivation, consumer's desire to use fragrances that affirm a particular gender identity, motivates less than half as much consumption. Consumers are looking for exclusive and high-quality fragrances that add a touch of class to their aspired image. ""Despite the weak French economy, the country has witnessed little change in the top ten brands. This means that brand-loyal consumers continue to treat themselves with the brands they know and love, which makes it harder for new players, but creates an opportunity for limited edition releases of existing leading brands,"" Canadean says. Meanwhile, health and beauty stores distribute half of all fragrances in France by value, over three times as much as the next leading channel. Specialized shops can provide an even more indulgent experience by featuring larger collections, consultants, and samples, so customers can examine scents themselves. ""The perception of perfume as a significant part of appearance means that consumers, especially women, want not just indulgent and sophisticated scents, but those that match their desired lifestyle, status, or image,"" the market research firm adds. This has helped established brands such as Dior and Chanel to continue to lead the market. In addition, 21.8% of fragrances by value were consumed because they helped consumers to affirm a particular gender identity. This includes fragrances that help both men and women to assert traditional styles of masculinity or femininity, but also those that help to break gender stereotypes."
MakeUp in Seoul in fifteen days: the first beauty event of the year 2014 in Asia,"Premium Beauty News - Comments seem to be unanimous! MakeUp in Seoul, it was the right choice? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Undoubtedly, it was the right choice! But this success will have to be attributed to an entire industry, which will have mobilized itself to make of this event the first beauty event in 2014 in Asia. Leading Korean and Western companies in formulation and packaging will be present as exhibitors. And with pre-registered visitors coming from Korea and from many other countries. Premium Beauty News - Conferences, round tables and make-up animations will follow one another for two days? Sandra Maguarian - This is in the DNA of our events. MakeUp in Seoul, in the wake of its older counterparts, MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York, will be both a very professional and fun event. As always, many conferences, but also plenty of make-up animations with the support of two prestigious make-up schools, the Soobin Academy and the Hera Academy. To note also, Damien Dufresne's photo exhibition. Among the conferences and round tables not to be missed: ""Parisian make-up style oscillates between identity assertion and fashion spirit""; ""Make-up and Skin-Care, an increasingly less marked border. Where are the new developments heading to?"" The Sleever company will present the ""Sleever Make Up solution to meet the current market trends in lipstick."" To note also the following conferences: ""Ten years of experience in measuring cosmetic brands equity in Europe; America and Asia: Which lessons for make-up brands?"" and ""Make-up and applicators, a sophisticated interactivity that can transform Make-up!"" Finally, on the second day, visitors will be able to attend the presentation ""Autumn/Winter 2014 Key Runway Make-Up Trends, adapting the season's main runway trends into product implications for the Asian Consumers."" Not forgetting the two last themes: ""How to successfully protect one's intellectual property?"" and ""Make-up trends in Europe versus Asia."" Premium Beauty News - A great evening is scheduled on the first day. Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Indeed, this event is organized in partnership with the Amore Pacific Group who thus intends to celebrate with the entire industry the first Korean professional event exclusively dedicated to make-up."
USA: prestige drives beauty sales in 2013,"The US prestige beauty [1] industry grew 5 per cent in dollar sales in 2013, compared to 2012. Skincare and makeup each experienced healthy gains of 7 per cent, while fragrance dollars remained flat last year, unveiled The NPD Group. ""Beauty is among a handful of industries showing growth in 2013,"" said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. Looking beyond the prestige market, sales within the US mass channel also increased slightly, up 1 per cent for total beauty in 2013, versus 2012 [2]. The makeup category grew the most, at 2 per cent, followed by skincare at 1 per cent, but fragrance struggled with a 6 per cent decline in dollars compared to 2012. ""Value is important to consumers, but premium-priced offerings are thriving in US prestige beauty,"" notes The NPD group. Even though sales for the total prestige fragrance category were flat, fragrances priced $100 and over grew 30 per cent in dollars, while face makeup priced at $60 and up increased 28 per cent, and premium skincare for the face gained 15 per cent in dollar sales compared to 2012. Over the past two years, the average price of prestige beauty products has increased consistently. ""Whatever the motivation, consumers continue to be more willing to invest in their beauty products,"" said Grant. ""The willingness of today's consumers to spend a little more on their beauty products is a continued opportunity for manufacturers and retailers. It is the right time for communicating the end benefit of investing in better products and service to get the attention of your customer, and delivering on those promises will do the rest,"" she added. In addition to the premium segment, the direct-to-consumer channel helped to drive growth for the US beauty industry in 2013, growing 19 per cent [3]. Beside the rise of premium-priced prestige fragrances, The NPD Group also reports another important shift in the types of scents being purchased. Indeed, sales of woody oriental scents, the second largest fragrance family after floral scents, and smaller segments grew faster than the whole fragrance market in 2013. ""Floral fragrances aren't fading away, but less traditional scents are gaining more of the attention from female consumers than ever before,"" commented Karen Grant. ""With the emergence of more artisanal scents on the market, women are welcoming the opportunity to experiment and explore different options."" The standalone oriental, woods, citrus, and fruity fragrances are still a small portion of the market, at just 7 per cent of women's fragrance dollar sales, but they are growing at the expense of the larger segments, including the top selling fragrance family, floral. Woody oriental is the only one of the larger blended fragrance families to experience growth in 2013. Two of the top 5 women's prestige fragrances sold in the US are part of the woody oriental fragrance family, while the other three in the top five are florals and a soft floral. ""The recognizable classics remain strong, but new players are important rising stars to watch,"" said Grant. ""Today, the opportunity for reinvention afforded by a novel scent coexists with the instant indulgence provided by the classics."""
"United Kingdom: Fragrance sales grew by 9% in 2013, boosted by the Valentine's fortnight","The NPD Group Inc is predicting a bumper period for prestige beauty sales in the UK in the fortnight leading up to Valentine's Day this year, especially for fragrances. In 2013, UK fragrance sales were up 9.3% year-on-year, with 1 million units of fragrances sold, generating £31.6 million in value sales over these two weeks alone. ""Valentine's fortnight remains a key focus for prestige beauty products, with fragrance representing 2.7% of annual fragrance value sales and 3% of total beauty sales in the UK - beating both Father's Day and Mother's Day sales,"" says The NPD Group. The market research firm notes there is an opportunity for growth in the UK fragrance market when comparing sales in other key markets. ""In France and the United States, 2013 Valentine's fragrance sales represented 4% of annual fragrance value sales, generating just over £67 million and £81 million, respectively."" Trend data reveals that while fragrance sales peak around Valentine's Day, at 42% of prestige beauty products sold based on 2013 figures, sales are less concentrated at this time of year compared to Christmas. However, sales across all beauty categories rise during Valentine's fortnight as consumers take the opportunity to buy something special for themselves, such as facial skincare or make-up, as well as for their lover. ""Men look set to be the winners in the fragrance stakes this year if the 2013 trend continues, with men's fragrances for Valentine's 2013 representing 35% of all fragrance value sales - up from 33% in 2012,"" points out The NPD Group. Data from Valentine's 2013 reveals that consumers may become more price conscious with their fragrance purchases. On average, both women's and men's fragrance sales were down £1-2 on the annual average price at £33 and £31, respectively. Leftover Christmas gift sets were also popular for Valentine's 2013 in the UK. ""As usual, we expect prestige beauty sales to peak around Valentine's Day. This year, we predict that the Valentine's fortnight boom trend for fragrance sales will continue, with the big brands creating the perfect setting for love in-store and online to leverage the growth opportunities in the UK market. Overall, we see that fragrance sales at this time of year are a key driver for wider beauty category sales as consumers treat themselves as well as their loved ones, with savvy consumers sniffing out the best deals,"" commented June Jensen, Director for The NPD Group Beauty UK."
France: another year of decrease for the prestige beauty market,"After a decrease by 0.9 % in value in 2012, the French market for beauty products (perfume, skincare, makeup) sold in the so-called selective network - which includes perfumeries and department stores but not pharmacies and supermarkets - recorded another decrease in 2013, with sales dropping by 1.5 % in value. However, according to the French federation of selective perfumery (FFPS), which represents more than 70 % of the sector's operators and nearly 1,700 sales outlets, including major national retail chains (Sephora, Marionnaud Nocibé ), groups and franchises (Beauty Success), department stores (Galeries Lafayette, Printemps, Le Bon Marché) and independent perfume retailers, the sector performed rather well, ""compared to other sectors related equipment of persons."" Actually, the results are quite contrasted depending on retail and product categories. For instance, chain retailers and department stores recorded a better performance than independent retailers, and makeup and skincare performed better than fragrances. As far as retail channels are concerned, beauty chains, which represent 76% of the market, ended the year 2013 with flat sales. December sales progressing by +0.5% in value and the opening of 59 new outlets may explain these results. Department stores, which hold 9 % of the market, posted an increase of 0.5% of their sales, while the number of outlets almost unchanged (+ 4 stores in 2013), and despite bad performances in December (-3.8% in value compared to December 2012). Eventually, independent retailers had to support the most pronounced effects of the crisis and recorded a decline of 9.8 % of their turnover. Regarding the products, makeup is the category recording the best performance in 2013. Its turnover remained almost stable compared to 2012 (-0.7%), thanks to products for the lips and gift sets, which recorded strong growth (+5%). After an excellent year 2012, skincare products recorded a decline of 1.7% of their turnover in 2013. The year was mainly driven by the strong performance of anti-aging (+3.7%) and moisturizing (+2.8%) products. Finally, the fragrance market, recorded a decline of 1.7% of its turnover, while rising prices have partially offset a 4.2% drop in sales volumes. ""In a context where consumption declined throughout the year, our market held up rather well. However, we must draw lessons for the future because our products are not first necessities and customers can chose to prioritize other items. We need to improve the customer experience so that it does not give up to please others or to please itself with our products,"" said William G. Koeberlé, President of the FFPS."
"""Garnier's withdrawal from China is a lesson of wisdom"", Florence Bernardin, Information & Inspiration","Premium Beauty News - How would you analyse these successive decisions, beyond economic reasons? Florence Bernardin - The problem for Revlon is mainly related to distribution and communication, which were not sufficiently focused on China. Their local sales only represented 2 % of the turnover. As for Garnier, at first I was surprised. This brand really had a history with this country, and actual legitimacy: a lot had been done for their international image as well as for the access to Western products. At the same time, I can understand the underlying economic, profit-related reasons. It is actually quite brave, and it shows the world anything is not possible in China today. It is not paradise. A lot remains to be done, but it is also necessary to appropriately position oneself, choose a distribution network and a competitive segment. So this withdrawal should be considered as a lesson of wisdom, economics and management, not as a cold shower. Premium Beauty News - Has the Chinese mass market become impossible to access for Western brands? Florence Bernardin - The mass market is hardly penetrable with export today. It has become increasingly complex to be competitive with first-price products on the mass market because of the local market. It is just not profitable. And it is hard to get sales to take off within such a competitive context, economically speaking. French brands in particular should keep focusing on masstige and selective markets. That is what they are good at. The luxury market is not really challenged by local brands because it is still associated with each brand's culture and history. Premium Beauty News - How can the future be seen on this market then? Florence Bernardin - China is going to become a tricky market, just like other international ones can be. The future will increasingly be made of joint-ventures and partnerships between local manufacturers and international brands to favour know-how collaboration. This is one of the solutions to be considered a priority, since attention should be paid to achieving effective communication with Chinese teams. It must be noted that there are lessons to be learnt in intercultural management, and in knowing how to work with the Chinese, and listen to all their wishes. Many international brands, including Garnier, according to Chinese social networks, seem to have come up against management difficulties in China. This results in a lack of understanding, and then it gets all negative. Many companies still have not established adequate intercultural understanding, nor have they left enough responsibility to their local management. It is hard to preserve the strategic image of a Western brand, but concessions will have to be made. Success depends on actual collaboration with stakeholders who are familiar with the local market. Premium Beauty News - Which segments do you consider as growth drivers? Florence Bernardin - Midrange and premium products, but with brands that really make a difference, just like for other international markets. I also think natural and organic products will play a part. The health theme will be crucial because consumers are really looking for protection, cleanliness and safety, as they are exposed to sanitary scandals and pollution. The brands that will decide to focus on safety and transparency do have a key role, especially if they are Western brands, because they are seen as a guarantee of quality. Premium Beauty News - Do you think the fact that the one-child policy was abolished can have an influence on the birth rate, and therefore on the child product segment? Florence Bernardin - First of all, the law has not been voted yet, and nobody knows when it will be. Then I am not sure there will actually be a babyboom if it is, because real estate and education costs increase at the same time, and they are already part of the most expensive in the world. Having a second child will be very costly! So people will think twice. However, the baby market will change, and cosmetics for children will develop. Indeed it should not be forgotten that children are at the centre of the family there. In addition, demand for safe products will be high for this target."
Nocibé: new store concept dedicated to private brand and services,"Less than two years after the launch of its own brand, Nocibé is offering it and unprecedented setting: a new beauty concept store. The first of its kind opened in mid-December 2013 in the Roubaix urban area, in Northern France, under the name: Les Bellista by Nocibé. There are hardly any luxury fragrances or high-end brands here, but a large offering of makeup, toiletries, skincare and accessories by Nocibé as well as some products from brands under exclusive distribution. This new generation of boutiques promises to experience beauty ""on and off the premises."" On premises, thanks to a comprehensive range of no-booking express services: nail and hair styling bars, makeup, depilation, express facial and body treatments, performed around the central bar or in the lounges. Off premises, thanks to a full range of Nocibé beauty products: a wide choice at an affordable price . ""If we should summarize this project, it is two-thirds of products and a third of services,"" a spokeswoman for the retailer told Premium Beauty News. Designed by French agency Rev Architecture, this new beauty retail concept will develop in parallel with existing boutiques. ""While Nocibé and Les Bellista by Nocibé share the same values - generosity, free beauty, fun, service and expertise - they are consived as two different and complementary offerings,"" said the retailer. Of course, there are strong synergies between the two networks, for instance, Nocibé's loyalty cards will be valid in Les Bellista boutiques and vice versa. According to Isabelle Parize, Nocibé's CEO, ""this generation of boutique is inspired from the expectations of new consumers. It emphasises 1,000 SKUs of the Nocibé brand as well as the expertise of our beauty consultants. Les Bellista by Nocibé is a bet that we do because we believe in our strengths and our expertise, we are confident in our teams, and we trust our brand so much that we offer it a new setting. In particular, we trust in our ability to innovate and to have a long term and enlarged vision for Nocibé."" The next opening is scheduled in spring 2014, somewhere close to Paris. The retailer's aims to have opened a total four stores by the end of 2014. Founded in Lille in 1984, Nocibé now operates 466 outlets, located throughout France. Despite unfavourable market conditions, Nocibé reported a 3% progression of its net sales in 2013 to 700 million euros, compared to 680 million in 2012. Nocibé's current owner, Charterhouse Capital Partners, is currently finalising its sale to the Douglas group. The merger of the two networks would allow Douglas to rank number two in France behind Sephora."
Regional cosmetics seeking to capture the world,"The starting point is quite simple for many of these new brands: ""Why travel the whole world searching for exotic ingredients, while extraordinary, often untapped raw materials can be found right here?"" ""I grew up with an orchard at the back of my garden, and nothing tastes better than fruit directly taken from the tree. Apples, especially the cider apple from Normandy, are extremely rich in polyphenols. France happens to be one of the main producers, with the most varied offer,"" explains Fanny Marouani, founder of Pomarium, an organic line which makes use of all properties in the apple. ""France is full of resources,"" declares Julie Ducret, who founded Pulpe de Vie, an organic brand from Provence based on fresh fruit, which is already cherished by Japanese women. ""For ethics reasons as well as to limit carbon footprint, I forced myself to define a maximum area of 350 km around the site to source my products"", she explains. This uncompromising philosophy concerns fresh fruit and all other ingredients alike: olive oil, bee wax, honey, floral waters, ochre from the Luberon… Given the growing interest of brands in local sourcing, ID Bio, a plant extraction laboratory, launched a brand named Terroir en beauté in 2012 to give more value to organic-certified raw materials from French regions: samphires from Western France marshes, highbush blueberry from the Vosges, carrots from the Alsatian region, dark red plums from Lorraine… The range already counts 18 references, and 6 are being developed. ""Whether small or bigger, brands are now ready to commit in a specific regional origin, and we are able to provide this. We have quite a high demand for our standard range as well as for our tailor-made extracts,"" affirms Alexia Machado Forestier, Marketing and Communication Manager. Apart from exploiting regional botanical richness, brands can also rely on the image of highly evocative regions. This is how Stéphanie Seznec founded Britanie, as she was willing to put forward the Breton lifestyle, all the while supporting local development. ""This encourages our region to work on its own resources, which is not always automatic in the cosmetic industry,"" explains Arnaud Fourel, founder of Nominoe, a brand of cosmetics developed thanks to the richness of Brittany's biotope. Such an ethical approach does not always prove economical though: ""packaging made in Brittany is much more expensive for us"", admits Stéphanie Seznec, ""but we do intend to give priority to quality"". With about fifteen local partners on average, these brands prefer to favour a close relationship with their suppliers, whether they provide raw materials, packs or formulators. Such a relationship is often perceived as a guarantee of quality and product traceability. Julie Ducret went as far as printing pictures of her 25 fruit producers on Pulpe de Vie product packages, just to follow this principle. ""Speaking the truth is only logical"", she believes. Corsican brand Solyvia partially finances the production of some plants, thus securing its own share of the harvest. ""If you want to use the image of a region, it is only natural to invest in this region"", explains Christophe Fouilleron, one of its founders. And he laments the fact that he does not share this investment with big brands. ""Corsica and its biodiversity are on a roll with major groups, which unfortunately take advantage of this without creating jobs on a local level."" He got together with eight other Corsican brands, and in 2012 he joined Corsica Cosmetica, the first cosmetic group on the island, which was founded by the Chambre des Métiers et de l'Artisanat de Corse du Sud - South Corsica's chamber of handicrafts - to preserve and give more value to its beauty asset. ""We have implemented a charter of good practices to protect rare plants such as the everlasting flower or the myrtle against any abusive exploitation, and to impose quotas"". These regional products are riding on the wave of the need for authenticity, local commitment and closeness of consumers who seek to give a meaning to their act of purchase. They also possess a considerable emotional power, playing alternatively on the feeling of belonging and the need to escape. Local sourcing is viewed as an act of solidarity, and a guarantee of quality. And when the region, such as Provence, enjoys strong tourist attraction and a significant popular support beyond borders, it can also become an important asset abroad. ""Reactions are extremely positive in Asia, as the Japanese are great admirers of Napoleon. They know Corsica, they appreciate its naturalness, and it is increasingly part of their travel destinations,"" declares Christophe Fouilleron. The local made in mark is popular abroad."
"Mixologiste is key beauty trend for 2014, Mintel says","According to the market research firm, blurred lines between beauty technology are becoming increasingly common, with overlaps between skincare, hair care and colour cosmetics. Manufacturers combine technology, packaging and marketing from different categories to create new products. ""Mixologiste is fast becoming the stand-out trend that spans all beauty and personal care categories. This is a key mega trend, in development for the last year or so, but we are set to see it really accelerating in 2014. While manufacturers have worked with multifunctionality for a number of years, we are now seeing them take inspiration from completely different categories to create new products and marketing messages. The huge success of BB creams has led manufacturers to think about how they can build on their existing portfolios and add excitement to sometimes saturated sectors. New combinations will continue to evolve, resulting in new products, packaging, marketing and merchandising,"" explains Jane Henderson, Global President of Mintel's Beauty and Personal Care Division. Mintel's consumer research highlights the popularity of multifunctional make-up in the US, with as many as 70% of US female consumers expressing an interest in multifunctional lip products, and 65% showing interest in multifunctional facial coverage products, for example those which combine the benefits of foundation and concealer. And while saving time and cost are highlighted as the benefits of these products, the research shows how time-poor US consumers perceive time saving (68%) to be a greater benefit than reduced costs (63%). In China, almost half (46%) of make-up users express an interest in trying new products with multifunctionality (such as 2-in-1 eye shadow and blusher), while almost one in three (29%) agree that multifunctional products (eg BB cream) perform as well as products designed for single purpose. Around four in ten (37%) say they like products which have cosmetic benefits as well as care for their skin. Reduced cost is seen to be a benefit for a third (34%) of Chinese consumers who say that buying multi-functional products is more economical than buying products separately. But while multifunctionality is popular in the US and China, it is not yet as popular in the UK where just a quarter (25%) of women say they are interested in products which have cosmetic benefits as well as care for the skin, such as BB cream and tinted lip balm. ""Of course we saw this trend several decades ago with 2-in-1 shampoos, but these new hybrid products are becoming more ambitious and exciting. The success of hybrids such as BB creams has inspired manufacturers to explore different ways through which they can bring categories together to create something exciting for consumers. Instead of cannibalising sales, these products are acting as 'add on' products and not simply replacement products,"" Jane continues. Looking to 2014, Mintel's leading beauty and personal care analysts have examined how Mixologiste is impacting the haircare, skincare, colour cosmetics and fragrance markets. "" Colour cosmetics have extended their scope into some unexpected areas. Hair chalks blend make-up with temporary colorants, primers now extend to pre-styling treatments and CC creams have moved beyond facial colour cosmetics in to nail care, lipsticks and even haircare. The coming years will see even more developments as manufacturers build on the excitement and pique consumers' interest in more adventurous formats and claims, "" says Vivienne Rudd, Director of Insight, Beauty & Personal Care. According to Mohamed Omer, Global Haircare Analyst, ""newly launched hair BB creams that promise to protect and reinforce hair fibre are being inspired by the growth of skin BB creams. Hair perfumes offer both a standalone product and an extension to fragrance ancillaries and a bath & body collection. Besides leaving hair smelling fresh, they also protect hair against UV damage, colour fading, helping consumers retain maximum moisture, condition and nourishment."" As far as skin care products are concerned, there are opportunities to cross-over into any number of beauty categories. ""We've already had BB, CC and even DD creams, with EE creams set to make an appearance too,"" says Christopher Lindsley, Global Skincare Analyst. ""The first treatment fragrances have already hit the market, and textiles and food and drink are making growing use of skincare actives too. In the future, we will see targeted skincare delivery systems through fabrics, fragrances and food, and further work on hybrids that bring together skincare, devices and diagnostics."" The fragrance market is no exception. ""In the fragrance field, there is room to innovate by extending the category to new formats and added benefits. We expect hair fragrances to offer more than scent with targeted and time-release delivery of specific benefits such as antioxidants, vitamins, pigments and UV filters. Other formats like scented skincare products and fragrance for clothes are still untapped but have potential to grow the fragrance offerings. A third of French women report interest for skincare products that contain their favourite fragrance and four in ten Italian women are interested in fragrance for clothes, highlighting the potential to disseminate benefits between fabric care and the fragrance categories,"" states Emmanuelle Moeglin, Global Fragrance Analyst. And, according to Mintel, it seems it is not just multi-use products set to impact the future, but also complementary categories. ""New technology will offer even more exciting hybrid products going forward, innovation will come not only from beauty but from complementary categories such as textiles, devices, sensors, 3D and 4D printing, food and drink and automotives. Of particular interest are new delivery systems and packaging, both or which will see significant advances. These will impact most beauty categories, but the sharpest focus will be on skincare, haircare and fragrance,"" concludes Vivienne Rudd."
"Moscow, a niche brands heaven?","Three chain retailers now dominate the distribution of selective perfume and cosmetic brands in Russia, particularly in the regions of Moscow and Saint Petersburg: L'Etoile, Rive Gauche and Ile de Beauté. The competition between the two leaders, L'Etoile and Rive Gauche, is based primarily on price, and exclusive and own brands. Note that besides Chanel, Guerlain and Estee Lauder products, the two chains, also offer mass brands such as Garnier, Nivea or Gillette. However, no trace of rare perfume brand. Among the three retailers, Ile de Beauté tries to stand out with a classier decoration and a high-end assortment. There are hardly any mass brands here, but attractively highlighted Sephora products in black displays. Also, a fairly wide selection of the most famous niche perfume brands: Annick Goutal, Atelier Cologne, Byredo, Diptyque, Clive Christian, Rouge Bunny Rouge, Serge Lutens... But in Moscow, niche perfume and cosmetic brands from around the world have found their cocoon at Apetka Cosmotheca, the concept store created by Hayk Sargsyan and which opened at the end of 2012 at Galereya Moskva. Fragrance brands such as Olfactory Studio or Humiecki and Graef are showcased alongside skincare lines such as Absolution, Erborian, Patyka or Tokyo Milk, makeup accessories such as Japonesque or the Japanese toothbrush brand Yumaki (on the pharmacy counter). [1] Cosmotheca already runs seven outlets (shops or corners) in Moscow, a corner in St. Petersburg and now plans to expand in the regions. A few steps away, near the Bolshoi Theatre, the famous Tsum store probably offers the most luxurious frame to the numerous niche brands it distributes Aqua di Parma, Atkinson, Comptoir Sud Pacifique, Coudray, Clive Christian, Creed, Diptyque, Histoire de Parfums, Houbigant Paris, Jovoy, Le Labo, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Memo, etc.) alongside the most prestigious global brands. In addition are the numerous Articoli point of sales that also offer - in a very upmarket frame - a diverse vision of the high-end offering of perfumes and cosmetics."
Perfumed candles: a confident sector,"""Things have to be put into perspective"", says Sébastien Roy, R&D Manager at Bougies La Française, ""the media have seized upon this announcement in a very alarmist way, but we still don't know about the future regulation guidelines"". People globally seem confident and welcome this initiative which, while improving the quality of interior air, could also improve the offer. Audrey Haupt, Marketing Manager at Terre d'Oc and Guilhem Rousseau, founder of Manufacture Française de Bougies, both think ""it's good there is a demand for transparency, especially on import products"". According to Sébastien Roy, French regulations might rely on European work in terms of labelling and standardization. Some of the standards published in 2007 for information only might become mandatory within the next two or three years. In addition to these standards, which are related to smoke quantification, anti-inflammatory safety and labelling, a project for the standardization of analysis methods is ongoing. Sébastien Roy adds that ""it's actually about methodology, how to analyse a candle, given the fact that combustion variations may alter results, and how to extrapolate given the various parameters (size of the item, ventilation level, burn time…). This project aims at universalizing the analysis method, and the limit values will then be left to each country's own free will"". The hypothetical limit values on benzene exposure laid down by the French authorities do not seem to worry manufacturers. ""Our results on candles were obtained in accordance with the analyses in force, and they are much inferior to the values recommended by the WHO,"" explains Sébastien Roy. ""We constantly tool up to improve our tests and keep providing quality"", adds Julien Pruvost, Executive Director of CIR. Terre d'Oc claims the same, as they have conducted a two-year study, along with Natures & Découvertes, which was destined for real-time measuring of the impact of their candles in the CSTB's experimental house MARIA [1]. Results proved inferior to risk values. As for olfactory compositions, Carla Romagnosa, Marketing Manager of Switzerland-based Cosmo Fragrances International, explains she has not received any specific request from her customers. Therefore complying with standards should not represent any obstacle to the great growth increase in the sales of high-end perfumed candles (+ 15 % per year since 1995). ""Luxury candles are winning acclaim, and perfume brands are growing aware of the fact that it is a powerful image driver that is likely to generate some turnover"", explains Julien Pruvost. If Europe – mainly France and the UK – represents about half the market, Asia is increasing its share with an uncompromising demand for quality. ""The market is mainly thriving in Japan but, paradoxically, awareness is being raised about the problems related to air quality in China, where consumers look for well-made products"", adds Guilhem Rousseau. We will have to wait until spring 2014 to find out about the content of the new regulation, which should reassure French consumers and reinforce the Asian clientele."
InterCharm Moscow: Where East and West meet,"With 1,022 exhibitors (+10% compared to the previous year) and an increase of 11% of the exhibition area, the InterCharm Moscow trade show continues to benefit from the growth of the Russian cosmetics market. A total of more than 3,500 brands from 32 countries were showcased this year. According to organizers, the 2013 edition, which was held from November 27 to 30, welcomed 67,382 visitors, an increase of 9% compared to 2012. Let's remind that 20 years ago, the Russian cosmetics market was still to build. In 1994, the first edition of InterCharm was launched and gathered… 76 exhibitors. The Russian market has recovered from the various crises. Today it is the ninth global market for consumer goods and should be ranked 4th in 2020. The large urban population (over 12 million inhabitants in Moscow and 14 other cities with over one million citizens) has been a strong propeller of the consumers' demand. According to Euromonitor, the Russian beauty market grew to an estimated USD 13.9 billion (EUR 10.14 billion) in 2012, compared to USD 13.5 billion (EUR 9,85 billion) in 2011 and is forecasted to reach USD 15.6 billion (EUR 11,4 billion) in 2015. Main segments of the market are fragrances (23%), skin care (22.6%), hair care (19.2%) and make-up (15.4%). The Russian cosmetics market ranks 5th in Europe, after France, Germany, the UK and Italy. Despite this dynamism, the Russian market is everything but easy. There is a strong competition, with a strong presence of multinational companies. According to Euromonitor, 70% of the market belongs to 40 companies. Furthermore, the retail side tend to be increasingly concentrated, in particular with three major networks that dominate the selective distribution (L'Etoile, Rive Gauche, and Ile de Beauté). This is particularly true in Moscow and St. Petersburg but the chains are extending their networks at nationally. Actually, a major part of the future growth should come from the premium cosmetics segment, in particular with increased sales in the regions (beyond Moscow and Saint-Petersburg) boosted by online boutiques. From this point of view, a quick tour Moscow's main outlets may be enough to convince to how the market has rapidly diversified to highlight the most advanced products. The organizers of InterCharm have also understood it very well and thus have created an area entirely dedicated to rare and high quality brands. Under the name ""La Niche"", this area hosted perfume brands such as Mark Buxton, Parfumerie Générale Pierre Guillaume, Huitème Art, Phaedon Laboratorio Olfattivo, Scultures Olfactives or Mona di Orio, and also skin care lines such as UNA skincare, Soley Organic or Swisscode Bionic. ""With a relatively short record on the Russian market, niche perfumery and cosmetics didn't wait long to find their loyal admirers,"" the show organisers highlight. Nevertheless, most of the InterCharm tradeshow is still devoted to professional retail networks (hair and beauty salons). ""The professional market and home consumption are overlapping in Russia,"" explains Anna Dycheva, Assistant Director of InterCharm. ""Many consumers prefer to buy products from a professional in whose knowledge they trust."" On this segment, the strength of European brands, including Italian, French and Spanish, is obvious. As far as the retail segment is concerned, there is a strong participation of Japanese exhibitors in the show, and of Korean, to a lesser extent. Similarly, Japanese cosmetic brands, and some Korean, also seem to hold strong positions in Moscow's beauty outlets. ""Russian women are known to value very highly European cosmetics, in particular from France, Switzerland or Italy, but the demand for Japanese cosmetics is rapidly increasing,"" says Anna Dycheva. ""Consumers perceive these products as 100% safe and 100% effective, and based on sound scientific research."" Just like Russia, InterCharm appears as a crossroads between the European and the Asian cosmetic offers."
"Alfonso Maligno's ""Pharmacy 3.0"" puts the light on the cosmetic shelves","About two years and multiple cross-disciplinary skills (twenty or so partner companies were appealed to): that is what it took the multidisciplinary teams at Alfonso Maligno's firm - trend observers, designers, architects and graphic designers - to conceive and develop the ""Pharmacy 3.0"" concept. They mainly aimed at generating purchase pleasure in a place consumers most often go to because they have to, and not because they want to. The starting point is pretty simple: it is essential to generate purchase pleasure to develop customer loyalty and make pharmacy attractive and engaging. ""Consumers will be much more tempted to buy and come back to a retail space where they have felt support, interaction, pleasure and well-being,"" explains Alfonso Maligno, founder of the firm. And so it is the ambience that the firm has first chosen to work on, by favouring natural and cosy materials, with an autoclave-treated oak wooden floor, wooden and steel shelves, or raw metal coated with water varnish. The firm has not hesitated to create vegetated areas, with planters lit with UV lamps to renew with the tradition of medicinal plants. The rest of the place is lit with LEDs, which offers the double advantage of saving energy – 6 watts per square metre, that is, five to ten times less than traditional lighting – and providing softer, less aggressive light than traditional neon lighting. The cosy, relaxing atmosphere is reinforced by the dark grey paint on the walls and ceilings, which also shows up the white lacquered, laser-cut sheet metal for display signs, whose graphics evoke the 1950s. ""Our research has revealed the steady progress of a movement in favour of green, environmentally friendly buying places that know how to preserve authenticity"", emphasizes Alfonso Maligno. The Pharmacy 3.0 concept by Alfonso Maligno's firm is also focused on sound, with a choice of 165 relaxing or lively ambiences, and scents, with two original fragrances – Norway pine and mango – designed by two experts in sensorial marketing, and spread out in the atmosphere of the office with aroma diffusers. This is the end of medicine smell, for sure! Another key element with ""Pharmacy 3.0"" is the customer experience. Again, the aim is to maximize purchase pleasure, by facilitating strolling and product testing and touching. At the Pharmacie de l'Aquarius, in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, the central island is built around a herbarium of aromatic and medicinal plants, which thus puts the latest cosmetic launches and offers forward, in a mingling of wooden display stands and benches. The island guides customers as they walk towards the shelves standing against the walls and the counter of ethical products. In the end the modest, but newly arranged 80 m2 area now offers a longer linear surface, while avoiding the various displays that used to obtrude both path and sight. Some products are exposed on wooden tables, as can be found in latest generation bookshops. ""Horizontal display makes purchasing easier, and creates small universes that are naturally attractive"", says Alfonso Maligno. In addition, Alfonso Maligno's firm proposes to integrate an area dedicated to brand sales leaders, skincare and personalized tips to the pharmacy. The firm teams have done their best to reduce building costs by designing architectural furniture and accessories, and a lighting system that can be manufactured in batches, or even in series. The total cost thus amounts to around 1,200 euros per m2, apart from wiring and air conditioning. ""Pharmacy 3.0 is a project that was built around consumers, with the possibility to make them interact with the product by creating ""discovery and testing islands"". It stands out with the alternation of display structures, multifunctional interaction islands, and consultation areas used by chemists to help patient-customers throughout their 360° health and well-being experience,"" sums up Salvatore Maligno, the main initiator of the project. According to the architecture firm, about 15 projects are currently underway."
Informa wants to double the size of China Beauty Expo,"By partnering with British group Informa, Shanghai Baiwen Exhibition, the owner of China Beauty Expo, aims at internationalizing its event. The two companies announced they will ""combine networks and skills with the aim to expand the Shanghai beauty-based portfolio to a pan-Asian audience."" China Beauty Expo - which hosted a total of 1,657 exhibitors and 245,000 visitors in 2013 - comprises three co-located exhibitions: Cosmetics China, dedicated to cosmetics, skincare and fragrances (over 800 exhibitors), Cosmetech, dedicated to the equipment, packaging and ingredients (more than 500 exhibitors) and Beauty Shanghai, dedicated to professional salons and spa products (nearly 300 exhibitors). ""Together, 'Informa-Baiwen' will offer the beauty business community new solutions in China and Asia, building on Informa's existing portfolio run globally out of Paris, the world capital city of beauty, and on Baiwen's strong offering in Shanghai, the epicentre of the beauty industry in Asia,"" says David Bondi, COO, Informa Exhibitions Asia. ""Our goal is to transform this show so as it becomes more international and to grow Shanghai as the main hub for beauty professionals in Asia,"" he details to Premium Beauty News. As a first consequence of this new partnership, the 2014 edition of China Beauty Expo will feature some key components of the Beyond Beauty tradeshow, which is held annually in Paris. A new exhibition area - ZOOM Asia - will be created alongside the Beauty Challenger Awards Asia, both of them wit the aim to recognize new beauty brands attempting to expand in the Asian market. According to the latest figures from the China Association of Fragrance Flavor and Cosmetics Industries, cosmetic sales in China maintain an average annual growth rate of 10-20%. ""Even if the market growth is expected to slow down in the future, it will remain strong as local needs remain strong drivers,"" adds David Bondi. Informa intends to build on this growth to grow China Beauty Expo as the first global event in the cosmetics sector, by doubling its size within the next four or five years."
Online beauty: A disappointing navigation experience?,"In order to generate a sustainable satisfaction and retain users, e-commerce platforms must now provide an intuitive navigation environment and adapt their ergonomics to the needs of visitors, including an easy access to the product ranges that are available online and to the customer service. To measure the quality of the browsing experience, the e-Performance Observatory published by Yuseo is focusing on the consumer's experience. ""A simultaneous measurement of three dimensions - Access to the Product Offering, Access to the Customer Service and Ordering Process - for each of the tested websites, allows a comparison of the functioning of the main online players,"" explains Jean-Pierre Leborgne, Partner Manager at Yuseo. For the third edition of the e-Performance Observatory dedicated to online beauty retailers, Yuseo has selected a sample of more than 4,500 users that have been asked to browse the sites of the four market leaders in France: Douglas, Marionnaud, Nocibé, and Sephora). The study was conducted in two stages: first a comparison phase during which users were asked to perform the same task on each of the four websites, namely to find a specific product, then a phase called ""Site focus"" in which the websites were tested by 120 participants, different for each site, the participants being asked to perform three identical tasks. The comparison phase has revealed very close scores on several issues, in particular with regard to the product pictures. However, the gap is widening on certain key issues of online merchandising, including the home page clarity, the presentation of the offering and the effectiveness of searching tools. ""The importance of searching tools is well established on the Internet. It is a key component of the flexibility that is expected (or required) by users,"" says Yuseo. ""In this regards, the sector generates a pretty good perception even if two retailers are lagging behind."" With an average rate of success that reaches 50% for the tasks performed by individual users on each site and corresponding to three main dimensions of the online purchase experience (access to the goods, order process, and reinsurance / customer information), the quality of the browsing experience is mitigated. Furthermore, the score appears significantly lower than for the previous edition of the barometer: 60% in 2012. As far as the navigation experience is concerned there are strong differences between the various online retailers as the gap between the first and the last reaches 11 points. According to Yuseo, such a result demonstrates the ""persistence of different types of navigation pitfalls depending on the site."" As per the satisfaction index expressed by users in relation to their browsing experience, the average score is 7/10, with a gap of 1.5 points between the first and the last website. In the end, Yuseo explains, ""in a highly competitive environment and with rising expectations from the users perception of these signs was negatively impacted by the browsing experience of users. "" By entering a little further into the details, one can see that the customers' main satisfaction criteria are: the large choice of products available, the clarity of presentation of the different product lines and the completeness of the product data sheets. With regard to these criteria, ""Nocibé and Sephora achieve pretty high scores regarding a wide and comprehensive range that meet all expectations. However, as far as the staging of lines, and the content and presentation of product data sheet are concerned, Nocibé clearly stands out of the mass,"" says Yuseo."
Perfume Trends: slowdown in the number of launches in France,"A closer look at the slowdown in the number of launches reveals some changes in the distribution: men's fragrances are resisting, as their relative part has grown from 14 % of launches in 2012 to 20 %. Women's fragrances still represent 53 % of launches on the period studied, and ""non-positioned"" fragrances derived from confidential perfumery are establishing themselves with 27 % of launches. Although trends are now favouring oriental (Aubade) and Chypre fragrances (Si by Giorgio Armani or Acquarosa by Fendi), flowers are still to the fore in the second period of the year: they represent 66 % of floral fragrances out of the 71 women's fragrances launched (Elle L'Aime by Lolita Lempicka, Modern Muse by Estée Lauder, or Boucheron's Place Vendôme). Favourites are white flowers such as Neroli, Ylang-Ylang, vanilla and jasmine, which can also be found in soliflores on the niche market. ""The attraction to gourmand fragrances is still quite strong"", explains Isabelle Ferrand. ""They remain focused on delicious, sweet, reassuring notes to meet consumers' demand rather than perfumers'"". These reminiscent scents also explain the recurring presence of fruity notes in numerous compositions, especially pear, which can be recognized in Honey by Marc Jacobs, or Flower In The Air by Kenzo. Blackcurrant is also often used. After the fashion and food industries, perfumery is now plunging into the ""Black Swan"" ambience of the ballet world. This semester, touches of grace, flexibility and mystery are conveyed by olfactory designs for Repetto, or the new Iris Prima by Penhaligon's, for which Alberto Morillas sought inspiration from the English National Ballet. The strong trend towards woody scents in men's fragrances is getting confirmed: out of 27 men's fragrances listed, 74 % belong to the woody category, compared to only 40 % in the first semester. They share the choice for ambery, woody fragrances (with cashmeran, cedramber, ambroxan, ambrocenide…), associated with strong concepts of success, as can be seen with bay leaves in Paco Rabanne's Invictus. The growing importance of woody scents mirrors the decline of ""Fougère"" perfumes – 7 % of current launches, compared to 50 % ten years ago. Gourmand notes are also infusing intense flavours into men's variants (1 Million Intense, Mont Blanc Intense…). Claims for strong, vivid scents driven by Eastern markets should be confirmed, in particular with the ""fragrance"" versions of Terre d'Hermès by Hermès, and Fahrenheit by Dior, soon to be expected. The powdery softness of iris and the mighty heat of leather are favourite notes in most launches in confidential perfumery. Not that it is still that confidential: with 30 % of launches, niche perfumery is actually visible. Faces are now appearing on marketing campaigns, which are still discreet, but used to focus more on bottle designs. Most fragrances to be launched by the end of the year are ""new"" (51 %), but leave a large share to variants (19 %), flankers (7 %), limited editions (4 %) and collections (12 %). However, the study mentions a renewal in old recipes. Though there were none in the first quarter of the year, re-releases from long-established perfumeries (Jean Patou relaunched with Joy Forever, Volnay, Oriza Legrand) are making their way back on the market, with a 7 % representation."
British women more cautious about premium beauty spending,"With the GDP growing by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2013, the fastest pace of expansion in just over three years, the threat to see the UK economy sliding into another recession seems now unlikely. However, uncertainty over the direction of the UK economy remains and is putting pressure on premium beauty marketers who have to address contradictory trends. On the one hand, the demand for targeted and niche luxury beauty products is growing and, on the other, most British women are becoming more cautious about how they spend their money on premium beauty products. ""Consumers are seeking bargains and value by shopping around and Christmas discounting is now the norm,"" explains consultant and researcher Imogen Matthews, the author of The Premium Beauty Market Report. The British premium beauty markets were valued at just under £2bn (about EUR 2.4 bn) by The Premium Beauty Market Report / NPD Group in 2012. Growth slowed to +5% from +10% in 2011, however the category is still growing faster than the retail trade overall. The ""Lipstick Effect"" - or maybe the ""Nail Varnish Effect"" as sales (mass market included) of nail colour cosmetics are expected to overtake that of lip colour cosmetics in value in 2013 - still holds. Actually, premium make-up was the most resilient category, posting +11% growth in 2012. Moreover, according to The Premium Beauty Market Report sales of make-up at Christmas are becoming stronger, accounting for 18% of total premium beauty sales in 2012, a 2% point increase on 2011. Within premium make-up, the fastest growing sectors are eyebrow make-up (+41%) and make-up sets +21%. Nail polishes continue to outperform market growth, at +15%, followed by foundations +14% in 2012. According to The NPD Group, sales of premium fragrances slowed in 2012 to +3.2% in value. Men's fragrance slightly outperformed women's at +4% compared to women's at +2.5%. Coffrets accounted for a third of all fragrance purchases. However, consumer demand for coffrets is changing in department stores, with a trend towards non-coffrets and discounted lines. In parallel, the niche luxury movement continues to thrive, with 331 launches in 2012 compared to 276 in 2011, according to The Premium Beauty Market Report. Although mainstream brands continue to account for the bulk of volume of fragrances sold, niche brands appeal to consumers demanding something different. Social media is helping niche brands enormously in gaining awareness through blogs, vlogs and forums. ""The extent of growth from a number of these brands is encouraging,"" comments fragrance expert Michael Edwards. ""Certainly, niche brands are affected less by external market forces such as the state of the economy."" Sales of premium skincare grew by +4% in 2012 in the UK according to The Premium Beauty Market Report / NPD Group. Anti-ageing skincare is the key driver for skincare, with a trend towards results-driven solutions, especially serums. According to Mintel, sales of targeted prestige facial skincare products increased by 9% between 2011 and 2012. ""The antithesis of the BB Cream is targeted products, which offer consumers a more tailored, personalised skincare alternative,"" comments Imogen Matthews. ""Skin diagnostics are becoming commonplace at point of sale."" The British premium beauty retail landscape has expanded with the arrival of several newcomers such as M&S Your Beauty, Harvey Nichols Beauty Bazaar in Liverpool ONE, Harvey Nichols BeautyMART and Selfridges The Beauty Workshop. ""The growing number of premium niche brands now have more opportunities for distribution, especially amongst new retailers and through new retailing concepts,"" says Imogen Matthews. Another trend is the rise of in-store services such as brow bars, nail bars, blow-dry bars and treatments, now offered in many beauty retailers. Online beauty sales continue to grow and were valued at £532 million (636 million euros) in 2012 (+13% compared to 2011), by Euromonitor. One in five women buy beauty online, according to YouGov SixthSense, which supplied exclusive research to The Premium Beauty Market Report. Several department stores have launched ""click and collect"" services, offering consumers increased freedom of choice as to where they purchase products. Dedicated e-tailers have emerged, such has Feelunique, which currently sells 18,000 beauty SKUs. ""Online is a powerful alternative for niche brands which cannot afford the merchandising and promotional investment retailers require to be stocked in a physical store,"" adds Imogen Matthews.

Marionnaud opens their international showcase on the Champs-Élysées,"Marionnaud belongs to the Hong Kong-based A.S. Watson Group, and owns over 1,100 stores in eleven countries. They are thus one of the leading companies in selective distribution of perfumes and cosmetics in Europe, and can be found in Austria, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovenia and Switzerland. In France, Marionnaud has a network of 535 stores, about 210 of which have been refurbished within the last 18 months. However, the distributor has used a completely unusual, new concept for their store on the Champs-Élysées. According to Marionnaud, tourists represent more than two thirds of the clientele there, among whom a great number come from the Middle East and China. ""They want to go home with a French style, luxury souvenir from Paris. They wish to be given emotions and marvel at perfumes, iconic luxury brands and gift boxes"", highlight the brand's managers. As a real international showcase, this store has thus received particular attention to the only aim of making it a spectacular place. ""We have designed this exceptional store thinking about the variety of its customers and the myth embodied both by Paris and the Champs-Élysées. It is our window to the world, designed by Marionnaud Paris"", underlines William Koeberlé, Managing Director of Groupe Marionnaud. As soon as they step into the store, visitors are plunged into the typical world of Haussmann mansions, as they walk around and rediscover all their codes: the entrance gallery is outlined by the huge, six-meter high art deco-inspired bookcase. The monumental hall is wholly dedicated to perfumes, and offers several hundred different fragrances, including a few special ranges, such as the Armani Privé collection. Theme tables display new launches as well as cult, designer perfumes, olfactory discoveries, etc. The company has also worked in collaboration with the brands to offer products that were specifically developed for foreign customers, such as mini-bottle boxes, gift boxes… The furniture was also designed as a nod to the suite, with the mezzanine, the makeup tables that remind us of dressing tables, the small lounge and the large windows opening onto the beautiful inner courtyard, the monumental stairs coated with a purple metal and ornamented with a pendant chandelier reminiscent of perfume bottles… ""We wanted to create a brand new experience, to poetize the moment spent in the store and invite visitors to walk around and discover various universes of beauty"", explain architects Sophie Thuillier and Cristano Benzoni. The mezzanine is completely dedicated to makeup. It was added to the store, which enabled to gain over 100 m2. It also enables to catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the perfumes at the entrance. It comprises a series of makeup tables to recreate the atmosphere of studios and fashion shows in a luxurious decor. Brands' professional makeup artists offer customers flash makeup sessions and personalized tips. Thanks to digital mirrors, customers can take pictures of themselves and post them on social networks. Marionnaud has also chosen to give priority to services at their store on the Champs-Élysées. The commercial workforce has been doubled, with eighty workers now instead of forty, including sales assistants, checkout assistants, stock team members... There is also a new floor manager who is in charge of skin care, perfumes, makeup and checkout. All in all, about fifteen languages are spoken, and the team was trained in particular to ""the specificities of the store and the clientele on the Champs-Élysées, as well as to the art of ""luxury attitude"", by learning how to use the right gestures and how to look, listen and pay attention to customers"". Nail, eyebrow and bun bars… they will all be available on a made-to-measure basis or by appointment. Moreover, the store still opens from 10am to 12am every day. Marionnaud has thus chosen not to take into account the obligation to close at 9pm, although its competitor Sephora, on the same sidewalk, had to comply with it. Marionnaud puts forward a house agreement, which was signed in 2001 and reviewed in 2002, with the agreement of trade unions."
Consumers in the US and Europe are spending more on lip colour,"Lip segments in the US prestige beauty [1] industry posted an 11 percent gain, generating $665 million in the 12 months ending August 2013 (September 2012-August 2013). In Europe, the UK gained 8 percent, generating £70 million in prestige lip sales. France held relatively flat during this time, and Italy and Spain experienced small declines. ""In the US, lips are keeping in step with the nail color trend this year. Consumers are responding to the new options and innovations in beauty and what better way than with some bold lips that make a statement,"" said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group, Inc. ""US consumers are clearly willing to invest a little more in products that will deliver the look they want, and it goes beyond just lipstick, carrying over to liner, application tools, and all-in-one lip products. Throughout Europe, sales of lip products are outperforming relative to units sold, especially in lip color, so this is a phenomenon across the pond as well,"" added Grant. The average price spent on prestige lip color in the US between September 2012 and August 2013 was $22, a 5 percent increase from the prior year. The average amount spent on lip color across Europe increased slightly as well compared last year. ""The success of lip today actually has international appeal. Top brands that are bringing innovation to the lip category vary from makeup artists to legendary cosmetic brands, to top European designer names,"" said Grant. ""Innovations in lip are winning consumers over with the ability to provide rich color, as well as moisture and high shine - a perfect combination to enhance appearance while providing the benefits women are looking for."""
Perfumery pumps: towards ultra-segmentation,"MeadWestvaco (MWV) is the company that has gone the farthest in segmenting the market of perfumery pumps. At the latest edition of Luxe Pack Monaco, MWV showcased ""Emotions of Spray"", a range of six fragrance pumps, each of them having their own and unique spraying characteristics. ""We view luxury fragrance much like fashion and beauty - each intended to make the consumer feel confident. But it's about more than just feeling good, it's really about facilitating a transformative state of mind - moving to the sublime through an emotional connection,"" said Sandy Gregory, fragrance marketing director, MWV Beauty & Personal Care. The specificities of each pump offer brand owners the opportunity to create a perfect match between the fragrance and the sprayer. The ""Emotions of Spray"" collection includes a total of six pumps. The original Melodie pumps, Melodie Agile and Melodie Forever, which are already well known, plus three new sprayers that have distinctive spray characteristics: – Melodie Pure, which provides a perfect and fine atomization, even for water-based formulas, avoiding a wet feeling on the skin, – Melodie Delicate, with its discreet and elegant spray and small, focused spray that is both soft and quiet. – Maestro Extravagant, which offers a voluminous spray mist that is refreshing and airy, with a long and sustained spray pattern, providing an exuberant and indulging experience. Such a diversity gives brand owners even more options to tailor the spray to the positioning and personality of the fragrance and heighten the consumer experience. ""MWV's consumer insights revealed an opportunity to enhance that emotional connection through the spray,"" adds Sandy Gregory. With its two launches, Aptar explores two different trends. On the one hand sensuality, with the pump Precious, of which a prototype was presented last year, which now adds up to Sensea and expands the supplier's sensorial range. Precious offers a voluminous and continuous spray: a light pressure from the finger is enough to activate the spray and let the perfume being diffused gradually and continuously (diffusion time is three times longer for the same amount of perfume) in a delicate mist that envelops the skin. The mist effect can be achieved thanks to an extremely uniform spray combined with exceptionally fine particles. On the other hand discretion, with La Petite, dedicated to customers looking for a miniaturized technical product, in order to focus on the bottle's noble forms and materials. Eventually, Albéa's Panache pump, continues to diversify. The very pump to control the size and dispersion of droplets and offer a real mist of perfume has participated in about 15 launches already. Beyond perfumes, Panache can be adapted to other formulations (sprays and body, hair care, deodorant) whether they are alcohol or water or oil based. This Panache Pulse version, which contains no propellant, is a sustainable alternative to aerosols. ""With its recognized expertise in the field of spray, Albea is the only supplier of cosmetic packaging to offer this technology for various applications,"" highlights the company. Perfumers just have to make a choice."
New growth drivers in the premium beauty world,"The luxury market is still thriving in the globally gloomy economic context: according to the statistics published by Bain & Company, the sector grew by +10 % in 2012. Perfumery and personal care have contributed to this growth, whether in emerging or developed countries. The premium beauty market is booming in Asia as well as in countries on the American continent. Year after year, the ""upper premium"" beauty sector expands its offer and gets more and more diversified, as can be seen with the rise of the number of face care launches between $200 and $400 by +49 % in 2012 [1]. Desire for top-of-the-range beauty products is now more to the fore than ever, according to Rémy Oughdiri, Manager of the Tendances & Insights Department at IPSOS Public Affairs, and Leïla Rochet-Podvin, President and founder of the Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation agency. The World Luxury Tracking study carried out by IPSOS shows that beauty products buyers give more and more value to the most exclusive items: ingredient scarcity, limited editions, personalized brand-customer relationship… And exclusive rhymes with expensive. This trend is confirmed both on more developed markets (Europe, the United States and Japan) and emerging ones (China, Brazil, Russia). But why are women still ready to spend more when they can easily have access to overabundant, quality products? The main reason why is the ever-growing influence of self-image in our societies. This influence is enhanced by the unprecedented development of filming devices and ways to take and stage pictures, in particular on social networks. Within such a context, tools for people to stage themselves are becoming more and more sophisticated, and a growing number of people spend money on various means to show themselves off to advantage, including beauty products. The economic crisis even puts more pressure on this need in some countries. But beware; it is all about being seen, but not too much! That is the latest tendency: showing but not flaunting oneself, nor being too visible or trying to stand out. Flashiness is no longer in. We still want to be ourselves behind our desire to be seen, with our own style, a style that reflects our personalities. We are still anxious to contribute our bit, yet without being radically different. Then, beyond image lies protection. This is the other powerful luxury cosmetics lever. Protection against the deleterious effects of pollution, protection against ageing effects… The more people care about their health, the more ready they are to indulge in the best products, even the most expensive ones. Paradoxically, expanding offer also arouses suspicion. Counterfeited or poor quality products are often seized in emerging countries, which benefits luxury cosmetics brands. Customers are convinced that buying more expensive means buying safe. The premium beauty sector finds its roots in luxury values that are themselves experiencing a deep change. While still reflecting excellence and refinement, the luxury market is less material and tends to favour experience and values more extensively. If it used to embody social belonging and economic success, it is getting increasingly committed and tends to adopt a more participative approach to development. Its ability to arouse desire comes to a greater extent from thrill-seeking, whether it be exhilarating, uplifting or fulfilling emotions. ""We have shifted from an appearance-focused society to one that praises hedonistic beauty and where a mosaic of people value difference"", highlights Leïla Rocher-Podvin. At the same time, ethics – emotions from the heart – has become a key value in our world. Thus for consumers seeking meaning, affinity has become essential. And echoing the values they have adopted has become a necessity. The statutory link with the brand has been substituted by an affinity, more human, even humanist relationship. We no longer buy a product, we subscribe to a brand. Given these findings, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation have presented a prospective segmentation used as the basis upon which to reflect on innovation. The agency encourages brands to add ideas that mirror society and luxury changes to their traditional performance arguments, in particular by reinforcing the brand-customer relationship. It has thus defined four prospective axes: – ArtKeting. Upgrading egos by strenghtening the brand's creative and cultural values, which will both reinforce affinity and experience and awaken a sense of wonder through the beauty of the creation. – 4Me. Finding a benefit or an experience that will increase the prestige of personal affinity with the brand, whether it be a service, a promise or a new quality to the product. – Sentstory. Reinforcing sensorial discovery or the discovery of a new story, and positioning the brand as an « escape brand » that brings hedonistic happiness. – Xhumaniste. Premium beauty's main feature is to make consumers feel valued when they buy, and to touch their hearts, provoking affinity. Reinforcing the brand's strong image as a sacred/human brand, and disclosing its ethics when facing societal challenges. The whole file comprising the cross analysis carried out by IPSOS and Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation was presented as a preview at the Beyond Beauty trade show (September 9 to 11, 2013) as part of a conference entitled ""The Irresistible Desire for Premium Beauty"", and is now available from one or the other company: – IPSOS : Rémy Oudghiri, Directeur du département Tendances et Prospective Ipsos Public Affairs, Tel : +33 1 41 98 95 73 ; (E-mail : remy.oudghiri@ipsos.com) – Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation: Leila Rochet-Podvin, Fondatrice, Tel : +33 1 82 28 32 82 (E-mail: leila@inspiration-creation.com)"
"""Consumer expectations have changed regarding promotional items,"" Virginie Mazelier, Anaïk Beauty","Premium Beauty News - The core business of Anaïk Beauty, are promotional solutions for major cosmetic brands. What changes has this sector experienced in the past years? Virginie Mazelier - Today I believe that the two main changes in the sector of promotional solutions are, on the one hand innovation, in terms of products but also services offered to brands, and on the other hand, the integration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) principles into promotional campaigns. Since the inception of the company in 1973, we offer main beauty players around the world, gift solutions in terms of luggage, bags and cases, rigid boxes, jewellery, scented items (cushions, ceramics...) decorative objects and accessories. Adapting to changing consumer expectations, and therefore to brand requirements, has always been our main concern. Premium Beauty News - What are the innovations in this sector, in terms of services? Virginie Mazelier - Generally speaking, our advisory activity tends to increase. We assist our clients in the structuring and setting up of heir promotional offer. Anaïk Beauty is organized around three core businesses: designers, buyers, and sales people. We create trend books and annual collections that we offer our clients with a customized advisory offer. We have also developed an in-house pre and post consumer tests service, which is an important addition to our product offering. We also carry out studies with our subsidiary Mode & Co, to better understand consumer expectations vis-à-vis promotional gifts. Premium Beauty News - And for products themselves? Virginie Mazelier - Changes concern both the design and manufacture of products! Responsiveness has become a crucial competitive factor. Methods imported from the fashion world, and which consist in sticking as quickly as possible to the latest trends, and therefore produce and deliver quickly, and then quickly take account of the tastes expressed by consumers in stores (fast fashion) are becoming common practice in the cosmetic world in general and promotional solutions in particular. The first consequence is a trend towards the relocation of production within or close to customer markets. The time required between the design and manufacturing stages has been greatly reduced. And to be fast to market, you must be close to it. This is also what led us to develop Easy-sampling, a solution dematerializing the production of samples and which makes it possible to significantly reduce production time while minimizing the impact on the environment. We also have an express service offer which, combined to Easy-sampling, enables us to design, produce and deliver gifts in less than 3 months. Other factors contribute to this relocation movement with costs first: they have risen sharply in China, and then with the ""made in France"" or ""made in Europe"" label that give a true symbolic added value to products. At the core of this phenomenon, there is also a considerable evolution of consumer expectations especially in mature markets like Europe, the U.S. or Japan. With social networks and blogs, communication is much less on a one way brand-to-consumer mode and much more participatory. Consumers want to give their advice and they want to be heard. Taking account of this advice is essential and this can even lead to a process of co-creation and customization. Consumers therefore appreciate they are given the choice of the gift they will receive. And they want to receive it as fast as possible! Premium Beauty News - And regarding CSR? Virginie Mazelier - Demand for ethics is becoming increasingly important in the design and sourcing process of promotional gifts. It all started with social audits carried out by our clients at our suppliers. The movement gained momentum when, in many countries, listed companies had to communicate on their achievements in terms of CSR. But it also meets a real expectation from consumers who need transparency, who want to know where products come from, how they are made. Today, ethical concerns cover all aspects of sourcing. They impact the choice of materials used, or the way to produce them. PET is a plastic which is appreciated because it is recyclable, paper must be certified (FSC among others), textiles are increasingly made from fibres originating from organic crops, or Oeko-Tex certified. But this ethical movement impacts the whole supply chain, it goes from the integration of disabled people in the production line to the quality of maritime carriers, with the Clean Cargo Working Group. For even more sustainability and also because surveys show that it is a true expectation from consumers, during the development of products we are thinking of the possibility of giving a second life to gifts, or the possibility of reprocessing them. In conclusion, the key to success when it comes to promotional solutions is differentiation and customization, while being clean, useful and responsible!"
Beauty packaging: Is relocation the new trend?,"""Made in USA"", ""Proudly made in America,"" ""Rendez-vous en France"", ""Origine France Garantie"": brands certifying the origin of manufactured products have mushroomed over the past 10 years, like so many signs of a growing worry, as much on the part of those struck by mass unemployment as of manufacturers threatened by international competition. In France, the so-called ""Minister of Industrial Renewal"" has launched a software making it possible to calculate the benefits of inshoring. The software is made available, free of charge, to companies through the Invest in France Agency (Agence Française pour les Investissements Internationaux). These initiatives, however, seem insignificant in view of a movement that, for years, has gradually extended on from the technological progress of Asian suppliers. Today, even products with a very high added value are affected. ""A few years ago, few luxury packaging suppliers claimed to have production lines in Asia,"" explains Yannick Vermorel, president of Le French Cosmetic Workshop, a company specialized in the supply of ""made in France"" solutions for cosmetic private label brands. ""Today, it's the opposite that strikes you."" Actually, the increase in quality of Asian beauty packaging suppliers is impressive. Technology transfers from Japan to Korea or from Europe to China have facilitated the dazzling increase in know-how in emerging countries. The impressive growth of the Cosmoprof Asia tradeshow - 2,000 exhibitors and 55,000 visitors in 2012 - demonstrates that Asia is now a key area for the beauty industry. The de-industrialization movement has reached such levels in Europe and North America that some products and accessories are practically only available in Asia. ""That's the case, for example of standard makeup boxes and multi-material accessories like brushes,'' explains Mr. Vermorel. However inshoring no longer seems exactly utopian and several cosmetics players affirm that it is indeed happening. ""The thinking of managers of major brands in Germany or France is that consumers are increasingly aware of the social consequences of their purchasing acts,"" says Marie-Laure Viellard, in charge of marketing and communications at Leoplast, an Italian manufacturer of packaging and technical pieces in injected plastic for cosmetics products and a specialist of eco-designed products. Obviously, this concerns, in priority, the ethical segment. ""Certified organic brands in Germany or distributers such as DM are getting more and more questions from consumers on this subject,"" adds Ms. Viellard. Aware of the contradiction between calls for environmental friendliness, on the one hand, and supplies in Asia, on the other hand, these brands have updated their guidelines for good practices by imposing that a minimum percentage of packaging products be made in Europe. Quadpack, a group until now exclusively centred on quality packaging sourcing, notably in Korea, has recently acquired the Spanish maker of wood ingredients, Technotraf. For its first manufacturing site, Quadpack chose Europe. Of course this involved guaranteeing that its customers would have access to innovative products of very high quality. But the acquisition can also be explained by ""Quadpack's desire to diversify its supply sources to ethical products: made in Europe from sustainable materials."" But are ethics and generosity enough? Other factors promote the inshoring movement: higher transport costs, delivery schedules that are too long, difficulties coordinating with teams located at a great distance, problems of quality, non-compliance and the risk of knock-offs. ""Asia is synonymous with huge quantities and unpredictable quality,"" according to Vermorel. ""Reliability and innovation are essential to success and are intimately related to proximity to customers,"" thinks Olivier Salaun, CEO of PSB Industries, whose subsidiary Texen, the world's 4th-ranked supplier of cosmetics and fragrance packaging, has sites in France and the Americas. Proximity also makes it possible to streamline flow, shorten delivery schedules and thus customer stocks. In addition, the tightening of European regulations, with REACH and the new cosmetics regulations, is not neutral. For Laurence Mulon, an independent consultant, ""these texts make it necessary for brands to get new information from their suppliers or even to modify some manufacturing processes, which Asian companies haven't always anticipated."" But players agree on the fact that the growth, or not, of the phenomenon will necessarily be accompanied by adaptation on the part of European and North American suppliers. This is because costs don't explain everything, notably in view of the Korean competition that is not necessarily very cheap but which has proven to be very flexible and creative. This is all the more so, as emerging markets are continuing to develop and the technological transfers required to serve these new customers will continue as a result. New factories will thus open in Asia and Latin America, new partnerships with local suppliers will be made and new competitors will gain power. A shift that Abléa has chosen to anticipate. Following the buyout of Rexam Personal Care, the group now has a network of 46 sites in 14 countries and is present in four different trade segments. Albéa is showing itself to be both local and global. And the strategy is certainly well adapted to the new challenges of a world that is more multipolar than ever, provided it serves also to maintain the group's capacity for innovation, which remains the key to success for all players, whatever their size."
Italy: skincare and fragrances to slowly recover from recession,"Italy has been in recession since mid-2011, and the country's Gross Domestic Product has fallen sharply since 2007. These factors have impacted consumer spending on both essential and non-essential products, such as fragrances and skincare products. As far as skin care products are concerned, the decline, however, is likely to be minimal at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of -0.1% by value up to 2017. Growth by volume is expected to be slightly positive and forecasted at a CAGR of 0.6% for the same time period. Skincare will continue to remain the largest sector in the health and beauty industry in Italy up to 2017, according to Canadean [1]. However, it is forecasted to rank only eighth for growth among the nine other categories in the sector studied during that period. Slow economic recovery and reduced consumer spending is expected to put pressure on value growth for all major categories in the sector. Facial care, the largest category both by value and volume share in 2012, is expected to witness a volume CAGR of 0.6%, but a slight negative value growth at a CAGR -0.1% up to 2017. The category is expected to maintain its stronghold over the market despite a decline in value. Depilatories, with only a modest contribution of 6.2% both by value and volume in 2012, is expected to be the fastest growing category by volume with a projected CAGR of 0.8% up to 2017. The rest of the skincare market is split between body care, make-up remover and hand care, with the latter forecast to witness stagnant value growth and a small volume CAGR of 0.7% up to 2017. Concerning the Italian fragrance sector, Canadean forecasts the market to grow by a volume Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of just 1.4% during 2012-2017, while value growth is forecast to be even lower, at just 0.8%. Although it is the largest category with over 60% of the sector, the female fragrances category is projected to show the slowest growth. The category will just meet average growth with a value CAGR at 0.7% and a volume CAGR of 1.4%. Male fragrances are expected to perform slightly better in both value and volume terms, with CAGRs of 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. The category commanded just above a 38% share in both volume and value terms in 2012. Unisex fragrances will be the best performing category, although possessing a much lower market share, with 1.5% for both value and volume in 2012. Growth in this category is projected to be just slightly above sector levels, with value and volume CAGR at 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively."
MakeUp in New York 2013: +50%,"All of them were really unanimous! The third edition of MakeUp in New York can boast of winning the votes of all participants, both exhibitors and visitors. First observation: the growth in the number of exhibitors was followed by a corresponding increase in the number of visitors, +50 % in both cases. According to the organizers' records, as of September 26 at 06.00 pm 1520 people attended the annual event of the makeup industry in North America: a figure well above the initial estimates of the organizers. ""However, once again it is not the number that has been most noticed, but the quality of the visitors. This has been a constant since the beginning of the event, just three years ago,"" observed the organizers, who also considered that ""the charm of the event not only continues to operate but is growing, such as its Parisian sister-event is doing."" Actually, the same ingredients seem to create the same winning recipe. Apparently, the North American beauty industry also bet on it. Thus, the Cosmetic Industry Buyers and Suppliers Association (CIBS) had wanted to organize one of its major annual evenings jointly with MakeUp in New York. The result, according to the association's President, a record number of participants, exceeding 500 people. The third edition of MakeUp in New York was also marked by a great interest in the ten conferences and half a dozen makeup animations that punctuated the two-day event. The conference room was almost always full from one session to another and the exhibitors' booths were particularly lively, especially during the first day. Among the various novelties presented on this occasion, let's mention the lipstick cases with magnetic caps developed by Axilone (Iléos group) for MAC and Armani, and the case developed for Marie Claire, with an opening device system on the top and a transparent background on the bottom to see the product's shade. The Canadian company Crystal International presented, a series of double-chamber packs that not only allows to separate two components prior to their distribution, but also to mix them by varying the dose of each formula, a pack that is ideal for makeup bases and foundations. The German company Weckerle launched a surprising squared lipstick. And Livcer, a French specialist of thermoformed samples and unit doses, has showcased Touch Kiss, a new sample for lipsticks that can be used without a support card. The event also hosted an exposition of historic lipstick packaging designs, organised by expert collector Jean-Marie Martin-Hattenberg and Anne Camilli. ""Information, new products, exchanges, everything came together to contribute to the success of this third edition, the goal of which was to become THE main event in North America for the make-up industry,"" said the organizers. It seem clear that the goal was reached and the organisers already announce an even stronger 2014 edition."
"Intimacy, ingredients and globalization: the new face of perfumery","Premium Beauty News - In recent years, a strong trend has driven the growth of a demanding perfumery, which has been attracting perfume addicts, tired of big launches, and looking for exception and rarity. What is the impact of this trend on the market? Armand de Villoutreys - We can observe an undeniable need for more intimate and personalized perfumes. The so-called ""niche"" perfumes enjoy high growth rates, but figures start from very low. For the moment, in terms of volume and market share, niche perfumery is - one might say ""by definition"" - marginal. Especially because it still has to cope with strong distribution issues. In addition, the boundaries of this perfume category are now even more difficult to drawn since traditional brands have responded to niche brands by developing their own elitist strategy. They have launched their own intimate lines with market codes similar to those of small brands: standard bottles, highlight on the main ingredients and notes, restricted number of point of sales. Today, this market is very crowded. To succeed brands must redouble differentiation efforts and have a very strong concept. For instance, a brand like Le Labo, has been successful in change the relation to perfumes by inviting consumers to smell their ingredients. Frederic Malle's idea - to create a publishing house for perfumes and to highlight their creators - is also truly remarkable. We can also mention Jo Malone's combinations, or By Kilian's hyper luxury, without forgetting Diptyque who pioneered the segment and has celebrated its 50th anniversary. But these niche brands have also demonstrated that a perfumery deeply rooted in the ingredients appeals to many consumers. More figurative than conceptual, these brands give value to raw materials, focus their creativity in the concentrate, rather than in the bottle or advertising. They helped restoring the quality of the concentrate, in which they invest a lot, and obviously it is something that we warmly welcome. Actually, I do think too many savings have been made at this level. For many years, we have faced briefs setting tight prices for concentrates, even though it coincided with a sharp rise in raw materials prices. Premium Beauty News - More generally, the rhythm of major launches is apparently slowing down? Armand de Villoutreys - Yes the number slightly slowed down and I personally consider it a good thing. We had reached a kind of craze that created a strong pressure on the brands' budgets. The success of those who have slowed the pace, implementing the ""fewer but bigger"" principle, showed that another way is possible. However, we must immediately temperate this observation because there are always so many flankers. Furthermore, if there is a real slowdown in the prestige segment, it is less marked for masstige and mass. Simultaneously, the market share of the luxury perfumes has been steadily declining globally due to the rise of emerging countries, including Brazil, which are rather masstige or mass. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how is the global market evolving? Armand de Villoutreys - First of all, the global market was transformed by the explosion of the huge Brazilian market. After taking first place in volume a few years ago, the Brazilian fragrance market has recently overcome the United States first in value. Also worth to note is the dynamism of the Middle Eastern market that represents a total of about 300 million consumers who are heavy perfume buyers. Besides, this market also has a great influence on the whole Muslim world, including countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, for example. In contrast, Asia - i.e. mainly China, Japan, and Korea - is not significantly taking off. As far as our organization is concerned, we opened creative centres dedicated to fine fragrances in Sao Paulo and Dubai. We now have four of these units: in Paris, New York, Sao Paulo and Dubai. We formulate locally, in direct contact with the local population. Finally, it should be noted that if our markets are highly globalized, it is also the case of our supplies. Today our ingredients are sourced from around the world, with a growing weight of central India. So far, we have eleven factories, nine of which are located in emerging markets."
Beauteam to launch MakeUp in Seoul in March 2014,"Recently interviewed by Premium Beauty News, Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, co-founders of Beauteam, had made no secret on the fact that this project was taking shape very quickly. ""Faster than expected"", they even admitted a few days ago, ""given the success of both the editions in Paris and New York, it was logical for us to question ourselves on the opportunity of creating in Asia a similar concept."" Not that simple, however, to select the country and especially the city that would enable to recreate successfully this winning combination that calls for a few key ingredients: An upscale and friendly venue in the centre of a capital city close to main local make-up brands; a country where make-up is an integral part of consumers' daily lives and where a subcontracting industry acts as a real economic force. Why faster than expected? ""Simply, Beauteam officials explain, because our industrial partners exhibiting in Paris and in New York, whether they are European, American or Korean, advised us to continue the adventure as of next year in Seoul."" Good spots to exhibit in Asia are not that many: Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore? As for the date? Not easy either! Simply enough, the success also lies in the proper choice of a date relative to other global events in the beauty industry, but also in the proper choice of the season.... Mid March seemed to be the perfect time. ""The more we focused on the project"", explain the organizers, the more Korea seemed to be the perfect match. "" A country where, as everyone knows, the ""make-up culture"" is particularly strong. The Korean cosmetics market is very polarized since about 65% of sales are shared by two product categories: facial (49%) and make-up (16%). [1] ""During the recent period, explained Richard Cymberg, in an article published on the blog of French Foreign Trade Advisors in Koera, the cosmetics market has been very dynamic, boosted by the increased purchasing power of households, the dynamism of department stores and the emergence of new distribution channels: the 'brand shops', drugstores and the internet."" According to UbiFrance, South Korea is the third market in Asia-Pacific for cosmetic products. ""Korean women, but also Korean men, are highly aware of the personal appearance. The market is characterized by a high consumption rate from consumers requiring cosmetic products of high quality and immediate effect in a beautiful packaging,"" said the French foreign trade office. ""Given the plethora of cosmetic brands in the Asian region and particularly in Korea, it seemed natural for a strong outsourcing industry to emerge and flourish in this country in recent years, "" said Jean-Yves Bouregois, Beauteam co-founder. A well established industry whose structure and messages, which have set the bar very high, in terms of quality, sophistication and environmental standards, clearly reflect its weight in the economic circuit and the challenges imposed by a highly demanding sector in terms of innovations. ""A number of manufacturers were clever enough to seize this opportunity and take the lead in R&D and manufacturing capabilities,"" he added. ""So Seoul will be the place! A capital city with a winning combination! A two-hour flight from Shanghai and Tokyo,"" concluded the organisers."
Nail polishes take the British make-up market by storm,"For the first time in 2012, the value of the UK nail colour cosmetics market equalled that of lip colour cosmetics. According to a new research from Mintel [1], both segments posted a market value of £229 million respectively (about 271 euros at current rate). ""While in 2011, the nail colour cosmetic market value stood at £221 million, compared to £224 million for lip colour cosmetics - continued growth in both categories has boosted the sector - but an increased passion for nail colour in the UK has ensured the nail market has clawed its way to level pegging,"" explains the market research firm. What is more, the nail colour cosmetics sector is expected to carry on growing in 2013! It should therefore overtake the lip segment by the end of this year to reach an estimated £233 million (vs £232 million for the lip colour cosmetics market). This surge is also reflected in product innovation, with a record number of new nail colour products entering the market in 2012, up 400% compared to 2008. And the trend looks set to continue in 2013. ""While new nail colour product launches accounted for 10% out of total new launches in the colour cosmetics category in 2008, the percentage shot up to 26% in 2012. This year (January to August 2013) they accounted for 27%, leading new development in the colour cosmetics category (this compares to 26% of lip colour cosmetics and with 23% of eye colour cosmetics),"" says Mintel. The fact that the nail colour cosmetics market has equalled that of the lip colour market for the first time in the UK highlights the growing popularity of nail polish in most advanced cosmetic markets. In France, for instance, the ""nail polish mania"" is affecting an increasing number of buyers (20% of French women), and with increasing quantities (2.4 units per buyer). ""Nail art continues to be a driving factor in sales. An explosion of new textures and effects is emerging which allows young women in particular to easily personalise their nail look. Nail make-up is also relatively purse-friendly, offering a range of affordable options and results that do not need daily application, cementing its position as a go-to sector for all consumer budgets,"" says Charlotte Libby, Household and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Figures are self-explanatory. According to Mintel, nail polish is used by 59% of women in the UK, with usage peaking among young women, standing at 72% of 16-24-year-olds - compared to less than half (48%) of over-65s. In contrast, just 7% of British women use false nails. Concerning the overall colour cosmetics market in the UK, Mintel estimates sales to reach nearly £1.5 billion in 2013, an annual growth of 2% from 2012. The outlook for the next five years is positive too, with a growth expected at a more rapid pace, to reach £1.9 billion in 2018 (about 2.25 billion euros, at current rate). In terms of trends, the most popular new product claims in 2013 are colour cosmetics with long-lasting features (45% of total new product introductions in the colour cosmetics category to date in the UK). According to Mintel, the claim is most prominent in face (55%) and eye (52%) make-up, with 55% of products launched in the face make-up category and 52%. Brightening and illuminating claims (41%) follow. Mintel's research also highlights that senior consumers are becoming a key demographic and a commercial opportunity for the makeup sector. Up to 36% of 55-64 year-old British women and almost two in ten (17%) of women aged over 65 say that wearing make-up makes them feel more professional. Furthermore, 69% of 55-64 year-olds and 54% of women aged over 65 agree that it makes them feel more confident. But it seems that while some British women are committed to make up, the same cannot be said for their cleansing routine. Today, some 21% of women don't always take off their make-up before going to sleep, with up to 27% of those aged 25-34 doing so."
"""The olfactory sense is proving its true worth"" Cécile Zarokian, perfumer","Premium Beauty News - A first fragrance emerged when you were still learning your trade at Robertet, then shortly after you created your own company, with some twenty fragrances signed in two years. You haven't lost much time, have you! Cécile Zarokian - It was now or never to get started. I did not want to wait too long and then not dare take the risk. And finally everything worked out fine. From the time my company was created, I engaged myself in an art project with the illustrator Matthieu Appriou. The project resulted in an exhibition in Paris in September 2011, which was part of the program ""Rives de la Beauté"". The idea was to combine six perfumes with six illustrations, and establish a dialogue between the two universes, each giving birth to the other. Alternatively, the brush stroke followed the olfactory narration, or in turn the nose was guided by the brush. This enabled me to show what I could achieve aside from a customer's specific request or business constraints. The exhibition is now going to take place in London this fall. [1] In parallel, I won some projects and signed several fragrances. The creation of Epic Woman enabled me to meet Francois Hénin, the President of Jovoy, who distributes the brand in his outlet. This meeting resulted in the creation of two fragrances for Jovoy Paris, the eau de parfum Private Label and the scented candle Ambre 1er. Creations then followed one another with two home fragrances and two scented candles for the waxmaker Perron Rigot: Carnet De Voyages and Soirée Câline. Then there was the eau de parfum Pink, a 100% natural composition for the brand Undergreen, some more candles, the perfume Mon Nom Est Rouge for Majda Bekkali, and recently, the three perfumes Vy Roza, Djélem and Albho for the Suléko brand. I also created the candles for the Château de Versailles. Premium Beauty News - Customers mostly come from the so-called niche perfumery sector. Cécile Zarokian - Yes, it is more a matter of choice. If I became an independent perfumer and created my own laboratory in the process, it was to be able to continue my work freely. From this point of view, working with smaller brands is very different. If they often have a smaller budget, they do not have the same constraints and when they turn to an independent perfumer, it is because they rely a lot on the fragrance. The creative work thus becomes both more interesting and is carried out in close collaboration. Premium Beauty News - An independent perfumer's way of working is very different from that of a large fragrance house? Cécile Zarokian - We do not exactly address the same needs nor do we exactly offer the same services, we generally don't operate on the same markets. Customers who come to me know that I love working on original projects, sometimes out of step with the conventional spirit of the fragrance industry, from visuals, emotions, colours, fabrics, sounds, while sticking to the brand's universe. I am not systematically given olfactory directions, and enjoy a lot of creative freedom. And then there is also a direct relationship with the customer throughout the development process. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the evolution of the market of niche perfumery, referred to as exceptional and creative? Cécile Zarokian - In this segment too, launches have increased. On the one hand, this helps stimulate demand and the market is expanding, but on the other hand, one might ask whether the market is not already saturated. In the end, profitability is not always easy to reach and many brands do not rely solely on their perfumes to make a business. The positive side is that the olfactory sense is proving its true worth The power of scent has long been underestimated, but nowadays a lot of brands seem to discover the power of olfactory marketing, its impact on sales. We can see in the ready-to-wear world, brands like Abercrombie & Fitch or Zadig & Voltaire give a real olfactory identity to their outlets. On this market, which is also becoming very competitive, I think it is important to take the time to give a ""soul"" to perfumes, it must be sufficiently differentiating to be recognizable by consumers, but not too much in order to not deter most customers. Originality is important, but it must be used appropriately. Premium Beauty News - Doesn't this frenzy of launches, all segments included, facilitate the development of full service? Cécile Zarokian - This is an underlying trend of the market. More and more companies are offering turn key products. Depending of their customers' request they can rely on a catalogue of perfumes or turn to a perfumer. In some cases, the customer may also express his desire to work with a specific perfumer. But of course this is only interesting when one wishes to engage in a genuine process of olfactory creation. Premium Beauty News - The strengthening of regulatory constraints also plays a role in these changes? Cécile Zarokian - Certainly. A small brand will need to rely on a growing number of experts. In such conditions, it is sometimes more effective to delegate a large part of the process to a company which already has a critical mass to withstand the costs involved. But as far as olfactory creation is concerned, the weight of regulatory constraints must not be exaggerated. I belong to a generation who has always worked in this context, and that does not preclude creativity. Sometimes it is also more the brands' specifications that generate real difficulties than purely legal obligations. In my projects, I have never had any difficulties with IFRA standards. Conversely, when I developed Pink, a 100% natural composition for the Undergreen brand, we had to undertake a huge amount of research work on ingredients, to manage in the end, to create a complex and subtle fragrance in spite of a limited palette. And the biggest achievement of the project lies in the fact that this constraint is not reflected in the final result! In fact, the problem arises mostly for already marketed fragrances. If the regulatory changes include the requirement to reformulate a large part of what is already on the marketplace, costs will be astronomical and not bearable for small structures, not to mention the loss of our olfactory heritage."
A summary of the summer news,"Concerning the markets, The NPD Group highlights the impact of SPF on sales of prestige colour and skincare products in the United States. Also regarding the USA, Mintel focuses on the importance of BB creams on the growth of colour products. As far as Europe is concerned, Canadean puts under the spotlight the contrasted evolution of men's and women's fragrances in Germany, the forecast growth of the skincare market in The Netherlands, as well as in Sweden. Regarding the French market, The NPD Group points out the resilience of makeup sales while sales of overall prestige cosmetic products are decreasing, a situation contrasting with the dazzling sales of the British market. Eventually, according to Canadean, budget-conscious Australian consumers favour bulk deals and offers. Among the innovations and new products showcased during the summer, Premium Beauty News wrote about Lindal's new actuator, which aims at eliminating the need for overcap on aerosols and the new mascara applicator launched by Avon, as well as Unilver's choice to turn to crowdsourcing for trying to lower the environmental impact of our shower practices. Some other launches are featured in our ""Summer 2013"" gallery. On per ingredients, we can note the new range of natural exfoliants by Worlee Cosmetics and the development of new broad-spectrum UV filters inspired by corals and the way they protect from the sun. Also to be noted the acquisition by Lucas Meyer of new range of a new portfolio of botanical cosmetic ingredients. Companies news in Europe were marked by the some major shifts among the suppliers of nail polishes, in particular with the acquisition of Chromavis by Fareva and the one of Dropnail by Intercos. Still on the supply side, let's note the strengthening by Ateliers Dinand of their business in North America and the entry of Geka in Brazil. As far as brands are concerned, let's mention among the several shifts that occurred during the summer, the acquisition of China's Majic Holdings by L'Oréal and the one of The Colomer Group by Revlon. Eventually, on the retail side, the major event of the summer is probably the acquisition of Saks by the Hudson's Bay Company. To be noted also, the bet of Target regarding online retailing."
Germany: Female fragrances to grow slower than the market,"With a value CAGR of 0.9% between 2012 and 2017, the female fragrance category is only the seventh fastest growing out of the nine German Health & Beauty sectors monitored by market research firm Canadean. ""German consumers are very price conscious despite having the strongest economy in Europe; German consumers perceive fragrances to be a luxury item, rather than an everyday product, and they are therefore careful when choosing their favoured product,"" says the firm. Female fragrances held the largest share of the fragrance sector in 2012, with value and volume shares of 54.8% and 54.2% respectively. However, according to Canadean, the category will also display the slowest growth over the next five years at a value CAGR of 0.7% and volume CAGR of 1.3% to 2017; below the sector average for both measurements. In contrast, both male and unisex fragrance categories will grow at a value CAGR of 1.1% between 2012 and 2017, with male just growing ahead of unisex fragrances in terms of volume, at CAGRs of 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively."
Hudson's Bay to acquire Saks,"Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) and Saks Incorporated have announced their merger at the end of July. The takeover of all Saks share by HBC has been approved by each company's board of directors and is expected to close before the end of the calendar year. This transaction will bring together three of the retail industry's most iconic brands in North America - Hudson's Bay, Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue. The combined company will operate 320 stores, including 179 full-line department stores, throughout the U.S. and Canada, along with three e-commerce sites. HBC said it will continue to build upon Saks' market-leading position and identity as a luxury retailer. Hence, Saks will operate separately under the HBC umbrella, including its own merchandising, marketing and store operations teams, and will remain headquartered in New York City. It is also expected that Saks will continue to be led by key members of its existing management team. ""This exciting portfolio of three iconic brands creates one of North America's premier fashion retailers,"" stated Richard Baker, HBC's Chairman and CEO. ""This acquisition will increase our growth potential both in the U.S. and Canada, generate significant efficiencies of scale, add to our powerful real estate portfolio."" In particular, HBC intends to introduce Saks into Canada and to build upon saks.com on the international market. The combination will maximize existing e-commerce platforms across all three banners."
SPF claims boost sales of prestige skincare and makeup in the US,"Sales of makeup and skincare with a SPF reached 1.1 billion US dollars in US prestige department stores from June 2012 to May 2013, reports The NPD Group. The market research firm notes it corresponds to a 24 percent increase from three years ago. ""Whether it is health concerns, or a more superficial fear of looking older, the intensified focus on sun protection from the beauty and health care industries is having a real impact on consumers, and the market,"" says Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. According to The NPD Group, most of the current growth in products with SPF continues to come from skincare, where dollar sales have consistently increased by double-digits over the past three years. Overall, dollar sales of makeup with SPF saw a boost in the 12 months ending May 2012 (June 2011 - May 2012). In makeup and skincare, products with SPF 15 remain the largest segment in sun protection with more than half of dollar sales. Growth of makeup options in the SPF 15 segment were driven by a 6 percent higher average selling price compared to last year, but it was options which offered slightly higher levels of sun protection, SPF 20 and 25, that saw double-digit increases based heavily on an increase in units sold. When it came to skincare, the majority of the growth occurred where the SPF was greater than 20. In particular, SPF 30, the second largest SPF segment in skincare at 13 percent of sales, grew significantly in the past 12 months ending May 2013. Sun protection products at the highest SPF levels of SPF 50 grew 24 percent from June 2012 to May 2013 and now account for almost one third of all in sun sales. ""It's been said that 'a good sunscreen is the best anti-aging product you can get', and not only are consumers buying more products with SPF they are spending a little more on them to get that higher SPF number for better protection,"" adds Karen Grant. Also, it is important to note that products claiming to protect the skin against sunburns are classified as OTC drugs in the USA."
France: Sales down for prestige cosmetic brands but makeup resists,"Sales of beauty products in the selective channel in France (products sold in department stores and specialty chains perfume brands) continued to decrease in the first half of 2013, in the wake of the downward trend recorded in 2012. According to The NPD Group, sales of fragrances and cosmetics perfumes have declined by 1.5% in value in 2013 compared to the first half of 2012. Among the three main segments only makeup resisted (+0.2%), while fragrances dropped by 1.7% (-1.0% for women's fragrances and -2.8% for women's fragrances) and skin care products dropped by 2.3%. Compared to other European countries, the market in France is now very close to the Spanish one, which is declining by 1.7%, but is better than in Italy (-3.4%). In contrast, sales in the UK remain dynamic with an increase of 5.9%. ""For the first half of 2013, makeup for the eyes clearly stand out from the mass with its dynamism, on the contrary, last year the nail segment was the most dynamic,"" says Mathilde Puszka, Beauty Analyst at The NPD Group. However, it is important to note that the NPD Group's figures only cover nail varnishes that are sold by prestige brands (Dior, Chanel, Estee Lauder, etc..) and do not take into consideration varnish products sold exclusively in certain chains or department stores, or retailers' private label brands. The NPD Group figures also show that, beyond makeup ""classics"" such as mascara, sales growth actually concerns all types of eye makeup products such as eye shadows and even smaller segments such as eyebrow pencils and eyeliners. These figures seem to confirm the trend towards accentuated eye makeup seen in the United States, which has been emerging in Europe since 2012. In the first half of 2013, the eye makeup segment was also the makeup segment showing the fastest growth rates in the UK, Spain and Italy."
Beyond Beauty Paris intends to be more than ever a springboard for emerging brands,"Premium Beauty News - What does the coming edition look like? Pradip Bala - Out of the 480 exhibitors, more than 50% of the offer will be renewed: quite enough to surprise visitors! In 2013, the exhibition will host more than twenty U.S. companies and new Japanese and Korean brands, but also brands from South Africa particularly in the Cosmeeting Color area. For many international companies, Beyond Beauty is an important communication platform regarded as an essential step in a strategy of export development. Premium Beauty News - The discovery of small emerging brands has always been one of Cosmeeting's strength? What does the coming edition of the Zoom look like? Pradip Bala - It's going to be particularly rich in innovation! This year the number of ""Zoomers"" is up by 38%. The discovery of small emerging brands is one of the strengths of Cosmeeting, especially this year with the creation of prizes for each category (perfume, skincare, make-up ...) for the Beauty Challenger Awards. The Zoom area is a springboard for small brands with a promising future, setting foot on the cosmetics market. The year 2013 will present brands dedicated to women, whether they are pregnant, smokers or active; but men will not be left out... Premium Beauty News - Precisely, this year the theme of the BBLab, the innovation area of the show will be on men's cosmetics. Can you tell us more? Pradip Bala - The BBLab, a true area of reflection on the major issues and challenges in cosmetics, will focus this year on masculine beauty. To paraphrase a popular image: man is not a woman like the others! Product offers and dedicated sales area are not always in line with the real expectations of men in terms of beauty. However, the strongest growth, all categories of cosmetics included, remains the ""men's segment"" with an important potential for development, especially in emerging countries. That's why, this year the BBLab will offer beauty professionals, the opportunity to enter – the men's much expected – complex but fascinating world of cosmetics. Marine and mineral ingredients will also be highlighted in this area. The BBLab will gather 12 companies, 11 cosmetic brands for men, who will dress the shelves of the future, two research firms, Mintel and Information & Inspiration, a Make Up animation for Men organized by Toupie Make Up and the promotion of exhibitors on the Green path of the show, with a sustainable approach. This area was staged by the architect Alfonso Maligno, a specialist in the design of pharmacies and spas of exception. Premium Beauty News - What will be the other highlights of the 2013 edition? Pradip Bala - First, the launch of the Perfume Zone, an area dedicated to the perfume world from its composition to its bottling, to perfumes ready to be marketed; this area presents the crafts of perfumery, the whole of it relayed in the conference room with two round tables. And of course, again and as always the Beauty Challenger Awards ceremony. Taking part in the Beauty Challenger Awards is the guarantee for brands to pass into the expert hands of international buyers and distributors. Sixty members of the jury will thoroughly vet the different brands and candidates to give them a final score. Among the members of the jury this year distributors as varied and prestigious as: Space NK (UK), Sens Unique (FR), Aelia (FR), Beauty Habit (USA), SLJ (Japan), Silvaron (Estonia), Supercosmetics (Russia), Galeries Lafayette (FR), Cosmetics & Perfume Distribution (UAE), Beauty Bizz (Denmark), Hypoluxe (USA), Biomarket Organik (Turkey)... A proof of the interest and credibility of the competition: 87% of new brands exhibiting at the show are taking part to the competition. New this year, brands have provided a two-minute video describing their history. More than fifty videos have already been proposed to the French jury during the assessments in July; the second round for the international exhibitors will take place on the first day of the show. More than fifty conferences are always available to visitors and exhibitors. Different design and communication agencies (Fullsix, Design Way...), but also market research companies (Datamonitor, Mintel...), international consultants will present trends and decrypt global consumer expectations. We will have a great theme this year to honour, China, from every angle: consumer products, retail, regulation, etc. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the evolution of the French market? Pradip Bala - The general economic situation is difficult in the whole euro zone. But the cosmetic sector, which is important in France, is resisting well, both with regards to exports sales but also domestic consumption, especially in differentiating segments and thanks to innovation. The French market is evolving, with in particular the development of independent retailers offering either more selective brands or lesser known brands with a unique positioning. It is the return of independent perfumery, which was almost condemned to disappear in France! This phenomenon, combined with the growth of e-business is a source of new opportunities for emerging brands."
Sainsbury's to launch private label make-up brand in September,"Sainsbury's recently introduced its new own-brand cosmetics range 'Boutique' and the relaunch of its skincare range 'Skin Therapy' to British press and bloggers. Both lines will be available in-store in September. ""Boutique is set to transform the way women shop for their make-up bag essentials. From nail polishes, lipsticks, lip gloss, eyeshadows to accessories, Boutique has been created, trialled and rigorously tested by a collective of professional make-up artists,"" the retailers says. Actually, Sainsbury's approached Jo Saville and Sophia Price in early 2011. The two established make-up artists have helped the retailer create a collection of colours that marries high pigmentation, easy application and brilliant staying power. Boutique shades feature fun, tongue-in-cheek names such as ""Grass Is Always Greener"", ""Tickled Pink"" and ""Cat Got The Cream"". However, the collection focuses on classic shades. Sainsbury's claims to have challenged its brand with the highest quality standards. As a result: ""blind product testing was carried out by 58 industry professionals, and the outcome resulted in over 90% of the beauty panel recommending Boutique."" The Boutique that will be launched in September 2013 at Sainsbury's includes: – Boutique Nail Polish: Available in 16 shades including ""Tickled Pink"", ""Caught Red Handed"" and ""As Good as Gold"", – Boutique Lipsticks: Available in 11 shades including ""Rest on your Corals"", ""Paint the Town Red"" and ""In the Buff"" – Boutique Eyeshadow: Available in 10 shades including ""Grass is Greener"", ""In the Limelight"" and ""Long Time No See"" – Boutique Lip Gloss: Available in 9 shades including ""Lip Lip Hooray"""
Seen at CosmeTech and Cosme Tokyo,"With exhibitors coming from 15 different countries, mostly from Asia, and a range of products and services covering the entire sector (from ingredients to finish products), there was no shortage in surprises at Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo. Several brands were showcasing products with ingredients derived from traditional Japanese products. The Marubishi Soap Company, for instance, has launched a soap containing luxurious sake made from 100% rice alcohol and produced by a long-established sake brewery in Kobe. ""Sake is rich in amino acid, which makes the skin smoother and whiter,"" claims the company. As for the skincare line launched by Jozen Mizunogotoshi, a famous sake brand, it uses rice-alcohol fermentation technology to produce its main moisturizing ingredient. Similarly, Citrus Juno Ltd. has launched Yutsuki, a moisturising cream rich in essential oil of Japan-grown yuzu (a Japanese fruit from the citrus family). Korean suppliers and brands formed the main overseas participation at Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo, with several innovative, or simply original, products. In order to address the micro-needling skin stimulation trend, DTS MG offers a series of applicators with a dual mechanism that enhances product penetration and stimulates collagen production. Dermal L&H is using a double fermentation method that has been developed in Korea to produce the ingredients of its newly anti-aging line: Cóem. To be noted also, the success of snail mucus, a substance well known for its healing properties, among Korean brands such as instance Callicos (Hongwon Costech Co. group), with its Ultra Snail Series, or Elishacoy's Skin Repairing Snail Cream. Other innovations of high interest, the new products showcased by Korean brands Beyon and Belif (LG Household & Health Care group). Belif is an apothecary brand proposing products conceived from the herbal recipes and philosophy of Duncan Napier, a botanist and herbalist who opened its first herbal shop and clinic in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1860. Beyond is natural cosmetic brands targeting teenagers and young adults. As far as packaging was concerned, the offer was less diversified, probably because most of the Japanese leading suppliers were not participating, but the average quality was quite high. In particular, Honda Plus has showcased a wide and colourful range of packaging with an impressive variety of forms illustrating its know-how and creativity in terms of plastic injection. Katani Sangyo also demonstrated the high precision and quality of its metal leaves for the decoration of plastic boxes. Korean company S&P World has showcased a wide range of applicators for make-up and skin care, including some notable innovations. Regarding ingredients several innovative products were showcased. Est Pro, for instance, launched Silk Fibroin, a silk-derived substance that can replace surface-active agents. Or also Bloom Classic Co. that developed ranges based on organic certified seaweeds. Also not finally, the hyaluronic acid and micro-needles combined offer by Cosmed Pharmaceutical Co."
Make-up: Kiko takes advantage of the crisis and of the craze for nail polish,"The makeup is not spared by the reduction of French households' spending in the health and beauty sector. However, according to Kantar Worldpanel, this category emerges unscathed as far as volumes are concerned, and the number of units purchased should increase this year. Thus, French consumers will purchase an average of 4.5 units of make-up products during the year. Among the categories that have the wind in their sails, nail polish enjoy the benefits of a real ""craze"", with an increasing number of buyers, 20% of French, and increasing quantities (2.4 units per buyer). As far as brands are concerned, the strongest contributors to the nail polish market growth are Yves Rocher, Leclerc, Sephora, Carrefour and System U. In terms of retailers, and in terms of brands: Yves Rocher, L'Oreal Paris, Rimmel and Kiko. According to Kantar Worldpanel, Kiko is the brand that has the greatest impact on the French make-up market. Created in Italy in 2005, it still has a low notoriety as only 18% of French women who purchase beauty care products declare knowing it. However, Kiko already has the highest purchase frequency in the makeup category, with an average 3.9 units purchased. It is the brand ""that generates the most additional volumes in the makeup market this year."" While it develops, of course, to the depends of some of its competitors, it is above all, according to Kantar Worldpanel, ""a great growth driver for the market."" In France, Kiko has captured 2% of the whole market, but already 11% of consumers aged between 15 and 24, and now equals the Sephora brand (in volume) in the make-up basket of the 15-24. Furthermore, Kiko has achieved this score mainly in the nail varnishes segment, where are concentrated its breath taking offers. However, its sales of lips and face and makeup, or of facial and body care products could also increase. Kiko's first advantage is definitely the attractiveness resulting from its low prices. Indeed, Kiko is one of the cheapest brands in the market, and in a period troubled by lower purchasing power, it could also attract older women. The brand has another advantage: its distribution network. Its products are available only in its own stores: around 75 outlets in France to date. Kiko thus enjoys the benefit of a huge growth potential linked to the possibility to open new stores."
Show report: Cosme Tech & Cosme Tokyo 2013,"With a rise of 60% in the number of exhibitors for its second edition, compared to 2012, Cosme Tokyo has grown as one of the major events in the cosmetics industry in Japan. The show even became much more international, with a significant Korean pavilion participating for the first time. ""The Korean participation is important for the show, as Japan and Korea are the most influent trendsetters for the cosmetics sector in Asia,"" explains Hajime Suzuki, Director, Group VP, International Sales & Marketing Division, at Reed Exhibitions Japan Ltd. As far as Cosme Tech - the section dedicated to suppliers - was concerned, the number of exhibitors was also on the rise with a wide array of packaging and ingredients suppliers, as well as OEM companies. Product showcases were completed by academic presentations in partnership with Japanese scientists, but they unfortunately only provided in Japanese language. Actually, the two shows combination offered a well balanced breakdown of products and services: ingredient suppliers (including participants in the Academic Forum) represented 12% of the exhibitors, OEM/ODM suppliers accounted for 22%, while containers and packaging suppliers for 21% and the manufacturers of finished products for 45%. ""Furthermore, the number of overseas exhibitors has been growing a lot and now represents 25% of the participants. And we expect this number to continue growing for the next edition,"" adds Hajime Suzuki. To encourage the participation of international players, the show's organizers know they have to deal with the reality of the Japanese market, which is not reputed as being particularly easy to access. Several foreign companies participating in the show already had an agent or distributor in Japan. For Jacques Jourlait, General Manager of Coverpla, a French supplier of standard glass packaging, which participated for the first time in this event, ""a key factor of success in this market, is to have the right partner."" Same advice from Aeneas Hall, Sales Manager at Manuka Doctor, a New Zealand brand proposing skin care products based on bee venom: ""it is important to find the good distributor before coming here."" However, according to Mario De Luigi, the CEO of Italian supplier of make-up and skin care high end products, B.Kolor Make Up & Skin Care, who sells directly to Japan and participated for the second consecutive time in the show, it is above all necessary ""to make a good preparation work before the show, and to hire someone speaking Japanese."" In his opinion, if the market is ""more difficult than in Europe"", it is because buyers ""need to be surprised and mainly look for innovative and original products."" In order to stimulate the business during the show, the organisers have scheduled several business meetings between exhibitors without any local partners and the Japanese operators attending the event. ""One of the most important evolution of the Japanese market is the shortening of the distribution channel. The time to market is faster and the feedback from the consumers comes earlier and is more accurate. As a consequence, there is a strong demand for innovation from all the operators, and this is a big opportunity for overseas suppliers and brands,"" concludes Hajime Suzuki. The next editions of Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo will be held from the 27th to the 29th of August 2014."
Global market for organic personal care products to reach 13.2 billion US dollars by 2018,"""Organic personal care products market is growing at rapid pace across the world,"" states a report recently published by Transparency Market Research. According to the study titled ""Organic Personal Care Products Market for Skin Care, Hair Care, Oral Care and Cosmetics - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2012 - 2018"", rising concerns for health safety, increasing green consciousness and growing consumer's awareness about the hazards in synthetic chemicals have fuelled the demand for organic personal care products worldwide. As a result, the global demand for organic personal care products, which was over 7.6 billion US dollars in 2012, is expected to reach 13.2 billion US dollars by 2018, growing at a CAGR of 9.6% from 2012 to 2018. Considering the regional repartition of the market, Transparency Market Research notes that North America was the largest consumer of natural and organic personal care products in 2011 and accounted for over 34% of the global consumption. The North American market is witnessing growth partly due to increased awareness about the organic principle and mainly due to entry of new multinationals, which are making organic products more easily accessible and visible for the consumer. Europe followed North America in terms of demand and accounted for over 29% of the global natural and organic personal care product demand in 2011. Germany and France were the primary consumers of organic personal care products in Europe together accounting for over 30% of the European demand. Japan, which is expected to register the fastest growth among all regions, accounted for over 42% of the total demand for natural and organic personal care products in Asia-Pacific. ""The belief in natural and organic remedies is already well ingrained in the Japanese culture therefore it became easier for the manufacturers to make the organic culture acceptable to the consumer,"" comments the market research firm. Skin care products are the largest segment and accounted for over 32% in terms of revenue across all the product segments in 2011. Transparency Market Research considers they will continue to dominate the organic personal care product market. The major factors contributing to the growth of this segment are launch of new products and widening distribution channels. Hair care was the next largest product segment accounting for roughly 25% of the total revenue in 2011. The natural and organic personal care products market is fragmented, with the top 10 companies accounting for little over 53% of the market share in 2011. According to Transparency Market Research, Bare Escentuals was the largest manufacturer for this product category in 2011 and accounted for over 7% of the market share by revenue. Estee Lauder, Burt's Bees and The Hain Celestial Group were the next largest companies in the natural and organic personal care market accounting for over 20% of the market share together in 2011. ""As the organic personal care products market show high growth potential many new companies are entering the market through mergers and acquisition route or through shifting their production line from synthetic to organic,"" adds the market research firm. Despite good growth prospects, Transparency Market Research deems that low consumer understanding of natural and organic personal care products, curbing pseudo-organic products competing with authentic products, multiple standards creating consumer confusion are some of the few factors dampening the demand for these products."
Scent is the first purchase criterion for French women,"Strongly attached to her perfume, sceptical towards new launches, and mainly attracted by the fragrance, here is the typical picture of the French perfume consumer according to the study conducted among nearly 2,000 French women on the web by CCL Benchmark Institute. First observation, the penetration rate is quite high: over 90% of French women perfume themselves every morning, and 34% several times a day. The vast majority of French women (90%) are regular consumers who use two or three fragrances and buy perfume once a quarter to once every six months, with an average annual budget of between 100 and 250 euros. Furthermore, women have a strong affective relationship with products that are firstly perceived as pleasure purchases (76% of women) but involving their own identity. The scent is mentioned as the very first purchasing criterion for choosing a perfume (94% of women) before the brand and the name of a perfume. The fragrance's ambassador is ranked far behind. Such statements were received with some scepticism by a part of the professionals gathered for the presentation of the results. Indeed, several of them considered they were in contradictory with market experience. However, other experts pointed that the success of Guerlain's La Petite Robe Noire, could be seen as a demonstration that style and the emotions are keys to success. Actually, although they mobilize a massive share of advertising spending, only few launches succeed in reaching the top 100 sales. French women also express severe judgements on new launches, 41% considering the offer as excessive, with rather negative comments about the lack of originality of new fragrances. According to the study, 60% of the French women have bought their latest perfume in a specialised retailer; only five per cent have bought it from the Internet. However, infrequent consumers are twice as numerous as the others to have bought their latest perfume on the Internet (looking for the best price, and because their purchase is not generally spontaneous). ""The role of the Fragrance Foundation France also consists in taking time to think about new challenges, and the tools that are available to move forward, and, contrary to a received idea, the fragrance industry generates few studies, and even fewer neutral studies not related to a brand. That's why this is an unprecedented study,"" said Philippe Ughetto, President of The Fragrance Foundation France."
Luxury in the Middle East: kill off received ideas,"GCC nationals [1] are high spenders. They spend an average of 1,300 US dollars monthly on clothing and accessories of which US$ 700 is on ready-to-wear and US$ 300 on shoes [2]. These figures can be compared with US$ 120 and US$ 15 respectively for the United Kingdom shoppers [3]. Similarly, according to the figures recently published by DMG Events, the organiser of The Life & Style Show UAE, to be held in Abu Dhabi on 5th-7th December 2013, one in ten United Arab Emirates residents is spending 60,000 dirhams (AED) a year on cosmetics, the equivalent of a small car. Eventually, according to Euromonitor International, forecasted daily spend on personal care will rise by 13 per cent per person by 2017 [4]. Generally speaking, the local environment is quite favourable but can the region be considered as an Eldorado for luxury businesses? Actually, ""a deep understanding of the region is a prerequisite of success,"" warns the Chalhoub Group (8.500 staff in 14 countries and more than 450 retail outlets in the region). Despite a lot of similarities, the various Middle East markets cannot be fully compared. For instance, some of them, such as Dubai, have a strong focus on tourism, while others (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) are mostly oriented toward their local market. Furthermore, if GCC countries usually have a population addicted to shopping, consumers' patterns and preferences also vary. According to the Chalhoub group, Dubai nationals are indulgent while those living in Abu Dhabi are elitist, viewing luxury as an exclusivity that only a certain social class can afford. Koweiti nationals are assertive consumers, with 92% choosing a brand simply because they 'like it' (versus a GCC average of 60%) and Saudi Arabian national are yearning for individual expression but are strongly attracted to anchor labels and shop within a limited set of brands. They need 'shopping guidance' and strong relationships with the sales staff. Similarly, Qatari nationals yearn for individual expression, yet, like Saudis, tend to purchase from a narrow and accepted set of brands. Probably because of the importance of shopping as leisure, the use of e-commerce is low, with only 26% of GCC nationals buying products on-line. In contrast, engagement in social media is very high. The white paper ""Luxury in the Middle East: an easy sell?"" is available from the Chalhoub group at www.chalhoub-group.com"
Seen at MakeUp in Paris,"With 90 exhibitors, including 60% from abroad, and more than 2,500 visitors (+18% compared to 2012, +110% for foreign visitors), MakeUp in Paris made the demonstration that it is now part of the most important tradeshows in the cosmetics industry, in particular thanks to its qualitative and friendly niche concept. The tradeshow, which aims to bring together all the players of the makeup industry, gathers a large variety of suppliers including packaging, accessories, or formulas makers, as well as full service players, who are able to offer turn-key products. This year, for the first time, MakeUp in Paris also hosted a selection of ingredient suppliers (BASF, Merck and Laserson), who came there to meet a different public, since marketing and R&D managers accounted alone for over 50% of visitors, according to the organisers. Also new in 2013, the ""MakeUPioneer"" trail, highlighting the innovations proposed by the exhibitors. Among the innovations that were presented during MakeUp in Paris, Premium Beauty News spotted: – The world's first nail varnish sample or single-dose packaging with applicator launched by Bioplan (Ileos Group). – The brush-formula couples kit jointly developed by Strand Cosmetics Europe and Dupont Natrafil, with the co-operation of make-up artist Louise Wittlich. – The first ever magnetic applicators in the make-up market, supplied by Priminter for Lancôme's Hypnôse palettes, injected and decorated by Qualipac. – The new ""Cashmere"" texture showcased by Aircos, obtained from its IPM technology. – Alkos' Sixties Addict Eyeline Marker, a waterproof long-lasting eyeliner with various shapes of applicator tips: fine, brush-shapped or slanted. – Ancorotti's back injected poured powders, for a sensually and tasty make-up. – Bomo Trendline's new ""Grand Eyeliner"" water-resistant and paraben-free eyeliner formula and its various applicators. – Cosmogen's new dual function applicator, Firm'Up. – HCP's new Magnum range of lipstick, blusher and eyeshadow packs, using anodized aluminium and trendy coloured plastic trims. – ICC ""No Tox Remover"", an odour-free nail-polish remover formulated without the use of standard solvents. – Oekabeauty's new mascara brushes. – Sleever International's Slever Make Up solution, with its wide range of colours and its 3D and glossy effects. – The laser etching technology showcased by Leoplast, which consists in removing material instead of adding it, thus enabling fine designs and decorations on any part of the pack."
New dates for Cosmopack and expansion prospects for Cosmoprof,"Premium Beauty News - What is your assessment on the last edition of Cosmoprof, which was held last March in Bologna? Duccio Campagnoli - We were happy about what we consider a very positive result. The fair hosted new exhibitors and welcomed a lot of additional visitors, in particular from outside Italy (+22% compared to 2012). Considering the current economic situation in Europe, that was good news. Cosmoprof Worldwide, which is held annually in Bologna, Italy, is the most important trade platform for the beauty industry and a global hub for the European, Asian and North American markets. Just considers that 69% of the exhibitors - 1,600 out of 2,300 - come from foreign countries. This unrivalled globalisation is the show's main strength. Another important asset is the Cosmoprof brand itself. Cosmoprof is famous worldwide as the oldest and most important event for the cosmetics industry. Whatever their main interest, beauty industry insiders know they will find what they are looking for among the variety of product categories and sectors that are showcased under one roof at Cosmoprof, which hosts several shows in the shows: for packaging, hair products, natural beauty products, etc. Premium Beauty News - On the occasion of the last edition you reorganised Cosmopack entirely. What are your prospects about this part of the show? Duccio Campagnoli - As the rest of the show, Cosmopack is growing. We consider that this section, that is to say the halls dedicated to beauty packaging suppliers and equipment manufacturers, deserves a specific consideration. Therefore, we have decided to change the dates of this event so as it corresponds with the expectation of professional visitors. As a consequence, Cosmopack will open and close two days earlier the rest of the show. Actually, Cosmopack will be held from the 2nd to the 5th of April 2014, while the rest of Cosmoprof Worldwide will open its doors from the 4th to the 7th of April 2014. This change corresponds to a strong demand from most exhibitors and many visitors. Actually, the policy of many European companies is not to ask the staff to travel on weekends. As a consequence, the attendance of Cosmopack was really decreasing on Sundays and exhibitors were considering it as a waste of time. We also think the new dates will help visitors to better organise their stay in Bologna. Furthermore, the next edition of Cosmopack will be increasingly focused on R&D and innovation, with more conferences and technical workshops. Eventually, we are also extending our Buyers Programme to better cover the packaging sector. Premium Beauty News - What about Cosmoprof North America, which will open its doors next July 14-16 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas? Duccio Campagnoli - With about 900 exhibitors, the next edition of Cosmoprof North America will be the biggest ever. The show will host two new collective participations from Spain and Turkey, in addition to the ones of Brazil, China, Colombia, Italy, Korea and Taiwan that were already there last year. We are very happy with our partnership with Pro Beauty Association (PBA), which provide us with a prominent position in the industry. This show aims at becoming a more general platform for the industry, in particular through the development of the packaging sector. There are strong opportunities in this area. Indeed, there is no tradeshow in the U.S. that really addresses the need of the largest variety of beauty packaging suppliers. Premium Beauty News - There are currently three Cosmoprof shows in the world. In the past, Cosmoprof was in Brazil, and made some attempts in Russia and in Turkey. What are your development priorities? Duccio Campagnoli - With our three shows, we are serving the needs of a large part of the global beauty industry. Cosmoprof Asia is the world's second beauty tradeshow, ranking just after Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna. However, we keep looking for other opportunities, in particular in Asia. Bologna Fiere has opened a sales office in Shanghai."

""The evolution of the makeup market strongly supports us, with an increasing reliance on outsourcing and full service, which is precisely the positioning of the show,"" says Jean-Yves Bourgeois, co-creator of MakeUp in Paris."
Marionnaud launches private label makeup brand and refurbishes Paris flagship store,"In order to address the new expectations of quickly changing customers, Marionnaud continues to build on in-store purchase experience; the retailer considering outlets as ""the main capital place for customer relationship."" With more than 1,100 outlets in eleven countries, Marionnaud is one of the leading European retailers of selective perfumes and cosmetics. In France, Marionnaud runs a fleet of 545 outlets, of which more than 200 have been completely refurbished as part of a large renovation program to be completed in 2015. At the halfway point of this huge effort, Marionnaud has launched the transformation of its Champs-Elysées store in Paris. The works, which began just after Mother's Day are expected to end in November 2013. The sales area will be increased from 500 to 600 m2, in particular through the creation of a mezzanine entirely dedicated to makeup. The new store, which will be clearer and more luxurious, will also host of new brands, especially niche perfumes. But the main purpose is to extend the range of services: makeup bar, manicure and nail care, etc.. According to Marionnaud, the Champs-Elysees store will be decorated with typical Parisian architectural features so as to become a symbol of French style luxury. The customer circulation will be simplified in order to provide opportunities to test and experiment and, when necessary, to get high quality sales assistance by a trained and multilingual staff. Furthermore, ""the store's sales team will double to 80 people in November."" These recruitments are a prerequisite to ""the improvement of the staff's current specific professional skills (fragrance experts, makeup artists, beauticians and international profiles,"" said Vocy Bloch, Director of the Champs-Elysées project. For Marionnaud, the Champs Elysees avenue is strategic, both in terms of turnover and in terms of image. Opened 7 days a week from 10 am to midnight, the Marionnaud store located at number 104 is group's the first point of sales regarding the number of customers than the sales volume, it welcomes a mostly (54%) international clientele. Most of clients are from abroad. Despite these heavy investments in outlets, Marionnaud carries on a careful exploration of synergies between on-line and street boutiques. ""Today, over 60% of our clients consult our website before heading to an outlet, it is an unavoidable dimension of the purchasing act,"" said William G. Koeberlé, Co-Executive Director at Marionnaud France. Moreover, the e-boutique even became the group's second outlet. Thus, the retailer completely revised its online sales strategy and is launching a new website featuring new applications in September. Among the innovations that are announced: a click & collect feature will allow customers to buy online and then to choose a store where picking up the product, and a store-to-door service will allow them order references that are not available in their store and to be delivered at home. According to Marionnaud, proximity also implies to be able to offer enough accessible products. The retailer therefore carries on developing its private label brand and is launching its first line of makeup. The short range (13 products, for the face, the eyes, the lips and a makeup remover) of the spring-summer collection 2013 thus completes the branded offering."
Natural Cosmetics: A first successful event in London,"Although the UK market of organic and natural beauty products is one of the most developed in the world, due to its very special structure, it is still poorly known by continental brands in this sector, most of whom are SMEs. ""Our goal is to offer exhibitors and visitors a broader view of the organic and natural cosmetic expertise through a wide variety of exhibitors and a program of educational conferences to develop branding, networks, regulatory knowledge, and all other aspects, which are needed to create and market one's brand of organic and natural cosmetics,"" said to Premium Beauty News Philippe Gelin, managing director and co-founder of Shorex, the organizer of the exhibition. For its first edition, the show hosted 70 exhibitors, among which suppliers of raw materials or essential oils ( Cassan, Maharishi, Statfold, etc..), contract manufacturers ( N & B, Alban Muller, etc.), but also brands specialised in finished products for make-up, cosmetics and perfumery (Zao, Unica Cosmetics, BellàPierre, Luxsit, Neal's Yard, etc..). The main institutional actors (like the Soil Association, Ecocert Cosmebio, Natrue, CTPA) also significantly contributed to the conference program. With 4,388 visitors (retailers, importers, distributors, pharmacies, beauty therapists, beauticians, spas...), the organizers consider also positively the outcome of the show. To attract as many professionals as possible, The Organic & Natural Beauty Show partnered with Natural Health, the number one wellness magazine in the UK, for the ""Natural Health Beauty Awards"" – which reward for the past 6 years the best natural and organic beauty products available on the UK market – to be organised during the event. ""We've added six categories to single out distributors and retailers, in particular Department Stores, beauty salons or spas,"" emphasised Gelin. As a result, the challenge of facilitating the access to the British market also appears to have been reached. ""Some of our customers told us they had already found a distributor in the UK following their participation"", said Gelin. Several exhibitors confirmed to Premium Beauty News that they had met a large number of distributors, agents or UK importers at their stand, although others said they were disappointed by the modest size of the show even if they agree on the fact that the organization of a first edition is always very challenging. Hence, the atmosphere was very positive at the stand of the Norwegian company Maya Water, where officials said they were very satisfied with the number of distributors who showed a keen interest in the brand. ""Now we just need to turn these opportunities into real markets, but we are very encouraged by the success we encountered in London"", said Maya Gulbrandsen. ""We were indeed the only brand to showcase misters and it certainly worked in our favour,"" she said. Concretely, this translates for the organizers into promises from exhibitors to take part to the next edition, which will be held on 1 and 2 June 2014. ""Our goal now is clearly to grow in size and pass the 100 exhibitor mark as of next year,"" concluded Gelin. Luxsit, the Swedish brand founded in 2007, wanted to participate to The Organic & Natural Beauty Show to enter the UK market which is, according to Maria Boström, Artistic Director, ""the most developed and exciting one in the world."" With fully biodegradable components, the brand intends to be soft to the skin and the environment. Mainly focused on hydration, Luxsit (""Let there be light"" in Latin) has designed a black packaging, to associate a luxury and trendy image to its products, and uses clear and bright symbols in contrast. The brand has its own factory in Stockholm and uses ingredients coming mostly from the Swedish flora. It offers care creams for the face, body and hair and will be launching soon its BB Cream. Mostly distributed in Spas, Luxsit has just signed a contract with the W Verbier Hotel in Switzerland, which will be opening in December 2013. Zao MakeUp, a young French make-up brand created in January 2012. The concept is based on silica from bamboo, for its properties promoting skin elasticity. The brand has taken the concept of environmental protection, one step further by providing a wide range of refillable packagings, from lipsticks to cream foundations and will soon be launching its line of nail polishes."
"Women and their body in France, China and Russia","Ifop interviewed a panel of more than 8,000 women in France, China and Russia, to determine what they consider as the most important parts of their body, what are the ones they like the least, and the ones for which they would be willing to spend more. ""The findings of this study help to explain some underlying trends, such as the dramatic increase of cosmetic surgery in China,"" says Laure Friscourt, Director of the Consumer-Beauty Department of the Ifop group. ""They also bring to light real business and innovation opportunities, for instance regarding hair care products in Russia."" The Ifop study also shows that in the three countries, the face is considered as the most important part of the body by 60% of women. However, while 42% of French and 35% of Russian women consider hair as a priority, Chinese women consider it is minor concern. Additionally, more Chinese women than French and Russian say they are willing to spend more for the various parts of their body: 58% would spend more for their belly, 40% for their breasts and, above all, one Chinese woman out of four is willing to spend more for her face."
Skincare: premium brands that French women prefer,"Having selected 13 premium skincare brands available in France (Biotherm, Chanel, Clarins, Clinique, Dior, Estee Lauder, Givenchy, Guerlain, Lancome, La Prairie, Shiseido-Clé de Peau, YSL), Promise Consulting Inc. has calculated their ""index of desirability"" [1] and their reputation. The study was conducted on a nationally representative sample of 1,012 women aged 18 and over, between 19 and 23 April 2013. Three brands, Chanel (50%), Clarins (46%) and Dior (44%) top the survey. Being luxury fashion brands, Chanel and Dior (LVMH) know how to make French women dreaming - for instance by enrolling charismatic female celebrities (e.g. Anne Hathaway or Vanessa Paradis for Chanel) as spokesmodels. However, they also succeeded in developing credible scientific and technical approaches, both brands communicating extensively about their R&D efforts and investments: for instance, the opening by Chanel, of a new research centre nearby Paris last year, hosting about 200 researchers under one roof, or the construction by Dior of a new research centre near Orleans for about 30 million euros. In this context, the performance of Clarins, that ranks second, is particularly impressive since this independent brand has to cope with competitors belonging to much larger cosmetic groups. According to Promise Consulting Inc., Clarins enjoys the benefit of its ""technical know-how and also of its flawless reputation among women,"" as shown by its notoriety index (98%), which is the highest of the study. Ranking in fourth position, Lancôme (41%), the luxury brand belonging to the L'Oreal group, also relies on the work of many researchers, and is now trying to create a direct relationship with its customers, in particular through its website and its YouTube page. Guerlain, another iconic French luxury brand, ranks fifth (34%) on par with Clinique. Founded in 1828, the LVMH group brand relies on almost two centuries of history but also on a strong technical expertise, in particular in the field of cell regeneration. At the ninth position, Biotherm (20%) seems to lag behind. Based on the benefits of Pyrenean thermal waters the brand addresses the needs of a smaller and older core target, which nevertheless remains significant in a highly competitive market. ""However, says Promise Consulting Inc., without a spokesmodel, the brand will have difficulties to compete with luxury brands at the top of the podium."" ""The market is structured into two major poles: luxury on the one side, where prestigious houses use their notoriety and image to provide comprehensive skin care ranges at the forefront of innovation (Chanel, Dior, Guerlain, Lancome). Specialist brands, on the other side, such a Clinique, which provide the assurance of their medical knowledge and state-of-the-art R&D,"" says Professor Philippe Jourdan, founding partner of Promise Consulting Inc. / On the Web Panel."
Beautyworld Middle East rides on a dynamic and premiumising market,"With 23 international pavilions this year and a 32% increase in the number of exhibitors over the previous edition - 1,096 exhibitors from 52 countries participating this year as compared with 829 in 2012 - Beautyworld Middle East's continued expansion underlines the vast potential of the regional market for beauty products. According to Euromonitor International, the per capita spend on personal care in the United Arab Emirates is set to reach 1,170 dirahms (AED) this year and grow to 1282 dirahms (268.4 euros or 348.9 dollars) by 2017, 13% increase compared to 2012. However, this average hides strong disparities, in particular a very high level of consumption for the 10% richest. Regarding Saudi Arabia, Euromonitor International forecasts that strong economic growth and a further increase in disposable income levels will boost sales in beauty and personal care by 5.8% by 2017. ""The attractiveness of the region also lies in the different emerging countries that surround it, including Iran for perfumes, Pakistan for skincare,"" says Philippe Durieux, area sales manager at Gerresheimer. The most advanced markets, in particular the United Arab Emirates, also benefit from the growing interest in specialised products and premium brands driven. ""With a multitude of brands already in the market, customers are very choosy about what they use. Niche brands are doing well, with the market growing to accommodate more of them and customers taking an increased liking to what's different,"" explains Mohammed Abdul Rahim Al Fahim, CEO of Paris Gallery Group of Companies. This is especially true for fragrances, with a market expected to reach US$ 33.4 million in 2016, in the United Arab Emirates alone. It is therefore quite logical that Epoc Messe Frankfurt, the organiser of Beautyworld Middle East partnered with Elements Showcase, the New York event specialised in niche and high end fragrances and cosmetics, to enable a series of emerging brands to showcase their products in Dubai. ""Dubai is the perfect intersection of buyers and media from Europe, Asia, and, of course, the Middle East,"" says Frederick Bouchardy, Elements co-founder. Among the participating brands: Cire Trudon, Illuminum, Bond No. 9, Yosh, Atelier Flou, Mona di Orio, État Libre d'Orange, Rouge Bunny Rouge, etc. The rise of niche fragrance brands in the Middle East is the consistent continuation of the traditional importance of scented products in the region. According to Euromonitor International, the per capita spend on fragrances in the United Arab Emirates is expected to reach AED 128 (USD 34.90) in 2017. This is 90% more than that of the US, which is only expected to reach USD 18.40 in 2017. This expected to market be worth approximately AED 1.13 billion (236.5 million euros or 307 million dollars), in the UAE alone. ""It is a key market, with a strong local manufacturing and from time to time a quest for excellence that can result in peak prices,"" confirms François-Patrick Sabater, CEO of Technicoflor, a French supplier of perfumery ingredients and compositions. No surprise in such conditions that perfumery is the main sector at Beautyworld Middle East and that it continues growing. ""Many customers create their own compositions,"" says Viginie Gervason, Marketing Manager Ingredients at Firmenich. ""There are of course a lot of demands that are specific to this market: oud, wood or rose notes."" Of course, the local market is not limited to perfumery. Many exhibitors from the makeup sector have noted the growing demand in the region, in particular in Iran. ""There also a clear trend towards the creation of makeup private label brands by retailers,"" observes My Driss Drissi, B. Kolormakeup & Skincare."
Nose licences its olfactive profiling technology,"The olfactive diagnosis created by Nose, the Parisian concept-store specialised in alternative perfumery and cosmetic brands, is now proposed in a license approach on digital tablets (iPad) to other high quality retailers around the world. Skins Cosmetics will be the first retail stores to rollout this technology outside France. In a first step, two stores in Amsterdam will begin using the Nose perfume recommendation technology: Skins Cosmetics Runstraat (Runstraat 11, 1016 GJ Amsterdam) and Skins Cosmetics het Conservatorium Hotel (Van Baerlestraat 27, 1071 AN Amsterdam). Skins Cosmetics is a Dutch retailer specialized in niche cosmetic brands with 11 stores across The Netherlands and a carefully selected collection of renowned brands such as Creed, Diptyque, Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle, Maison Francis Kurdjian, Byredo, etc. Two and a half years have been needed for Nose to launch, on June 2012, a unique perfume recommendation technology, which aims to help anyone to find the perfect fragrance for oneself or for a relative. Built from thousands of perfumes qualified one by one by a team of very senior perfumers, it also leverages a very robust statistical algorithm. ""The Nose diagnosis helps you find new fragrances through a short survey of seven questions on your profile and your existing and past perfumes. You can then access your 'olfactive portrait' (favorite scent families/notes), from which you will discover five recommended perfumes that suit your preferences. You will then be asked to evaluate each fragrance so that your 'olfactive portrait' always gets updated, with 5 newer recommended perfumes,"" says the retailer in a release. This service was first implemented at the Nose outlet in Paris to boost in-store perfume advisor knowledge and help customers find their perfect fragrance. About 30,000 perfume diagnoses in less than a year. This tool is really at the centre of the Nose concept and of its first concept store that opened in Paris in June 2012 from a team of seven beauty professionals and enthusiasts (Nicolas Cloutier, Silvio Levi, Romano Ricci, Mark Buxton...)."
Recreated historical French fragrances attract the attention of Chinese media,"The archives of the Palace of Versailles, the principal residence of French kings from the time of Louis XIV to Louis XVI, retain a series of fragrance formulas developed in the 17th and 18th centuries by the perfumers of the King of France. The company Conservatoire Français des Fragrances et Cosmétiques (CFFC) has been is the only fragrance developer to have obtained the right to use these formulas and market them under license. The perfumes have been recomposed with antique natural flavours but also with contemporary synthetic molecules to create a range of perfumes directly inspired from this time: the Parfums du Château de Versailles. Many Chinese media hailed their arrival on the local market and Chinese netizens have been very curious about them. The profession of perfumer was recognized at the beginning of the reign of Louis XIV, who bore a passion for perfumes, which he inherited his mother's taste. Perfumery was definitely one of the jewels of French refinement during the ""Grand Siecle"" (the 17th century and more precisely the period covering the reigns of Louis XIII, 1601-1643, and Louis XIV, 1638-1715) and the heyday of Versailles, where its development has been staggering. Indeed, for the first time, in the early 17th century, the profession of perfumer was granted an official title: ""Maître gantier et parfumeur"" (""Master perfumer and glovemaker""). The heyday of the Court of Versailles thus marks the rise of French perfumery, thanks to lavish ceremonies of King Louis XIV and his court, and their political and cultural influence throughout Europe. The Château de Versailles is one of the most visited monuments in the world, and its gardens, halls and art galleries welcome every year many Chinese tourists. The association between fragrances and this monument seems very well received by Chinese consumers, especially as they are very fond of brand's story-telling. Thus, the launch in China the Parfums du Château de Versailles has been an opportunity for the Chinese to debate in the media and the internet about the relevancy of a historical comparison between the French monarchy and the last Chinese imperial dynasty. ""The Chinese people are very sensitive to the history and quality of the products from France. We are very confident on the perception of professionals and the general public on this new product,"" says Michel Patrice, historian and Director / General Manager at CFFC."
Pack & Gift: towards an expanded edition in 2013,"With about 3,000 expected visitors, the 2013 edition of the Pack & Gift tradeshow looks promising, according to the organizers. ""After five years of existence, PACK & GIFT has found its niche with a unique concept and relevant positioning enabling promotion and customer loyalty specialists to offer brands a range of exclusive packaging solutions, promotional gifts, and CRM,"" they say. The show, which will be held on the 12th and 13th of June 2013 at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, will host 250 exhibitors (compared to 225 last year), including presentation pack manufacturers, samples, POS, promotional item distributors, specialists in printing, finishing, and CRM, and also advertising and design agencies. Back in Pack & Gift this year, the Pack & Gift World Tour exhibit, organized in cooperation with Jean Jacques Evrard, Pentawards founder, was conceived as a travel around the world's most original event-based packages found these last few months in China, Japan, Europe and the USA. This year, Pack & Gift creates a new trend and innovation animation titled: "" Pack & Gift Trends - Material, colour, usage, eco-design"". A dedicated area will present future trends illustrated by the most telling exhibitors' innovations in terms of materials, colours, usages and eco-design. The organisers have entrusted Thema Design, an advisory agency in the fields of innovation, marketing and communication, for selecting exhibitors' innovations and to showcase them according to the material, colour and usage trends, identified in its monitoring activity. In order to complete this analysis, Thema-Design will host a conference on the theme: ""Materials, sensations and emotions: prospective landmarks"" on Wednesday, June 12 at 1.30pm. This year, Pack & Green exhibition and competition, dedicated to eco-conceived innovations will be part of the Pack & Gift Trends exhibition. An exhibition area will provide exhibitors with an opportunity to showcase their latest designs and innovations aimed at reducing the environmental impact of promotional packages. Along with the exhibition, the Pack & Green Award will honour the most sustainable packaging solution, both in terms of design, materials used and in terms of production process, transportation, product usage, not to mention the end of its life. The jury members [1] will assess the products according to the criteria and coefficients of the Pack & Green 2013 charter, given to each participant. The final deliberations in the presence of all jury members will be held during the fair, on Wednesday, the 12th of June, in the afternoon. The program of conferences at this 6th edition of the event attempts to cover a wide scope of issues: from packaging including QR codes to the constraints of packaging design for the travel retail, including a semiotic approach to packaging, the legal protection of packaging and gifts, as well as customer relationship management. Jean Watin Augouard, brand culture advisor and editor in chief of the Revue des Marques, Jean-Jacques Evrard, founder of the Pentawards, Catherine Meunier Losson, Head of marketing and sales development for High Co sales, Gwenaëlle de Kerret Director of qualitative and semiology studies at Harris Interactive or Henri Saporta, editor in chief of Emballages Magazine are amongst the experts that will participate in the various round tables together with representatives of brands such as: Brasserie de Bretagne, Motta, William Saurin, Pernod Ricard, Lascad L'Oréal."
Global luxury market to grow by 4 to 6 % annually through 2015,"Global luxury goods market grew by 10 percent in 2012 (at current exchange rates) and now tops 200 billion euros, according to consulting firm Bain & Company [1]. The market will continue to grow as much as 50 percent faster than global GDP, with an expectation of four to five percent growth in 2013 and five to six percent annual average through 2015, on track to break the 250 billion sales threshold by mid-decade. According to Bain's spring update of the ""Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study"" conducted with Italian luxury trade body Altagamma, growth should remain sluggish in Europe this year, rising by a maximum of 2 percent, compared with 3% in 2012, at constant currency. Actually, Europeans, especially in southern Europe, are curtailing spending, while tourists from the USA, Asia and the Middle East are changing their habits, seeking out new destinations (e.g. Dubai, South East Asia, Australia) and showing more savvy in the items they purchase. Chinese tourists, in particular, are reducing their purchases in Europe due to narrowing price gaps with goods at home. As far as Asia is concerned, Bain says that the growth of luxury sales in China is stabilizing to an expected seven percent, keeping pace with GDP. In parallel, Hong Kong and Macau benefit from the shift in mainland's tourist flows previously targeting Europe. Regarding, South East Asia, Bain expects a 20 percent growth driven by a wave of new store openings, and increasing strength and relevance of second-tier markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Japan is returning to a strong growth story of five percent as the country's monetary policy depreciates the yen and boosts the economy and local consumption while discouraging travels abroad. High consumer confidence among the affluent, increased store openings in American cities, and intensive investment in linking physical and digital shopping are all fueling United States sales growth. Combined with the strong growth of sales (+12%) across Central and South America (notably Brazil and Mexico), this positive environment will result in overall growth of five to seven percent in the Americas. Argentina, however, continues to conduct economic policies that impediment the development of the luxury market, which should grow at a limited 0.3% rate. Eventually, Middle East is growing at a steady pace, with Dubai continuing as the centre of gravity and the only city attracting foreign luxury consumers (e.g. Russians, Indians, Africans). ""We are seeing a more even distribution of global growth,"" said Claudia D'Arpizio, a Bain partner in Milan and lead author of the study. ""In turn, brands are refocusing from short term, reactive hot spot thinking to long-term sustained growth strategies."" Over the long term, Bain estimates that the global luxury goods market in 2025 will likely be more than five times larger than it stood in 1995. ""We are entering a new phase in the evolution of the luxury market,"" concluded D'Arpizio. ""More markets, more segments, and more diversity of tastes all combine to create more variables to solve for when pursuing the right strategy for growth."""
"Cosmetics packaging market to grow in 2013 despite uncertainties, says report","Visiongain forecasts [1] that the demand in emerging markets will boost unit volumes and that the premiumisation trend in developed markets will also contribute to deliver strong growth in the cosmetics packaging market, which will reach a value of 25.23 billion U.S. dollars (about 19.41 billion euros) in 2013. ""Premiumisation of cosmetics and the anti-aging trend in developed markets is expected to increase the value of the cosmetics packaging markets, as cosmetics packaging becomes more innovative and expensive. Strong growth is expected to emerge from emerging and developing markets where consumers increasingly demand more of non-essential cosmetics products,"" Visiongain comments. While the increase in premium packaging in cosmetics markets can be partly explained by the aging of developed societies, other consumer trends also drive growth: the environmental trend, which is heightening the demand for environmentally friendly materials, and the rise of male grooming that boost the demand for particularly facial skincare and hair care packaging. Innovative techniques and integrated applicators, which are used to excite consumers in the increasingly crowded cosmetics markets, also contribute to the rise. As far as the growth in emerging markets is concerned, the demand for cosmetic products is driven by higher income levels and the ascension of the middle class and professional occupations. ""Appearance is becoming more important, and as consumers grow wealthier they are able to afford products previously seen as unattainable luxuries,"" says the market research firm. However, there are also impediments to the market growth. According to Visiongain, the main constraints of the cosmetics packaging market are the still-lingering effects of the global financial crisis and the doubts created by the current euro-zone problems. ""Reduced consumer and producer confidence restricts cosmetics packaging growth as consumers reduce purchases,"" the firm explains. In such a context, some cosmetics packaging sectors are likely to maintain relatively good positions even during financial crises. ""Products such as hair care or facial skincare are widely seen as essential, and will be in demand regardless of the economic conditions. However, the less essential product sectors, such as decorative cosmetics, nail care or fragrances, are likely to take the impact of any double-dips on the horizon,"" analyses Visiongain. Fluctuating raw material and energy prices are further factors potentially constraining the cosmetics packaging market growth, making cosmetics packaging more expensive and reducing profits."
Cosmetics and food: cross border trends,"""We have entered a hybrid society. By combining their information sources, drawing on many influences to satisfy their desires, consumers tend to question traditional segmentations,"" said Leila Rochet-Podvin, director and founder of Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation and co-author of the study [1]. In a context, marked by the rapid, and sometimes contradictory, evolution of consumers' needs and desires, brands seeking innovation must open up their eyes as much as consumers do. The two agencies have completed their reflections by many examples of innovative products and retail concepts illustrating the numerous cross-references between food and cosmetics. For instance, they highlight the use of common ingredients or common references to the purity and benefits of certain waters as well as the power of the marine world. Food and cosmetics have also come together to praise sugar, but also fresh and local products, and even sensuality. On this basis, Leila Rochet-Podvin and Béatrice de Reynal suggest following ten trends that are likely to have a strong influence on these two sectors in 2013. The first two trends (GRIN'IFIC and iControl) refer to the increasing penetration of technology, science and information in the daily lives of consumers. The rise of homo numericus is also reflected in the consumer's desire to seize power and become a strategist of its own personal affirmation and desires. The following two trends (Senstory Gamers and Hyperlife & SuperStress) highlight the quest for higher aspirations, customization, and calm in parallel to accelerating bulimic lives, with multiple sides and fully interconnected. The fifth (Clean & Pure) and sixth (Healthy) trends are two complementary sides of the same search for well-being and health, with in the one hand, the desire to preserve oneself from any source of poisoning, and a strong willingness to detoxify oneself, and in the other hand, the search for wellness and health, the willingness to feel good in one's body, the quest for a new balance between health and beauty, as well as assumed healthy ageing. The next three trends reflect the major global economic and demographic changes. The rise of Asia results in a sort of Eastward rush, with the growing influence of Far Eastern fashion and lifestyle, including Japan and Korea. ""What happened with BB Creams will not remain an isolated case,"" sayid Leila Rochet-Podvin. ""Consumers in Europe and North America are increasingly sensitive to the ancestral values and roots of Chinese culture, even if they reject the current outrageous consumerism of the country,"" she added. Similarly, the increasing proportion of seniors in several societies (today almost 1 in 10 people are over 60 years old, by 2050 1 in 5 people will be over 60) and the growing ethnic diversity of populations should encourage brands to change the way they address these two issues. Eventually, Sustainably True, the tenth and final trend identified by the two agencies, continues the organic and natural trend but with an increased demand for transparency, stronger attention to communities and to the origin of products and their human signature. The resources of the planet are still perceived as exhaustible, but consumers have grown increasingly suspicious towards greenwashing practices and they demand more concrete actions. To be noted also, a rise of sustainability concerns among luxury brands. In conclusion, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation and NutriMarketing recommend putting consumers at the centre of the innovation process, to enable them to resume a meaningful purchase, allowing to express themselves, to realize their personality (""upgrade the ego ""), but also to provide them with a really attractive value (""desirable benefit""), while reintroducing the emotional dimension of the shopping experience (""re-enchant ""). ""This is more or less for brands to return to common sense and the courage to assume their role in society rather than talk about it, in short to achieve the role of the one who will shape its market,"" said the two authors of the study."
Euromonitor warns about the overuse of multi-functionality claims,"Euromonitor's Global Head of Beauty and Personal Care Research, Irina Barbalova, and Beauty and Personal Care Analyst, Nicole Tyrimou discussed how 2012 was another year of strong performance for the beauty industry despite economic uncertainty and cautious consumer spending. The premium segment sustained its growth levels and continued to be driven by skin care and dynamic innovation in anti-ageing. After a spectacular year in 2011, North America still managed to achieve close to 6% increase in premium value in 2012, according to Euromonitor data. ""Total industry growth bettered that of the previous year and reached pre-recession levels. Despite the strong performance of the premium cosmetics category, overall growth was boosted by mass cosmetics globally, with positive prospects shown by staple categories such as oral care, deodorants, and hair care,"" said Barbalova. ""Hair care is experiencing a transformation and is increasingly inspired by skin care in terms of ingredients, as well as adopting a similar multi-step routine approach to hair treatment."" Euromonitor's latest research also shows leading beauty companies are taking a more holistic view on products. This has also been driven by consumer demand becoming more complex in their expectations of product performance and benefits. ""Anti-ageing is increasingly being associated with a wider portfolio of benefits. Moisturisation and sun protection are now expected in every product, thus added value has gone far beyond that,"" explains Nicole Tyrimou. ""There is a greater alignment with enhancing the skin, rather than just treating wrinkles. Many of the new claims are about evening skin tone, brightening, illuminating and smoothing properties,"" added Tyrimou. Multifunctional products are becoming mainstream, most epitomised by the BB and CC creams phenomenon. At the same time, the need for more personalised solutions and products targeting specific concerns are presenting further scope for innovation in this area. According to Euromonitor, while multiple benefits are important even in targeted products, the overuse of multi-functionality and the BB/CC labelling of products could result in the blurring of the actual benefits and thus the ultimate brand credentials. ""There seems to be room for both of these divergent trends. While both targeted and multi-functional products are equally sought after by consumers, the need for preserving and promoting the specialised features of a product should remain key. Consumers need to be able to relate to a product that provides them a solution for their individual needs,"" concludes Irina Barbalova."
Makeup: premium brands that French women prefer,"For this eighth edition, beyond the index of desirability [1] of premium makeup brands, Promise Consulting Inc. also measured brands' awareness. The study was conducted from 19 to 23 April 2013 on a nationally representative sample of 1,012 people aged 18 and over. Chanel (57%), Dior (49%) and Yves Saint Laurent (11%) are the three leading brands. With a score of 57%, Chanel overcomes all competitors in this study. ""If this legendary brand knows how to rock the heart of French women, it is due to its DNA, which is the epitome of French luxury and elegance but also to more than a century-long history. More than a brand, Chanel is part of the national cultural heritage,"" says Promise Consulting Inc. in a release. Furthermore, the brand has made relevant strategic and marketing choices, whether regarding its faces or regarding new product developments inspired from the most glamorous moments of the movie industry. With a score of 49%, Dior is on Chanel's heels. The flagship brand of the LVMH group, which will celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2016, also capitalizes on its history. This spring, the brand has chosen to pay tribute to pink, one of the favorite colours of designer Christian Dior. Dior is also putting great emphasis on innovation in particular with the ""Lip Glow Dior Addict Dior Chérie Bow Edition,"" a gloss that reacts to the moisture rate in lips; a highly relevant R&D axis since hydration is one of women's main cosmetic concerns. Yves Saint Laurent Beauty (42%) ranks third. As a part of the L'Oréal group since 2008, the brand has developed ""a powerful and consistent marketing strategy that is carefully implemented over time."" With a score of 41%, Lancôme ranks fourth. The brand, owned by L'Oreal since almost 50 years, now wants to create a relationship with its customers, in particular through the use of its website and YouTube page. The brand with the famous rose thus offers a page devoted to makeup tutorials, a kind of tribute to the ""do it yourself"" trend that drives the blogosphere. Then Guerlain comes next (39%). The brand of the LVMH group offers real bestsellers such as the ""Terracotta"" powder, the ""rouge G"" for the lips, the ""Météorites"" pearly or compact powder, or the ""kohl"" pencil for the eyes… ""While haute couture cosmetic brands allow French women to get access to their share of the luxury world, a number of women want to associate skincare and beauty during a cosmetic purchase,"" says Promise Consulting Inc. Thus, Clarins (40%) ranks 5th in the study and Clinique (25%), ranks seventh. Makeup specialist brands, aiming at more expert customers, achieve lower scores in this study. For instance, Make Up For Ever (5%) only ranks in the 10th position, with the lowest brand awareness level (77%). According Promise Consulting Inc., ""Make Up For Ever is nonetheless a cosmetic company with a high growth potential."" Acquired by LVMH in 1999, this makeup pure player, which was originally dedicated to the entertainment worlds, now addresses the general public through the notoriety of its Artistic Director, Dany Sanz, a reference in the makeup microcosm. ""In addition to luxury brands that draw their legitimacy from their image in the ready-to-wear fashion and perfume businesses, as well as in the high quality of their products, skin care brands are betting on the clear synergy with their proven expertise in the field of hydration, in anti-aging and in the correction of the skin's imperfections. Eventually, professional makeup brands have been able to stand out thanks to the personality of their creators or art directors and an unconventional and uninhibited conception of makeup,"" concludes Prof. Philippe Jourdan, founding partner of Promise Consulting Inc. and Panel On the Web."
"US personal care market ripe for acquisitions, sees Kline","Both key and niche industry players are meeting significant sales success in the U.S. personal care market, according to a recently published report Cosmetics & Toiletries USA [1] by Kline & Company. ""Procter & Gamble (P&G) maintains its lead in the U.S. personal care market; however, its market share across multiple categories is being challenged. With the exception of P&G, major companies - in particular, L'Oréal and Estée Lauder - are enjoying steady growth. Of particular note, smaller companies are making strong headway and highly viable impressions,"" notes Kline. However, the consulting and research firm considers it is at the macro level that the flourishing personal care market is offering the most promise. ""Within the presently fertile merger and acquisition climate, smaller companies are increasingly attractive acquisition prospects by larger, cashed-up, and savvy players,"" says Kline. As a telling example, earlier this year, L'Oréal's CEO Jean-Paul Agon announced that he was ready to make important acquisitions to maintain growth, and this has already been borne out by the recent acquisition of Interconsumer Products, one of Kenya's largest manufacturers of personal care and beauty products. ""Clearly, companies continue to emphasize growth agendas and make significant funding available – both strategic and financial sponsors – to realize such aspirations. Such an improving environment is increasingly attractive for merger and acquisition and a growing number of smaller, often privately held, cosmetic and toiletry companies are contemplating, developing, and/or executing exits. As such, 2013 portends to offer even greater deal flow as many companies look to invest in new growth opportunities,"" remarks Eric Vogelsberg, Senior Vice President at Kline's M&A Advisory. Thus Kline's Minor Companies chapter from the Cosmetics & Toiletries USA report, consisting of almost 150 profiles of smaller and especially dynamic cosmetic and toiletry companies, reveals particularly promising companies that have been identified as positive net-value prospects and are also presently competing in segments that are expected to post higher-than-industry-average growth. Among the profiles are companies such as New York City-based Anthony Brands with the high potential for acquisition based on a solid presence in the male grooming market and a high level of innovative product launches. Similarly promising is Vogue International, a distributor of hair care and other personal care products in nearly 42 countries worldwide with a potential based on prolific R&D, mass brands with broad appeal and a recognized name. In terms of the overall cosmetics and toiletries market performance, the nail polishes category claims the most success, shining with 17.4% growth, fueled by continual innovation and high consumer demand. Additionally, skin care products for men show a strong performance in 2012, gaining formidable traction with innovative brands such as Lab Series Skincare for Men by Estée Lauder and Anthony Logistics For Men by Anthony Brands, performing exceptionally well and posting double-digit growth."
Can natural cosmetics break through the green glass ceiling?,"According to the market research firm, ""a small group of consumers comprise most sustainable product sales, creating a glass ceiling to business growth."" For instance, organic food sales have been increasing at double-digit rates in the USA however they comprise just 4% of total food sales. In Europe, natural and organic personal care product sales have shown similar growth rates, yet they have just 3% market share. In Germany, where they hold the biggest share of the market, natural and organic cosmetics account for 6.5% of the market, not more. Similarly, concentration of demand would explain the low market shares of fair trade products, ethical textiles and many other sustainable products. Marketing appears to be the solution. Indeed, brands that can successfully position themselves to attract broad consumer groups are breaking through the glass ceiling. In the food sector, Belgian firm Alpro is one such success story. After initially finding success with its organic soya dairy alternatives, the Alpro brand has been re-positioned to widen consumer appeal. It is marketed as a well-being brand, attracting health-conscious and ecological consumers, as well as those suffering from food allergies. Today, Alpro dominates the European functional foods and dairy alternatives market. Bio+ is another example. Since its launch in 2005, Bio+ has grown to become the leading organic brand in the Netherlands. Its popularity is because it is positioned as a lifestyle brand, with organic not the main proposition. It was the fastest growing brand in Dutch supermarkets in 2012, and ranked 39 in the Top 100 brands in the country. As far as the beauty sector is concerned, Aveda has been highly successful in the US with its professional range of natural personal care products. Launched in 1978 by Horst Rechelbacher when few consumers were aware of natural and organic products, Aveda products were marketed on their plant ingredients and performance. Like Alpro, Aveda leads in many areas of sustainability: it is the largest user of recycled plastic in the beauty industry and is one of the main buyers of organic essential oils in the world. Today, Aveda is the second leading hair salon brand in the US, with sales spread to almost every continent. Other organic brands, such as Hipp, Weleda and Green & Black's, have also gained a mainstream following because they have not focused on the green consumer segment. According to Organic Monitor, retailers are also widening consumer appeal for their ethical private labels. The Naturaplan brand of Coop Switzerland now comprises almost half of all organic food sales in the country. Sustainable products - including textiles and household cleaning products - have over 10% market share in Coop Switzerland stores. In Germany, DM drugstores have successfully positioned the Alverde brand of natural cosmetics; it is now the premier private label of certified natural cosmetics in Europe. According to Organic Monitor, its also because of its broad customer base that Whole Foods Market, the largest natural and organic food retailer, has been successful. ""Expanding the small green consumer segment will be fundamental to the long term growth of organic and sustainable product industries. In the interim, Organic Monitor advises brands to follow the pioneers and invest in marketing to reach out to new customers,"" concludes the market research firm. [1]"
Next edition of MakeUp in Paris is set to break new records,"MakeUp in Paris, the trade show dedicated to the makeup industry, continues to grow and will host 85 exhibitors on the occasion of its fourth edition on 20-21 June 2013 at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris. ""Growing from 65 to 85 exhibitors MakeUp in Paris 2013 is taking an important step not only in terms of the number of participants, but also in terms of representativeness,"" says the organizers. Once again, the show will take place in the rooms Souffot, Delorme and Gabriel at the Carrousel du Louvre, which totalize 3275 sqm gathering the exhibitors' stands, the entertainment areas, the conference room and the event's catering area. ""The increase in the number of exhibitors has led us to reorganise the floor plan to maximize space,"" says Sandra Maguarian, the show manager. A reorganization that has not been sufficient to meet all demands since, according to the organizers, six companies are still on a waiting list. ""We are considering all possibilities to find them a place, but it is unlikely that we can meet all demands,"" says Sandra Maguarian. As far as exhibitors are concerned, MakeUp in Paris is becoming more and more an international gathering of the makeup industry. French companies only represent 37% of exhibitors this year and the show is hosting exhibitors from 12 European countries - first and foremost Germany and Italy, and for the first time in Spain, Poland and Russia - but also from North and South America, Japan and Korea. Amon first time exhibitors are, for instance, AC Cosmétiques, Bao Sheng Corporation, Barbara Hoffman, Baralan, Bell, Chromavis, Confalioneri Matite, Cosmecca Korea, Dieter Bakic, Federico Ferrer, HCP, Leoplast, Toly, Yoshida, Shanghai Delviel Cosmetic, Cosmecca, Zignago Vetro.. For the first time ever, MakeUp in Paris opens its doors to ingredient suppliers, introducing a new area, MakeUPigments, where exhibitors and the visitors will be invited to didactic and sensory exhibitions and workshops. The first edition of MakeUPigments will host 3 partners: BASF, Laserson and Merck. ""MakeUp in Paris offers ingredient manufacturers the opportunity to express themselves in a way that differs from what they are used to and to target different audiences, including brand marketing teams,"" explains Jean-Yves Bourgeois, co-founder of the event As in previous years, the organizers continue to pay particular attention to the several animations that punctuate the two-day event. Thus, students from makeup schools and their models will participate twice a day to the MakeUp Parade. They will stage the exhibitors' products in the aisles of the show, among the exhibitors and visitors. In partnership with Schwan Cosmetics, Faber-Castell Cosmetics and Mobius & Ruppert, the MakeUp Painting area will offer visitors and exhibitors a funny, creative and recreational break to draw up the most beautiful makeup on a paper. MakeUp in Paris will also ask three young designers to design six decorative objects for the home, using makeup products and accessories. Their creations will be exhibited during the two days of the show. Furthermore, this year, MakeUp Pioneer, the show's path for innovation and new products, will succeed the MakeUp Innovation Awards. The floor map distributed to visitors will highlight booths participating in the operation. A dozen round tables and conferences will also be held during the days of MakeUp in Paris. Among the topics to be discussed: – "" Make-up and skincare"" to explore the links between care and makeup products, 20 June 2013 (10.15-11.00 a.m.) – ""Foundation, a concentrate of innovations"", 20 June 2013 (01.30-02.15 p.m.) – ""Korea, a champion in make-up innovation"", 21 June 2013 (10.15-11.15 a.m.) – ""Make-up and the strategies of luxury brands,"" 21 June 2013 (12.30-13.15 p.m.) The success of this ""niche"" show is also confirmed in the United States where, in order to meet the many demands of exhibitors, the organizers have chosen a new venue for the third edition of MakeUp in New York to be held on 25-26 September 2013. ""The evolution of the makeup market strongly supports us, with an increasing reliance on outsourcing and full service, which is precisely the positioning of our events,"" concludes Jean-Yves Bourgeois."

The first reason is the huge success of the initial edition where the show floor was always flooded with buyers, both from Japan and abroad, eagerly looking for hit products coming next. Almost all the exhibitors who participated in the 2012 edition are coming back and many new companies are joining this year, encouraged by achievements of the previous exhibitors. Another reason is the launch of new specialised zones for each product category such as [skincare], [makeup], [hair & scalp], [bath & body], [tools & accessories] and [beauty drink/supplement]. This layout does not only contribute to attract more exhibitors from each category, it also helps to gathering increased number of visitors interested in those products. In addition, there are also zones reflecting the current trends in the Japanese market. The ""Organic Zone"" and ""[Special] Anti-aging Cosmetics Fair"", in particular, are expected to gather a large attention as these two markets are rapidly expanding in Japan. The ""Organic Zone"", for instance, is greatly expanding its scale, in response to the ""organic cosmetics boom"" in Japan. Premium Beauty News - How would you describe the Japanese cosmetics market today? Hajime Suzuki - As far as its growth rate is concerned, the cosmetics market in Japan - the world's second largest market - has entered a stable period. However, the market situation is actively changing. Now that consumers can access to a flood of information on the Internet and choose from numerous alternatives, many newcomers are entering the market, seeking chances in meeting the diversified consumer needs. While the competition is getting fiercer, the current market is full of opportunities to increase sales, even for newcomers or small and medium-sized companies. This remark also applies to overseas cosmetic brands, which are becoming increasing popular among Japanese consumers. Another prominent feature in the current market is the success of overseas organic brands. Considering these situations as an opportunity, many overseas companies will exhibit at Cosme Tokyo 2013. We have therefore created a special exhibiting area for overseas companies inside the show. The dedicated zone will be called ""New Comers to the Japanese Market Pavilion"". To support overseas companies who did not find an importer in Japan to enter the market, we offer extensive support services with exclusive price advantage. Premium Beauty News - Cosme Tokyo is held conjointly with Cosme Tech. What is this event about? Hajime Suzuki - Showcasing ingredients, OEM, packaging and other products/services, Cosme Tech 2013 (4th Int'l Cosmetics Development Expo) is dedicated to suppliers of cosmetic brands. The event is considered in Japan as the best and most efficient way for brand owners to source and compare all the key components required for developing a cosmetic range. These two concomitant shows have become Japan's only exhibition covering the whole cosmetics industry from ingredients, OEM and packaging to finished products. Enabling visitors to grab both comprehensive overview on the whole industry and detailed information in each field, they have further enhanced their value as the must-attend event in the Japanese and Asian cosmetics industry.

"""Selective perfumery is at a crossroads,"" William Koeberlé, FFPS","Premium Beauty News - With a decline in sales of 0.9% in value, 2012 was not an exciting year for the selective circuit in France? William Koeberlé - Unquestionably, the past year was rather disappointing. The selective circuit has declined, but it is part of a trend that began several years ago, with an erosion of sales volume, more or less offset by an increase in value. We can also observe that in the light of the current economic climate, this decline is not a cause for alarm. In addition, you must look at all the data. Figures provided by NDP take into account only part of the sales in our circuit. Neither sales of distributors' own brands, those of exclusive brands, nor Internet sales are taken into account. While private labels represent a growing proportion of sales in selective distribution. If some brands in the selective circuit are indeed struggling, the ones which have innovated and managed to launch some interesting novelties have been very successful. I am thinking in particular of Clarins, Guerlain or Lancôme, but there are many more. Premium Beauty News - How do you explain the continued rise of private labels? William Koeberlé - The fact that they are very affordable makes them perfectly adapted to current needs. It is not only a question of price, they remain in the field of selective distribution with products that have a history and quality ingredients, but with a positioning which not challenged by major selective brands. In addition, for retailers, it's a way of attracting customers from other distribution channels. Selective distribution in France is the predominant circuit for perfumes. Sales of cosmetics and skincare products are more challenged, either by supermarkets or by pharmacies. Own brands are an important asset to encourage customers who have entered selective points of sale to buy something else than perfume. Premium Beauty News - The openings of outlets offering alternative perfumes, brands little known to the general public, have mushroomed in recent years. Major brands themselves also launch perfumes with a very limited distribution. William Koeberlé - It is interesting and of course we are closely following this, like we are following more globally what is happening in the market. For now, sales figures in these outlets remain marginal compared to the rest of the market. For the record, in France, 93% of women's fragrances are sold in the selective perfumery circuit, versus 87% of men's fragrances (according to NPD), and these openings reinforce this trend. Regarding the limited editions from major brands, this is not a new phenomenon. Brands have long since developed perfume ranges the distribution of which was limited to a few corners or owned stores. This is also an important element in the construction of their image. Premium Beauty News - On your arrival at the head of the French Federation of selective perfumery, you had set yourself three priorities: To maintain the regulation exempting selective distribution, the harmonization of practices in logistics, and negotiations on a new collective agreement to give new impetus to training. What is the situation like today? William Koeberlé - The renewal of the block exemption has been granted since 2010. The challenge now is to ensure that within this common framework, the same rules apply to all. I am referring obviously to pure players who sell on the internet, in particular fragrances, paying no heed of European rules. Regarding logistics, the joint working group set up with the FEBEA, (the French trade association representing cosmetic manufacturers) succeeded in adopting a manual of best logistics practices for the flow of goods and is continuing its work. This has allowed us to move ahead on traceability issues and on the procedures for the withdrawal of products in view of the entry into force of the new European regulation by July next, particularly to provide solutions to independent perfumeries. Finally, concerning the collective agreement, discussions with the unions are continuing. One of the issues is to decide whether we will continue to work under a separate collective agreement or if we consider joining an existing agreement. My belief is that this agreement should stand as the backbone of this specific business of ours and that is should give prominence to training issues. This is important especially for employees in independent perfumeries who are only trained by brands. Premium Beauty News - You mentioned online distribution, it was also the theme, during the last General Assembly of the FFPS, of the conference of the future of the sector, organised last October with the European federation of perfumery retail (FEPD). William Koeberlé - In France, online sales represent about 2% of sales in the selective circuit. It's a rapidly growing circuit, even if its weight is not yet significant. Today, most of women from selective perfumery are active on the web: to compare, find tips and share views. The real change regards its position in the purchase cycle; 68% have visited a website before visiting one of our shops. Internet is now an integral part of our business in terms of both communication and sales. But if the internet is a great tool for us, it can also represent a risk when websites outside the European Union behave like real pirates, with no respect for the rules in selective distribution or for those regarding the protection of clients or products' traceability. Not to mention risks of counterfeiting and regarding product safety. The protection of our business goes hand in hand with the protection of our customers. Customers, brands, players, internet: all of them contribute to the evolution of the old model of selective perfumery."
Russian beauty market expected to grow to EUR 15.6 billion by 2015,"The Russian cosmetics and personal care market is gradually recovering from the 2008-2009 recession. The Russian beauty market grew to an estimated USD 13.9 billion (EUR 10.75 billion) in 2012, compared to 13.5 billions (EUR 10.43 billion) in 2011 and is forecasted to reach USD 15.6 billion (EUR 12.06 billion) in 2015. The country's new economic wealth is associated with rising incomes and increasing consumer expectations. The main segments of the market are perfumed products (23%), skin care products (22.6%), hair care (19.2%) and make-up (15.4%). In parallel to the development of the market, the distribution was highly restructured in Russia. Open markets, with their amounts of goods of questionable origin, which had become emblematic of the post-communist era now account for only a fraction of the overall distribution of perfumes and cosmetics (7.2%). Similarly, direct sales (internet excluded) carried on declining. On the contrary, health and beauty retail chains and grocery retail channels saw continuous consolidation, with the largest retail players increasing their market presence. In October 2012, the number of beauty retail outlets increased by +24.2% (compared to the previous year). The city of Moscow is the leader in specialized retail with some 800 point of sales and their number is expected to continue growing in the nearest future. This is accompanied, however, by a significant concentration of retailers. In the selective distribution, the three major retail networks (L'Etoile, Ile de Beauté and Rive Gauche) are dominating the market, in particular in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and are extending their network nationally. Besides national retail chains some 25 regional specialized retailers operate in the market. The biggest are Seven days (Voronezh), Novex (Siberia), Podruzhka (Moscow), Alpari (Tatarstan). In parallel, the ""Drogerie"" format has been developing actively. In October 2012, the number of ""drogeries"" increased by +25% (compared to the previous year). Among the biggest market players are Magnit Kosmetik, Podruzhka, Ol!Good, Yuzhny Dvor, etc. This retail format is expected to be one of the most dynamic over the next years. As their familiarity with cosmetic products is increasing, Russian consumers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their product choices and tend to spend money more rationally. The marketing strategies of specialized retail chains, based on discounts, have also simulated changes in consumption patterns. This trend, which is forecasted to continue, is prompting retailers and manufacturers to explore new ways to communicate with their targets. To date, manufacturers are continuing to exploit natural claims that continue to be highly attractive for consumers."
Cosmoprof defends its global leadership,"In the context of a declining Italian beauty market, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is defending its global leadership, closing its 2013 edition with a 14% increase in visitors, including a 22% increase of visitors from abroad (48,823 foreign visitors out of 193,842). The whole show hosted 2,390 exhibitors, including 666 Italian companies and more than 1,500 from abroad (272 exhibitors from China, 161 from France, 143 from the USA, 125 from Germany and 113 from Spain. ""These figures are testament to the global mission of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna. Together with the platforms of Las Vegas and Hong Kong, it has once again shown itself to be the most important trade fair worldwide in the cosmetics and beauty sector,"" claim the organizers. There was a new location for Cosmopack, the exhibition area dedicated to packaging, machinery and contract production. In order to address the specific needs of exhibitors in this area, the separation between Cosmopack and the rest of the show has been increased: in space, with the reorganisation of the entire exhibiting area on the same floor, and in time, with the packaging show-in-the-show opening one day before the rest of the show, and closing one day before too. Furthermore, the organisers also stressed the role of Italy in the production supply chain of cosmetic products, reconstituting a lipstick production chain with the help of Alma Cosmetics, Citus, Coesia Group, For lab Italia, Inca Cosmetics, Intercosmografica, IDM Automation, Omnicos Group, TGM. As far as finished products are concerned, green cosmetics are still particularly in fashion, with an entire pavilion dedicated to the sector and 198 exhibitors focusing on eco-sustainability. The perfumery sector displayed a trend towards strong, spicy and sweet fragrances, with 40 exhibitors from the Middle East, and many other perfume brands with a clear focus towards this geographical area. According to Duccio Campagnoli, President of BolognaFiere and SoGeCos, the company that organises Cosmoprof, ""the new Cosmoprof is increasingly international and professional."" The next edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna will be held from April 11th-14th, 2014."
France: the new players of luxury perfumery,"The situation is rather worrisome. According to the NPD Group, after a good year in 2011 (+3% in value), the French market for fragrances and cosmetics sold in the selective channel (high-end specialised beauty stores) recorded a slight decline in 2012 (-0.9% in value). However, selective retail in France is also suffering of a loss of buyers. According to Kantar Worldpanel, 3 million buyers have left it since 2010. Especially, for the first time in 2012 older and affluent consumers - the core target of selective retail - have begun to turn to other horizons. Actors of the French selective market must therefore find new growth drivers for 2013. And fragrances are certainly a key factor for that. Actually, on the one hand, this circuit seems highly (too?) dependent on sales of fragrances and, on the other hand, retailers have difficulties to differentiate themselves in this segment. In parallel to the traditional selective channel, which is dominated in France by Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé, small retailers are exploring ne avenues and are trying to bring about a new conception of luxury perfumery. Several perfumeries in French provincial cities - Parfumerie de l'Opéra in Bordeaux, Parfumerie Santa Rosa in Toulouse, or Parfumerie du Soleil d'Or in Lille - already proposed to their customers a real alternative offer, but they had no equivalent in Paris, where the offer was fragmented between brand owned stores, department stores and fashion concept stores such as Colette or L'Éclaireur. But during the latest years, several new outlets have been filling this gap and seem to have found their customers: Jovoy, in the Rue de Castiglione, in the upscale and touristic Place Vendôme area, Sens Unique and Marie Antoinette, in the Marais, and Nose in the Montorgueil district. ""Buyers of niche brands were already there, but nobody - or hardly anybody - was addressing their demand,"" Nicolas Cloutier, co-founder and President of Nose, recently told Premium Beauty News. Nevertheless, marketing alternative perfumery products in France remains a hard job. There are about 20 to 30 outlets in France - traditional stores or concept-stores - that propose an alternative to the standard offer. In Germany or in Italy there are 250 to 300 of them, and they have developed a specific knowledge about rare perfumery. One question remains: what is the weight of these products on the market? About 4% of the global perfumery market, deemed David Frossard, co founder of Différentes Latitudes, last year during a conference in Paris. Actually, there are hardly any figures available. NPD deems that, in the US, these brands strongly outpace the growth of rest of the market. ""The fragrance brands that are being sold in more selective distribution are experiencing explosive growth. We've seen this trend with high-end designer brands like Tom Ford and Jimmy Choo and this is also evident today with jewelry and niche fragrance brands,"" said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. ""Even though niche and jewelry brands make up only nine percent of the total prestige fragrance market they are creating a new dynamic in the larger fragrance arena. They are growing faster than any other type of fragrance in the prestige space and their combined sales are actually more than double the size of prestige celebrity fragrances."" Is the situation is similar in France? This is, among other things, what will be discussed by the various speakers at the conference ""Parfums d'exception, parfums d'avenir?"" organized by Beauteam and Premium Beauty News in Paris on April 9, 2013.

Euromonitor decodes top five beauty trends in North and South America,"""The Americas [1] continued to be a dynamic hemisphere for Beauty and Personal Care products in 2012 with more potential for growth in 2013,"" says Euromonitor's Latin American Research Manager, Sean Kreidler. ""Latin America is very active in expanding awareness with its consumer base by way of direct selling and expansion with modern store-based retailers. In North America, Canada and the USA lead product innovation and customer shopping experiences."" Another difference between North and South America: mass cosmetic products - or products at a lower price point - represent over 90% of sales in every country in Latin America, whereas premium cosmetics account for 35% of sales in Canada and the United States. According to the market research firm, direct selling represents over a quarter of all beauty and personal care sales in North and South America, which is the highest regional share in the world. Direct sellers continue to expand in Argentina and lead the market in Bolivia. Brazil, on the other hand, is seeing a push toward store-based retailing, with the expansion of beauty specialist retailers such as Sephora. Several other Latin American countries are experiencing strong retail growth as pharmacies and hypermarkets are now reaching consumers where only direct sellers ventured before. Apart from direct selling, Euromonitor International identifies four other main trends: Middle income consumers benefiting from the economic growth drive beauty and personal care sales throughout Latin America, most notably in Brazil and Peru. On the other hand, Argentina and Venezuela are battling surging inflation that has eroded consumers' purchasing power. Men's grooming continues to shine in Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru and the USA; however, men's grooming might struggle in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador where future potential lies in men increasingly making their own purchasing decisions. Premium products keep growing in Chile, Costa Rica and México and remain a priority for many consumers in Venezuela, despite poor economic conditions. In Canada, premium brands are recovering to drive growth. Product innovation is growing rapidly in Bolivia and México. Canada and the USA are seeing advanced skin care technology development, and the demand for products containing natural ingredients present growth opportunities in Colombia, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.

Marionnaud opts for nature,"For this new line, Marionnaud chose an original environmental positioning that was not really prevalent on the French cosmetics market so far, since ""natural"" there was more or less understood as ""organic."" Actually, the Marionnaud Nature skincare range claims at least 90% natural ingredients (fruits and flowers) and an environment friendly manufacturing process. But it is not an organic line and its natural claims are not certified by an independent third party, as it was becoming usual. The products are free from parabens, silicone and synthetic dyes and, with the exception of shea butter, their natural ingredients (calendula flower, cherry blossom, clover blossom, cassis, physalis, etc.) are produced ""locally"", i.e. in Europe. Also for environmental reasons, the retailer has selected European production sites (Alban Muller in France and Hampshire Cosmetics in the UK) for their performance and with the aim to optimize the carbon footprint of products sold in its European outlets. While in 2008, its first private label line was certified organic, the beauty retailer is opting for another radical choice today by making natural and environmental claims but getting rid of certification. A choice that Marionnaud explains by its will to address ""the growing needs of customers increasingly aware of environmental issues,"" but who are not ready to ""sacrificing the quality of their cosmetics and the part of dream of beauty rituals."" In short: sustainable development, and pleasure, rather than organic. With this new range of 15 products (makeup removers, cleansers, moisturizers and well-being) for the face and the body, Marionnaud intends to strengthen the attractiveness of its outlets. ""60% of the French never push the door of a perfumery shop. Actually, we are launching our own line of products in order to increase the accessibility of skincare products sold in perfumery shops. We want women and men to discover a shopping experience made of attention and advice,"" says Fabrice Obenans, Marketing Director at Marionnaud. As for other Marionnaud private label brands (Bio by Marionnaud, launched in 2008, Les Essentiels Marionnaud, launched in April 2010, Swiss Apple Formula and Marionnaud Men, launched in 2011) products are unsurprisingly offered at quite affordable prices (from 4.90 to 14.90 euros). In 2012, Marionnaud private label skincare products accounted for almost 20% of the retailer's sales volume. However, this is significantly lower than for its two main direct competitors in the French market, Nocibé and Sephora, which have invested more in this area when Marionnaud chose to focus on major brands. ""Customers are increasingly mobile and can opt for a retailer's brand skincare while succumbing for a selective item at the same time. Our role as a retailer is to support this freedom,"" says Fabrice Obenans. Marionnaud Nature new skincare range for the face and the body will be on sale as of March 21, 2013 in 288 stores (out of 1,100 Marionnaud outlets in Europe) and on the site marionnaud.com."
"China, India and Russia among the top 5 largest economies in 2020","By 2020, three of the world's five largest economies will be emerging countries, accounting for 30.4% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms [1]. At this date, the world's largest markets will be China, the USA, India, Japan and Russia. ""Advanced economies are being displaced by emerging market superpowers, notably the BRIC countries, which has been accelerated by the seismic effects of the global economic downturn of 2008-2009,"" says Media Eghbal, Country Insight Manager at Euromonitor International. India overtook Japan as the world's third largest economy in PPP terms in 2011 and its demographic advantage means the country could become the world's biggest economy in the coming decades. Euromonitor International predicts that China will become the world's largest economy in PPP terms in 2017 and will account for 19.0% of global GDP in PPP terms by 2020. However, China is also facing big challenges, including rising labour costs, pollution, a potential real estate bubble and rapid ageing. The market research firm predicts that China's working age population (aged 15-64) will decline from 2014. Furthermore, Russia should overtake Germany as the world's fifth largest economy in 2016, driven by its energy sector. The country also offers potential in its rapidly expanding consumer market, which Euromonitor forecasts will be the ninth largest globally in real terms in 2020. However, the lack of economic diversification and modernisation, as well as declining working-age population, remain key long-term challenges. ""These shifts will influence global politics, business environments and investment flows while consumer markets in developing countries will rise in importance as the middle class expands,"" Euromonitor notes. Actually, global cosmetic players, such as L'Oréal, Estée Lauder or Procter & Gamble are already anticipating the shift. L'Oréal for instance is investing heavily in India and recently inaugurated a new Research and Innovation (R&I) Center to study Indian hair and skin specificities. The French cosmetics giant aims to quadruple its sales in this country. ""New markets"" (Asia-Pacific, Eastern and Central Europe, Africa, and Middle-East) are already L'Oréal's number one geographic zone, accounting for 40% of the group's turnover. Last November, the group inaugurated a giant factory in Indonesia to serve South-East Asian markets, and it will open a new plant in Egypt in 2013 to serve the Middle East area."
Nine in ten British consumers now on a budget,"The United Kingdom does stand away from the spreading of economic austerity over Europe and is bracing itself for another year of cuts. In this context, budget Britain is in full swing with nine in ten (89%) Brits now on a budget, new research from Mintel reveals [1]. ""For many, budgeting has become a part of daily life and it seems Britain's affluent are feeling the pinch too,"" says the market research firm. Mintel's research finds nearly half (44%) of all Brits are budgeting more than they were this time last year. Today, as many as nearly nine in ten (89%) Brits shop on a budget, and a further 9% don't budget but are keeping a track of what they spend. Indeed, proving the impact of post recession Britain, just 2% of Brits admit to not having a budget or tracking their spends. Families are the group most likely to budget, with nearly half (48%) of parents reporting they had a stricter budget over the past year. Meanwhile, it seems Britain's women are the savviest shoppers - nearly one in two (49%) reporting an increase in budgeting over the past year compared to less than four in ten (39%) men. ""The downturn over the last few years has changed spending and budgeting habits in the UK. We have gone from a nation of borrowers and over-spenders to a nation of savers and savvy shoppers. The constant reminders of the dire state of the UK economy, together with what we have seen happen in Europe over the last few years, means that budgeting, saving and discounts have become words ingrained in the consumer psyche,"" said Ina Mitskavets, Senior Consumer and Lifestyles Analyst at Mintel. Mintel's research also shows how consumers on high incomes (those earning £50,000 and above) are likely to jump on the ""budget bandwagon"" - with some 90% of high earners claiming that they budget. Today's high earners are particularly savvy with their shopping activities - leading the way in using discounts and special offers when shopping. Indeed, while 70% of all consumers use in store discounts such as buy-one-get-one-free, this rises to 73% of high earners. Rewards and loyalty cards are used by an average of 66% of Brits, again this rises to 75% of high earners. Finally, percentage off total purchase is used by an average of 52% of Brits compared to some 59% of high earners. ""Even the more well-to-do shoppers show more reserve with their finances in uncertain economic times. Budgeting is becoming an ingrained habit, as people are reluctant to flash the cash and appear to be taking pride in being more financially conservative than in the past. Rising costs of childcare, coupled with austerity measures such as the slashing of child tax credits and the loss of child benefit for middle and high income earners, mean that the squeeze is only set to get tighter for families,"" Ina continues. Some seven in ten (70%) adults have used discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free or 2-for-1 in the last six months. Meanwhile, rewards or loyalty schemes are favoured by two thirds (66%) of shoppers while percentage off total purchase discounts by one in two (52%) consumers. Coupons from the Internet (32%) and magazines (29%) are the next most popular ways for consumers to save money whilst shopping. Just under half (44%) of all discount users used them to buy clothing and accessories and 38% used special offers to eat out or to buy groceries in the past six months. ""This shows that people are working to stretch their money not only to help make ends meet, but also to put a little pleasure into their lives,"" Ina Mitskavets says. ""The market has responded well to consumer demand for low prices. However, as shoppers get increasingly savvy, retailers will need to look beyond price points if they want to retain customers who are increasingly selective and less brand loyal,"" she concludes."
Organic cosmetics deadlocked?,"The January edition of the Matinales de la Cosmétiques, the monthly event organized by SRC Consulting, was dedicated to the ability of the organic cosmetics to meet consumer expectations. Marie Alice Dibon (Alice Communications) and Sandie Jaidane (SJ Consulting) have investigated the gap between consumer expectations regarding natural and organic cosmetics and the real market offer. According to them, despite favourable market trends, which result in undeniably strong sales, natural or organic cosmetics did not succeeded to convince consumers they are able to meet all of their expectations. Despite double digits annual growth rates in many countries, the organic and natural beauty market remains a niche market. In France for instance, while sales rose at an average of 25% per year between 2005 and 2011, natural and organic cosmetics accounted for only 2% of the total market in 2011, according to Deloitte [1]. In Germany, where they hold the biggest share of the market, natural and organic cosmetics account for 6.5% of the market, not more. Paradoxically, the number of players in this narrow market has skyrocketed and launches have boomed. According to research firm Organic Monitor, the French market witnessed the highest number of launches in Europe [2]. Ethical SMEs that pioneered the market have been joined by other types of players offering new organic or natural brands for all the market segments, and also by conventional brands expanding their offering with organic lines. In such a competitive environment, the early signs of a market downturn are necessarily having damaging consequences. Thus, the group Clarins decided to put an end to the market life of the Kibio brand it had acquired in 2010. Despite significant investments, the brand never really succeeded to impose itself. Earlier in 2012, Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of L'Oréal, had already expressed its disappointment regarding the growth of the organic market as a whole and the results of its Sanoflore brand in particular. However, in addition to these iconic brands, many small brands have disappeared after two or three years trying to find a place in a quite limited market. Yet, despite the economic crisis, all studies show the persistence and progression of environmental and ethical concerns, and the high expectations regarding health and wellness among consumers. The trend remains strong in Europe and in North America, despite slower growth rates than in the past. According to Deloitte, the French market is expected to grow at a steady pace (around 10% per year), while marked ""by the stronger requirement of consumers in terms of corporate social responsibility and product benefits."" Indeed, even when they are highly aware about ethics and the environment, consumers are not willing to give up their demands for quality and efficiency. According to Marie Alice Dibon, the proliferation of logos and certifications has not been an adequate response to consumer expectations. ""Actually, none of the existing certification currently covers all of their main concerns: effective but healthy products, sustainable and environmentally friendly products, ethical products."" Another problem is that, in a market where dreams and pleasure are important parts of the shopping and consumption experiences, natural and organic brands have adopted a very basic positioning. For a long time, their main selling argument has been limited to the absence of supposed harmful ingredients in their formula. It was the famous ""free from"" trend: free from parabens, free from phthalates, free from aluminium... In a competitive environment, which remains increasingly harsh, especially with the rise of retailers' brands, organic and natural brands must strive to convince consumers about the sincerity and consistency of their approach, but also to reassure them about their effectiveness. Organic and natural brands, especially those with a high-end positioning must also develop an attractive brand universe in order to appeal to consumers and being capable of conveying the expected dreams. Actually, required investments in R&D and in marketing should increase significantly therefore leading to the exit of the weakest players and a restructuration of the market through alliances and buyouts. The year 2013 will also be marked by important regulatory changes with, in the one hand, the full ban on animal testing in Europe and, on the other hand, the entry into force of a new European legislation that is particularly demanding about safety. The increasingly stringent regulatory framework, combined with sometimes very ambitious sustainability initiatives from traditional players such as Unilever, could both increase the barriers to entry into the market while limiting the differentiation opportunities for new players. The development of an ISO standard to harmonize global definitions of natural and organic cosmetics may have similar effects. Eventually, according to Sandie Jaidane, ""organic products are not becoming the standard, but the standards are becoming more organic and natural."""
US prestige beauty sales up 7% last year,"Sales of prestige brands, those sold primarily in department stores, showed an increase of seven percent in dollar sales in 2012 compared to 2011, said The NPD Group. The US market thus performed much better than the European one, where sales declined in France (-1%), in Italy (-4%) and in Spain (-7%) and progressed by 5% in the United Kingdom. ""Coming off the wave of 2011, one of the most robust sales periods in over a decade for the beauty industry, 2012 has shown some great highs, along with some modest lows,"" said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. According to the market research firm, all of the U.S. prestige beauty categories posted healthy growth. Prestige skincare sold in U.S. department stores generated the largest growth at 10 percent, followed by makeup at seven percent and fragrance at five percent, compared to 2011. ""Even though consumer confidence continues to waver, there is momentum at both ends of the price and product spectrum. In 2012, along with smaller categories in beauty, we are seeing investment spending on premium-priced makeup, skincare, fragrance, as well as premium-priced sets, which lead in growth once again. Even in Europe, where the economic environment is more challenging, the major premium-priced category, fragrance, was positive. Premium-priced products remain one of the brightest spots in beauty and will continue to carve out market share across all categories and geographies in the New Year,"" said Grant. In comparison, the U.S. Food/Drug/Mass [1] channel recorded a lower growth, recording nearly a three percent increase in sales for total beauty in 2012, versus 2011. Mass makeup sales posted the biggest increase at five percent, followed by skincare at three percent, while fragrance sales declined four percent in dollar sales, compared to 2011. Furthermore, in National Chain [2] stores, fragrance sales grew seven percent, reported The NPD Group. ""In the U.S., although we have seen some tempering in sales performance, compared to 2011, growth remains positive for both the prestige and mass channels. The trend of prestige beauty outpacing mass beauty continues to be evident since the recessionary period of 2009 and will likely continue into 2013,"" ended Grant."
Global male grooming market bouncing back,"Growing consciousness among men concerning their appearance and increasing awareness regarding the benefits of products specific to men are driving the growth of men's skin care products worldwide, reveals market research firm Kline & Company in its recently published report, Male Grooming Products: Global Market Brief. While Europe is the largest market for male grooming products, Asia is posting the highest growth. The advanced markets of Japan and South Korea are benefiting from male grooming, including the use of cosmetics, as an entrenched socially encouraged practice wherein men are seeking to retain a youthful and appealing look. By contrast, within China and India, male grooming as a trend has only recently been developing its significant potential and is being assisted by greater disposable income among consumers. Although the European male grooming market is growing at a comparatively slower pace, products are generally more sophisticated and leading brands vary from country to country. The leading male grooming industry marketers in Europe's strongest market of Germany are Nivea for Men, L'Oréal Men Expert, and DM's Balea Men. ""Our extensive research has revealed a myriad of exciting developments,"" notes Nancy Mills, Kline's Consumer Products Practice Industry Manager. ""One that strikes most, revealed in the consumer part of the research, concerns the major cultural shift observed across all age groups of men in countries previously reluctant to extend male grooming beyond basic cleaning and shaving. Essentially, this is opening up a largely untapped market that consists of half the population."" The consumer research comprising of responses on the topic of grooming from over 1,500 males between the ages of 15 and 69 spanning six core countries also reveals actionable granularity, such as the least popular market for conditioners is Germany, while demand for hair styling mousse is highest in China. Category strength continues to vary between regions. Deodorants and antiperspirants is the largest and most fragmented category across the globe. Partly due to a tendency to utilize deodorant sheets instead of a Western style spray/solid/gel/roll-on formats, the category is weakest in some Asian countries. However, the category's growth numbers in these countries also reveals a move towards Western-preferred formats. Regarding male grooming products distribution channels, the dominating popularity of mass merchandisers can be seen across all categories and countries. Alternate channels are also changing the male grooming products retail landscape, with Internet shopping making great gains. In China, men are also the highest frequenters of upscale department stores, with 29% of Chinese respondents saying that's where they shop for skin care products."
France: high-end beauty market declined in 2012,"According to NPD Group, sales of perfumes and cosmetics in selective perfumery shops, which now generate 2830 million euros in France, recorded a slight decrease in value (-0.9%) in 2012 compared to 2011, which was a record year for the sector. The decrease is more pronounced in volume (-3%). Sales remained flat in December, which is a crucial month as it accounts for more than 20% of the selective channel's annual turnover. In comparison, sales in December 2011 had experienced a very strong growth in value (+8%) compared to the same period in 2010. Under these conditions, the overall market decline is not a surprise. However, according to Mathilde Puszka, Beauty Analyst at NPD Group, ""the French market is still doing better than its neighbours, Italy and Spain, where sales in value will respectively decline by 3.6 and 6.7% in 2012."" NPD Group's data show a decline of 1% of sales of fragrances in France in 2012. Women's fragrances (-0.7% in value) are performing better than men's fragrances (- 1.4% in value). Indeed, the impact of launches has been lower for men's fragrances, while women's fragrances have benefited this year from the successful launches of La Petite Robe Noire by Guerlain, La Vie est Belle by Lancôme, Manifesto by Yves Saint Laurent or Coco Noir by Chanel, Dior Addict Eau Fraîche and Eau Sensuelle by Dior. However these developments failed to stimulate an increase in sales compared to 2011. Makeup segments also recorded an overall decline (-1.4%), in context where new products, which usually account for 16% of sales in this category, had a lower impact in 2012. ""Makeup is highly dependent from innovations. In 2011, the market had benefited from the launches of major products such as Guerlain's Terracotta or the Dior Addict's lipsticks. Actually, more than new products, they were re-launches of iconic products. In 2012, there many new products but they were less appealing and therefore had a more limited impact on sales,"" said Mathilde Puszka. Skincare, which was traditionally the category that suffered the most in the selective beauty channel, succeeded to stabilize itself (-0.2%), mainly thanks to the dynamism of anti-aging sales that rose by 1.6% in value in 2012, with the launch or re-launch of innovative and sophisticated products. Brands have also invested heavily on specific products for the eyes, including including Clinique with the Even Better range, Dior with Capture Totale and Capture XP or Lancôme with Génifique et Rénergie Multi-Lift. ""Innovation is absolutely required in the anti-aging segment as new products generate a quarter of sales,"" says Mathilde Puszka. Nail polishes [1] formed the other very dynamic segment in 2012, with sales progressing by 7.8% in value compared to the previous year. The NPD Group estimates that this market has more than doubled since 2006 in terms of revenue but also of sold units. Actually, with an average price of 17 euros in high-end beauty stores, nail polishes remain an affordable luxury."
The beauty industry bets on digital technologies,"A wide range of digital tools, the effectiveness of which has been more or less assessed, is available to brands that want to to capture the attention of consumers, turn their visits into purchases, or increase their loyalty. Students from ESCP Europe commissioned by the BeautyFULL Club [1] have studied a wide array of existing technologies and tried to assess them through a grid taking into account, their impact on visits in retail outlets, on the brand's reputation and image, on the collection of customer information, or the return on investment. Then, they tried to investigate future trends. From augmented reality contests on mobile phones to e-mailing campaigns, through holograms within shop, interactive displays or YouTube channels: technical possibilities seem almost limitless when it comes to attracting the attention of consumers and highlighting a brand's values. However, said the group of students, all of these techniques must be evaluated in terms of their impact on the reputation and image of the brands. Depending on brands' market positioning, these tools can be used to preserve the brand image, to optimize the recruitment of clients or to build an interactive and immersive relationship with the brands' values. In all cases, ""the aesthetic of the brand must prevail over purely technological issues."" Beyond their capacity to seduce consumers, digital technologies have already demonstrated their ability to generate significant sales. The e-commerce market share in cosmetics retail sale in France reaches 2%, to compare to 9% in China. In parallel, while the market for high-end cosmetics is growing by about 5% per year worldwide, online sales are progressing by 30% on average, but at very uneven rates, ranging from 12.5% in the United States, 45% in Russia and 66% in China, and 20% in France. At this level, however, it is necessary to take into account the particularities of each country, especially in terms of payment and delivery habits. However, if online sales of cosmetics are constantly increasing, 71.7% of consumers still say they prefer to buy in high street stores rather than on the web. However, they are almost as many (69%) to consider that the new digital technologies make brick and mortar retail stores more attractive. According to the ESCP Europe students, beauty retail trends are definitely proving to head towards outlet digitalization. New technologies are emerging clearly as a propeller for the acquisition of new customers and the transformation of visits into purchases: 87% of consumers believe that technological innovation contribute to upgrade retail stores, and 74% that they are timesaving. Once again, the list of available technologies is impressive: 3D without glasses, digital flasks, tactile holograms, applications for smartphones, indoor GPS, mobile cash desks, etc. Their objectives vary from brand promotion, consumer education, purchasing and payment facilitation. Because of their low cost and a high equipment rate of consumers, smartphone applications rank first and are proliferating, in particular for consumer information purposes. For instance, noting that nearly one third of consumers are using their mobile phone at the point of sale, in particular to obtain information and advice, L'Oréal has developed InstantBeauty, an application that allows scanning barcodes of L'Oréal Paris products in order to retrieve information. For its part, Sephora has chosen to equip sales consultants in its 50 top stores in France with an application allowing them to better advise clients. New digital equipment is also entering outlets. In the United States, Sephora has launched, in cooperation with X-Rite/Pantone, a system that measures colour values of customers' skin tone to facilitate the choice of a suitable foundation. The same system is now being deployed in Boots stores in the UK. As far as payment methods are concerned, innovations are legion but have to cope with security concerns and the problems linked to their complexity. Many systems are being tested but, so far, current technologies lack of maturity are seem far from being able to revolutionize the act of purchase. System swap tested by Sephora in its stores in New York seems promising to relieve the shops and avoid the abandonment of purchase intentions as a result of waiting too long in body. Also note that some technologies may face hostility from consumers, for reasons of privacy protection, or may have to cope more stringent legal frameworks. Obviously, students from the ESCP also investigated the issue of customer relations. While 70% of consumers use social networks and 80% consult reviews published on the Internet, many brands have developed strategies at this level, in more advanced cases, these strategies may include the incorporation of social networks in ecommerce platforms, or the set up of online concierge services for the most important clients, or the co-creation of products. As far as technology is concerned, the dematerialization of the loyalty cards seems on track, as well as, especially for mass retail, mobile phone couponing. Finally, regarding the future, the study focuses on the potential of contactless technologies to streamline in store purchases, on outlets optimization based on the study of customers' movements through GPS tracking (indoor-mapping), or even on holographic projections of customers enabling to test makeup on a virtual clones. Who said that traditional shops are no longer surprising anyone?"
Emerging countries to boost global fragrance market,"Revenues in the fragrances industry are likely to continue to develop at dynamic rates in the upcoming eight years. ""We forecast global revenues of more than US$15.6 billion to be generated in 2019"", explains Oliver Kutsch, CEO of Ceresana, a market research firm headquartered in Germany. As the number of customers demanding fragranced products is rising all over the world, the study points out the importance the emerging countries in South America and Asia-Pacific as growth propellers for this sector. ""Fragrances are becoming more important all over the world,"" say the authors of the study. Indeed, due to the economic development of many emerging countries, an increasing part of the population has access to products enhanced by added fragrances, in éparticular because fragrances are used in a wide variety of products, from cleaning agents and detergents, to perfumes and the vast majority of personal care products. In emerging countries, a growing middle-class disposes of an increasing income that allows them to purchase and consume such products. ""Urbanization trends in already highly industrialized countries continue as well; consumption of scented products in cities is higher,"" they add. As many producers offer a broad collective product portfolio that caters to both standard and niche applications, the fragrances industry is subject to strong competition and affected by a strong push for innovation based on extensive market knowledge as well as up-to-date research and development. ""The general trend in fragrances is likely to continue to develop at the favour of exotic varieties. Customers that get to know these scents due to ongoing globalization are increasingly demanding such products. At the same time, the high pace of life many people experience also increases demand for harmonic fragrances that allow them to enjoy short moments of relaxation,"" highlight Ceresana analysts. Sustainability results achieved through in efforts to optimize ecological, economic and social impacts are the other major demand from customers. Fragrance manufacturers are therefore encouraged ""to develop and manufacture natural products that pose no risk to human beings and the environment."" In particular, products made from renewable resources that can be processed without hazardous substances are appealing to producers and consumers alike."
Ten consumer trends for 2013,"Euromonitor has chosen not to highlight so ubiquitous global trends such as ""thrift, urban consumers and the consumer love affair with mobile technology."" Nevertheless, even at this second level, the market research firm notes that consumer trends are increasingly globalised. ""The lack of a dedicated trend about emerging market consumers underlines the fact that our world is no longer experienced as 'The West and the Rest',"" wrote Daphne Kasriel-Alexander, consumers editor at Euromonitor, in a blog post about the report. Euromonitor's top ten consumer trends for this year: 1. Spending on convenience nudging into the quest for value The recessionary consumer's dislike of paying for convenience is softening. Consumers are tempted by bite-sized brand offerings aimed at emerging and now developed market shoppers and greater novelty and superior niche services. Consumer reviews also cut the risk of trying something new. 2. Crowded house redux Multigenerational and other combined living arrangements are leading to shifting consumption patterns as the 'floating generation' stay or return home to economise while peers and even separated couples are forced to cohabit. 3. Downtime decoded Digital life is making 'leisure' harder to define and even as 'digital detox' periods are shared digitally, holidaymakers are 'smoasting' – using social networking to boast about their holiday fun. Meanwhile health-conscious consumers are working hard to stay fit. 4. Food - more than a life staple Food is now celebrated, avoided, greener, healthier, grown in more urban spaces and hopefully safer. 5. Gendered consumption RIP? Gender-specific consumption and outlooks may be fading – apparent in everything from unisex tech preferences, to new gaming audiences and traditionally female behaviour feted in business situations. 6. Local love Things local are capturing the consumer imagination as more prosocial consumers (those who care about others and society as a whole) reject 'burbiness' (a term that reflects commercialism and the prevalence of chain stores) and global brands court local cultural relevance and tastes. 7. Older and off to work and train More tech-savvy, active and image-conscious older consumers need and want to work and spend comfortably for longer as more governments and firms are raising or abolishing retirement thresholds. 8. Parenting lifestyles Parents buying to suit themselves and tomorrow's generation - including 'shopturnals', yummy mummies, parents befriending their teens online, stay-at-home dads, 'tiger mothers', 'idle parents', parent bloggers and gifts in lieu of time spent with kids. 9. Shopping like it's the future New tech-driven shopping culture reveals generational faultlines. Brands are focusing on interpreting consumer lifestyles to reach out to customers warming to innovation. 'Showrooming', gamification, Facebook's piloted 'want' button and in-store digital information offerings are all part of this trend. 10. The roll call of consumer concerns A catalogue of often-disparate concerns preoccupies swelling consumer segments. These include bigger peoples' needs, long tail via the net, the quest for simplicity and the grasp of consumer data as an asset to brands. There are even havens for smokers."
Emerald named Colour of the Year for 2013,"According to Pantone, a subsidiary of X-Rite, the global leader in colour science and technology, most often associated with brilliant, precious gemstones, the perception of emerald is sophisticated and luxurious, since antiquity, this luminous, magnificent hue has been the colour of beauty and new life in many cultures and religions. ""This powerful and universally-appealing tone translates easily to both fashion and home interiors,"" said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. The emerald vivid and verdant green succeeds to Pantone 17-1463 Tangerine Tango, the 2012 colour of the year, a spirited reddish orange. ""The prevalence of green has been steadily rising for several seasons now, especially in the fashion and couture markets, and even on the Red Carpet,"" Pantone observes. Emerald's classic elegance makes for striking and irresistible women's formal, everyday wear and accessories. Emerald also makes a strong statement in men's sportswear, knitwear and ties. Fashion designers featured in the Pantone Fashion Color Report Spring 2013, including Tracy Reese, Nanette Lepore, Barbara Tfank, NAHM and Marimekko, are incorporating Emerald into their spring collections. ""Balanced, yet sophisticated, Emerald enlivens all colors in the spectrum and will continue to make a statement beyond spring and summer into fall and winter."" On the cosmetic colour wheel, Emerald dramatizes all eye colours. It is compatible to blue eyes, emphasizes the green undertone in hazel eyes and intensifies brown eyes to make them appear deeper. ""Emerald is also a perfect complement to peaches, pinks, roses, ruby reds and aubergines – offering a variety of lipstick and blush options. For those who want to sparkle and stand out, Emerald is the perfect punctuation point in nail color because of its complementary nature,"" Pantone highlights. Whether in paints or accessories, the emerald touch of wellbeing and luxury will spread to entryways, powder rooms, dining rooms or studies. It will also extend to bedding, pillows, bath towels, accessories, kitchens and dining rooms, including dinnerware, stemware and appliances. Pantone and Tollens, a leader in the European paint industry, have already concluded a partnership to give birth to an exclusive paint collection, Tollens inspired by Pantone, available throughout France in 2013. By March 2013, the Castorama DIY network will launch of a 40-colours ready-mix paint collection, followed by the launch of a 100-shades colour collection in Tollens exclusive professional network in June. Pantone 17-5641 Emerald will be the flagship colour in both collections. In order to select the colour of the year, Pantone's teams quite literally comb the world looking for colour influences. This can include the entertainment industry and films that are in production, traveling art collections, hot new artists, popular travel destinations and other socio-economic conditions. Influences may also stem from technology, availability of new textures and effects that impact colour, and even upcoming sports events that capture worldwide attention. Past colours of the year include: – PANTONE 17-1463 Tangerine Tango (2012) – PANTONE 18-2120 Honeysuckle (2011) – PANTONE 15-5519 Turquoise (2010) – PANTONE 14-0848 Mimosa (2009) – PANTONE 18-3943 Blue Iris (2008) – PANTONE 19-1557 Chili Pepper (2007) – PANTONE 13-1106 Sand Dollar (2006) – PANTONE 15-5217 Blue Turquoise (2005) – PANTONE 17-1456 Tigerlily (2004) – PANTONE 14-4811 Aqua Sky (2003) – PANTONE 19-1664 True Red (2002) – PANTONE 17-2031 Fuchsia Rose (2001) – PANTONE 15-4020 Cerulean (2000)"
Fragrance brands that French like best,"The survey was conducted online from November 28 to December 15, 2012, on a representative sample of 1,082 people (including 1,000 perfume buyers), aged 18 and over. On the one hand, Promise Consulting Inc. measured brand awareness and, on the second hand, calculated a ""desirability index"" and made a focus on the brands that men and women would like to buy for their own use and the women and men would offer to the other. The 10 fragrances women prefer for themselves: Actually, perfumes belonging to the ""floral"" family (Dior J'adore, Chanel n°5, Nina Ricci Nina, Lancôme Trésor) and those of the ""oriental"" family (Kenzo Flower, Dior La Petite Robe Noire, Lolita Lempicka 1er parfum) seem to be the ones that women like the best. The 10 most popular fragrances among men to offer to women: When it comes to offering a fragrance to a woman, men opt for traditional choices, with Chanel's No. 5, Dior's J'adore and Guerlain's Shalimar topping the list. The 10 fragrances men prefer for themselves: When it comes to choosing a perfume, men appreciate brands that symbolize virility and that reflect their masculine identity, however, Jean-Paul Gaultier, with Le mâle, has succeeded to attract buyers with a more androgynous offer. The 10 most popular fragrances among women to offer to men: Finally, when it comes to offering a fragrance to a man, women also do opt for brands with an old history on the market."
"Alain Khaiat: ""Properly targeting the needs of Asian consumers is a key factor of success""","Premium Beauty News - You will lead, as part of the In-Cosmetics Paris trade show, a seminar on anti-aging. What will be its main lines? Dr. Alain Khaiat - The objective will be to address the whole range of themes surrounding this topic to provide a comprehensive update resulting from everyone's knowledge on the latest discoveries in this field. We will review the latest developments concerning ingredients for anti-aging treatments; we will also take an interest in the development of scientific knowledge concerning the physiology of the skin during the aging process. We will examine the signs of aging as they can be observed on the skins of Europeans and on the ones of Asians. The seminar will also include an update on the latest techniques for the measurement of products efficiency, and also a presentation provided by Johnson & Johnson on the formulation of anti-aging treatments. In addition, the organizers of in-cosmetics have also asked me to participate to the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award for Cosmetic Science 2013, of which I was the laureate in 2010. Premium Beauty News - Are there really big differences between the aging of Asian skins and that of Caucasia skins? Dr. Alain Khaiat - I have been living and working in Singapore for the past 17 years now. This experience helped me understand how incomplete the vision of Europeans or North Americans was on Asian demand for cosmetics. We are aware that 80% of the market for facials consists of whitening products, but eventually I had to wait to be in Asia to perceive what it was all about exactly. This specificity of Asian markets is in large part due to differences in the skin's aging process. When a European or North American person tries to make a first-hand evaluation of the age of an Asian person he is often wrong mistaken by 10 or 15 years. We've all experienced this. But it's also true the other way around with Asians people trying to evaluate our age. On European people, the first signs of aging appear from the age of 20 in the form of small wrinkles that form around the eyes. With Asian people, they appear from the age of 16 in the form of pigment spots on the cheekbones. Premium Beauty News - This can be explained by different habits in terms sun exposure? Dr. Alain Khaiat - Undoubtedly habits from that standpoint habits are very different. Europeans and North Americans tend to expose themselves frankly while Asians are much more cautious, and will even try to avoid any sort of exposure. This obviously has an influence since sun exposure damages collagen fibres thus encouraging the appearance of wrinkles. But genetic factors also come into play. In any case, these differences obviously have an influence on the sunscreen market. In Europe or North America, they are seasonal products while in Asia they are systematically included into everyday products. Premium Beauty News - Asia is definitely emerging as the main market of the future for the cosmetic industry. What are its main issues? Dr. Alain Khaiat - First the picture must be qualified. Asian markets are complex. Hence, behaviours in Japan, Korea and China differ from one another and also from the ones observed in India, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. They are the result of very different psycho-social behaviours. But there are also some similarities, and I think the psycho-sociological factors explain the boom of the market for face masks in several Asian countries. Another important feature of Asian markets: a young population. Of course, there too there are big differences between aging countries like Japan and conversely very young countries like Vietnam. The main consequence is that in a number of these countries there is a very important market for teenagers, which is not so much the case in Europe or North America. In China, where the age distribution is showing its first signs of aging, still 22 million babies are born each year, which is the equivalent of the Australian population! And in India, the figure is even bigger. Apart from these aspects, I do, however, believe, that the main issue right now is the Chinese regulation. It is a major obstacle to the development of the cosmetic industry in this country: it hinders innovation, slows the launch of new products and challenges investments in both research and marketing."
French women increasingly go online to buy cosmetics,"Cosmetic brand État Pur, whose products are sold only on the Internet, joined forces with market research firm Come & Stay, a specialist of digital communication, to build a barometer on the behaviour of those ho chose to buy their cosmetics online. First of all, this initial barometer confirms the strong interest of French women in cosmetic products. Indeed, 66% of them say they love to test new cosmetics and own dozens of products already. A majority of French women also claims to spend between 30 and 60 euros per month for purchasing cosmetics, and 47% of French women purchase between 30 and 60 euros, all retail channels combined. More over, the results confirm the increasing confidence of consumers towards online sales and the steady increase of the e-commerce, which gradually becomes as legitimate as physical distribution networks. In an area where personal advices as well as the need to test products before purchasing it were considered as major impediments to the development of online sales, the results of the study show, on the contrary, that this distribution channel is becoming as usual as the others. Actually, 30% of consumers say they have made regular online purchases over the last 6 months and two thirds of the respondents have bought online over the 6 months (to compare to 82% for brick and mortar perfumeries and 88% for brick and mortar pharmacies and drug stores). Regarding product categories, 61% of respondents have bought a face care product (moisturizer, serum, ...) online over the last 6 months and more than 47% have bought a body care product (cream, oil, specific treatment, ...). Over 40% of buyers say that they even get on the internet to buy a brand they did not know. These online shopping cosmetics are overwhelmingly made from home (about 96%), and most frequently during the evening (42%). Furthermore, French women prefer massively (71%) turn to the online shops of renown brands (Clarins, Yves Rocher,...) rather than on the merchant site of a specialized distributor (39%). Also note the good score of private sales sites (BrandAlley, Beauty Private ...) that almost score as high as with the online beauty stores (35% compared to 39%). As far as online drugstores are concerned, they appeal for 24% of the buyers. The main motivations of online shoppers include the opportunity to make ""good deals"" (69%) and to save time (64%). When purchasing cosmetics online, the most important criteria are: prices (66%) and product information (57%). The survey was conducted online between May 9 and June 21, 2012 with 1,230 women. The sample was adjusted according to the quota method, based on French demographics for the following variables: age and distribution by region."
Indonesia: a cornerstone of L'Oréal's growth strategy in South-East Asia,"The inauguration, last month, at the Jababeka Industrial Estate, West Java, Indonesia, around 60 kilometers east of Jakarta, of what is to date the largest L'Oréal plant in the world, has focused attention on the beauty market in Indonesia. With an increasing proportion of households belonging to the middle class, the consumption is beginning to go beyond basic needs. Also stimulated by a relatively young population and the rapid urbanization, the demand for cosmetic products has grown by an average annual growth of 10 - 11%. In 2011, the cosmetics market was valued at nearly 1.6 billion euros [1]. Indonesia is therefore a cornerstone of L'Oréal's strategy to attract a billion new consumers by 2020. Despite a long tradition of beauty rituals, some of which are still perpetuated in a more or less modernized form, the younger generation is very sensitive to new beauty criteria: slenderness and a very fair complexion are considered as signs of modernity. ""It has become very important to have a fair, luminous complexion and many young women use lightening creams. They are eager for innovation and novelty and are prepared to experiment with different hair and skin care products,"" explains L'Oréal. However, the overall use of cosmetic products, of all categories, is spreading rapidly within the Indonesian population, leading to the development of a strong cosmetic industry. There would be some 700 cosmetics companies in the country, and would have recorded an average production growth of 12.5% between 2003 and 2007. Concerning the L'Oreal group, which has been present in Indonesia since 1979, it currently records over 39% market growth. In particular, L'Oreal succeed in becoming the leader in men's cosmetics. ""The latest brand launches have met with great success: with 11.9 million units sold since the start of 2012 the Garnier Men line topped sales win barely a year,"" details the company. With 15 brands distributed in the country, L'Oréal is present in all distribution channels: from hair salons and beauty institutes to traditional shops, and from mass retail to selective channels."
"Beauty Success, reviewing its store concept and getting involved in drugstores","A logical continuation after the launch in 2010 of a new visual identity with a new logo in the shape of a ""butterfly rosette"" and a new ""Well-being & beautiful mind"" base-line, Beauty Success - fourth selective perfumery network in France on a par with Douglas and behind Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé - has just launched the renovation programme of its new store concept. In a sluggish market, competition continues to grow between the main actors in selective distribution in France, but also between the different circuits, since Beauty Success also confirms its desire to set foot in the drugstore segment. ""This is in line with our concept of 'global beauty',"" explains Philippe Georges, the CEO of the brand. ""We serve 'beauty pleasure' with our perfumeries, 'beauty wellness' with our beauty parlours and 'beauty health' with our drugstores"". Beauty Success, which now consists of 280 stores (including 84 branches and 196 franchise stores) and which has achieved a turnover of 230 million euros in 2011, continues to have the ambition of posting 400 points sales and a 10% market share in France by 2015 (against currently 7%). The brand revealed last week an ambitious renovation program of its store concept that intends to be ""friendly, attractive, bright and warm."" A Project, matured over two years with the objective to rejuvenate (the average age of loyalty card holders is currently of 45 years of age) and to broaden the customer base. Two goals well on track to being achieved as the brand has announced a 20% increase in attendance and a 15% increase in sales in its renovated stores. Designed with the Versions and Raymond Interactive agencies, this new store concept intends to convey the values of the brand, especially proximity and accessibility. Wood provides its warmth to a store arrangement where furniture and light wall surfaces give a feeling of space and clarity. Colours provide a bright touch to the whole setting and enable to delimit the different perfume areas inside the store. Indeed, a special effort was made to make the offer much clearer, with in particular, a coloured Plexiglas signage, backlit by LEDs. The different areas being themselves segmented in brands. A dedicated sound signature was also developed by Mood Media. The new concept was tested in a pilot store in Bergerac and deployed since August in the franchised stores in Pont-Audemer, Rennes (Saint-Grégoire and Alma) and the retailer has set itself an objective is to implement the concept in at least twenty perfume-institutes each year. Dedicated furniture was designed to specifically enhance selective make-up brands in a harmonized atmosphere. Check-outs were designed to become an area fostering service, impulse purchases and to give extra visibility to loyalty cards and to the rates in beauty parlours. Service areas (makeup, nail care) are scattered throughout the store. Finally, the Beauty Success brand itself (approximately 400 references of bath and make-up products) has its dedicated areas, at the store entrance. The company has also undertaken a complete renovation of its make-up line which will be launched next year. Concerning beauty parlours, Beauty Success has imagined six different atmospheres (""bubbles""), tropical ocean, eastern, mineral, northern solar. Each point of sale, depending both on the number of cabins it has and of its customers can choose one, two or three atmospheres. More than 40 stores are already equipped with these new cabin concepts and Beauty Success has set a goal of reaching 250 beauty salons in line with this concept within 5 years. The company sees the beauty parlour, which is a key place for retention and value added, as a significant growth vector, provided services are made truly accessible. Currently, only 10% of the clientele of perfumeries also attended the beauty parlours. This is why, alongside its partnerships with major brands in the industry, Beauty Success has also developed its own skincare card and proprietary protocols claiming an ""excellent price/quality ratio."" In addition, the beauty parlour is also perceived as the natural link between the world of perfumery and the drugstore. One of Beauty Success's other major challenge is to succeed with its development in the drugstore circuit. The retailer has already opened four outlets of this type, including a franchised one since October 15, 2012 at Claira-Perpignan. ""Depending of the catchment area and on the potential available space - an area of at least 250 m² is necessary to establish a drugstore in addition to a perfumery and a beauty parlour - we will explore all the opportunities,"" said Georges. ""This is a new activity for the brand, not additional shelf-space. There is a direct and separate entrance to the store; it cannot just be a corner. But the entire store is accessible with the same loyalty card."" To comply with the requirements of the sector, this area is run by a pharmacist. The architectural concept is based on the one of perfumeries but it was been adapted with simpler, more neutral showcases and gondolas. ""Beauty Success drugstores are particularly suited to the types of flow of people seen in shopping centres."" Outside France, the Beauty Success brand is already present in Morocco, where it represents before Marionnaud, the second distribution network dedicated to beauty. But by their own admission, retailer officials explained that the brand's successful implantation in this country was more the result of a happy combination of circumstances than that of a strategy of exportation of the concept. However, it is seriously considered and expected to materialize as of 2014."
Natural cosmetics: Distribution is key to success in a slowing European market,"According to Organic Monitor, the European natural and organic personal care products market should record single-digit growth this year, for the first time over the last decade. The latest research of the London-based company shows the growth rate has dropped from double-digits because of the ""debt crisis"" impacting retailers and consumer expenditure. The UK market has been the most adversely affected by the crisis. Revenues have been slowly increasing by about 6% per annum since the financial crisis started in 2008. The harsh retail environment - with some historical high-street players such as Woolworth going bankrupt - has led many UK natural and organic brands to target export markets for growth. Indeed, many British brands have made significant inroads in the Nordic market. Some like Bulldog have gone further a field, exporting to the US, Australia as well as to parts of Europe. Germany is showing sluggish growth this year. This is a bad news for natural and organic beauty brands since the country has the largest market for these products and also leads in terms of market share; natural and organic products comprise 7% of total personal care products. Organic Monitor also notes that private labels have had most success in the German market, with Alverde of DM drugstores being the third leading natural brand, housing over 300 products. In France, where the market has witnessed the largest number of new product launches in recent years, competition is at the highest. ""Many large cosmetic companies have introduced natural and organic lines. L'Oreal is marketing a range of products under popular brands, such as Garnier, Ushuaïa, Biotherm and Mixa. Other multinationals, including Henkel and Unilever, have also developed certified organic lines for the French market. Although mass market distribution has increased significantly, the channel comprises less then 15% of natural and organic personal care product sales,"" says Organic Monitor. Rising competition and slowing market growth rates are not only pushing brands towards export markets but also lead them to explore new retail channels. While specialist retailers - the traditional channel for natural and organic brands - still comprise most sales, with 40% market share, Organic Monitor observes that brands are making most inroads in drugstores, pharmacies, beauty retailers and department store. Dr. Hauschka, for instance, is targeting high-end outlets, including beauty retailers and department stores. The Jerodia group (Phyt's, Bionatural, Gamarde, Françoise Morice, Institut Jerodia), through its Gamarde brand, tries to strengthen its position in para-pharmacies, whilst Primavera is targeting the spa channel. Many are taking the direct route and opening concept stores. Korres and Melvita are frontrunners with their international retail networks. As far as mass market is concerned, although many supermarkets and hypermarkets have launched private label ranges, the crisis is not boosting the organic segment in this channel and its market share remains below 10% at the European level. In its upcoming European market report [1], Organic Monitor expects market growth rates to recover as economic conditions improve. ""However, competition is expected to remain intense as natural and organic brands increasingly jostle for shelf-space with large cosmetic firms. Brands that have a clear strategy in terms of product offering or distribution are expected to succeed in the changing market landscape,"" explains the market research firm. Organic Monitor will also give an update on the European natural and organic personal care products market in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which will be held on 21-23rd November 2012, at the Crowne Plaza Paris-République hotel, Paris, France."
"Mascara, the flagship product of colour cosmetics","Language, power of conviction, self-expression, the look has thousands of facets and eye make-up, thousands of aspects. ""Eyes probably have the longest recorded history in make-up, all the elements have a role to play: the eye shape, eyebrows, eyelashes, the colour of iris are all factors that contribute to the specificity of make-up depending of countries,"" explained Florence Bernardin, General Manager of Information et Inspiration and Hélène Capgras, Director of Brain for Beauty at a conference organized in November 2011 by the CEW France Association on eye make-up in the world. And eye make-up very often involves using mascara, a product invented in its modern version at the beginning of the last century by TL Williams, a chemist by profession for his sister Maybel, which will give birth to Maybelline. We know what happened afterwards... Depending on regions, make-up habits are different and often find their roots in ancient traditions. ""In India, kajal or kohl according to Ayurvedic tradition was used to fix dirt and dust, as a sunscreen or to refresh and brighten the eyes, it was both a make-up and a skincare product. Women used to prepare it themselves from ghee or clarified butter,"" explains Florence Bernardin. Nowadays, this tradition is found in India in the importance placed in the eye make-up. The products used (kohl and mascara) must enlarge the eyes and accentuate their expression, Almond shaped eyes are idealized. In Japan, where the ideal is to have manga eyes, eyelashes should be XXXL but require, due to their scarcity and implantation, the use of specific mascara formulas. Recently, says Bernardin, ""a new solution has been found for the make-up of the eyelashes of Japanese women with the very popular use of false eyelashes. Applied using an expert hand, they can be removed in the evening without using a make-up remover, are re-usable and offer an infinite variety of looks."" However, mascaras are not outdone and are seeking to find a new dimension in Asia, in particular ""by offering mini brushes to catch all the little lashes, by treating lashes with anti-aging serum effects or by becoming an identifiable and statuary object,"" she added. In the U.S., a country where innovation is a sales driver for make-up products, claims are getting increasingly sophisticated. ""There is a quest for perfection and eternal youth that is also noticeable at the level of eyelashes. In 2009, Latisse was the first brand to launch a product designed to promote the growth of eyelashes. Since then, have appeared on the market, booster mascaras, booster serums and now booster eyeliners"" emphasised Capgras. On the contrary, according to the study conducted by Bernardin and Capgras on behalf of CEW France, eye make-up remains secondary in Brazil. ""To have accentuated eyes is extremely important, but eye make-up is recent and comes after the making up of the mouth and nails, Brazilian women are just beginning to use mascara,"" they added. In Europe, the mascara market could weigh 800 million euros and represent 50% of the eye products market and about 15% of the total make-up segment. European women are over 54% to believe they cannot do without their mascara, while they are only 18% to say the same about their foundation product! Even though it is hard to obtain an accurate estimate in volume of the global market of mascara, main players agree most often on the figure of around one billion units sold annually. While the ongoing success of this product could not be denied most manufacturers have announced plans to expand their production capacity. ""To meet the growing demand from our customers, we have increased this year by more than four the surface of our factory to reach 7000 m2 (75,000sq ft),"" acknowledges Renato Ancorotti, the CEO of the Ancorotti Cosmetics company founded in 2009 and specializes in the formulation of eye make-up products. A growth also visible in the turnover of the company with a 30% leap between 2010 and 2012 estimates. ""The mascara market is doing well and growth drivers still exist,"" underlined Ancorotti. At Luxcos, the entity of IL Cosmetics specialized in mascara, results also confirm the strength of the market. ""Sales for this product have increased by more than 40% between 2010 and 2011,"" confirmed Pauline Starck, Make-Up Business Developer. This point of view is shared by Geka officials, one of the world leaders in complete packaging systems for cosmetics including mascara brushes. ""We we are currently building a new unit to expand our capacity. Mascaras are enjoying a growing demand from our customers,"" confirms Pilar Gonzalez, Head of Marketing and Communication for Geka. Albéa, a leading supplier of mascara brushes, who has been operating in this field for more than 30 years, is also increasing its production capacity by grouping two Italian production units on the same site. ""We are planning to group two of our Italian based factories to increase our production capacity and thus absorb more growth. Mascara is a segment that represents 50% of our share in make-up and which is growing rapidly. We are heavily investing both in research and industrialization,"" added Aurélie Emond Creative and Innovation Marketing Director. If one takes a look at the figures concerning supermarkets in France [1] , the eye make-up sector has increased in 2011/2012 by 1.9% obviously way behind the nail polish sector with 17% but nonetheless a very honourable performance compared to lipsticks with a drop of -4.7% or foundations with -3.7%. Finally, the recent study undertaken by Mintel [2] on make-up habits of teens (9-11 years old) and tweens (9-17years old), clients-to-be, shows that mascara is the second most used product after lip gloss. 33% of girls aged 9 to 17 say they wear mascara every day against 37% for lip gloss, 27% for eyeliner and only 16% for foundation. Habits that augur good prospects for mascara which has not yet conquered all categories of people like men, for example!"
Cosmetics retail market in Central Europe to grow by 1.5% in 2012,"The economic environment in Central Europe remains dull, in particular when compared to the 2008-2009 period. According to specialised market research firm PMR Publications, the difficult and uncertain situation on the Central Europe labour markets, as well as fiscal austerity measures (wage and staff cuts in public administrations in Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, as well as VAT increases in Poland and Slovakia), constrained the income of households and their propensity to consume thus directly impacting the cosmetics market. Total sales of cosmetics in Central Europe grew by 2.3% (at local currencies) in 2011 and reached the value of EUR 8.6bn. The highest increase, of 3.2%, was recorded in Poland, which accounts for more than a half of total cosmetics' sales in the region, as indicated in the latest PMR Publications' report. [1] ""In 2012 the overall value of the Central Europe cosmetics market is expected to grow further, though only at a rate of 1.5%,"" says Patrycja Nalepa, Senior Retail Analyst at PMR Publications. Two countries, namely Bulgaria and Slovakia, are predicted to see higher growth rates compared to 2011. Romania and Poland will be growing the fastest with a rate of 2.2%. ""In the case of Romania this is, however, much lower than previously predicted. The initial expectations of many players on the Romanian cosmetics market, who had indicated a growth of their sales this year ranging between less than 10% and others a two-digit surge, have been tempered during 2012,"" comments Patrycja Nalepa. PMR Publications also forecasts that Czech Republic and Hungary will experience decrease in cosmetics sales in 2012. ""In Hungary, macroeconomic indicators are again deteriorating in 2012,"" explains the firm, and ""sales by volume are not expected to grow during next years."" In the Czech Republic both economy and private consumption are declining and growth of wages does not offset rising prices. However, for 2013 and 2014, PMR Publications deem that sales of cosmetics will eventually increase in all the countries in the region."
Halal cosmetics gain popularity in Asia,"Halal is an Arabic word which means permissible or lawful, by opposition to Haram which means prohibited. Therefore Halal (permitted) products are those that do not contain Haram (prohibited) ingredients. The list of products prohibited under the Islamic law (sharia) includes pork or pork by-products, animals that are dead or dying prior to slaughter, blood and blood by-products, carnivorous animals, birds of prey, land animals without external ears, ethanol... As far as cosmetics are concerned, there are several ingredients that can be of concern to Muslim consumers eager to extend their respect of the Islamic law to this product category. Possibly problematic ingredients include: allantoin, ambergris, collagen, elastin, ethanol, gelatine, tallow and tallow derivatives, etc. According to Organic Monitor, ""the Halal label has been gaining popularity in the cosmetics industry since the Malaysian government introduced the Halal cosmetics standard (MS 2200: 2008) in June 2010."" The Halal label is given to cosmetic and personal care products that meet the Islamic religious rules, in particular regarding permitted and prohibited ingredients. It ""appeals to Muslim consumers seeking integrity and authenticity in their cosmetic and personal care products."" Depending on sources and their definition of what is a Halal cosmetic product, global annual sales of Halal cosmetics are estimated from 5 to 14 billion US dollars. Focusing on Halal-certified cosmetics, Organic Monitor considers global sales can be estimated at above USD 5 billion. ""At present, 57 certification agencies are authorised to certify products according to the Halal cosmetics standard. Although the highest adoption rates are in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, certification is also catching on in Europe and North America. In the latter regions, a growing number of Muslim consumers are interested in Halal certified products,"" says the market research firm. Asia, which hosts more than 60% of the world's Muslim population, is one of the first market for Halal cosmetics, together with the Middle East, (in particular Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates). ""A growing number of cosmetic and ingredient firms are taking up Halal certification in Asia. The highest adoption rates are in Muslim countries where multinationals that include Colgate-Palmolive and Avon have launched certified products. International chemical firms like BASF and CP Kelco are also getting ingredients certified for these markets."" However, according to Organic Monitor, Halal personal care products often fall short in terms of their ecological credentials since, apart from ingredients prohibited by the sharia, the formulations are similar to conventional cosmetics. ""Realising this, some companies have started to formulate natural / organic cosmetics with Halal certification. Saaf Pure Skincare was launched in the UK to appeal to Muslim consumers seeking organic skincare products that adhere to Sharia principles. The products are certified organic by the Soil Association and certified Halal by European Halal Services. The brand is developing an international presence, with products exported to Europe, the Middle-East and North America,"" points out the market research firm. Organic Monitor sees high potential for such products in the Middle-East and Asia. In many of these countries, the market for natural and organic cosmetics is growing by over 20% a year. Rising consumer affluence, coupled with growing knowledge of cosmetic ingredients, is making consumers pay a premium for cosmetics that meet their ethical and religious beliefs. However, with a lack of local brands of natural & organic cosmetics in these regions, there is a clear gap in the marketplace. ""A major challenge is formulating cosmetic products that meet two or more standards, as many European brands have discovered."" The potential of halal cosmetics, and formulation challenges of developing natural and organic personal care products, will be featured in the Asia-Pacific edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit. Taking place in Hong Kong on 12-13th November 2012, the summit will discuss the growing role of labels (Halal, natural, organic, cruelty-free, etc.) in the Asian cosmetics industry."
Luxe Pack 2012: sensoriality under the spotlights,"Materials that have the appearance of something else, new tactile and visual experiences, pumps that cover fragrance users with a cloud of scent: the 2012 edition of Luxe Pack, which was held in Monaco from the 24th to 26th October 2012, was placed under the sign of the senses. Perhaps, as mentioned the experts of Luxe Pack Trends Observer, it is the result of a growing need for astonishment from consumers who have gained much more expertise. The trend has even conquered the Pack & Green prize, which for the third consecutive year, highlighted the environmental solutions and innovations presented by exhibitors. Indeed, the jury [1] awarded Favini, the Italian paper manufacturer, for its Crush paper line. Crush is a new eco-friendly range of papers made using process residues from organic products to replace up to 15 percent of virgin tree pulp. By-products from citrus fruits, corn coffee, kiwi fruits, hazelnuts and almonds, which would normally be processed as fillers in animal food and fertilizers or simply dumped as landfill, are among the natural materials used. Elements of each different material are visible on the surface of the paper giving it a distinctive texture and appearance. Premium Beauty News offers a visual overview of the main novelties found on the show:"
Jewellery and niche fragrances shine in the US,"According to The NPD Group, a market research company specialising prestige cosmetic products, the prestige fragrance industry showed robust sales of 1.6 billion dollars (1.24 euros) in U.S. department stores year-to-date (January to September 2012), with men's fragrance sales growing slightly faster than women's. Designer fragrances, which accounts for nearly three quarters of the total U.S. market, grew the same rate of the overall category performance, while jewellery and niche prestige fragrances almost tripled. Jewellery fragrance brands like Boucheron, Bulgari, and Cartier and niche fragrance brands like Creed and Jo Malone helped to take this segment of the fragrance category to double-digit growth in the first nine months of the year. ""The fragrance brands that are being sold in more selective distribution are experiencing explosive growth. We've seen this trend with high-end designer brands like Tom Ford and Jimmy Choo and this is also evident today with jewelry and niche fragrance brands,"" said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. ""Even though niche and jewelry brands make up only nine percent of the total prestige fragrance market they are creating a new dynamic in the larger fragrance arena. They are growing faster than any other type of fragrance in the prestige space and their combined sales are actually more than double the size of prestige celebrity fragrances."" In addition to niche and jewellery brands experiencing the largest dollar growth, they generate sales at one of the highest average price points in the prestige fragrance market. While the average price in women's and men's for these fragrances are about 70 US dollars, selections in this space may be in excess of 350 US dollars and leading brands are often in the 200 US dollars range. ""It is quite a compelling story that despite the economic uncertainties that prevail, we continue to see sizable pockets of growth in prestige fragrance. And, when one considers the price, these fragrances are often treasures and truly an investment,"" said Grant. ""Yet, if we were to compare the scope of the premium market in countries like France, the U.S. still has significant opportunity to expand sales further in this frontier. Consumers are continuing to invest where they see the value,"" ended Grant. Source: The NPD Group"
The packaging of luxury brands tries to appeal expert consumers,"Design, creative packaging and graphics professionals, as well as a sociologist and an expert in market research and forecasting, gathered within the Luxe Pack Trends Observer [1], have identified this year four major trends for luxury packaging: The Hyper Material, Pink Lights Up, My Little Show Off, Back to Front. In our hyper-visual technological environment, tactility becomes luxury and pleasure. In the same time, technological advances enable industrials to give materials the appearance of something else: cardboard, thanks to complex printing, lacquering and embossing, transforms into wood, metal or leather. ""Metal is transformed into leather or fabric, while glass and plastic are covered with ever more surprising tactile effects,"" highlights Lan Vu, founder of Beautystreams. With increasingly demanding consumers, that have gained more expertise, who want to be surprised and need to dream, who spend a lot of time in front of screens and digitize their lives, industrial tools have become more efficient to address new sensory needs. Emblematic of a society that is not completely certain to have exited from the recession, but which is fed up with the gloom, pink - the colour of happiness - is treated on the mood of depth, sophistication, seduction and sensuality. ""We're no longer in a girly regression,"" notes Rémy Oudghiri, director of the corporate strategy and trends & future studies departments of Ipsos Public Affairs. According to Oudghiri, ""the desire for pink is very strong today in mature countries."" Especially since, as highlights Jean-Paul Cournillou, director of the packaging and retail department at the Strate Collège, ""pink can oppose to other senses, as in the case of the grenade Viktor & Rolf."" While the bling did not survive the recession, the normality supposed to succeed it might be too boring. Actually, overt bling is rather being succeeded by controlled bling for those who want to give up overly eye-catching and fun, but rather do it more discreetly. ""A new style of luxury is taking hold, less oriented towards the desire of admiration from others and more towards the search for experiential and aesthetic pleasures,"" says Isabelle Musnik, content and editorial manager at INfluencia. Contrary to what we might think, this trend is not limited to mature markets but begins to spread to emerging ones. Thus, Rémy Oudghiri observes that in Russia and China ""the move towards greater measure of discretion, distinction"" is growing. « The sacred has become no secret, » laughs Béatrice Mariotti, vice chairwoman, Carré Noir. Like Replica, the three fragrances from Maison Martin Margiela, that show their ingredients on their front label and use it as the base of their decoration, brands are trying to define their expertise by displaying it. Here again we find the expert consumers, who are, according to Rémy Oudghiri, ""increasingly fond of details and product culture."" Consumers that are not only looking for a status, but for expertise, knowledge, and experiences too."
Internet: a challenge and an advantage for selective perfumery,"In 2011 in France, online sales accounted for only 2% of the turnover of selective perfumery retailers. However, online sales of perfumes and cosmetics in upscale scores scored much higher in some other European countries such as: Austria (6%) and the Czech Republic (20%). While these figures show an important development potential, it is nevertheless important to remember that online sales are far from being the only big stake in this business. For William Koeberlé, chairman of the Marionnaud group and of the French Federation of Selective Perfumery (FFPS), internet is now fully integrated in a retailer's business. ""Two-thirds of shoppers visit the web for information on the products and on innovations,"" he said. An opinion which is fully shared by Franck Lehuédé, Senior Project Manager at the Consumer Department of Crédoc, a French research firm specialising in consumer studies. ""Internet is about purchase, but internet is also, specifically, about purchase preparation."" Thus, both brands and retailers strive to follow their clients on Google, blogs, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or Pinterest. For Robert Leygues, President of the European Federation of perfumery retail trade (FEPD), the development of e-commerce fits quite naturally in the irreversible logic of an increasingly digital world: ""We must learn to live intelligently aside this form of commerce and take advantage of the web whenever possible."" For all the operators, ""it is a permanent training process in order to invest these multiple channels and not lose sight of the consumer,"" said William Koeberlé. For retailers, there is no doubt: Internet will become a major media to influence consumers' choices and preferences. In much of Europe, consumers are convinced that their purchasing power would decline in the coming years. They will have, in particular, to face with the continuous increase of their ""unavoidable spending"" - such as housing, food and energy - which now represent 33% of the budget of French households, against 25% in the 1960s. In spite of this negative outlook, the Crédoc's researchers observe, among French consumers, a strong desire to invest in knowledge, not only in professional knowledge but also in personal knowledge, which is associated with ""a strong investment in self-image"" and eventually in personal appearance. Enough to leave rather high hopes to the industry of cosmetics. In order to succeed in the game, Franck Lehuédé thinks industry should place innovation at the centre of new product developments and be able to reassure consumers about ""the ethics of products,"" including consideration on issues such as climate change, biodiversity preservation and fair trade with small producers. But if the internet can be a great tool for placing consumer insights at the heart of a development strategy, it can also be used for harmful practices, especially in a difficult economic environment. Cybersquatting practices, purchasing of sponsored links, development of rogue websites [1] or illegal use of consumer-to-consumer commercial websites (such as e-bay, LeBonCoin.fr, dinkos.com.au, etc.) have contributed a huge development of the trade of counterfeit goods and parasitic grey markets. So much so that ""on the internet, counterfeiters are always ahead of brands,"" said according to Manlio Pizzorni, Regional Vice President Western Europe and Middle East, Coty Prestige. As far as the FFPS is concerned, the trade association recalls it fully supports the development of this new distribution channel provided it keeps strictly compliant with the rules of selective distribution. That would normally prohibit pure players to distribute high end products from being distributed in the selective network in Europe. ""That is why the French Federation of Selective Perfumery (FFPS), with the support of its members, while reaffirming its commitment to respect the free competition principle, especially in the field of online sales, has decided to raise the awareness and French and European authorities regarding the risk that may represent the development of e-commerce websites by pure players selling perfumes and cosmetics away from the European legal framework,"" concludes William Koeberlé."
"""Emerging countries will soon represent more than half of the global cosmetics market,"" Muriel Lartigue, UBIFRANCE","Premium Beauty News - Can you describe UBIFRANCE to us, in particular its activity in the cosmetics industry? Muriel Lartigue - UBIFRANCE, the French agency for export promotion, aims to assist French companies in their efforts to export: from guiding them on the markets to linking with foreign operators and developing business relations. To fulfil this mission, we rely on our overseas offices that form a multicultural network now present in 60 countries. We have almost 880 employees outside France, of which a hundred at the disposal of French cosmetics companies. The main personalized services offered by UBIFRANCE include: the identification of potential markets, the information on industry opportunities and regulatory issues, the identification of potential business partners, boosting French companies' visibility in the press abroad, strengthening human resources abroad through International Corporate Volunteering. Thanks to their dynamism, innovation and international reputation, the French cosmetics industry is a major asset for our trade balance. It is therefore very important that companies of this sector may enjoy the benefice from a personalized international support over time. Premium Beauty News - UBIFRANCE organizes business meetings (with the operators of the luxury sector in China, for example, in April 2013, or those of the cosmetics industry in South Korea in November 2013), how do they work? Muriel Lartigue - The collective support of companies is an important part of the services we offer to the industry. This can be achieved through the sponsorship of two types of events: French pavilions on major international and regional exhibitions (Cosmoprof Asia, Beauty World Middle East, Cosmoprof Bologna, Intercharm Moscow, In-Cosmetics, etc.) and the business meetings that provide an opportunity for companies to explore new markets. These business meetings are usually held on 2-3 days and gather around 8 to 10 companies. They consist of a common component (informative seminar, visits of outlets, etc.) and a program of targeted meetings with local operators, according to specifications previously defined with each participating company. The collective operations are undeniably generating business. A survey to measure the business impact of our services, which was entrusted to ISPOS, showed that in 2011, eight out of ten UBIFRANCE corporate clients identified potential customers, previously unknown to them, and that six have signed an order or established a business relationship with a positive outlook. Premium Beauty News - In December, UBIFRANCE organizes the ""Rencontres Internationales de la Beauté"" (International Beauty Meetings""). Muriel Lartigue - This is a first in this sector. Building on the success of the meetings that we organize already in the health and digital industries for instance, we deemed logical to duplicate the formula to support the beauty industry. The goal of this event is to enable companies in the beauty industry to meet during one day with industry experts from around fifteen different countries (Brazil, United States, Korea South China, etc.) as well as with our partners such as Oseo, Coface and INPI, to discuss the issues they have to solve when exporting. Also, it will be the opportunity to take on industry trends and the market access issues in these countries. The day will consist of a plenary session in the morning during which we will discuss major trends in mature and emerging markets with our experts and a panel of companies that will share their experience. Discussions will be continued during a networking lunch, before the second part of the day: face-to-face meetings between with our experts. Sponsored by STIO (a freight forwarder and logistics company), the event is free of charge for participating companies. Our ambition is to grow it as a key annual meeting for international development in the cosmetics industry, thanks to the support of all major stakeholders in the sector. The entire cosmetic industry is concerned: manufacturers of finished goods, suppliers and service providers to the cosmetics industry, not to mention the manufacturers of dietary supplements. Premium Beauty News - UBIFRANCE thus appears as a true market observation tool. What do you see as the major trends and developments in the global cosmetics market? Muriel Lartigue - While the cosmetics market is also impacted by the current crisis, it remains dynamic and is expected to grow at about 4% in 2012. However, this good rate hides important disparities between geographical areas. Europe is certainly the area where the impact is the highest, but it remains the largest market for French cosmetics makers. Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy were still in the top 5 destinations of French exports of cosmetic products in 2011. Actually, historic markets (Western Europe, USA, Japan) dramatically contrast with emerging markets in terms of dynamism. In the short term, some emerging markets - first and foremost China, Brazil and Russia - will account for more than half of the global consumption. Russia already ranks as the 7th destination of French cosmetic products and China ranks 11th. As far as trends are concerned, over recent years we have observed deep movements affecting several countries at varying degrees: the growing importance of organic and natural products, strong market segmentation with the development of products for men, children / teenagers and elderly people. Furthermore, more technical products have emerged and distribution networks have diversified, in particular with the emergence of alternative channels. These underlying trends should not hide the strong specificities of the various markets that may be cultural, sociological, climatic and regulatory. They also have a significant impact on the opportunities offered by each market, in particular in terms of accessibility. Any company wishing to expand internationally should understand these characteristics. Similarly, the rise of competition cannot be ignored by French companies. I'm pleased to invite the cosmetics industry to discuss these issues on the occasion of the first edition of the Rencontres Internationales de la Beauté, which will be held on December 11, in UBIFRANCE's premises."
Dassault Systèmes simulates consumers' in-store shopping experience,"The know-how acquired by Dassault Systèmes in the aviation industry, then in industries with high complexity products, became available in recent years to the areas of consumer goods and retail. ""We have adapted and developed solutions for businesses where knowing the consumer and its behavior is the main issue,"" explains Philippe Loeb, Vice President Consumer Packaged Goods - Retail at Dassault Systèmes. Precisely, in order to better meet the needs of these sectors the world leader in 3D design software has changed its organization to create 12 divisions corresponding to specific industrial sectors, including one devoted to consumer goods and distribution. Dassault Systèmes thus offers a software series designed to facilitate the marketing of consumer products [1], focusing on the complete social industry experience from ""idea to consumer."" Perfect Shelf is the latest product in the series ""the idea of the consumer."" This new software leverages advanced 3D modeling and visualization to provide realistic views of retail aisles including shelves, fixtures, products, lighting and promotional materials, in order to ease and accelerate the design process of the consumer's in-store shopping experience. Computerized modeling offers a great flexibility and extends possibilities at lower cost. Thus, both brands and retailers can design virtual shelf layouts and stock them with realistic 3D product representations built from 2D pictures. Perfect Shelf industry solution experience incorporates, and connects digitally, many business scenarios in the areas of Category Management and Space Planning such as new packaging introduction, category assessment, consumer decision trees, in context assortments review, adjacencies and sales materials. Also, it quickly adapts shelving plans to store specifics and then helps store employees execute these plans 'right the first time'. Another feature highlighted by Dassault Systèmes: the ease of use. ""Obviously we adapt our soft-wares to their users, as the expectations of a marketing specialist are not those of an engineer,"" says Philippe Loeb. When both brands of consumer packaged goods and retailers want to ensure that every consumer, in every store can find what they want, when they want it - and do so quickly and easily, Perfect Shelf also appears as a conviction tool to recommend shelving scenarios that have the potential to enhance both the brand's and the retailer's category revenue."
"Indian cosmetics market to register a 17% annual growth up to 2015, says new research","The Indian cosmetics sector is expected to expand remarkably in near future, according to a new research report by RNCOS: Indian Cosmetic Sector Forecast to 2015. Indeed, the influence of western culture, rising beauty concerns among both men and women and robust media promotion combine with rising purchasing power and growing fashion consciousness to boost the demand. As a consequence, says RNCOS, the Indian cosmetic market is likely to register a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 17% during 2011-2015. Hair care should be one of the market's main drivers along the very next years. According to RNCOS, this product category is anticipated to register a strong double-digit growth during 2012-2015. ""The Indian hair care market, which comprises hair oil, shampoos, hair colorants, conditioners, and styling agents, has shown strong growth over the past few years. Various factors, such as shift in consumer behaviour, growing purchasing power, gradually changing lifestyle, and product awareness continue to fuel growth in this market. Moreover, Indian consumers are becoming more conscious about their looks and showing promising purchase patterns which are further initiating strong growth in the coming years,"" says the market research firm. RNCOS also notes that men cosmetic products are becoming popular in India where male consumers are willing to pay premium price for cosmetics products that are developed specially for them. The men's segment is estimated to occupy around one-third of the total cosmetics market and the increasing demand from men users stimulates the emergence of new players specialising in male cosmetic products. ""Rising awareness, increasing influence of western world, product availability, and changing lifestyle are the main driving forces propelling the male cosmetics industry and the segment is expected to surge at a CAGR of more than 18% during 2011-2015,"" forecasts RNCOS. ""From visiting parlours for manicures and pedicures to spas, Indian men are concentrating on every aspect of grooming. Face-care (skin whitening) creams and lotions, in particular, are catching attention of Indian men. Deodorants also play an equally important role in the male cosmetic market of India."""
United Kingdom: Colour cosmetics market set to grow,"Eight out of ten British women feel more confident when wearing make-up. In such a context, no surprise that sales of colour cosmetics are, once again, proved recession-proof. ""Sales in the market have continued to grow and will continue to do so for as long as the market delivers the feel-good factor even if the economy cannot,"" says Vivenne Rudd, Head of Beauty and Personal Care Insight at Mintel.]. Indeed, according to latest research from the firm, UK retail sales of colour cosmetics put on a good performance in 2011, with market value up by over 8% from 2010 (when the market was valued at £1.28 billion) shoring up sales of £1.38 billion. Growth is expected to continue - albeit at a slower pace - into 2012 and beyond, to achieve an estimated market worth £1.44 billion (1.80 euros) in 2012. Face colour cosmetics remains the largest of the four makeup sectors (face, eyes, lips and nails), accounting for 38% of total market value at £526 million. The remainder of the sales are made up of ""eyes"" valued at £410 million (accounting for 30% of total sales), ""lips"" valued at £224 million (accounting for 16% of sector sales) and ""nails"" worth £221 million - accounting for 15% of the market. Although accounting for the smallest number of sales, nail make-up was the real star performer of the UK colour cosmetics market in 2011, posting double-digit growth to reach a value of £221 million compared to £179m in 2010. Indeed, Mintel's research shows users of nail varnish have risen from 52% of women in 2007 to an impressive 61% in 2011. And it is not just Britain which has seen a rise in interest in nail colour cosmetics. Indeed, this has been the case across Europe as a whole. In 2008, nail colour cosmetics accounted for 10% of all colour cosmetic launches, by 2012, this had risen to 26% of all new launches in the sector. In terms of launch activity by region, the UK was the most active region, accounting for 29% of all new product activity in the colour cosmetics market during 2012, this was followed by Germany accounting for 22% of all activity and France which accounted for 20% of activity. ""In terms of colour, nails have stolen the limelight from eyes and lips, and have become an arena for self-expression in the form of nail art. While the prim, ladylike look of French manicured nails is unlikely to ever go out of style, recent trends have covered less subtle, even outrageous looks ranging from two-tone manicures and classic red polish to ombre and metallic shades. Nail make-up has also witnessed one of the biggest increases of all core beauty sectors in its consumer base in recent years,"" comments Vivienne Rudd."
Creative perfumery attempts to make its way in France,"Latest episode to date, the opening at the end of June, of a new perfume shop named Nose, in a pedestrian area in the centre of Paris, near the Place des Victoires and the Sentier, but a quite away from the main tourist hotspots. ""The customers we are targeting are the Parisians, the neighbourhood and the curious ones, those who are interested in niche perfumes. Of course, foreigners and those on the lookout for the latest trends and fashions are also paying a visit, but they are not our main target,"" explains Nicolas Cloutier, co-founder and President of Nose. [1] Does that mean there is room in France for alternative fragrance brands and retailers? ""Nose was born from the observation that most niche fragrance brands are French, but usually make more business abroad than in France,"" says Silvio Levi, one of the seven co-founders of Nose and also the founder of Esxense, the annual event dedicated to artistic perfumery in Milan. The high concentration at the retail level in France (perfumery chains, such Marionnaud, Sephora and Nocibé, hold more than 70% of the market) makes the environment even more difficult for small brands. A situation contrasting with the Italian retail structure where there is a much higher rate of independent operators, including an interesting proportion that is very interested in alternative perfumes. The situation is quite similar in other European countries, such as Germany, The Netherlands, or even Hungary and Rumania. ""There are 20 to 30 outlets - traditional stores or concept-stores - that take the floor against the standard offer. In Germany or in Italy there are 250 to 300 of them, with a specific knowledge about niche perfumery,"" explains François Hénin, President of Jovoy. Where French chain stores only see low-turnover products, these alternative retailers do see an opportunity to stand out from the mass and to capture demanding and rather affluent customers. Though, French consumers have repeatedly shown their interest in original brands, with a limited distribution, when they succeeded in gaining visibility, by entering in department or concept stores or by opening their own outlets. According to Nicolas Cloutier, ""buyers of niche brands were already there, but nobody - or hardly anybody - was addressing their demand,"" . A rather curious situation indeed, where an abundant offer was coexisting with a real demand but where structured intermediates were lacking. While some perfumeries outside Paris - Parfumerie de l'Opéra in Bordeaux, Parfumerie Santa Rosa in Toulouse, or Parfumerie du Soleil d'Or in Lille - have proposed a real alternative offer to their customers, they had no equivalent in Paris, where the offer was fragmented between brand owned stores, department stores and fashion concept stores such as Colette or L'Éclaireur. ""We thought that this situation could led to the resurgence of alternative retailers in France and that there was a huge opportunity to rebuild a distribution network for niche brands in this country,"" explains Silvio Levi. In order to expand the distribution and spread the culture of creative perfumery with both customers and distributors, Francois Hénin, imagined an original concept: the perfumery in a trunk. ""There are two barriers that prevent small niche brands from being accepted by traditional retailers: lack of cash on the one hand and lack of shelf space on the other hand,"" he says. To circumvent these barriers, he developed a wheeled-trunk capable of carrying 16 different bestselling items. The trunk occupies only a small space on the ground and the retailer only has to fund the purchase of a limited number of products. The trunk can also be placed in hotels or spas. ""It is an idea among others, but we are considering other potential concepts such as pop-up retail shops in a high traffic area, or the reproduction of our concept in the form of small size franchises, from 30 to 40 m2,"" concludes Hénin. In this market, retailers cannot simply differentiate themselves with their range of products. Since creative perfumery is refocusing on the fragrance rather than on packaging and advertising, customers needs a lot of education and assistance. At Nose, they have conceived a dedicated tool that helps choosing the right perfume, but always with the help and with the explanations of a shop assistant. An innovative tool that could appeal customers in search for different products and help to enter into a virtuous circle of market development. ""The more we improve the distribution network, the more demand will increase,"" insists Silvio Levi."
MakeUp in New York: number of visitors skyrockets,"After a very positive first edition in 2011, MakeUp in New York, which hosted 40% additional exhibitors this year, has kept its promises. Indeed, more than 1,000 people (1,036 exactly, according to the organizers counts), came to visit the second edition of the event, which took place last week on September 12 and 13, two blocks from the Madison Square Garden. ""This 2012 edition was taking place on three levels, one more than the previous year, also representing 50% extra surface area. Far from being a handicap, the flow of visitors was very evenly distributed between the different floors. And icing on the cake, sunshine was also part of the show for the whole week in New York enabling visitors and exhibitors to enjoy the terrace available on the last level of Studio 450,"" explain the organizers. The conferences organized for the first time this year also recorded high attendance and the small room planned for this purpose was packed during the two days with a total of more than 250 attendees. Moreover, the organizers were particularly delighted by the number of visitors coming from far beyond the greater New York metropolitan area. ""The first statistics show that visitors came both from the east coast of the United States but also from Mexico, Canada and several countries in South America. MakeUp in New York takes full advantage of its specificity as a event exclusively focused on make-up, a unique characteristic shared on the European continent by its sister event, MakeUp in Paris."" A new appointment is set in September 2013, but this time in a new venue, success requires."
"""The image we have of beauty is very naive,"" Mona Chollet","Premium Beauty News - You show throughout your essay, how women's relationship to beauty is ambivalent. It should be marked by pleasure, instead it is often marked by suffering. Mona Chollet - When it comes to beauty, most women have an ambivalent attitude. Of course, some of them are not too troubled by their appearance. But among all those for whom it is a major concern, many question themselves. They want to look beautiful and attractive, and as such, this is no problem, quite the contrary, it is very positive! But this concern is accompanied by great frustration, involving permanent dissatisfaction. In front of the mirror, one is never beautiful or thin enough. How come what should be a source of pleasure, frivolity and of lightness of mind, becomes a source of worries and suffering? That is what Beauté Fatale [1] is all about. Paying attention to one's appearance, trying to have a pleasant presence, ideally, this translates into a concern for others, a form of politeness, of keen interest to one's entourage. Moreover, women sometimes blame men for not thinking enough of the show they offer! What is alienating, is not to want to look beautiful: it is that it should become the most important, the essential thing, that it should takes the whole place and that women's identity and self-esteem should depend on that. This is what generates the feeling of moral decline if one does not reach his goal. A feeling all the more frequent that the standards of ideal beauty seem to be increasingly stringent and, as such, unattainable. Premium Beauty News - You say about this alienation that it is also a plus, a skill that many men are deprived of. Mona Chollet - It's hard to say. An aesthetic concern is in itself quite positive, but it is one of those positive values in oneself to which women are confined, trapped. What the feminist discourse is stressing on, quite rightly in my opinion, is first confinement! Nevertheless, as part of this confinement, women have developed special skills. When one learns very early to take care of oneself and of his environment, but also to develop its sensitivity and subjects of interest in certain directions rather than in others, one develops skills which are different from the men's. Let us be clear, this has nothing innate, it is merely the result of education, of transmission. The main strength of the fashion or of the cosmetic industry, just like women's magazines, is to consider this ""women's culture"" seriously. Premium Beauty News - Precisely how do you analyse, in this context, the breakthrough of men's skincare products? Mona Chollet - I have the feeling that the desire to develop the men's cosmetic market still faces many obstacles. The brands discourse still seems to have little influence on many men. When it comes to their appearance, women are in a situation of psychic insecurity which does not seem to have any equivalent in men. Concerning for example the use of cosmetic surgery, which remains a predominantly female practice, we observe that men have a much more distant, more technical approach than women. Women address cosmetic surgery as a much more intimate matter, like a truly existential, personal stake. In our society, it is primarily the role of women to embody beauty. Even if pressure is increasing on men, it is far from equalling the burden hanging on women's shoulders. And since, at the same time pressure is also building on women, the gap remains! Premium Beauty News - You insist a lot on the this obsession with thinness and the increasing number of anorexia cases. Is there not a contradiction between this obsession and the desire to be attractive? For a number of men extreme thinness is not very appealing. Mona Chollet - According to the theories of American feminists, this obsession with thinness arises when women start leaving their traditional place to set foot into the domain of men. In short, when they leave their homes to enter the active work force. For them it implies conforming to an image of professional efficiency, forged by men, and which devalues the housewife, the mothering woman. To which comes in play, I believe, a element of female guilt, a feeling of not being in their place, and also some aggressiveness versus the female body. Premium Beauty News - You mention at the end of your work a broader conception of beauty which could reconcile many women with themselves. Mona Chollet - It seems to me that the image we have of beauty is very naive. In short, it boils down to a set of ideal physical criteria that must be met as closely as possible. It is pretty well summed up by the fetishism of measurements. All this ignores the reality of relationships where seduction comes into play or of the many ways of inhabiting a body. Often people reduce my discourse to a simplistic opposition between ""inner beauty"" and ""outer beauty"". But what I mean in fact is that boundaries between appearance and psyche are much more blurred than what is generally thought. Beauty, has obviously to do with outer appearance, but also in the way we express ourselves with our body and the way we interact with others. There is no joy in perfection and it is much more desirable to be fantastic than to be perfect!"
Male grooming: market grows at rapid pace but brands need to adapt,"All surveys point to the same phenomenon: the global market for men's cosmetics is booming. According to a recent study by Kline & Company, the male skin care market has nothing of a niche market anymore. In this context, even the term ""metrosexual"" - a portmanteau word that, throughout the first decade of the century, symbolised men's new behaviour of towards beauty - has turned obsolete. ""It used to imply a certain niche group, whereas in 2012, all types of men, in urban and suburban areas, are using male grooming products,"" explains Nancy Mills, Consumer Practice Industry Manager at Kline & Company. As far as sales are concerned, it is a real emerging market, with several segments recording double-digit growth rates. Recent figures on men's grooming tools and products [1] released by The NPD Group, reveal men continue to discover the benefits of keeping up appearances. ""Men's grooming tools are among the largest dollar growth drivers in the overall personal care industry and product categories like men's facial skincare continue to grow at a fast pace,"" says the research firm in a release. According to Kline & Company, sales of men's cosmetics and toiletries in the U.S. could hit US$ 3.2 billion by 2016, up from an estimated US$2.6 billion this year and US$ 2.2 billion in 2006. As far as the European market is concerned, sales of skincare products have boomed from 289 million euros in 2005 to 420 million euros in 2010 in the continent's five biggest markets - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK - according to Mintel. The surge in sales is also affecting new markets. In China, the male grooming market should increase by more than 20% a year during 2012 to 2014, according to RNCOS. The rise of the men's cosmetics market comes together with a strong growth in sales of electrical appliances especially dedicated to men. For instance, in the 12 months ending June 2012, U.S. sales of men's electric shavers and men's trimmers gained 9 percent and 12 percent, respectively in dollar sales. According to The NPD Group, sales of facial trimmers grew 13 percent in dollar sales. Pen trimmers and nose/ear trimmers together accounted for 13 percent of men's trimmer dollars and increased 22 percent and 19 percent in units, respectively. Body groomers gained nearly 16 percent in unit sales in the 12 months ending June. Body groomers skew toward the under-35 age group and are even more popular among men under age 25. [2] There are several sociological changes concerning both mature and emerging markets that may explain this dramatic shift that has no reason to slow down: an increased number of men employed in the sector of services, increased competition in the workplace, ageing baby boomers eager to stay stylish, and the young generation influenced by changing standards of male beauty. However, the men's market is not as easy to capture as it seems. As impressive as they are impressive, growth rates do not always match the initial expectations of many manufacturers. Especially as competition has increased greatly in this market. In the U.S., over nine in ten men use some sort of grooming products today, claims The NPD Group. [3] Nevertheless, apart from the usual toiletries and from perfumes, the progress is notable only regarding a limited range of face care products. At Sothys, the French brand specialised in skin and body products sold at beauty parlours, three separate categories of targets have been considered for renewing the men's range: ""beginners"", using the bare minimum of cosmetics; ""amateurs"", they use men's products but do not hesitate to borrow those of their wife, ""confirmed users,"" who appreciate the most innovative products and want a perfect result. Because of its positioning, Sothys is perfectly aware of how difficult it is to tap into this market. ""Although men are becoming increasingly familiar with beauty products, it is not easy for them to push the door of a beauty institute."" The brand, which now generates 8 to 10% of its turnover in the men's segment thus observes that if sales are taking off in spas, they remain marginal in beauty institutes; the latter representing 90% of the Sothys' points of sale worldwide. Despite the huge potential of the men's market, both brands and retailers still need to find the most effective way to communicate with these new male consumers. ""They have still not developed specific communication strategies for men, and the sales universes are still very much women-oriented, especially in selective distribution,"" recently explained Anne Césard, project manager at French market research firm Xerfi. As far as Sothys is concerned, the answer was to develop a range of products being both simple and practical, in order to convince men, but also to enrol Vincent Clerc, an international rugby player, world cup vice-champion with the French team in 2011, as the brand's spokesmodel. The way brands speak to men is even more important as the beauty industry was historically built to address women's needs. ""Men have become increasingly conscious of the perks associated with looking good,"" says Karen Grant, The NPD Group. ""They have a heightened awareness that looking good may provide them an advantage in the workplace as well as in their personal lives. However, men have different skin than women and the men's grooming brands need to continue educating them as well as make them feel comfortable in the shopping environment to gain sales in this category,"" she adds."
MakeUp in New York opens its doors next week,"Premium Beauty News - Already the second edition of this event, which is already standing out as the major event of the make-up sector across North America! Sandra Maguarian - That's true... In the wake of the success of MakeUp in Paris and numerous demands from exhibitors, we decided to duplicate the winning concept in New York.

Boticario invests to tackle growing competition,"The Boticário group chose a typically Brazilian name for its new brand of makeup. Quem disse, Berenice? (in English, Who said, Berenice?) was selected after a consumer survey as emblematic of a Portuguese name which is easy to understand and to remember. Indeed, the aim of the launch, announced on the 9th of August, is to tackle the rise of international brands on the Brazilian marketplace. The US makeup brand M.A.C, for instance, already operates stores in twelve cities across the country. For its part, French beauty retailer Sephora (LVMH group) has opened its first retail store on July 13 in in São Paulo's new JK Iguatemi mall. The group Boticário's new brand is starting operation in São Paulo with the opening of six franchised stores scheduled during the month of August.

What did you miss (or not) during the summer?,"As far as markets are concerned, Organic Monitor noted that natural and organic cosmetic brands tend to open their own shops to enter in Asia. This topic will be developed further during the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit that will be held in Hong Kong on 12 and 13 November 2012. Also concerning the natural cosmetics segment, the 2012 edition of the Natural Cosmetics Conference will focus on the desires and expectations of European consumers. This latter event is organized in Berlin (September 25 & 26, 2012) by Elfriede Dambacher, Director of publishing company Naturkosmetik Verlag, in cooperation with NürnbergMesse, Emerging markets continue to attract investments.

French brand L'Occitane, which is listed at the Hong Kong stock exchange, has focused its attention on Asia, with the acquisition of French-Korean brand Erborian. Korea is also in the focus of Coty, which is cooperating with LG to tap into this market. French group Yves Rocher oriented its development towards the growing markets surrounding Western Europe (Turkey, Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe) and acquired a majority stake in Turkish cosmetics maker Flormar. The London Olympics games in London were a major highlight during this summer, and were marked by the efforts of brands operating in the UK to take advantage of this opportunity to boost rather dull sales.

The Natural Cosmetics Conference questions consumers' expectations,"This year's Natural Cosmetics Conference will be held on September 25 & 26 at the Ellington Hotel, in Berlin, Germany. The aim of the organizers is to offer a full overview of the stakes and current trade topics for the natural beauty market. ""Natural has become part of the entire beauty market. Whether natural cosmetics will continue to influence the cosmetics market depends on several factors. Aside from current market data and facts, interesting discussion forums, expert discussions, trend reports and Best Practice examples will be on the Conference agenda. For the first time participants will be offered two focal points: Forum A will centre on the international market and retail. Forum B will focus on questions concerning procurement, research, development and the commodity market,"" explain the organizers. This year's main speakers will reflect on the topic of sustainability from two points of view: Michael J. Kolodziej, board member DM-Drogerie Markt, will present the topic as a holistic, strategic business concept. Based on his Cradle to Cradle® concept, Prof. Dr. Michael Braungart, founder and scientific manager of EPEA Internationale Umweltforschung GmbH, will demonstrate that intelligent and eco-efficient design can lead to new impulses for the entire beauty trade. A specific focus will be made on consumers' expectations: Why are there so many occasional buyers? What keeps them from becoming loyal natural cosmetics customers? What do they expect at the POS? Consumer protection issues will also placed at the centre-stage of the conference. Experts and representatives of European politics have been invited to discuss central questions for future market development: How much regulation is needed? How can consumers more easily discern natural cosmetics? What is the significance of the POS? Why is shoppermarketing a relevant aspect today and how is a targeted introduction of consumers to natural cosmetics possible? On September 24, the day prior to the conference, the organizers offer a 4-hour trend tour in Berlin (from 2 to 6 p.m.), with the aim to discover innovative natural cosmetics shop concepts at different hotspots of the German capital city."
The assumed pride of beauty made in Brazil,"Premium Beauty News - There is an increasing number of International brands to try their chance in Brazil. Is it the new Eldorado of beauty? Leila Rochet-Podvin - Brazil has become one of the target countries in the internationalization of brands and its economic growth attracts each year more and more foreign brands. The country ranks fifth in the world in terms of its population, and there is a rising amount of middle- or higher-class people living close to the number of people in France and in the UK put together. It is also a very urban, (84% of the population lives in cities), and young country, since the median age is 29 years. Unlike Chinese people who save money, Brazilians have a high level of consumption. Opinion polls highlight a very optimistic population, confident in the future and proud of its country. Feelings that should be enhanced by the preparation of upcoming major sports events: the Football World Cup in 2014 and the Summer Olympics in 2016 in Rio. As a result, Brazil ranks first, ahead of Chile, among 30 emerging economies [1] in terms of attractiveness for retailing activities. Premium Beauty News - Beauty holds an important place in Brazilian culture. Leila Rochet-Podvin - It is often rightly said, that Brazilians women truly worship the beauty of the body : which must look simple, as natural as possible, but perfect. This is logical in a country where climate encourages body exposure. Therefore Brazilian women do not hesitate to invest to shape their silhouette, be it through sport, cosmetic procedures or through the use of cosmetics. For 91% of Brazilian women, being beautiful is important primarily for social life [2]. It must be noted that three of the five highest paid top models in the world are Brazilians. But things do not stop there. Because of its history, this market is very different from many other emerging markets, in particular regarding their interest for luxury products. Brazilians have their own brands, including in the upper end segment. Several Brazilian luxury brands have even emerged in fashion and jewellery. The tradition of design is strong in Brazil. What naturally comes to mind are the great Brazilian architects, but the country is also very dynamic in terms of fashion and also has several world-renowned contemporary artists. They develop a contemporary aesthetic inspired by Brazilian history, a mixture of modernism, closeness to nature and of indigenous influences. Unlike other emerging markets, sophisticated and knowledgeable, Brazilian consumers have great confidence in their local brands. An equally important feature of Brazilian culture is the art of living together: the importance given to human relationship, to cordiality. This has immediate consequences in terms of marketing. Thus, Brazilians are very demanding in terms of quality of service, of the quality of reception in outlets. The shopping experience in outlets must be up to expectations. Moreover, the country ranks second for the use of social networks. Beauty bloggers as such, play a pivotal role for the recommendation of cosmetics in Brazil. Finally, we cannot talk about beauty in Brazil without mentioning the country's ethnic, religious and cultural mix, the ""mash'up"" culture that fosters tolerance and mixtures. Today, a minority of the population (48%) defines itself as ""white"", and 7% claims being ""black."" In Brazil can be found a multitude of skin tones, actually 136 different types. And this must be combined to an almost equally impressive variety of hair types. This obviously has an impact in the development of products, particularly hair care and make-up. Premium Beauty News - What are the main market trends? Leila Rochet-Podvin - The ideal Brazilian beauty favours a ""healthy"" and natural look. Skincare products are progressing very quickly (55% per year [3]), ""urban"" sun protection products are also fast growing, as well as make-up. We have summarized the trends and influences that we observed in Brazil according to two axes. On the one hand, that of urbanization and of country development confronted to its more authentic temporal link ([fast/slow}) and, on the other hand, the influence of Brazilian roots facing the standards of internationalization and of global performance. Which gives us four major trends: – Authentic'Link, with the enhancement of Brazilian ""mash-up"" culture as the root for a future style of life. Keywords are the reinterpretation of know-how, the enhancement of the country's heritage and history. The cosmetic brands which are emblematic of this trend are Avatim, or Água de Alfazema de Phebo. – Graffiti'Play, that promotes vibrant colours, as an expression of the creative urban identity game. Keywords are the joy of living, experience and emotion, the identity mash-up, a rich culture. The cosmetic emblematic brands in this trend are Body Store, Ducha Cosmeticos or the make-up line Soul from Eudora. – Techno'Wise, an optimistic urban model hinged on products developed with the solid know-how of pros. The keywords are: sustainable architecture, technology of tomorrow, urban efficiency, praise of the pros, expert words. Among cosmetics brands emblematic of this trend: Duda Molinos, eos, Contem1g. – Green'Alchemy, where nature is seen as imperative source of future development, which values social harmony and the preservation of resources, and with the following keywords: ethics, biodiversity, natural chemistry, respect of Brazilian knowledge, preservation, upcycling. The Ekos line by Natura is the best known example. One can also mention the brand Amazonia Viva or Sejaa. On all market segments, local brands are flourishing and proudly wear the markers of Brazilian identity. To meet this competition, international brands who want to succeed in this market should be above reproach in terms of quality and find an appropriate distribution solution in a country where the retail sector is still underdeveloped, although the situation is evolving very quickly. The study ""Inspiration from Brazil"" is available from Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation. For more information, contact Leila Rochet-Podvin: contact@inspirationcreation.com"
MakeUp in Paris: record number of visitors,"""MakeUp in Paris is a must that is making its mark,"" said the organisers of the show dedicated to the makeup industry. Indeed, the third edition of Make Up in Paris hosted more than 2,100 visitors, up 13% over the previous year, according to the organisers. As usual, marketing teams come out in the top positions with a rate of 35%, followed by R&D and Sales teams. The organisers particularly welcomed the strong rise in the number of foreign visitors: +45% over 2011. ""They come from everywhere and ... from far! Many Americans (+ 75%), more and more Germans (+ 65%), of Spaniards (+ 45%), English (+ 31%), Belgians (+37%) of Swiss (+ 14%)... but also visitors from countries totally new to this event like Paraguay, Taiwan, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Ukraine.... Visitors from China, Japan and South Korea had also made the trip."" Overall, more than 40 countries were represented this year against 29 in 2011. A figure that should consolidate MakeUp in Paris in its ambition to be the leading B2B make-up event in Europe."
Instrumental beauty: strong growth confirmed by recent study,"The think tank BeautyFull Club provides a new contribution to an important issue for the prestige cosmetics industry: instrumental beauty. And this, through a partnership with Parisian business school ESCP Europe. The study was entrusted to 6 students graduating in a Master 2 (Master in European Business) was presented with great success on June 20 before an audience of professionals. This is the second time [1] that the BeautyFULL Club entrusts students from ESCP Europe with a study. With the help of Raphaël Goumot, technological innovation consultant, Sophie Meyer-Ohlendorf, Maja Kambic, Daphne Philippou, Irina Poganaru, Diana Yanova and Archit Gupta, all of different nationalities, have strived for 4 months on the project, and made a remarkable presentation of their findings. In an amphitheatre perfumed on the occasion by Scentys. They were asked to analyse - globally - the emerging market of instrumental beauty for the selective cosmetic industry, and to specify the characteristics and attractiveness of this new market, both for cosmetic brands, and packaging manufacturers. Ultimately, the study helps understand how electronics provides consumers and brands an additional asset and new features justifying the extra cost of instrumental beauty and its adoption over time by consumers. More than fifty professionals, packaging manufacturers and cosmetic brands alike, were very impressed with the relevance of strategic recommendations. All the presentation material is available to members of the BeautyFull Club (downloadable from the website www.beautyfullclub.com). The market of instrumental beauty in the selective sector presents important differences depending of countries. The attractiveness of instrumental beauty was therefore studied in 11 countries: in Asia (China, Japan, South Korea), on the American continent (USA and Brazil) and in Europe (France, Germany, England, Italy, Spain and Russia). The study also listed the main marketed systems by distinguishing three categories of electronics used: embedded in the packaging, proposed as a complementary system or used for purposes of communication and customer relationship. One of the recommendations of the study is the strategic acquisition of companies with an electronic activity to help them develop creative high value offers for cosmetics brands. Because the global market of prestige instrumental beauty is bound to grow very significantly due to the benefits perceived by customers, eager to find ""instant"" and multi functional effects. True to its mission as a think tank, the BeautyFull Club will continue in 2012/2013 its collaboration with engineering, business and design schools, to develop a thorough understanding of the main issues in the selective cosmetic industry, and also to help attract young talents."
Men's beauty market booms but retailers need to adapt,"The time where skin care products were targeting the specific ""metrosexual"" niche has come to an end. With the growing popularity of men's cosmetics the term ""metrosexual"" is even becoming obsolete. ""It used to imply a certain niche group, whereas in 2012, all types of men, in urban and suburban areas, are using male grooming products,"" explains Nancy Mills, Consumer Practice Industry Manager for market research firm Kline & Company. Actually, men's grooming is one of the fastest growing segments in the beauty business. According to Kline [1], in 2011, sales of men's skin care in the U.S. have seen their best growth in several years. The analysis is the same at Mintel. The Chicago-based research firm forecasts sales of men's toiletries in the U.S. to hit US$3.2 billion by 2016, up from an estimated US$2.6 billion this year and US$2.2 billion in 2006. As far as the European market is concerned, sales of skincare products have boomed from 289 million euros in 2005 to 420 million euros in 2010 in the continent's five biggest markets: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK. This growth is particularly impressive when compared to largely stagnant sales of shaving products and razors in the same area [2]. The demand is driven by social and demographic changes in both mature and emerging markets: an increased number of men employed in the sector of services, increased competition in the workplace, ageing baby boomers eager to stay stylish, and the young generation influenced by changing standards of male beauty. New entrants on the markets, as well as technologically advanced products, expanded lines, and innovative packaging are also stimulating sales. According to Mintel, six in 10 (65%) European men consider their appearance important and almost half (48%) admit what they want most is to look attractive and well groomed. Just 15% of men admit that while it is acceptable for women to use skincare products, it is not acceptable for men to use such products. It's not only that it has become more socially acceptable for men to put effort into looking and feeling good, as for many women it has almost become a requirement. Brands are consequently creating new solutions for men, expanding their offering far beyond the traditional deodorant and after-shave. Anti-aging creams, powders, concealers and tinted moisturizers are now entering in men's beauty routine. Despite the huge potential of the men's market, both brands and retailers still need to find the most effective way to communicate with these new male consumers. ""They have still not developed specific communication strategies for men, and the sales universes are still very much women-oriented, especially in selective distribution,"" argues Anne Césard, project manager at French market research firm Xerfi. Indeed, many men remain squeamish about products that seem too feminine. Thus, as far as male products are concerned, some words and colours are considered taboo. For instance, the term ""make-up"" as well as pink and gold colours must be avoided strictly. ""It is clear that brands cannot approach the men's market as they do with the women's one,"" confirmed celebrity makeup artist Max Herlant, during a session dedicated to the enhancement of men's complexion at the latest edition of the MakeUp in Paris trade show. As a consequence, brands specifically devoted to men may benefit from a competitive advantage as they can more easily adopt a strong masculine positioning than those derived from the women's market. However, from that point of view, retailers are facing the biggest challenge. As the market is growing they tend to devote more shelf space to men's beauty products but still have to find the relevant environment. In the U.S.A., department stores such as Nordstrom and Macy's are creating separate sections dedicated solely to men, cosmetics chain Ulta rolled out in-store boutiques called the Men's Shop, CVS Pharmacy has created Guy Aisles in its stores, and skin-care brand Kiehl's is building Shave Bars inside its stores."
Make-up: a subtle global overview,"The round table on cosmetic markets in Brazil, Asia and the United States, which took place on June 21 as part of the third edition of MakeUp in Paris somehow prefigured the forthcoming appointments of MakeUp in New York, on 12 and 13 September 2012, and of MakeUp in Sao Paulo on 10 and 11 April 2013. For the organizers, it was not so much a matter of comparing a priori very different markets than to offer an overview of major trends at stake in these key areas. If Brazil is undoubtedly a country with a high growth potential for beauty manufacturers, ""it is a market where many things can be undertaken"" confirmed Helena Garcia de Gracia, Marketing Director of Eudora, a brand of the Boticário group. Brazilian women have a culture of sensuality and a power of decision over their beauty. The penetration rate of make-up products is about 35% and their share of the beauty market in Brazil is about 12%, with a perfect balance between nail polishes, lipsticks and face makeup (25% each). But in 2012, make-up products are still mostly sold by home beauty advisers. ""There are a lot of direct sales beauty consultants in Brazil, 2000 or 3000 women who sell make-up with only a basic training. This is the role of advertising and of social networks of doing the education work required to properly use the new products. There are in Brazil some beauty blogs which are very popular and where women describe their make-up experiences, the impact of the posts and comments is very strong,"" emphasised Helena Garcia de Gracia. To be noted also, the importance of ethnic diversity. In Brazil, there are no fewer than one hundred different types of skin tones while Caucasians-type carnations only represent 49% of the population: a specificity that brands must consider in their communication. Unlike Brazil, the U.S. is a mature market, but it continues to grow steadily. ""It is the first luxury and beauty market in the world, growth in 2010-2011 was of 9% in the premium make-up market and of 8% in the make-up mass market. [1] After years of crisis, this is a rebirth,"" explained Leila Rochet-Podvin, founder and director of the Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation Agency. According to Jamie Matusow from the American magazine, Beauty Packaging Magazine, ""purchases of beauty products are a small luxury that U.S. women treat themselves with, while sales of electronic products and solar panels have collapsed."" A cornerstone of the market, is the culture of innovation, particularly in marketing. Many new products appear in the U.S. before spreading to the rest of the world. It is from this country that originated the vogue for make-up artists, mineral make-up as a specific category, or Doctor's brands. According to Rochet-Podvin, the growing diversity of the U.S. population is one of the major trends to consider: ""in 2050, those who are currently known as 'minorities' will represent the majority of the U.S. population."" Which is reflected in particular by an evolution of the beauty ideal. Other trends identified by Leila Rochet-Podvin: the eulogy of femininity with an explosion of colours, urban cosmetics and entertainment, which results in products suited to contemporary lifestyles, ethics and sustainable development, up values, and finally the emergence of the healthy look that puts health and longevity at the heart of concerns. Make-up is an important part of American culture, with 49% of women considering that it can help improves self confidence (IPSOS WLT 2011). The Asian market is still marked by the two heavyweights, China and Japan. For Caroline Moulin, President of NaO Design Trends: ""What is happening in China is what happened eight years ago in Japan, sales of cosmetics are completely going through the roof. Brands in China are the same than those found in Japan. But there are differences in tastes depending of regions and colours may differ, especially between Beijing and Shanghai."" But the Chinese market still has its make-up culture to build and, again in this case, beauty blogs play an important role. In China, the look is very important, a pale look that women are seeking to broaden, thanks to tips found on the social media authorized by the government. In Japan, the market is very different since it's already very mature and bearing the brunt of the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster. ""But the market continues to innovate, especially in terms of packaging with very ingenious innovations in packaging and refilling systems,"" observed Moulin. ""Furthermore, electro-beauty is very present in outlets."" Japan's culture of the flawless skin is very strong, the success of BB creams and the need for a radiant complexion exemplify this. Given these characteristics and the development potential offered by these markets, participants to the roundtable emphasized on the growing role of subcontractors, who, in the wake of brands, are also extending their global presence. Moreover, an increasing number of companies choose to focus on marketing and to rely on full service for the development of their products. ""Subcontracting is a professional service and with high value added, it is a fast way of bringing innovation to markets. In the U.S., more than 50% of beauty product's come from subcontracting,"" confirmed Musa Pharand-Dias VP Marketing of the American firm Oxygen Developmentwho experienced a very strong growth in 2011. For his part, Thomas Weckerle, CEO of the German company Weckerle, guarantees the ability of his company to ensure in the whole world the same level of quality: ""Each market can benefit from the latest technologies and we can produce with the same tools in a global way."" Good news for markets like Brazil, where access to the latest innovations is more difficult and where the help of full service companies is therefore most welcome. ""Our customers are willing to pay the necessary price for a product with high added value, we make sure to take into account local needs, human diversity to offer innovative make-up products,"" underlined Weckerle. Finally, the main common point which was highlighted between these three regions is the importance of social media and their increasing role in consumerism."
MakeUp in Paris 2012: a mature edition,"It works for all industry players, be they specialists in formulas, packaging or make-up accessories. A twist of friendliness with a few smart ideas like the distribution of soft drinks in the aisles of the show by a waitress on a delivery tricycle relayed by a permanent open bar, the whole of it in an upscale atmosphere due to the flawless design of mini showrooms and stands...exhibitors and visitors alike were seduced. They were also seduced by this original colouring workshop where everyone could practice on colouring, oops! make-up. Not forgetting the superb demos performed by students of make-up schools. Among the new features that have strengthened the professionalism of the event: the organization of more than twenty highly original conferences in the dedicated room crowded by hundreds of people, and, of course, the very first ""Innovation Awards"" which enabled to single out six companies in the ""formulation"", ""full service"", ""packaging"" and ""accessory"" categories. The awards ceremony, on the evening of June 21st, was particularly moving given the enthusiasm and emotion expressed by winners. Three years and already mature! But also the same comment expressed by professionals, visitors and exhibitors to the organizers, ""Please don't grow!"" An attitude which is indicative of this atmosphere ""like no other"" that have managed to create the initiators of this event indeed ""like no other"" where operators in the make-up industry obviously enjoy meeting far away from ritual gatherings. This MakeUp in Paris is indeed quite a subtle cocktail, made of luxury, friendliness, warmth, professionalism and proximity. A successful cocktail too, since the next meeting will take place on 12 and 13 September in New York, while organizers have announced the holding of MakeUp in Sao Paulo on 10 and 11 April 2013. The New York edition promises to be an excellent vintage and the one in Sao Paulo is obviously highly anticipated, not to say eagerly awaited by suppliers and many managers of cosmetic brands established in South America. The adventure continues..."
The MakeUp in Paris Innovation Awards winners are...,"These awards have been created to honour the year's most innovative developments for make-up products in four categories: formulation, packaging, accessories & samples, full service. Twenty companies participating in the third edition MakeUp in Paris submitted more than thirty innovations. The jury consisting of Florence Bernardin, Gérard Péverelli, Olivier Guillemin, Jean-Louis Mathiez, Damien Dufresne, Doria Maiz, chaired by Thierry de Baschmakoff, carried out a first selection, which enabled to identify a list of nominees for each categories.

This brush enables to design and apply make-up using any touch screens on the market."
"""Our difference stands in the complementarity of the three shows constituting Beyond Beauty""","Premium Beauty News - The acquisition of Itec by Informa, last year, seems to have marked a strategic turnaround with both the increased number of complementary events to the shows, and the identity of each of the Beyond Beauty Paris components being put forward. A new start? Julie Cartigny - The acquisition by the Informa group is the recognition of the expertise of the Paris team which has been driving Beyond Beauty and its side events since 2002. This rapprochement enables to accompany the new growth dynamics that implies the creation of events and some acquisitions in all strong growing areas. We want to stay alongside Beauty industry leaders and continue to offer them efficient and profitable events. Informa represents a portfolio of exhibitions and expertises the world over, with some of them in direct connection with our businesses: Vitafood in Geneva is close to Creative Beauty in the segment of health/beauty oriented ingredients, the World Anti Aging Congress, a world leading congress in Monaco targeting medicalized beauty, Datamonitor has developed its expertise as a research firm. All the offices around the world are at the service of our projects and of our will to be even more focused on 'beauty' in the coming future. Beyond Beauty remains the signature of all our initiatives and for more consistency and simplicity, we have strengthened the communication on each show Creative Beauty Paris, Spameeting Paris, Cosmeeting Paris...Paris has therefore found itself slightly shifted, but remains at the heart of our strategy. Premium Beauty News - In this new context, how is positioned Creative Beauty Paris, the event dedicated to beauty suppliers? Julie Cartigny - The 2012 edition promises to be very successful. To date, more than 92% of the total area is already booked, a 13% increase to compared to 2011 at the same time. With 13% more new exhibitors, we have noticed a significant increase of the Packaging sector, but also great enthusiasm from the ingredient sector, strongly represented on the BBLAB; the private label sector is not left out since we will be also welcoming this year new international players. With 71% of loyal exhibitors from one edition to the other, Creative Beauty remains a major business event where many take advantage of this autumn appointment to present their new products and innovations. We propose in autumn the largest European appointment for beauty suppliers. The complementarity of the three shows that constitute Beyond Beauty is a differentiating point from other events in the profession, since our exhibitors are just as interested in meeting international decision makers (marketing & purchase) from the distribution sector, than they are in meeting the CEOs of brands attending Cosmeeting Paris. Premium Beauty News - What will be the novelties and main highlights of the forthcoming Creative Beauty Paris? Julie Cartigny - Our goal is to rally the whole perfume and cosmetic industry The numerous actions implemented will guarantee a significant increase in the attendance of foreign visitors. (North Africa, UAE, ...) Through their synergy, the three Beyond Beauty events, have been attracting for the past two editions, decision makers from large groups and brands operating in the ready to wear but also luxury or lingerie industry which are diversifying for most of them in cosmetics, perfumes, make-up, by developing in particular ""Capsule"" collections or simply wishing to enrich their offer to female and male consumers! Some brands will develop new market segments: source of inspiration, search for ""white labels"", but also of different packaging solutions Fashion also visits us to find solutions during the Beauty Week! The BBLab, the area to stage and reflect on beauty trends will celebrate its 10th anniversary centred on the theme ""A Better World."" Today there is a desire for progress in all areas of cosmetics. ""Look good, feel good and do good"". True mirror of tomorrow's cosmetic trends the BBLab is the show's dedicated area of amazement. Premium Beauty News - How do you ensure the consistency of this Beauty Week - which consists of three shows, Creative Beauty Paris, Cosmeeting Paris and Spameeting Paris - with exhibitors and visitors with so different concerns in mind? Julie Cartigny - The Beauty Week represents a high point in the agenda of the beauty industry, some initiatives at the heart of the three specialised shows but also in parallel with several high-level Summits/Conferences which are also represent bridges between each exhibition. The European Spa Summit will bring together international experts from the wellness/spa market, the Natural Beauty Summit Europe will take place in a completely revisited 2012 edition, but also an exceptional cycle of conferences called 'Beyond Beauty Trends' who will give the floor to 23 trend agencies and beauty experts and dozens of other conferences. In total the Paris event will gather more than a hundred speakers and experts from around the world to celebrate together our tenth anniversary. The Beauty Week is also a unique collaboration with the 'Victoires de la Beauté' which partner with our 'emerging' brand award and will announce the Beauty Challenger Awards 2012 'Grand Prix'. Finally we are announcing a fine update of our Innovation Awards, which have become the European Beauty Innovation Awards (EBIA 2012) with the arrival of four new countries alongside Germany to evaluate the confirmed talents of the European selective."
MakeUp in Paris to open its doors this week,"With an average 30% of the references of a brand being renewed each year, the make-up market is probably the one requiring the highest innovation rate within the beauty industry. So, it is rather logical if the organizers of MakeUp in Paris chose to put innovation at the heart of the third edition of the show dedicated to the makeup industry. Thus, more than more than thirty innovations have been submitted to a jury which was in charge of identifying the list of final nominees in each of the four categories - full service, packaging, formula, accessories, samples - that will receive a MakeUp in Paris Innovation Award. All the selected products will be then showcased in « L'Espace des Innovations » (innovation Area) of MakeUp in Paris 2012. Main originality of this last step: it will be the visitors who will chose among the finalists to single out one product per category. The votes will be displayed on the main screen in real time and the awards will be remitted to the winners during the evening. For the third consecutive year MakeUp in Paris will invite exhibitors, make-up schools and make-up artists to express themselves through make-up demonstrations. On the initiative of exhibitors, nearly a dozen demonstrations are planned, with the participation of renowned make-up artists like Michele Burke and Céleste Duquesne. Four make-up schools will collaborate to two make-up poles; Tannaz Studio from Switzerland, the Make Up For Ever Academy, the Atelier International de Maquillage and for the first time since it was created, MakeUp in Paris will invite So Nails Academy, an academy for future nail stylists, who will perform on Friday, June 22 at 02:00 pm some spectacular demonstrations. Partnering, as of its first edition, with the CEW (Cosmetics Executive Women) France and its Beauty Centres, MakeUp in Paris will propose this year to buy pins bearing the colours of the show, to the benefit of ""Les Centres de Beauté de CEW France"". On Friday, the 22th of June, 9:00 am the CEW France will also propose a conference entitled ""The power of nails!"" This event, upon reservation with the CEW France (www.cew.asso.fr), will be preceded by a breakfast. MakeUp in Paris will feature a program of 23 conferences with a large part of them focusing on beauty trends. In the end, with a record number of exhibitors and an enhanced program, all indicators are on the rise for the next edition of MakeUp in Paris."
France: Competition between retailers is strengthening in a difficult market environment,"After a rather buoyant 2011 year, 2012 is likely to be more complicated for perfume and cosmetic retailers in France, partly because of economic uncertainties and the predictable Increase in burdens of households. In a recent study on the challenges of the distribution of perfumes and cosmetics in France [1], Xerfi expects a slowdown in global demand in the short term, despite structural growth factors, particularly the increasing population of seniors, large consumers of skincare products, and the growing emphasis on appearance and well-being in society. But for 2012, some moroseness is to be expected. Sales in the first half of 2012 were rather disappointing for selective distribution (-1.1% in value and -4.1% in volume). For the year as a whole, the beauty industry could suffer from changes in consumer behaviour from French people, even if explains Xerfi, perfumes and make-up should be relatively spared. Additional difficulty, the undeniable source of growth represented by natural and organic cosmetics, personal care products for men and so-called ""ethnoscosmetic"" products may not, despite their dynamism, suffice to boost the short-term market. Especially since, according to Xerfi, traditional operators are struggling to optimize their development strategies vis-à-vis these new segments. For Anne Césard, author of the study, brands are having trouble to communicate with new potential targets. "" They have still not developed specific communication strategies for men, and the sales universes are still very much women-oriented, especially in selective distribution,"" she explained. Observations are the same on the side of natural and organic cosmetics. ""If laboratories are increasing the number of launches, distributors for their part are not too offensive and concepts dedicated to organic cosmetics are scarce,"" with few exceptions, like Aphibio, a selective perfumery of organic perfumes and cosmetics present in 5 cities in France. Given this expected slowdown in sales, Xerfi believes that the volume strategies of selective perfumeries, leading retailers of perfumes and cosmetics, have reached their limits and are ""now forced to play the card of differentiation,"" to try and ""retain consumers increasingly seduced by competitors (pharmacies, drugstores and pure players of the web)."" The research institute notes however that ""in this quest for differentiation, truly innovative concepts have trouble to emerge, brands most often preferring the easy way with imitation, "" by extending their private label range - such as Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé - by increasing the number of exclusivity agreements or by expanding their service offerings to beauty salons (Yves Rocher) or through nail, brow and smile bars (Sephora with its Brow Bars Benefit Cosmetics). For their part, pharmacies are relying on their image of experts to increase their venture in the beauty market (about 15% of perfume and cosmetic sales). Hence some economic interest group have launched their private brand (like Welcoop with Marque Verte), seeking to grow particularly in the segment of dermo-cosmetics, with a low price policy, while others, like Top Pharma, are setting foot on the web. As for drugstores, whose market share in this segment is for the time being limited (6% according Xerfi), they are steadily gaining ground on the cosmetic market. They also have their private brands and have managed like Parashop to revamp their image by revisiting their sales concepts and by expanding their offer. Finally, distance selling leaders must also cope with emerging new actors. In a few years, beauty boxes or subscription based e-commerce websites have proven their attractiveness. While the market is still in its infancy, half a dozen operators (GlossyBox, JolieBox, My Little Box, etc..) have already invested this market niche. Other innovations in the segment, such as private sales and de stocking (beauteprivee.fr) or low-cost operators (Eyes Lips Face - e.l.f.) are also trying to challenge the leadership of chain stores network (Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé) on the web."
MakeUp in New York announces a set of three round tables,"Visitors of the second edition of MakeUp in NewYork, which will take place on 12 and 13 September 2012 at the Studio 450, 450 West 31st street in New York, will have the opportunity to attend three round tables titled: – Do major make-up trends in Europe have an influence on the North American ones and vice versa? – Why is the Full-Service offer an underlying trend and how far will it go? – Make-Up Artist and make-up Innovation, a winning complicity. ""It will be a premiere for the MakeUp in NewYork show,"" say the organizers. Indeed, following the success of the first edition, the show doubles its surface and allocates a dedicated area to conferences. The first roundtable (September 12th from 10:30am to 12:00pm), titled Make-up: What is the mutual influence between Europe and North America?, will try to build a bridge between both continents. Led by H. Douglas Thornley, co-founder of Impact Colors, it will bring together Dominique Bouvier, Strand Cosmetics Europe; Mario de Luigi, B.Kolormakeup & Skincare; Renato Ancorotti, Ancorotti Cosmetics; Eric Vanin, Qualipac America and Barbara Bauer-Kropf, Schwan Cosmetics. Titled Strengths and limitations of the full service offer, the second roundtable (September 12 from 3pm to 4:30pm) will explore the development full service in the cosmetics industry. ""This is probably what has most changed the economic landscape in the beauty sector in recent years. In a survey conducted in 2006 among a hundred cosmetic brands in Europe, 20% of respondents said they relied almost entirely on outsourcing... Four years later, they were almost 40%,"" explain the organisers of MakeUp in New York. However, what are the limits of outsourcing? Can everything be outsourced? The round table will be moderated by Jamie Matusow from the Beauty Packaging magazine, with the participation of Jill Tomandl, Stila Cosmetics, as a ""witness"", and: Philippe Cohen, Oxygen Development; Marc-André Houx, Shya Hsin Packaging USA; Mauricio Pachon from Weckerle Cosmetics; Debra Mc Donough, Cosmolab and Nick Gardner, HCT USA. The third round table (September 13th from 10:30am to 12), titled Make-Up Artist and make-up innovation, the winning couple, will focus on the role of make-up artists in the development of new products and their contribution to innovation, from new formulations to new packaging or accessories, through new techniques of application. The round table will be moderated by Brian J. Fox-Krawczyk, Genealogy, and will gather Sumatra Batra, Ziba Beauty, Virginia Bonofiglio, Fashion Institute of Technology and the Make-up Artists Michele Burke and Eve Pearl."
Cosmetics for dark skins: Towards a quality labelling?,"Premium Beauty News - What was an association dedicated to cosmetics for black and coloured populations created? Isabelle Ossey Mananga - Because there is a real need for information in France: information intended for consumers and public authorities as well as professionals operating in the cosmetic sector who are developing an increasing interest in this market segment, that they do not however always understand very well. Label Beauté Noire works with dermatologists black skin specialists, pharmacists and psychologists. We carry out preventive and information actions throughout France. We also conduct actions to raise the public's awareness on the dangers of some products. We have also eventually managed to alert public authorities on the need for information campaigns for consumers and for a better control of the market, while for years we were facing a total indifference vis-à-vis these issues. But information is not our only goal. Our association, founded in 2004, is a consumer association but it also takes an interest in products themselves. We want to raise the awareness of all stakeholders in the sector so that they act more responsibly: manufacturers and distributors alike. This is why we are currently working on a quality label, which will enable our committed manufacturers to have additional benefits in terms of ethics and to enhance their efforts. Premium Beauty News - What will be the purpose of such a label when all cosmetic products sold in France and Europe are subject to the same regulation which guarantees their safety? Isabelle Ossey Mananga - All this is true in theory. But what we observe in the field is quite different from this legal fiction. If all products on the French market were really safe, the government would not have felt the need to warn consumers on the risks associated with voluntary skin depigmentation practices. [1] It must be recalled that for a long time this market segment, considered as a niche, was of no interest for the European cosmetic giants. Products were only available in specific areas such as Barbès or Château d'Eau in Paris. They were often parallel imports of American, or African products, which in some cases were not compliant with EU regulations. In 2009 and 2010, the French authorities, launched a national campaign to control the market. The tests performed on more than 160 products highlighted a high level of products which were not complying with regulations, with the presence of prohibited substances endangering the health of consumers in about 30% of cases in 2009 and 40% of cases in 2010. The DGCCRF undertook legal proceedings for breaches of the rules on the composition and/or labelling of products and proceeded to the withdrawal of products at the distributors. Premium Beauty News - The situation has not changed since? Isabelle Ossey Mananga - This market is rapidly changing with manufacturers showing a growing interest in it. Long considered a niche market, it is now increasingly seen as a growth driver for brands. Today, the product offer is much broader. But parallel circuits have not disappeared, online sales of non-complying products either. Some drugs are still diverted from their original use for cosmetic purposes. Consumers have trouble making a difference between products. Our work to educate and alert consumers consists in directing them to general and specialized recognized cosmetic ranges and in preventing them from using an inappropriate product, and in diverting them from the use of illegal products containing hydroquinone or steroids. The label will be, from this point of view, a simple and immediately understandable indicator. The cosmetic market for black and mestizo skins must be deghettoized. Whether it concerns hair care, skincare, or make-up products. By educating consumers, without stigmatizing them and by promoting quality products. Premium Beauty News - How will this label work? Isabelle Ossey Mananga - Interested brands will have to adhere to a quality charter imposing commitments in terms of quality and traceability of products and forcing them to accept controls. All product categories will be concerned: skin care, hair care, make-up. Premium Beauty News - Yet, health issues are not identical for all product categories. Concerns are mostly related to lightening products? Isabelle Ossey Mananga - Beyond the health aspect there are much more general issues. We can for example question ourselves on the predominating standard of beauty. But all this is changing very quickly. The increasing mixing of races in societies, globalization, the rise in the purchasing power of children and grandchildren of immigrants, are all factors fuelling a fast growing market that brands no longer overlook even if they still find it difficult to meet the specific needs of over-consuming, and demanding customers. Take for example the case of make-up. Studies have shown that there were 12 tons of so called Caucasian skins against 35 of black and mixed skins. This represents a huge issue in terms of product development, particularly in the field of make-up. And few are the brands addressing this need. The more women will easily find a suitable and accessible offer meeting their needs, the less they will be tempted to turn to the parallel market."
Summits highlight growth of US natural cosmetics market,"According to Kline's ""Global Natural Care Market Report"", the double-digit growth rate of the natural care global market, reached a volume of USD 23.1 billion in 2010 (USD 20.1 billion in 2009). According to the market research firm, which presented the main quantitative features of the North American market during the Natural Beauty Summit, growth in the U.S. market alone is expected to reach USD 5.8 billion in sales by 2016. Kline's Consumer Industry Manager Nancy Mills attributes the dynamism of the natural personal care sector to ever growing consumer awareness of health, environmental, and sustainability concerns. ""These drivers are near universal, but their influence varies significantly between markets,"" she observes. ""In Western Europe, consumers have a higher awareness and interest concerning product ingredients, business ethics, and sustainability practices, and many are astutely avoiding products which are natural only in positioning."" To this regard, third party certifications play a much more important role in Western Europe compared to the U.S. where both consumers and manufacturers appear quite confused by the profusion of integrated private standards. Possible clarification could come from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which is currently working to develop a standard for natural and organic cosmetics. Farah Ahmed, Vice President - Associate General Counsel at the U.S. Personal Care Products Council, closed the Natural Beauty Summit's session devoted to regulations and standards, explaining that ISO is mainly working at defining what are natural and organic cosmetics and cosmetic ingredients and providing the corresponding technical criteria. However, Farah, who was appointed convenor of the ISO Cosmetic Marketing and Packaging Group in 2009, remained very cautious about the exact scope of the future standard. Speaking at the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which was held at the end of the same week, Wendy McLain of PCC Natural Markets said that the lack of U.S. standards for natural and organic cosmetics puts the onus on retailers to educate consumers. Its company uses newsletters, in-store sampling and merchandising techniques to inform consumers about its natural cosmetics range. In comparison to the Natural Beauty Summit, the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit was more focused on industry's best practices, feedbacks and technical solutions, and devoted less time to the description of the market and consumer behaviour. The two key messages that emerged from the presentations were the need for better and more accurate measurement techniques for environmental impacts, as well as increase adoption rates of sustainable packaging. Regarding the measurment of their environmental impact, although many companies are undertaking life-cycle analysis, varying methodologies, lack of standardized data and general difficulties in analyzing cosmetic formulations prevent accurate measurement. Regarding packaging issues, which according to Intertek, comprises a third of landfill waste, speakers stressed the importance of eco-design in reducing their impact. Innovations in recycled packaging and the potential of bio-plastics and novel packaging materials were also highlighted. Following the success of its North American edition, Organic Monitor, the organiser of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit also announced its intention to host its first-ever Latin American edition on 25-27th September 2012 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. As for the next edition of the Natural Beauty Summit Europe, it will take place on 10 and 11 September 2012 in Paris."
Make-up: Spring/summer 2013 trends according to Eckart,"In a market permanently in search for new products, cosmetic ingredient suppliers are required to develop an increasingly widespread range of services. Their laboratories do no longer limit themselves to illustrate the potential of their products, but offer innovative formulations in line with the needs of different markets and with the latest trends. Thus Eckart offers its interpretation of the trends in colour cosmetics for spring / summer 2013. The specialist of metallic effect and pearlescent pigments has identified three major trends: Colours to die for, Business glam, and Dresscode summer. However, warns Eckart, ""as unique as each of us are, the more important our 'own' personal style becomes. Few big trends mix up with each other and are displaced by a variety of uncountable small, but distinctive directions."" What counts, in the end, is to stand out from the rivals, to entice emotions, to leave a deep impression on others, in particular in a highly competitive environment. The first of the three trends developed by Eckart, is made of metal effects that meet traditional Scottish habits and melt into a moment of sensuality. ""They create the feeling that the long-awaited gentleman is only one look away. When applying the ""Colors to Die for"" make-up, a woman turns into a femme fatale for one night. She will be the centre of attention, and wraps everybody around her little finger by her charming appearance."" To illustrate this theme, Eckart used a variety of red and lilac shades, provided with the expressive metallic shine of its Visionaire range of pigments. ""They are dark, dramatic, and offer passion to touch,"" explains Eckart. The 'colours to die for' trend was also illustrated in lip stick colours (Gasping Rose, Racing Heart, Bloodcurdling Ruby), blushes, and nail varnishes (Burning Tears, Heart-Stopping Pink, Pulse Breaking). Business Glam, the second trend, brings a feminine touch into a business world. ""This theme understands itself as an escape from dreary dark-blue and grey interwoven office routine. It is a clear commitment to delicate colour accents, which are effectually spiced up with glamour."" Colours are derived from the nude trend, and they have been successfully combined with the Mirage range, Eckart's borosilicate pigments. For this thematic, liquid eye shadows in toffee and caramel have been upgraded by a touch of violet. ""They bring unexpected sparkle to the 'business lid', and help radiate self-confidence and dynamics. Additionally the eyeliner ensures precise highlights,"" explains Eckart. As per glosses, they will bring lips no more than the necessary sparkle. The same applies for the nail polishes; on the first sight their shades appear innocent and subtle. On looking closely they shine in manifold dimensions. Eventually, Dresscode: Summer, the third and last trend explored by Eckart, targets the young, hip, cool. ""Dresscode: Summer is happiness created with the cleanliness of SynCrystal pigments. Long days, long nights – both are right."" It is a true anthem to summertime, sports, beach, music and meeting new people. In short, an anthem to the lust for life; outdoor activities, and to freedom. The colours in this theme are sending a floral message, with eyes exuding cheerfulness, lips which invite kissing, and nails that are true eye catchers. ""Dresscode: Summer represents the perfect contrast and partner to the white of linen,"" concludes Eckart. Sources: Beautypress, Eckart GmbH (Katja Petri)"
What is the place of creative perfumery in France?,"The last decade has indeed seen the revival of some old perfume brands and the emergence of a significant number of newcomers, trying to capture an audience, both curious and wanting to escape the uniformizing steamroller of international brands. But strangely , these brands seem to have trouble finding their place in France. [1] According to David Frossard, co founder of Différentes Latitudes, they are ""perfumes whose approach is not dictated by marketing and markets, perfumes which are not intended to the largest number but to a happy few, an intellectual, financial and/or cultural elite."" Which confirms François Hénin, President of Jovoy, for whom this is an ""interesting phenomenon that invites individuals to stand out from this homogeneity with a real differentiation approach."" For his part, Gilles Thévenin, President of Lubin, insists on the research for quality and tradition of the French fine perfumery. Freedom, creativity, independence, and almost home-made high quality manufacturing, are also characteristic features highlighted by Valérie PIanelli-Guichard, CEO of Comptoir Sud Pacifique. All stakeholders agree on the reality of the request for a segment that, according to David Frossard, represents about 4% of the global perfumery market. But the French situation is both specific and difficult for brands, due of the highly concentrated structure of the distribution. ""In France, very few distributors exist for these products,"" explains David Frossard. If we add to this, the fact that small brands cannot really afford to invest in advertising and that there seems to be a lack of interest from beauty journalists for the subject, the main difficulty to overcome by creative perfumery in France seems be its lack of visibility. Brands strive to work on their own identity, not hesitating to adopt differentiating biases. From the wild and natural history of the Atlantic coasts at Lostmarc'h, where each ingredient comes from a local sourcing, to the olfactory world tour proposed by Comptoir Sud Pacific, from juices made by the greatest noses at The Different Company, to the classics revisited by the Lubin house founded in 1798, each player is working with passion on his identity and positioning. The customer will then acquire a perfume that will become her/his perfume. Despite a often higher shelf price than in the traditional selective circuit, a real emotional connection is created between the customer, and her/his creator's perfume. "" Customer loyalty is very high in this market unlike the selective market which is a market driven by novelties,"" confirms Luc Gabriel, CEO of The Different Company. More than ever, creativity is at the heart of this business, because the number of artistic perfume brands has exploded since the early 2000s. An inspiration that must however come to life in compliance with regulatory constraints. The last part of the conference focused on packaging issues and on the specific needs of creative perfume brands. For most brands, packaging is an integral part of the creator's universe and a source of differentiation. Working with standards appears therefore difficult despite the numerous decorating and customizing possibilities offered nowadays by suppliers. The difficulty then stands in finding manufacturers that can perform specific moulds and produce series in limited quantities. Significant efforts have been made by packaging suppliers and conditioners to meet this demand. Valerie Jacob, Marketing Director of SGD, Francis Cheru, Sales Manager of Verreries Brosse, Jean-Luc Leblond, Sales Director of Bormioli Rocco & Figlio, Lucy Ray, Industrial Marketing Manager of Pochet and Isabelle Legallicier Pochet, President of CCI Productions, presented the interest of this segment for them and the specific solutions they offer. Eventually, despite a difficult environment creative perfumery is responding to a real market demand. Thus, leading luxury brands are interested in this segment and many of them have developed a specific offer. Maybe a means to unlock retail networks."
The cabaret trend continues to inspire cosmetics,"Are movie stars on the verge to lose their near-monopoly on glamour? We are still far from such a situation, but the stars of cabaret, whose fame, until the mid-2000s, never exceeded a limited number of connoisseurs, are now beginning to gain access to worldwide fame. No wonder that cosmetics manufacturers are interested in them. More generally, the sensual and glamorous image of the cabaret stage fits perfectly with the development of cosmetic lines especially dedicated to life's moments of seduction. Dita Von Teese, the famous stripper who greatly contributed to the renaissance of burlesque, had already launched an eponymous perfume in October 2011, with German group Luxess. The creation even received a Duftstar Award, the German equivalent of a FiFi Award. It is again with a German company, Artdeco, a leading brand for colour cosmetics, that Dita Von Teese signed last year in Paris a licence agreement for the launch of a makeup line to her name. A naturel choice for Artdeco's CEO Helmut Baurecht: ""We couldn't identify any other woman who is so closely linked with the perfect make-up. She is a true icon."" Dita Von Teese, who participated in the presentation of the new line in Munich at the end of April, explained that she wanted to be part of the products' design and that it was one of the reasons of a choice for Artdeco. ""I had all liberties to drive the creative process, to influence the development of the textures and colours to make them my signature products. For me it's important to give more than just my name to a product."" For Artdeco, which is still a family-owned business, the size of this challenge is also an opportunity to strengthen its position on a market where its main competitors are global brands. However, it does not seem to intimidate the team, which is sure of the quality of its work. ""We have never worked so long or so hard on a product launch. We compared ourselves to benchmarks and ultimately surpassed them by delivering better solutions,"" said Anna Blasco-Salvat, marketing director. For Chrisitian Louboutin, for which it is legendary said that a bottle of bright red nail enamel inspired him to coat the soles of his vertiginous stilettos, the leap into the cosmetics sector may seem less obvious, but it is consistent with the glamorous image of the French shoemaker, known for his fascination for Parisian cabarets, from the Moulin Rouge, where he started his career, to the Crazy Horse, for the dancers' of which he made booties and stilettos and signed four scenes of the latest show. For its first foray into the beauty industry, Christian Louboutin partnered with U.S company Batallure Beauty, with the aim to develop and globally market luxury products across a number of classifications. ""Wearing a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes completely transforms a woman and Christian will bring that same transformative quality to women through his beauty products,"" said Robin Burns, Chairman & Co-Founder of Batallure Beauty. ""Twenty years ago I started what I thought would be a small adventure, which ended up becoming a company. The beauty adventure is a natural extension for someone like me, who likes to empower women and to be a part of creating beauty seems like the right next step,"" added Christian Louboutin. The first Christian Louboutin Beauté products are expected to launch late 2013. Sources : Beautypress, Artdeco, Batallure Beauty"
French creative perfumery: why is it performing better abroad than at home?,"But, good news, things are starting to change! On the side of distribution channels first with more and more shops opening specialized in this unique world. On the side of big perfume brands also who are getting involved in the marketing of perfumes of exceptions, and who with this proactive strategy, contribute to better convey this information on another world of perfumes. Finally on the side of suppliers of glass bottles who reaffirmed, on the occasion of this information day, all the good they thought of this sector by striving to adapt their industrial tools to the needs for small batches of high quality required by the creative perfumery. An opportunity, however, for David Frossard (Different Latitudes) and Francois Henin (Jovoy), to make a comprehensive review of this market in France and of the difficulties related to the lack of visibility of creators vis a vis the consumers. An opportunity also for Valérie Pianelli-Guichard (Comptoir Sud Pacifique), Gilles Thévenin (Lubin), Antoine Vuillermet (Lostmarc'h), and Luc Gabriel, The Different Company, to explain their strategies. The opportunity for Nicolas Olczyk (Rouge Curacao), and Isabelle Ferrand (Cinquième Sens) of letting us enter into this wonderful world of unusual fragrances. The opportunity for Frédéric Lebreux (Ifra), to try and make us see that, this particularly controversial subject, of Regulations must not be seen as an obstacle to olfactory creativity. Finally, an opportunity for packaging professionals, including in particular glass manufacturers to demonstrate their know-how and industrial flexibility enabling them to meet the most audacious technical and artistic demands. Full report on the debates next week in Premium Beauty News."
China's beauty market goes premium and online,"Total sales of prestige beauty [1] in China increased by 21 percent in 2011 compared to the previous year, revealed a recent study conducted by The NPD Group. The skincare and makeup were the most dynamic categories, growing by 23 and 17 percent, respectively. Anti-aging continued to play as the driving engine of the prestige skincare market, accounting for a half of the market and posting a robust growth of nearly 27 percent in 2011. Hydrating (+19%) and whitening (+15%) skincare also played a big role in the category growth. In prestige makeup, the face segment captured 59 percent of the category's dollar share and increased by 18 percent in value from 2010. ""Products that make the face look lighter and smoother like foundation and makeup base continued to play a key role in China. Foundation and makeup base led the face category, up 24 and 30 percent, respectively,"" said The NPD Group. In addition to face products, lip helped drive the growth in makeup, with a rise of 26.5 percent from 2010 to 2011 (+31% for lipstick sales and +22% for lip glosses). On the other hand, sales of eye products were soft (up +6%) due to mascara's sharp decline of -3% in dollars and the slower paced sales of eye shadow and eye liner. While the rise of prestige beauty was quite predictable in a country where consumers are seeing their living standards rising quickly, the recent explosion of online sales is more surprising. Actually, according to Kline & Company [2], beauty sales through the Internet in China have been growing at a rate of nearly 200% since 2006 and are estimated to be worth nearly US$8 billion at the retail sales level in 2011, making it the largest Internet beauty market in the world. ""This news is astounding,"" remarks Karen Doskow, Industry Manager at Kline, ""and to put this into perspective, Chinese online beauty sales in 2011 are nearly equal in size to the entire beauty market for France, which is the largest market for cosmetics and toiletries in Europe. Furthermore, Chinese Internet beauty sales are nearly nine times larger than the U.S. Internet beauty market."" ""The rapid growth of Internet usage over the past five years has given way to a tremendous surge in sales and availability of local and foreign cosmetic and toiletry brands,"" explains Li Wang, Vice President of Kline Asia. ""The number of online users and buyers in China has skyrocketed. Internet user numbers in China approached 457 million in 2011, up from 137 million in 2006. Online buyers now total some 205 million in 2011."" So-called ""e-malls,"" such as Tiantian.com and Alibaba's Tmall, are enabling customers to buy from a wide range of domestic and foreign skin care and makeup brands in a convenient one-stop shop. ""We expect the growth of these portals to remain quite robust, driven by continually improving socio-economic dynamic, as well as an increasing appetite for Internet convenience among all consumers,"" adds Doskow."
Selective distribution: Nocibé states its ambitions,"Until now a rather discreet challenger, Nocibé, third selective beauty retailer in France, behind Sephora and Marionnaud, is going on the offensive again, through the impetus given by Isabelle Parize, its President. The chain headquartered in Villeneuve d'Ascq, in the Lille metropolitan region (Northern France), in turn is launching its own brand, with as main assets, a bath product range and a full make-up and nail polish range, that aim to be both accessible, trendy, glamorous, innovative and of quality. A launch which, while being part of an underlying trend in the French selective distribution, claims being, according to the brand, ""the answer to a true expectation"" on the theme ""I want to have fun, I want to test, I want to experiment"" In total, it is no less than 360 references, including 200 in make-up, that will be made available as of May in the Nocibé outlets. ""With this approach, we wish to attract all generations, in perfect complementarity and in perfect harmony with luxury brands,"" explained Isabelle Parize. As far as colours are concerned, for its first cosmetic line under his own name, the retailer's officials believe they have ""thought big, very big even"": 200 products for the eyes, skin and lips, not to mention accessories. But the successful launch of the nail polish line, as a preview, in January, bodes well. It must be said that the company has managed to create the buzz by adding to its 24 traditional nail polish shades, four shades of its Vernis Magnet 3D, containing magnetized nacres to create, with a magnet, small ripples featuring a 3D effect. Nothing revolutionary, maybe, for the aficionados of nail art, but it is a first in this circuit and at this price (6.90 euros)! On the side of bath products, the new Nocibé range is composed of fourteen products (shower gels, body lotions, scrubs, scented candles, massaging oils, eau de toilette, or bath beads), available in six scents decidedly gourmands (Blackberry Blackcurrant, Amber Patchouli, Honey Vanilla, Litchi Redcurrant, Green Tea Citrus, and Jasmine Tiare). The line benefits from bottles designed exclusively for Nocibé to convey the brand values. Among the suppliers mentioned by the retailer at the press conference, companies like HCT, Lumson, Bomal/Pibiplast, and PRP, for the packaging, Intercos, ICC, Hygena-Laboratoires Gilbert, and Alcia Laboratoires, for the formulations. Nocibé also intends to animate its sales operations throughout the year with the launch of ephemeral, one-off product lines. For Mother's Day, it will be the Jungle operation, with nine make-up palettes, bath products and even an eau de toilette Jungle Addict. In July, to celebrate the Olympic Games in London, the retailer will market its Union Jack line, and another one-off animation is planned during Christmas time. A total of three to four annual animations of this type are planned. Finally, for Nocibé and for its competitors in the selective circuit who opted for the launch of private label ranges, the benefit is twofold: a higher profitability, and the diversification of the offer at the entry level in order to attract in stores a younger population, looking for quality products at affordable prices. By joining Sephora and Marionnaud on these grounds, Nocibé makes no secret of its ambitions and is clearly aiming to become the second-largest player on the French market. After having restructured its network and closed several unprofitable or inappropriate outlets, the brand should start opening new outlets again specifically targeting the Paris region and major provincial cities. According to the newspaper, Le Figaro, a new store concept could even be under development. Nocibé which since 2005 belongs to the British fund Charterhouse, achieved in 2011, with 450 stores, 90 franchises, a turnover of 651 million euros."
Sothys wants to develop sales in spas,"With business in beauty salons and spas perking up again after troubled times, sales in Asia representing a real powerhouse, strong growth in France, its home market, and a highly developed international network, Sothys can face the future with some optimism. On the agenda of the 2012 year: The launch in September of a BB cream, the complete redesigning and relaunch of the men's range, and some productive investments in the make-up segment. Founded in 1946, the French brand really took off after it was acquired in the late '60s by the Mas family, who still is its sole shareholder. Today, Sothys represents 80% of the group's consolidated sales, which neared 60 million euros in 2011. The brand is present in 120 countries through a network of agents and a dozen subsidiaries. This international deployment is also one of its main assets. Not only because it offers the possibility of a better resistance to economic vicissitudes, but also because it conveys the image and values of a brand who prefers to invest in lasting relationships with its customers, and remain adamant about its development strategy in beauty salons and spas. ""There is no country where we consider using retail networks to gain in notoriety and grow faster. Our goal is to invest in the long term, by strengthening our partnerships with salons and spas,"" explains Christian Mas, the CEO of Sothys. ""The brand is strong because it shares values which are consistent with those of its distributors and professionals who trust her,"" he added. But because visibility remains a crucial issue in an extremely competitive market, to further increase its brand awareness, the brand taps in channels more in line with its positioning, such as this partnership for the year 2012, with Singapore Airlines, who offers Sothys creams to its first-class passengers. Strong principles that do not stop the brand from broadening its global network, on the contrary. Among recent openings: Macedonia and the Honduras. But the main development priorities are in Northern Europe, Turkey, Asia as always, and of course Russia, where there is a strong potential. Bearing in mind that a market as huge as Brazil still needs to be addressed. ""We were present in this country until 2006 and we are currently looking for a new partner,"" explains Jérôme Froment-Meurice, Export Manager. In any case, this firmness seems to be paying off. Sothys somewhat better withstood the 2008 crisis than some of its competitors. Maybe also because it was, again, an opportunity to put its values to the test. ""We didn't change the R&D resources, or our workforce during that period,"" explains Mas. ""We started from a premise that with a development time for new products ranging from 12 to 24 months, such a strategy would allow us to be in battle order for when the market recovered"" And today, the brand can claim being one step ahead of its competitors. In September, the company should be the first to launch a BB cream exclusively intended for beauty salons. ""This is a segment of its own in which we have the opportunity to develop our expertise and provide a true originality."" Also new in 2012, the complete redesigning of the men's range. Formulas and concepts were revisited and the number of references will increase from four to seven A consistent Investment with the brand's desire to increase its sales in spas, where men's products can represent up to 50% of sales, while this turnover remains marginal in salons, where it peaks at 3%. ""The spa is still very consistent with an ongoing dynamics, particularly in the United States and Canada, details Mas, it is a key axis of our development."""
France: The necessary differentiation of beauty retailers,"If the concentration was already high in selective distribution and mass-market, it is growing increasingly in the hitherto spared circuit of pharmaceutical sales. More than fifteen pharma chains were created in recent years and are uniting a growing number of outlets. Eurostaf also notes that groups of pharmacists are developing ""real branding policies, thus improving their visibility on the beauty market."" [1] In parallel drugstores chains are continuing their deployment driven by supermarkets in particular, (the Leclerc Group as a leader) who are developing their networks at a rapid pace. However, the difficult economic environment and the high cost of market entry, have not deterred newcomers from making their entry. Among them, alternative brands like Mademoiselle Bio for natural cosmetics, specialists of ethnic cosmetics like Mix Beauty and Colorii, but also retailer brands, like Kiko, the Italian brand positioned on low prices, or pure Internet players. These new actors benefit from a unique positioning while on the side of generalists, "" The convergence of offer strategies blur the brands image and strengthens price competition by trivializing the offer."" ""Concerning the offer, the growing number of exclusivity agreements, the positioning in dynamic segments (bio, ethnic cosmetics, doctor brands), the expansion to drugstore products and the development of services are dominant trends."" observes the research firm. Another underlying trend, the growing investment in private labels (PLs), which are mushrooming, with in particular the recent launch in mass market of Carrefour's Cosmetics Design Paris, and the announced one of the Nocibé brand in selective perfumery, and which are getting more sophisticated, with an increasing segmentation, like at Sephora, where the private label is managed like a national brand. The direct consequence, according to Eurostaf, being that in a context where the available retail shelf space is necessarily limited, ""the product delisting of national brands is increasing in all circuits."" In such a competitive environment, networks try to differentiate themselves through their outlets and through the development of new concepts. With more or less success: ""from 5 to 10% growth in sales for Marionnaud's renovated outlets, 5% for Parashop and Galeries Lafayette. For others, like Carrefour Planet, results are disappointing."" The aim for brands is to increase the average basket, seen as a strategic priority to increase the brand loyalty indicator [2] and thus brand loyalty. Apart from optimizing merchandising, this also involves some investment in customer relationship management with the improvement of the quality of the database, the sophistication of loyalty programs (customized programs ""premium"" cards, offered services) and the use of new technologies (Internet, social networks, blogs) to continue to enrich the relationship. All this may require some choice making. Thus, emphasises Eurostaf, Passion Beauty has announced the termination of its magazine to focus resources on customer relationship management."
"""Eudora"": a year already!","Premium Beauty News - Eudora is not only an original brand positioning but, truly, a new strategy for Grupo Boticário! Helena Garcia de Gracia - Absolutely! The decision was taken three years ago. You know that the Group's distribution network is based on a strong network of franchised stores in a Brazilian market historically oriented towards ""door to door"" sales. To grow, there were not that many solutions. We had to create a new brand more in tune with the aspirations of a segment of Brazilian customers that we had not reached yet. And commercialize the brand in both, dedicated stores that are also real platforms to develop our ""door to door"" activity, but also through social networks via the internet. For this, we have studied and questioned nearly 4,000 21st century Brazilian women during several months to understand their aspirations and motivations. This enabled us to determine the category of women who were looking for a certain type of product. Premium Beauty News - Out of the two hundred million inhabitants in Brazil, about half are women. This segment, corresponding to the ones you had selected represented how many consumers for the Eudora products? Helena Garcia de Gracia - Approximately 20%, that is to say 20 million! Eudora understands that the woman has many ways to express herself according to her mood. She may go through different moments without ceasing to be herself. Provocative and surprising, Eudora incorporates a variety of expressions and the sensual moments in beauty and fashion segments. Eudora attends this woman bringing specific products for each of its four moments: Casual, Cool, Powerful and Between 4 walls. Premium Beauty News - Results of a survey that you wanted to take advantage of for each element in the range of your new brand! Helena Garcia de Gracia - It's true that we were very careful to stay consistent with these four wishes expressed by the sample of women we had interviewed. I can even tell you that our investigation even led us, without any taboo, into these new stores selling erotic products to take into account this phenomenon in the development of some of our products. Premium Beauty News - A year later, how many products and how many dedicated stores does the Eudora range include? Make-up is obviously a strong point. Helena Garcia de Gracia - We have on display three hundred references in fourteen stores. Our aim is to reach seven hundred references fairly quickly. You're right, make-up is also a strong asset of the range. The Brazilian market has changed considerably over the last few years. A new breed of consumers has emerged with these men and women, with a greater purchasing power who can have access to more sophisticated products. Premium Beauty News - You believe that more sophisticated products, require an access to a larger and more diversified supplier market. Now you are aware that it is not easy for a supplier to enter the Brazilian market. Helena Garcia de Gracia - That's true! But that's what has also participated to Brazil's economic recovery. The system encourages obviously local production. You must know that we are of course very interested in what is happening in terms of novelties, in all areas of the beauty industry. And any opportunities that can help us gain access to these areas are welcome. I think, in particular, of the recent announcement by the organizers of MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York of the organisation, next year of MakeUp in Sao Paulo. That's an excellent idea that I fully support."
"""Beauty in Brazil, a rapidly developing sector!"" João Carlos Basilio, ABIHPEC","Premium Beauty News - Most beauty industry professionals agree on the fact that Brazil is only at the very beginning of its growth in this sector. Joao Carlos Basilio - We have been experiencing growth rates between 11% and 12% in this segment for almost a decade. And for good reason... If one considers only the last five years, more than 40 million people (including women!) have advanced from a precarious state to the one of empowered consumers with enough purchasing power to buy ""something else"" than just food. A ""boom"" that the whole perfume and cosmetic industry is fully benefiting from, with, still in full swing, the door to door sales sector but also, and this is new, the distribution sector undergoing profound changes with new brands gaining access to the market through the development of new shopping centres and a very dynamic parapharmaceutical sector. As a result, major European or American brands are no longer hiding their intentions of setting foot here. Not to mention many new Brazilian brands that emerging here and there. Premium Beauty News - Those well-known foreign brands are only entering the market now? Joao Carlos Basilio - Some of them, yes. Because to enter the Brazilian market, brands had to be aware of the necessary adjustments they had to do in their formulas, for their products to be able to cope with the Brazilian climate and the different skin types we have in Brazil. For example, a foundation powder or a cream made in the United States or in Europe are not suitable for Brazil. You must also add the fact that the Brazilian tax package is too complex to be administered, which makes it difficult to access these different markets. Premium Beauty News - It is true that volumes have what it takes to make manufacturers' mouths water! Among the latest anecdotes to date, the one referring to the sale of some 70 million bottles of nail polish in just one month, just before the last summer holidays... Joao Carlos Basilio - But this doesn't stop at nail care The face, eyes lips are also the brands core strategy in our country. It must be said that for the eyes, the market development is impressive. Not to mention perfume! Premium Beauty News - The ABIHPEC of which you are the President is, by far, the sector's main professional organization! Joao Carlos Basilio - The largest in fact, with 300 member companies representing 94% of the Brazilian market of the health and beauty sector who generate a turnover of more than USD 17 billion. In this figure, hygiene products have a share of 57%, followed by cosmetics (27.5%) and perfumery (15.5%). The growth rate should again be at least of 10% in 2012 compared to last year. Premium Beauty News - You were already talking about it, things are changing in the distribution sector. Joao Carlos Basilio - That's right! The famous Brazilian exception of ""door to door"" sales is changing. It remains strong and is still developing but new circuits are emerging like the one for example of drugstores and shopping centres where we can see appearing here and there some specialty shops. You also know that Sephora has announced it had made plans to set foot on the Brazilian market. Premium Beauty News - An important development for a market which is opening up to other brands? Joao Carlos Basilio - This indeed can only but encourage the opening of the market to new brands and new products. In fact, some well known Brazilian brands specialized in door to door selling have grasped this opportunity to develop new concepts and new points of sale."
Natural and organic cosmetic brands looking for new growth openings in North America,"While the North American market for natural personal care products has reached 5.4 billion US dollars, Organic Monitor underlines that in most revenue increases are from outside the traditional channel of natural food shops. In a context of slower growth, most brands are focusing on the expansion of the retail network. ""Burt's Bees and Yes To brands have grown considerably in drugstores, whilst premium brands like Dr. Hauschka have become popular in beauty retailers. JR Watkins is focusing on multi-level marketing, whilst brands like Eminence Organic are targeting hair salons. Natural brands are also making inroads in mass market retailers, encouraging supermarkets to develop private label ranges,"" notes the market research firm. Actually, the retail landscape for natural and organic cosmetics is changing at a fast pace. Limited shelf-space for non-food products is restricting growth in natural food shops. In parallel, retailers are also becoming more selective with their natural personal care ranges. Chained outlets, such as Whole Foods Market and PCC Natural Market, are increasingly scrutinizing product formulations. Apart from new distribution channels, export markets are the other important source of business growth for natural and organic cosmetic brands. Asia is one of the main destination for North American brands. Although its size is a fraction of the North American market, the Asian market for natural and organic personal care products continues to show double-digit growth. According to Organic Monitor, the burgeoning middle-class in countries, such as China and India, are creating demand for 'chemically clean' cosmetics. ""The Asian market is attractive because of healthy market growth rates and high consumer preference for western brands. Aubrey Organics is one of the most successful American brands in the Japanese market, whilst Intelligent Nutrients is gaining popularity in Asian countries because of its certified organic range. With a consumer market of 1.2 billion, the Chinese market is deemed the most prospective in Asia. However, few western brands have made advances because of distribution and regulatory issues. A frontrunner is the Australian brand Jasmin Skincare with its range of organic skin care products,"" details Organic Monitor. These various issues will be presented and debated at the next New York edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit organised by Organic Monitor at the InterContinental New York Barclay hotel on 17-19th May 2012. CEOs of leading natural and organic personal care brands will discuss the marketing and distribution challenges they face in the North American market. The panel comprises CEOs from Aubrey Organics, Dr. Hauschka, Weleda, JR Watkins, Eminence Organic and Jasmin Skincare. With research showing raw materials and packaging comprise the highest environmental impact of personal care products, the summit will also hone in on these key areas."
Fragrances boosted prestige beauty sales in the UK,"Data collected by The NPD Group confirm strong growth in the UK prestige beauty market in 2011, one of the most robust sales periods ever. Indeed, total sales grew by 9.4% to £1.7 billion compared to 2010. The market growth was boosted by the two-digit rise of the fragrance sector and by robust sales of prestige make-up and skin care lines, +8.5% and + 8.2% respectively. According to The NPD Group, the exceptional performance of fragrances was fuelled by a series of launches as well as re-launches of existing scents. In particular, the highly successful launch of the new designer fragrance of Jimmy Choo would have boosted the market. ""In 2011 some manufacturers tried a new approach - launching fragrances at the start of the year to maximize share of voice and sales opportunities in what is a quieter time for the sector - rather than waiting for the Christmas season when up to 60% of all sales have traditionally been made. Launched in January 2011, the Jimmy Choo fragrance was publicized throughout the year, culminating in a strong push in the run up to the all-important holiday season. High-end fashion brands are increasingly moving into the premium beauty market allowing consumers to indulge in affordable luxury. Whilst not everyone is lucky enough to be able to afford a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes, being able to own the fragrance gives consumers the chance to own a part of the luxury brand,"" explains June Jensen, Director for The NPD Group's UK Beauty team. As far as make-up is concerned, the overall market growth of 8.5% for the year was fuelled by a strong push on lip colour during the start of the year, with launches and promotional activity from Lancôme, Dior, YSL, Chanel and Estee Lauder amongst others. According to The NPD Group, the big story in the second half was the launch of Benefit's 'They're Real' mascara in August. ""What was interesting about this specific launch was that it was communicated exclusively using social media including YouTube. Support activity from personal consultants in-store was a crucial part of the strategy that eschewed advertising in traditional media such as TV and magazines."" Having been the fastest growing sector of the UK market in 2010, skincare growth slowed last year although a rise of 8.2% would still be very pleasing in most industries in Europe. The main reason for the slowdown, according to The NPD Group, is that existing skincare ranges grew more slowly than in make up and fragrance."
PCD and Aerosol & Dispensing Forum held their first joint edition,"For the first time, these two events were held at the same time and under the same roof, the Espace Champerret, Porte de Champerret, Paris. Apparently, combining the two events was successful, at least if we refer to what exhibitors said to Premium Beauty News. The two events hosted over 2400 attendees from more than 40 countries, announced the organizers. In total, some one hundred suppliers of packaging, dispensing systems, services and technologies for the packaging of perfumes and cosmetics presented their products. Taking advantage of the emphasis put on electronic cosmetic devices during the Innovation Workshop e@PCD, Jackel-LF Beauty presented its latest developments in this field, including: an ultrasonic spatula for an easier application of face cleansers and skin care, and a massage device for the face. Clearly, despite economic pressures, operators continue to deserve great attention to environmental issues, whether in their operations or in the design of their products, with increasing efforts to combine luxury and sustainable development. A trend epitomized by the presentation of Or Infini, an ""exquisite body veil"" eco-designed by the eight partners of Mouvement Infini - Mane, M-real, Rexam, SGD, Strand Cosmetics Europe, Sylvie de France Designer, VPI et Wauters. A theme that was also at the heart of the keynote presentation by Michel Fontaine, President of the French National Council of Packaging, at the beginning of the PCD Awards ceremony, which have honoured the best packaging innovations showcased during the exhibition.

Skincare to fuel growth of men's grooming market,"All studies confirm that men are increasingly paying attention to their personal appearance, with the youngest generations being as vain as their female counterparts. Six in 10 (65%) European men would consider their appearance important and almost half (48%) admit that what they want most is to look attractive and well groomed. Sales of men's beauty and personal care products are subsequently progressing at a steady pace. According to Euromonitor, the global men's grooming market grew by 7.4% from 2009 to 2010, to reach 29,6 billion US dollars in retail value, while beauty and personal care products in general grew by 5.2%, to reach 382,2 US dollars in 2010. In Western Europe, sales of men's cosmetics grew by 3.1% from 2009 to 2010, compared to +2.0% for the overall market. Thus, despite their dynamism, sales are not skyrocketing in developed markets. Mintel estimates that the overall male grooming category in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK was valued at 6.6 billion euros, an increase of just 8% since 2005. ""While the category is set to grow by a further 8% to EUR 7.2 billion (USD 9.5 billion) between 2010 and 2014, the slight dip in 2009, due to the economic crisis, has led to men buying fewer and cheaper grooming products,"" explains the market research firm. Actually, as far as sales are concerned, all male grooming categories are not equal. For instance, the market for shaving products and razors, has remained largely stagnant in the five biggest European countries [1]. According to Mintel, sales in these segments grew from 1.85 billion euros in 2005 to only 2 billion euros in 2010. Over the years, with penetration rates remaining relatively low, skin care products have emerged as the most promising product category in this market. Indeed, according to a new study conducted by The NPD Group, over 9 in 10 men (ages 18+) in the U.S. are using some sort of grooming product today [2]. However, only one quarter of men are currently using facial skincare products [3] such as facial cleansers and moisturizers, lip and eye products, and anti-aging treatments. ""There is a huge opportunity with men for facial skincare. The challenge is getting them involved and engaged,"" says Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. ""Seventy-five percent of men ages 18 and up are not currently using facial skincare products. There is a feeling that facial skincare products are not needed unless you have a specific skin problem such as acne. For men to use a product, he first must be aware that there is an underlying need that requires addressing,"" she adds. In Europe, Germany and Spain have registered the greatest growth in male skincare sales over the past five years. Indeed, the German men's skincare market grew from EUR 65 million (USD 85 million) in 2005 to EUR 130 million (USD 171 million) in 2010, a stunning 100% increase between 2005 and 2010. Similarly, the Spanish market for male skincare grew from EUR 29 million to EUR 51 million between 2005 and 2010, with a growth of 76% in five years. No other sectors within the grooming market have registered the same outstanding performance. ""Men show a huge interest in keeping young looking which has fuelled demand for skincare products that combat signs of fatigue, stress and ageing. An increase in information about male grooming in the media, the availability of a wider range of products, and the wider usage of celebrities to endorse brands has benefited the male grooming category in the past five years,"" explains Nica Lewis, Global Skincare Analyst at Mintel. When it comes to new trends, botanical and herbal products dominate with three in ten new launches during the 18 months to June 2011 featuring botanical ingredients, according to Mintel. Dermatologically tested is the second most popular claim in Western European countries. While just under a quarter of new launches claimed to moisturise or hydrate."
"""Facebook is a marketing tool for ultra-precise targeting""","Premium Beauty News - You are one of the few people who have transformed their passion for social networking in a real occupation. Can you tell us what your activity consists in? Laetitia Luthringer - As a consultant in the Social Media cluster of KRDS, I help brands communicate on Facebook. This includes both operational and strategic missions. It may consist in helping a brand build a page on Facebook, to propose quizzes, to recruit fans for her or to undertake on her behalf a real community management activity. Depending on its identity and its needs, we often undertake an audit to better target its presence on social networks, and advise the brand on all the construction work to achieve in terms of image through these new media. In my case, I am more specifically in charge of luxury brands and of cosmetics. Partly because I was noticed as a beauty blogger and because this passion has led me to always want to get a better mastery of this market's codes and techniques. Most of my missions is devoted to communication on Facebook, KRDS being an agency specialized in F-marketing . But we can also, for larger budgets and when there's an elaborate strategy of development on social networks, operate on other media. Premium Beauty News - Precisely what are the goals of a community management on Facebook? Laetitia Luthringer - I think the greatest achievement of a community manager is when he manages to develop around a brand a large community of fans, with enough motivation and enthusiasm to see the community generate by itself enough buzz and animation. At this stage, his role is simply to guide the community. Among the big successes of this type we can name Starbucks, or in the cosmetic sector, bareMinerals USA (Bare Escentuals Cosmetics). On the Facebook page of these brands, it is mostly the fans who express themselves, and with a high number of online posts (particularly for pictures). At this stage, the role of the community manager is almost only reduced, to controlling the legality of exchanges. Premium Beauty News - However you are often far from such ideal situations! Laetitia Luthringer - Yes. But not all brands have the same goal. For many of them, the display of their products or of their posts is a priority. In this case, the objective is much less to unite a community than to be seen and read by its targeted audience. Premium Beauty News - No salvation outside of Facebook? What, about for example, Google +? Laetitia Luthringer - Being present on several social networks takes time and requires resources. I think that at present, a presence on Google + is justified especially if one is targeting an audience of technophiles and even of techno-addicts. There are many people registered on Google + but the site's traffic rate seems quite low. However some brand have been very successful on this medium, like Burberry. In general, there are two questions to ask oneself before investing on a network. First question, is my target present on that medium? You must address each social network like you would addresses an agglomeration. And then question yourself on the profitability of your investment: where and by whom will you be seen? Will my advertising pay off? From this point of view, Facebook is an ultra-precise targeting tool. Second question, what will I say to my target? You must be sure of your identity and of your discourse. In all cases, a campaign will always have more impact if it is not confined to the only chosen network, but if it is supported by an action on several other media. Especially in France, and more generally in Europe, consumers have less the Facebook reflex than in the United States. If some brands have a very large number of fans, it's often because they did not hesitated to recruit them elsewhere than on Facebook, through POS actions for example. Premium Beauty News - And the cosmetic brands in all this? Some say they are lagging behind? Laetitia Luthringer - This is all very relative! There is nothing surprising if beauty brands took an interest in social media later than high-tech brands. It is a universe that could have seemed very distant to them. But the consequence, when they decided to invest these media, was to step in an increasingly expensive market... Today, for an SME, the entry ticket is far from trivial if one wants to be efficient. Brands that got their tickets first have taken a lead and benefit from a greater loyalty. Premium Beauty News - Is there not also a generational gap with leaders for whom Internet and social networks are still considered as an ""area of inconsistency""? Laetitia Luthringer - Social networking can be scary. This is not specific to cosmetics. To some leaders, entering Facebook is to run the risk of opening Pandora's box. There are several answers to these concerns. On the one hand, there is a legal restraint, which is permitted by the Facebook rules. On the other hand , brands can suggest rules of conduct (policies) on their page, and must not hesitate to put them forward. But it is true that there are always people who have a negative opinion and for whom Facebook can give them the opportunity to speak publicly on the cheap. Listening to these people is always useful. One can of course delete their comments if they violate the rules of good conduct, one can also answer them constructively. They can even sometimes uncover problems not seen before. This possibility which left for someone to express its negative opinions is what makes the strength of communication on social networks. Positive opinions have even more weight than negative opinions are possible. This may seem like a risky bet, because it is generally accepted that a consumer who has a negative opinion on a brand is more likely to express himself than if he had something positive to say. But inside a community of fans, this proportion is very different and positive opinions are expressed more easily and spontaneously. The role of the community manager is also to encourage and facilitate the expression of positive opinions."
Russia: the distribution issue,"Since the liberalization of the Russian economy in the 1990s, the Russian cosmetics market has undergone profound changes and a constant and dynamic growth, with the exception of the brutal recession that followed the 1997-1998 crisis, and the slow-down that followed the 2008-2009 crisis. Estimated at US$ 3.9 billion in 2001, total sales of perfumes and cosmetics accounted for US$ 11.2 billion in 2010 and were expected to reach 13.2 billion in 2011, an increase of 17.8% over the previous year. ""The market is gradually recovering after the crisis, in particular thanks to the strengthening of the rubble, rising incomes and increasing consumer expectation index,"" said Anna Dycheva-Smirnova, Deputy Managing Director of Reed-SK LLC., the organizer of the Intercharm Moscow. The pace of growth should be sustained and the market is expected to approach US$ 17 billion in 2014. In parallel to the development of the market, the distribution was highly restructured in Russia. Open markets, with their amounts of goods of questionable origin, which had become emblematic of the post-communist era now account for only a fraction of the overall distribution of perfumes and cosmetics (8.3%). However the striking phenomenon of the last two years has been the decline of direct sales. If this circuit still accounts for 25.6% of sales, specialty shops have overcome it. This phenomenon is explained by both more efficient distribution channels, which extend their network to better serve the public, and by a shift in consumer preferences towards more upscale goods. This is accompanied, however, by a significant concentration of distributors, in particular with three major networks that dominate the selective distribution (L'Etoile, Ile de Beauté and Rive Gauche), including Moscow and St. Petersburg, and are extending their network at nationally. ""But there are regional chains that may offer an interesting alternative, with favourable terms,"" says Anna Dycheva-Smirnova. Indeed, there are more than 25 local channels, operating in a number of regions, with nearly 400 doors for Sangi Stil, the biggest of them. These chains are, however, often less upscale and are more likely to operate in a ""drugstore"" format, which has emerged as the most dynamic in the country. Regarding the breakdown by product categories, the Russian market is relatively balanced between four major segments: perfumery, skin care, hair care and decorative cosmetics. Decorative cosmetics have been particularly dynamic in recent years, with an average annual growth of 5%. Eventually, as far as major market trends are concerned, one's can note a growing but still marginal interest for natural cosmetics. Generally speaking, environmental issues remain of low concern for the Russian consumers."
Stylesight's views on beauty trends,"With nearly 3,000 subscribing companies and 40,000 individual users in over 60 countries around the world, Stylesight is the industry-leading global content and technology provider for professionals in the style, fashion and design sectors. Stylesight combines trend forecasting and analyses, with an online workspace designed to help analyze and anticipate the ever-changing marketplace. Isham Sardouk, Senior Vice President Trend Forecasting at Stylesight tells us his vision of beauty trends and gives us an extract of its forecasts for 2013. ""The beauty market never seems to be affected by any type of recession. There is always a need for fantasy, which provides a type of escapism into something indulgent. Especially in a time of economic uncertainty, this escape can boost our morale and make us feel better about ourselves. The beauty sector is always dynamic, providing innovative colours and technology,"" says Isham Sardouk. Despite the resilience of this market, there is harsh competition and leaders need to innovate permanently in order to keep their position. ""I think that beauty is an eternal evolution – one that mutates from one stage to the next, but is always going forward,"" adds Isham Sardouk. Stylesight's Beauty Forecast for Spring/Summer 2013 comes across four themes: Subnation, Nutopia, Ashen and Clarity. Mood: An anti-conformist approach resonates with a new generation of urban tribes that are chic and shocking. This style merges disparate genres, combining everything from cocktail glamour to a candid punk attitude. Colours: A range of explosive colors pierces and vibrates with added metallic and changeable effects. Pinks, violets, greens and blues harmonize with power and force. Mood: A positive and radiant ambiance sees oranges and reds flourish in a theme where nature takes back its rightful place in the world. There is a fresh desire for outdoor living and a need to experience cool, dewy mornings. Colours: A truly sunny palette emphasizes subtle oranges and coral nuances. Red and copper will also feature in darker tones that veer towards crimson. Turquoise and sky blues, along with prairie greens, will illustrate the outdoor aspect and the re-found respect for nature. Mood: A monastic universe recalls the Victorian era in stark contrasts of dark and light. Materials will express this mood, moving from patina to aged and weathered effects. Dust, cinders and mists will soften this richly dark mood. Colours: A misty theme appears through stormy skies, dusts and cinders, lightened by a touch of sky blue. Powdered pinks temper the grey expanse of the palette. Mood: The extreme orient is set to influence a current with two distinctive streams. One side emphasizes purity while the other plays with tradition to develop a modern and fantastical aesthetic. Colours: The colour range will showcase impertinent acidic hues and soft colors with a fresh twist. The most prominent colors emerge as orchid pinks, bamboo greens or coral while translucent effects and jelly consistencies are set to renew textures. What makes each of Stylesight's four key themes different for S/S 13 is the difference in color range. Some trends in beauty are focused on the 'non-color' trend, whether it's developed through naturals, skin tones or simply muted neutrals. On the other hand, we have trends that only focus on brights; saturated vivid colors with a lot of different textures. The common thread between these themes is the importance of textures and finishes. A color without texture or finish is meaningless today."
"French enjoy gift sets, but not at any price","At Christmas time, the French acclaim gift-sets, but not at any price and provided they are seduced. These are the results of the qualitative study conducted online by Panel On The Web, a subsidiary of Promise Inc., a consulting and market research firm, specializing in the analysis of consumer behaviour. In the cosmetics business, these gift sets appears to be a Christmas hit, with 2 to 3 million items sold every year. The study was conducted between October 24 and November 1, 2011, on a representative sample of 500 individuals (male and female) 15 years old and more. Six beauty gift boxes, available this year in France, whose prices range between 45 and 115 euros were screened through three questions to assess their attractiveness: ""3 customized fragrances"" (50 euros), Beauté Divine (69 euros), Elaÿs (109 euros), Love the carrots, by Honoré des Prés (76 euros), box Bento Box, by Nars (115 euros) and Contes de fée parfumés, by Cire Trudon (45 euros). Is it because of the economic crisis context or just a choice of reason? The fact is that the cheaper boxes monopolize the top three places. But the distribution is not mechanical as the Beauté Divine gift set, the most expensive among the top three, ranks first: – First: the Beauté Divine gift-set (69 euros) – 2nd: the ""3 custom fragrances"" gift-set (50 euros) – 3rd: ""Les contes de fée parfumés, Cire Trudon"" (45 euros) The point to be noted about the Beauté Divine gift-set is that it is the only box offering a so-called ""experiential"" present. Actually, it consists in offering a skin-care session in a beauty salon - a well-being moment - rather than make-up or perfume. The French also need to appreciate what they offer to their relatives. The results of the study show that, whatever the gift-set, percentages are almost identical for the two questions on the concepts of ""act of purchase"" and ""desire to receive."" For example, in the case of the gift box ""3 custom fragrances"": 30% of respondents would like to receive it as a present, and 29% plan to buy it in order to offer it to a relative. ""The symmetry between the desire to purchase and the desire to receive can be applied to all the gift-sets presented in this study,"" said the authors. However, it must be noted that almost all the gift-sets achieved higher preference rates among women, with the exception of the Elaÿs gift set, the only one that more men (34%) than women (21%) want to offer. Indeed this package features a bottle of champagne with two creams, allowing the present to be shared. This gift thus express its full potential during the holiday season. ""Elaÿs seems to have met the challenge of convincing male customers,"" concluded the authors of the study."
MakeUp in Paris 2012 on the rise,"MakeUp in Paris continues growing, with one figure to remember: +25%. Indeed, the next edition to be held on 21 and 22 June 2012 at the Carrousel du Louvre, is already recording an increase of 25% in the number of exhibitors, as well as a 25% increase in exhibition space, according to the organisers. Actually, almost all exhibitors in the previous editions have signed up for the next one, and over 15% of them have decided to increase the surface of their stand in 2012. As for the organisers, in order to consolidate the unique positioning of MakeUp in Paris as the a high-end business to business event exclusively dedicated to the make-up industry, the aim remains to reach a good balance between the various product categories, with exhibitors proposing formulation and full development services as well as packaging suppliers, together with a series of make-up animations and professional conferences, during the two days of the event. Among the new exhibitors: Cosmogen, a French company specialising in the design, development, and production of makeup and cosmetic packaging and applicators, to elaborate its new line of brushes, Marbella, a French supplier of luxury body jewels, Kum, a German supplier of cosmetic sharpeners and brushes, Rusi, a German group specializing in the manufacture of manufacture of make-up lines, in particular of mascaras, lip-glosses or eyeliners, and SGD, the world's leading manufacturer of glass for the beauty industries."
Marionnaud is renovating its outlets to attract new customers,"Step by step, Marionnaud is continuing the renovation of its brand and the unification and harmonization of its network that it had started in 2005 following its acquisition by the AS Watson Group, the world's leading distributor of beauty products and toiletries. With 572 outlets in France, Marionnaud can rely on the largest network in the country, but this network of outlets is heterogeneous, reflecting a growth that was achieved through successive acquisitions of regional chains and independent stores. In France, the sales areas range from 20 to 900 sqm, the outlets can be located in city centres or in shopping malls in all types of cities and catchment areas. The brand is also present in Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Romania, the Czech Republic and Portugal. After having reorganized its logistics and reshaped its IT system to finally manage to unify it at the group level, Marionnaud has renovated most of its beauty salons (240 out of 254 in 2010) and reviewed its signage in April, before tackling in 2011 the very concept of outlets, with a new version being tested on more than 70 outlets. As the first results posted by these outlets - 5 to 10% increase in sales - met and sometimes exceeded the group's expectations, the pace of renovations should be increase compared to what had originally been planned. ""Legitimizing our approach, shareholders have given us the means to accelerate the program enabling us to have half of our stores completely revamped as of 2012,"" was delighted to say William Koeberlé, CEO of the Marionnaud Group. The pleasure of discovering and a clear consumer perception of the offer have been placed at the core of the project, so to make shopping even easier through clear signage, family products (women's perfumes, men's perfumes, skincare) identified with their own colour codes, readily available products, and beauty consultants always available. ""Without reinventing everything, we worked on a concept store which could be used on all our formats, all our sales areas, and for all customer types"", explained Fabrice Obenans, Marketing Director of the brand. Fragrances are arranged on either side of the outlet, with a taupe colour on the left for men, and a mauve colour on the right for women. Areas dedicated to sales opportunities, new products and seasonal events were created and the opportunities for impulse buying of small complementary products have been increased. The area dedicated to care was designed as a space conductive to a privileged relationship with the beauty consultant. Located in a quiet area, at the back of the outlet, it is the perfect place to start discovering and learning around the ""beauty bar"". The make-up offer, the pleasure category par excellence, for its part has been granted a central place in the outlet, with standardized dedicated furniture and inclined displays designed to increase the visibility and accessibility of products. Make-up through its accessibility, is also, coupled to the brand's private labels, one of the main component of the strategy devised to reconquer customers. To regain market share, Marionnaud is also relying on the strengthening its image of proximity and accessibility. Hence the development of the make-up offer, perceived as a good way of recruiting young customers, with in particular the Danish brand Gosh, for which the group is the exclusive distributor in France. In general, the most accessible offers, especially the group's private labels, are more particularly put forward in order to capture new, younger customers. Thus, an ""impulse table"" located at the store entrance, showcases the set boxes, the price opportunities and current commercial news. ""Customers that way, can enjoy from the start products in connection with the brand's latest commercial updates, thus demonstrating its beauty expertise and its price affordability"", the company said. All or part of a wall panel is dedicated to Marionnaud's skincare offering. As for Marionnaud accessories, they are displayed in transparent Plexiglas compartments located in different areas depending on the configuration of the outlet: in wall units (near the check-out, or near the make-up to make the connection between the two worlds), in displays at each end of the aisles and at the check-outs. in spite of this emphasis on the Marionnaud offer, William Koeberlé insists that in no case this offer cannibalizes the offer from selective brands, but on the contrary provides a complementary service. ""Our core business is selective distribution. But there is a large part of needs which is not appropriately covered by the offer in selective circuits, especially in the bath and shower segment."" Consistent with this approach, the brand will soon present a range of skincare products for men under its own name, with nine references including shaving, deodorants and anti-aging products."
Cosmoprof Asia carries on its rise,"At time of publication of these lines, we do not have the details about visitor numbers of the last edition of Cosmoprof Asia, which was held from the 9th to the 11th of November 2011 in Hong-Kong, but we know already that the organizers have reached their first goal: to fill all the halls of the Hong-Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Cosmoprof Asia hosted this year 1,780 exhibitors, up 9% compared to the previous years, occupying a total of 68,000 sqm, up 18% on 2010. Among these exhibitors coming from 42 countries, the show welcomed 477 new comers. 23 country and group pavilions took part in the event: Australia, Belgium, Mainland China, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, UK and USA, with Jordan, Pakistan and Turkey as first-timers. With such a record participation, the organizers of Cosmoprof Asia have succeeded in fulfilling the two halls that were still available last year. They also approach the objective which they have announced for one year: to become the world's first trade show of the beauty industry, before Cosmoprof Worldwide, which is held in Bologna, Italy. A concern however, that space becomes scarcely available, and the risk of not being able to answer all the demands during the next years. What are the reasons for this success? Unquestionably, the dynamism of most markets in the Asia Pacific region has played a key role in the impressive development of Cosmoprof Asia. In addition, the organizers have cleverly uses the attractiveness of Hong Kong to open the show to open the all the area, so as not positioning as a Chinese only event. As a result, exhibitors as visitors come from around the world, of course primarily from the neighbouring Asian countries, such as Korea, Indonesia, Japan, or Thailand, but also from the Middle East and Europe. It thus possible to observe on the show floor a surprising number of visitors from Central and Eastern Europe or Russia. As the access to mainland China's markets still remain highly complex for most exporters, this regional opening is unmistakably an enormous asset. Should we also consider the quality of the organization, it is not surprising that we hardly met any deceived exhibitor, even if some of them recognized that the Asian markets were becoming more and more demanding and that this show, as the others, needed to be carefully prepared. In particular as competitors from Asia are proposing an increasingly higher level of offer. The next edition of Cosmoprof Asia will be held from 14 to 16 November 2012."
The French cosmetic industry goes looking for growth in emerging countries,"Sales of French cosmetic manufacturers continue to rise, driven by a domestic market that has returned to growth in 2010, in particular because ofselective distribution (2.8 billion euros in 2010, i.e. an increase of 1.9 % over 2009 according to NPD) and mass distribution (5 billion euros in 2010, i.e. an increase of 1.5% over 2009 according to Nielsen) and, despite a slight drop in sales from the pharmacies and drugstores circuit (1.54 billion euros, i.e. a drop of -0.87% compared to 2009 according to Nielsen). But it is mostly thanks to their performance on foreign markets that cosmetic French manufacturers have continued to post remarkable growths in sales, said Gérard Delcour, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the FEBEA, (the French trade association representing manufacturers operating on the Beauty market), at a breakfast organized by the BeautyFULL Club last November 4th, themed on the main growth drivers for the beauty industry. Indeed, figures provided by the French customs reported a 9.2% increase in French exports of perfumes and cosmetics in 2010 compared to the previous year. Overall French exports of perfumes and cosmetics reached 9.538 billion euros (ex-works before tax prices) in 2010. In this sector, the French trade balance surplus remains high (7.571 billion euros, i.e. an increase of 9.4% over the 2009 surplus. While most of French exports go to countries of the European Union (53%), the markets where the growth is strongest are Latin America (which is currently only 4% of exports but up 24% in 2010), European countries outside the Union, which grew by 19% in 2010 (and account for 11% of exports, thanks to the weight of Russia) and the Far East, up 19% representing a share 12.8% of total French exports. ""If the market still clearly remains an European market, most of the growth come from emerging markets. It is estimated that 60% of the growth in years to come will be fuelled by the BRIC countries"", commented Gérard Delcour. However, behind this BRIC acronym - which means Brazil, Russia, India and China - lie some markets very different from one another. The Russian market is certainly the one who, with its structure, distribution and consumer preferences, is the closest to the French market and more generally the European one. The Brazilian market however, is characterized by a severe lack of distribution networks, that leading brands (Natura, O Boticario, Avon) try to overcome by resorting to direct sales. ""But things are changing, notes Delcour, especially with the arrival of Sephora, who last year took control of Sack's an online shopping platform and one of the leading distributors of beauty products in Brazil."" India, however, remains primarily a market for toiletries and haircare products (bath and shower, shampoo, etc.) manufactured locally, and where imported high-quality products are only enjoyed by a small elite, particularly because of high custom duties and a very weak distribution network. As for China, it is obviously a very dynamic market, but exporters of perfumes and cosmetic products are still facing great difficulties to access this market which has set up technical barriers effectively blocking the entry of new products."

Global sales of natural cosmetics to reach USD 9 billion,"In an upcoming report on the Global Market for Natural & Organic Personal Care Products, Organic Monitor predicts sales to reach 9 billion US dollars this year and 14 billion in 2015. Organic Monitor estimates that natural and organic products have 2% share of the global personal care product market. ""Demand for natural and organic products has spread to every region, however sales remain concentrated in Europe and North America,"" the company reports. ""In some countries - such as the USA, Germany, Austria - the market share is reaching 10 percent. The large market share is because of high consumer awareness and extensive distribution of natural and organic products."" Availability is a major driver of market growth, explains Organic Monitor. While their distribution was initially limited to specialized organic food retailers, in many countries now natural and organic personal care products have reached all mainstream retail channels, including pharmacies, drugstores, supermarkets and department stores and high-end retailers. Companies like ADA Cosmetics and Panpuri are developing natural lines for hotels and the spa channel. Furthermore, the production of natural and organic cosmetics is no longer limited to specialized brands. ""Large cosmetic companies are entering the naturals arena. Some like L'Oreal and Colgate-Palmolive have taken the acquisition route, whilst others have developed natural / organic lines. Recent newcomers, such as Garnier, Henkel and Amore Pacific, are launching certified organic products,"" adds Organic Monitor. Eventually, retailer private labels are also becoming prominent for natural personal care products, in particular in Germany and many other European countries. However, the rising number of competitors is now coinciding with slower market growth rates. In this environment, Organic Monitor finds successful brands are those that focus on marketing and distribution to differentiate their products. ""Concept stores have become en vogue, with leading brands like Aveda, Melvita and Korres opening international retail networks."" Latest findings from Organic Monitor's new report as well as future growth projections will be given in dedicated workshops at the Asia-Pacific (November 7-8th in Hong Kong) and European (November 28-30th, in Paris) editions of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit."
The evolution of the relation to beauty in the U.S.A.,"While the United States are gradually emerging from a crisis that marked their history and shook up their values, the beauty market has recovered strongly, showing a remarkable resilience. New proposals have emerged, riding on emerging lifestyles, leading to a significant evolution in the relation to beauty. It is this evolution that Rémy Oudghiri, Director of the Prospective for market research firm IPSOS, and Leila Rochet-Podvin, Founder of the agency Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation, presented in October as part of Beyond Beauty Paris. Five major themes have been decrypted, Rémy Oudghiri decoding societal trends and Leila Rochet-Podvin unveiling underlying emerging product trends. Compared to their European or Japanese counterparts, American women seem to have a casual relationship to appearance, giving greater value to independence of mind. However, a thorough analysis of their responses to the surveys conducted by IPSOS, reveal that appearance is in reality a real source of stress in their daily life and that the aging is less well accepted in the U.S. than elsewhere. The neutral styles of crisis times have finally given way to what Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation called ""the great comeback of the hyper-femininity,"" including sophisticated make-up, flawless complexions, and highlighted and more colourful eyes and lips, with a more seductive state of mind. Self-confidence is central to the American vision of beauty (49% of American women say it is one of the reasons that lead them to make-up), which is modelled on an increasingly urban pattern and on the go lifestyles. This results in a quest for hyper-performance: the products must be mobile, easy to use and highly effective at the same time. As a result, multifunctional products flourish on the market. They are stackable (eg Sephora Collection), with multi-brushes (MAC) or proposed as wipes (eg, Dr. Dennis Gross self-tanning and exfoliating). If the desire to appear ""younger than her age"" is not seen as ridiculous in the United States as it is often the case in France, Germany or Italy, the crisis has partly questioned the cult of youth. Indeed IPSOS studies show that the idea that beauty is acquired with maturity, is progressing gradually. The concept of ""aging well"" tends to replace the ""look young"". The search for ethical values survived to the crisis. According to 61% of American women, a luxury beauty brand must be ethical. Similarly, the ecological sensitivity remains strong after the crisis. ""Ethical promises are no longer a specificity of niche brands,"" confirms Leila Rochet-Podvin. ""Right now, a series of pink products are flooding the shelves, and support the action of the Pink Ribbon fight against breast cancer. In Soho, the new boutique Treasure & Bond, an initiative of Nordstrom, pays 100% of its profits to charities. For consumers, ethical values do not replace the search for performance or pleasure but add to them, according to the 'double bottom line' principle."" The proportion of women members of the so-called ""ethnic minorities"" is increasingly important in the United States. Surveys show that minorities more and more contribute to create new symbols of femininity. Beyond a demographic reality, the ideal of a ""mixed race"" beauty is merely becoming the new American standard of beauty. According to a study in the March edition of Allure magazine, 64% of respondents say that a woman of mixed complexion is the epitome of the American beauty. Consequence of a reality that is reinforced by magazines, fashion designers and cosmetics brands in America: ethnic minorities are increasingly present in the media."
"Maria Viegas, Albéa, ""Consumers are showing the way to us!""","Premium Beauty News - You have launched in quick succession several innovations in the field of lip applicators. Where do you find your inspiration from? Maria Viegas - Our proactive approach that we had already explained on a previous occasion on your site, has confirmed being the right one and has even strengthened in recent months. Basically it consists in always staying tuned to the market and its trends. We systematically organize brainstorming sessions with consumer panels to feed our creativity. At the same time, we have developed partnerships with a network of designers, make-up artists, experts in various fields, and this, in all parts the world. These numerous sessions and the quality of the resulting feedback, confirm the necessity to meet the specific needs inherent to each country. Gone are the days where there was just one packaging on display, not to mention the universal applicator. Consumer expectations, for example, in South America are very different from those in China or in the Middle East. Premium Beauty News - A true revolution! Because it is one thing to notice it, but it's a completely different story when it comes to implementing it on a industrial scale! Maria Viegas - Yes, but it's our job! And we are already in battle order to take up these challenges with a very operational but also very flexible industrial tool, to support our customers in their growth projects. We are also aware that innovation does not focus only on products but it does also in processes. At Albéa, we also pay a lot of attention to all the developments on materials, surface treatments, new technologies sometimes coming from other areas and that may lead to new avenues in our domain. Premium Beauty News - Any examples of this ""flexibility"" in terms of innovation and on the efficiency of the feedback from the field? Maria Viegas - Yes, for instance the three rotating lipgloss applicators that we have just released! They enable a perfectly uniform application of the formula on the lips and maximum brightness in a single stroke. This applicator is actually part of the SpinArt™ family. The first one, called ""Volume +"" is a flocked applicator with a simple shape but which, thanks to its different options in terms of wipers and sizes of the stem, enables according to the needs to better control the amount of formula applied on the lips compared to a standard applicator. The second one, ""Silhouette"", with its design recalls unquestionably feminine curves. With its ergonomics it fits perfectly to the shape of lips. The ""formula traps"" located at the upper part and bottom part of the flocked tip make it possible to apply just the right amount of product as of the first application. Finally the third applicator, ""Mars"", features a non-flocked tip with an extremely original shape. It clearly offers more definition and more hygiene thanks to its angled tip. Composed of ""micro formula traps"" it is ideal for pearly lipgloss formulas. Premium Beauty News - Another feedback from your 'field' sessions, the come back on the lips of the red colour and a demand for precision! Maria Viegas - Absolutely! intense colours are back and ask for more technical applicators. And Néopro, the new range of lipgloss spatulas, epitomizes this trend perfectly. This new series of six innovative lip applicators (""Tulip"", ""Up&Down,"" ""Fiber Sensation"", ""Feather,"" ""Rose"" and ""Luxe Color"") combines an eye-catching design, vibrant colours and a professional make-up result. They also come in a flocked or partly flocked version according to requirements. Premium Beauty News - This indeed is all about ""ultra"" precision! Maria Viegas - This is the result of our studies! We offer a complementary range: the ""Tulip"" Model with its flower-shaped spatula stands out thanks to its incredible fineness and extreme comfort, perfect for liquid gloss and lipstick formulas with strong and opaque colours. ""Up&Down"" has two different sides to make up the lower and upper lip. A single stroke is enough to achieve a very technical result, a real tool worthy of a professional make-up artist. ""Fiber Sensation"" mimics the gestures of the make-up artist with a brush for ultra shiny formulas and a wet effect. The feather tipped shape and its firmness allows for a precise lip contour. ""Rose"" has a thick base with large formulas traps to capture a large amount of gloss. ""Lux Color"" features on one side some grooves to load the applicator with formula and a flat side that enables to smoothly apply the gloss on the lips."
Perfumes and cosmetics facing the challenges of ethical sourcing,"Fair trade and ethical channels that are beginning to take shape in perfumery and cosmetics are seen as an extension to the bio trend. This is quite a challenge in fact: to offer products elaborated through responsible supply chains, lending as much attention to environment than it does to human beings. The goal being not to lose sight of the concern for fairness and social partnership that first guided pioneers in organic products. At a time when, with a flurry of standards, of labels, and with the entry on the market of multinationals and private labels, bio products tend to become a purely technical matter, ethical channels seek to reconnect to the social pillar of sustainable development. ""This came as a logical continuation of our commitment six years ago in the manufacture of natural scented composition"", explained François-Patrick Sabater, CEO of Technico Flor, a creator and manufacturer of aromatic compositions for the perfume industry. As for the supply chain in shea butter implemented by L'Occitane, which includes five cooperatives and employs nearly 12,000 women in Burkina Faso, it results, explains Maud Reboul, Sustainable ingredients & Supply chain Project Manager for L'Occitane, from the commitment, more than thirty years ago, of Olivier Baussan, the founder of the brand, in favour of what was not yet called sustainable development. Ecocert, with the launch of its repository ""ESR - Equitable, Solidaire, Responsable"" (Fair Trade, Supportive, Responsible) and Cosmébio who has modified its charter to take into consideration ethical and fair trade concerns, are following the same logic. The main objectives of the Round Table ""Fair Trade Perfumes and Cosmetics"" were to better understand the concept of fair trade and to put into contact the actors involved. Julie Stoll (Plateforme Française du Commerce Equitable - PFCE), Maud Reboul (L'Occitane en Provence), Patrick Collin (Golgemma), François-Patrick Sabater (Technico Flor) and Jérôme Vaquier (Ecocert) presented their activities in this area and exchanged views with brands and stakeholders gathered for the occasion. Among the priorities put forward by different stakeholders, the need to develop the offer emerged first. The perfume and cosmetic market originating from fair trade is still very marginal in France and the offer is confidential, unlike the English market which is driven by dynamic major brands and a keen consumer interest. The various participants, admitted however that there were still too few of these fair trade channels. The greatest difficulty not pertaining so much to additional costs but more to the time needed to really structure the supply chains and get the desired qualities. ""But with this progressive multi- stage approach, we don't need to start everything at once, we can engage ourselves in a process of progress scheduled on a 2 or 3 year period"", tempered Claudie Ravel, General Managing Director and Marketing Manager of Guayapi, one of the pioneering companies in this field in France. Hence the importance of uniting all stakeholders to create partnerships for the development of these fair trade programs. ""By sharing our experiences, we hope to spark the interest of other operators who in turn will also work with the producers that we support, making them less dependent on L'Occitane"", explained Reboul. Once the channels are in place, the creation of value will surely be the one expected. In particular because of an improvement in the quality of materials produced thanks to a tightening of links and a closer cooperation with suppliers. ""Our - human and financial - return on investment, is truly beneficial for both producers in Madagascar and Golgemma. It is truly a virtuous social, commercial and environmental circle"", commented Patrick Collin, Director General of Golgemma, a company specialized in the production and trading of essential oils, hydrosols and maceration oils. François-Patrick Sabater also believed that ""Fair Trade creates a true dynamic within Technico Flor, but also with customers and suppliers. This approach leads us to more transparency and enhances our creativity. In addition, our commitment towards sustainable development has taken another dimension. The fact that all our fragrances can now take advantage from excellent fair trade essential oil stands as a proof."" An approach that should quickly sparkle increasing interest among both industrialists and consumers, even if, as all stakeholders underlined, it could not be considered as a panacea. Indeed, by definition, fair trade channels only concern some producers, leaving all the others in the traditional trade circuits."
Michele Burke: Passion and love for make up!,"Premium Beauty News - Where did you get that passion for make-up? Michele Burke - I was probably predestined to it! I was born in Ireland and I emigrated to Canada late 1973. I moved to Montreal and found a job in fashion. I noticed the work of make-up professionals and then it was just like love at first sight for what will become my profession! Anyway, I always felt from the start irresistibly attracted by artistic ""matters"". However, I had no idea at the time that I could make a living out of it. But I really wanted to! And where there is a will... Premium Beauty News - Precisely, from this will is going to emerge all the talent that you had in you? Michele Burke - Absolutely! But it was necessary to spark and channel this talent. So of course I took some courses. Then I began to get clients. One of the first was with Revlon, doing live demonstrations. Then, in the early 80's, I met two Makeup Artists, Electa and Corrado, who owned a make-up outlet with their own brand of makeup and with whom I worked with for two years doing makeovers, print and runway shows. They were truly... precursors, because today's specialty brands that have their own makeup lines have certainly drawn their inspiration from them. All these early years are very important to me and my evolution as a makeup artist. At this point I was firmly decided and committed, ""I want to become a true professional makeup artist!"" Premium Beauty News - The die is cast but not just in any direction. Michele Burke - That's true! I quickly chose make-up in the film industry. Rightly or wrongly, I believed the makeup for film is one of the royal roads to do this job I love so much. And the facts will prove me right. I started by working on three films for no pay, just experience. I was a sort of multipurpose make-up artist! At this point I felt that the way ahead is almost mapped out. And actually, my career began to take off quickly. It must be said that at the time the city of Montreal attracted a lot of film producers, especially for horror movies. You can imagine in such conditions all the creative opportunities that were offered to me. Nothing like a horror film to develop one's talent in make-up! Premium Beauty News - And then there's the movie, Quest for Fire. A milestone! Michele Burke - Yes absolutely! This film will represent a major step. It will be my first Oscar. For the record, no make-up artist agreed to leave for seven months of shooting in the wild. But I was made for this kind of challenge. After, of course, events happened even faster I participate to several wonderful films in a row, in Canada such as Ice Man, Clan of the Cave Bear, and many horror films too numerous to mention. Premium Beauty News - An acceleration that can only lead you to the West Coast of the United States. Michele Burke - Yes and obviously Hollywood was a necessary stop on my royal road. So in 1985 I moved to Hollywood where I had to start again almost from scratch. People weren't waiting for me! You have to prove yourself! This will be the case with a film, Bram Stoker's Dracula, for which I get my second Oscar. [1] Premium Beauty News - The other films come in quick succession and you have excelled in recent years in several major Hollywood productions such as Rock of Ages, Mission Impossible IV and III, Tropic Thunder, The Cell, Elizabethtown, Spanglish, Minority Report, As Good As It Gets, Austin Powers 2, 3, Interview with the Vampire, etc. But cinema is not all? Michele Burke - That's right! During that period, I also worked for some big brands like Max Factor, Procter & Gamble, etc. Then in 2006, I have the opportunity to meet the GEKA team. The company had a desire call to utilize the experience of a make-up artist like me to develop new applicators and make the existing ones more efficient. I found the challenge interesting. This is the starting point of an exciting collaboration, which has led us to develop novel products, like for example, GEKA's latest gloss applicator ""LipDefiner Max"". The applicator is inspired by my pinky finger, and is a real power loader thanks to its ergonomic shape. In addition I have also designed a series of unique multi-functional lip and eye applicators. There's really nothing like them in the market… Yet ! Premium Beauty News - What is your philosophy of make-up? Michele Burke - In general make-up must first of all allow a person to feel better about themselves. Make one feel beautiful! But we have all our own personal beauty needs. We have to look at our faces and discover ourselves. Find one signature note or feature like eyes or lips and focus on that! Beauty and makeup is all about self-discovery and the image we want others to see. We have to sift through all the information about cosmetic products and beauty tips and find out what suits us and what we need. So, my philosophy is to focus on our best features, correcting what we can and ignoring what we can't change without doing any harm or damage. Always be ready for evolution. Don't get stuck in applying the same colours and looks all the time. Only follow trends if they look good on you. Carefully consider the colour and style of your hair. Good grooming can make you look like a million. There is nothing more golden than a smile. Premium Beauty News - This profession that you have taken up is really a matter of passion! Michele Burke - As I have already had the occasion to say. I think you need a love and a passion for it. It is not for everybody, with all the hours you put in and the personal sacrifices. Those who have that passion and love, whether male or female, will make it. See on line : www.micheleburke.com"
TFWA World Exhibition in the dynamics of travel retail,"The annual travel retail event hosted a total of 5868 visitors from 2737 companies, increasing respectively by 9% and 6% compared to the previous year. According to the organizers, of that total 15% were key duty free operators and retailers. Among the 457 exhibitors, 128 belonged to the perfumes and cosmetics sector, including Ahava, Beauté Prestige International (BPI), which showcased Kokorico, the new Jean Paul Gaultier fragrance, the Jacques Bogart group, or Gosh Cosmetics, a Danish makeup specialist. The French company Terre d'Oc, which is not yet distributed in the travel retail channel, also took the opportunity of this event to meet some of its distributors. According to the Tax Free World Association, global duty free and travel retail sales rose by 13% in US dollars between 2009 and 2010 (+11% in local currencies) to 39 billion dollars. With 13.8 billion dollars and a market share of 35.4%, Europe remains the largest duty free and travel retail market, followed by Asia-Oceania (USD 12.7 billion and 32.7% market share), and the Americas (USD 8.9 billion and 23% market share). But in this market as in others, the Asia and Ocenia zone proved to be the most dynamic and grew by 23.7% from one year to another. In comparison, the growth of the European market appears as rather more sluggish (+3.6%). Perfumes and cosmetics account for 30.8% of the total market, and increased by 13% between 2009 and 2010, identical to the total market, second only to luxury goods (+16.5%). The next edition of the TFWA World Exhibition will take place from 21st to 26th October 2012 in Cannes."
Personal care products: Emerging markets are driving the global growth,"First conclusion drawn from the study [1], total global sales of personal care products have reached a record of USD 380 billion in 2010, or the equivalent of USD 56 per capita, an increase of 7% on the previous year. Sales, which according to the authors of the study, should continue to grow by 3% per year to 2014. Hair care would represent the first in all product categories, with some 49 billion units sold, followed by bath and shower products, and facial skincare products coming third. The Asia-Pacific region represents the largest share in the global market of personal care products with 56% in volume, Europe accounts for 19%, Latin America for 14%, North America for 8% and Middle East for 2%. It is Asia too that should achieve the highest growth rates. The hair care category, in particular, should record its highest rise over the next coming years with an increase of around 9% per year, and hair colouring products leading the way. The dynamic is the same in Asia for facial skin care products where the growth should be of 7% per year. Another interesting figure revealed by the study, Latin America accounted for 26% of global sales of perfume in 2010. In this region, the overall market of personal care products is expected to grow by 4% annually to 2014. The best performance being achieved by facial make up, perfume and eye make-up. According to Rexam, ""Latin America is expected to be the main growth friver of the global beauty industry, with the region set to add over USD 18 billion to its value size by 2015"". Let's mention also the good performance of colour cosmetics in the Middle East and Africa, with an expected growth that should be well above the average. Facial make-up should increase by 11% annually while eye make-up is expected to grow by 7% per year. Perfumes should also do well. However, sales of fragrance in the region are heavily weighted in a small minority of wealthier countries - Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Israel, United Arab Emirates and Iran. More generally, the authors of the study subsequently forecast a strong growth in packaging needs for the personal care sector and expect a rise around 5% a year to 2014. Source: Rexam"
Strong growth for TV and internet cosmetic sales in the U.S.,"Sales of cosmetics and toiletries through alternate channels have skyrocketed, growing by nearly US$ 1 billion since 2005, reveals a recent report by consulting and research firm Kline & Company. [1] Internet sales (e-commerce) are leading the way with a 25.4% growth from 2005 to 2010, followed by home shopping networks like QVC and HSN posting an annual growth (CAGR [2]) of nearly 20%. As ""consumers are increasingly drawn to the convenience of at-home shopping to meet their beauty needs,"" Kline forecasts that double-digit growth should continue. ""Consumers are spending more time at home, either by virtue of unemployment, telecommuting, or merely a desire to save money by not going out so much,"" observed Karen Doskow, Consumer Products Industry Manager at Kline. ""Instead of running out to the store to buy their beauty products, they're watching home shopping channels and infomercials to get the latest on new products."" Kline also says that consumers increasingly tend to use online services to get more information on products. ""The Internet and mobile technologies are empowering consumers to be even more aggressive in their product and price comparisons and driving marketers to deliver value-based products to meet these demands,"" adds Doskow. Both brand marketers and retailers are adapting their strategies to the growing importance of these channels. Kline's study reveals that as brands increasingly look to leverage mobile and e-commerce to create seamless and ubiquitous purchase options for their customers, single-channel marketing is being rendered less and less viable. In order to build online buzz, brands are also using daily deal sites, such as Groupon, LivingSocial, and so-called ""flash sale"" sites such as HauteLook, Rue La La and Gilt Group, which are fueling e-commerce sales by creating awareness and enticing interest about new products or services by offering one-time discounts in order to create trial. The bricks-and-mortar front is far from lagging. Doskow notes that ""beauty has become the new revenue sweetheart in the traditionally slow-growing drug store channel as pharmacies reinvigorate their beauty offerings to lure customers with a more upscale, specialty-store look. For example, Walgreens' acquisition of Duane Reed and its high-end Look boutiques is expected to promote growth for both the chain and the channel. Meanwhile, CVS, Rite Aid, and others have begun offering new and improved customer loyalty programs and expanding shelf space for their beauty merchandise."""
"Beyond Beauty Paris, a transition year?","The 2011 edition of Beyond Beauty Paris, which was held from September 12 to 14, brought together 450 exhibitors. The organisers announced an increase of 14% of visitors to 22,230 over 3 days, including 37% international from 90 countries, mainly Germany, Italy, United Kingdom but also Iran, Liban, Russia, and a great noticable Asian presence from China, Japan and South Corea. Beyond Beauty Paris features three components: Cosmeeting, the event focusing on cosmetic brands, Creative, which gathers suppliers, and European Spa, renamed Spameeting, for the spa and salons sectors. This year again, the Zoom area and its 40 exhibiting young brands was an important focal point, despite a lower rate of innovation compared to previous years. The Beauty Challengers Awards have highlighted several of them: – ""Coup de coeur de la presse"", for Too Fruit, a brand aimed at the 6-12 years of age, – ""Beauty blog favourite"", for Less is More, a range of organic hair, – ""Innovation Awards"" granted by the Beauty Alliance, the first German selective distribution network, for three brands: Patyka, Sampar and Laboratoires Filorga, – ""Beauty Organic Award,"" for Alorée and its Chlorocosmétic® concept, – ""Beauty Pharma Award"" for the Fleurs de Bach, the brand well known for its elixirs, – ""Coup de coeur du jury"", again to the Fleurs de Bach, – ""Prix de la marque de niche"", for the brand of high en hygiene products, Le Bain Collection, – ""Prix de la marque émergente"", for Solyvia, an emerging brand of roll-ons against small daily troubles and based on the Corsican pharmacopoeia. Beyond Beauty Paris featured also two trend laboratories, several conference cycles and master classes, with more than 50 speakers. In particular, twelve conferences dedicated to the latest trends identified by the main style offices (Peclers, Carlin International, Nelly Rodi, Inspiration & Design,...) were fully booked. Within the Creative section, the BBLab, the area dedicated to analysing trends focused on Sustainable Development, Ethics and what's ""Behind the Green"". This year, Solabia highlighted its expertise in biotechnology, Greentech its natural and organic cosmetic oils, Natur'alps its comprehensive work on organic and coloured formulations of the future, Stearinerie Dubois the possibility to «go green» without plants. Minasolve and the Institute of Monoi were also present. However, several suppliers in the Creative area questioned the broad-scope positioning of the show, combining packaging manufacturers, ingredient suppliers, brands and suppliers of beauty salons or spas. What was once seen as an asset of the Paris event, which was aiming at gathering much of the beauty industry, now seems to undermine its coherence and ultimately limit the presentation of new products, reserved for more focused events. Some issues that the Informa group, the new owner of the event, will have to tackle."
MakeUp in New York: A grand cru ... as of its first edition!,"""All the necessary ingredients were there!"" say the organizers. ""A magical place with a breathtaking view on the Hudson River, perfect weather, the finest in America's and Europe's make-up industry from formulation, packaging to full-service specialists, a large number of participants with a high quality level, all of them coming and it was a surprise, from both New York and the West Coast of the United States."" ""An excellent show..."", ""the best we have attended in a long time..."", "" high quality decision makers..."", ""the very best in the make-up industry decided to meet here..."" comments were already flying as of the end of the first day of the event. With a total of 650 participants as of its first edition, Make Up in New York already appears to be the future meeting spot for American make-up professionals. During two days, dozens of managers of American brands coming from managing, marketing or purchasing teams have followed one another in the aisles of Studio 450. ""A true festival of highly competent professionals, with many of them coming from the West Coast and even several from South America"", agreed many exhibitors who had seldom seen during a professional event so many people of such high level. An event punctuated by a number of make-up animations particularly appreciated by visitors and which were set up by the teams of Eve Pearl, who is a 5-time Emmy Award winning celebrity Makeup Professional with over 18 years' experience in television, film, theatre and print. Make Up Designory who teaches the art of make-up and hairstyling for a career in the beauty, media, Entertainment and retail industries, was also working on the show, as the team of Make Up For Ever launched in the U.S. in 1995 with the opening of a NYC Studio and which has grown tremendously over the past 16 years. ""We also wish to thank the Studio Make Up team who have also helped us organizing the events"", added the organizers ""We also wish to thank the 'Look Good…Feel Better' program present at the cocktail with Louane Roark and who has for more than 20 years, changed the lives of people with cancer by reminding them that they are beautiful, Inside and out… 'Look Good… Feel Better' is the only fee, global public service that is changing the way people with cancer approach their disease, by teaching them that they can have some normalcy in a life that is by no means normal…"" To note also the presence of the association of the Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW) Inc.. which is a non-profit professional organization that advances the professional growth and leadership potential of its members in the cosmetic industry ""This first edition was rich in lessons explained, Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, members of the organising team, and we are already working on the second one. Especially since all exhibitors that we warmly thank again for their first participation, told us they were eager to attend next year's edition. A second edition, which will of course be full of novelties and surprises. More details to come in a few days."""
"Samples, the first purchase triggers for make-up products","The sample is just before the promotional box with free products, the most efficient element of the promotional mix, the one that encourages the most to buy a make-up product, according to a survey conducted by Invescomm, a market research and consulting firm, in partnership with the online site FemmesPlus. Beyond questions in connection with the purchase trigger and the conditions of choice of a new make-up product, the survey also addresses preferences and expectations in terms of sampling and, more generally, make-up habits. The survey was conducted on a panel of 1,071 women who answered an online questionnaire from the website FemmesPlus. The panel was adjusted using the socio-demographics of the French population as published by the Insee. It was complemented with a B to B supplement consisting of interviews of professionals operating in the marketing of colour cosmetics. When asked about the choice conditions of a new make-up product, consumers say they need to try it and use it for at least a day (54.4%) or quickly (29.5%), but they do not believe that simply enquiring on the product is enough (9.4%) just as seeing it on someone else (0.9%). No wonder then that samples are acclaimed before promotional boxes and even before testers in the ranking of purchase incentives for make-up products. Samples are particularly appreciated by women aged 25-44 and those whose annual income is over EUR 100 000. The survey also reveals that the older consumers are, the more they need to try a make-up product on themselves for a long period. This is also what claim 90% of consumers with very large incomes, who want to test them for at least a day. Concerning the dispatch mode of samples, Invescomm's survey focuses in particular on the internet channel. It appears, and this is no great surprise, that the younger the consumers, the more they are familiar with ordering samples via the Internet. But the survey also reveals that high-income consumers are more likely to order samples online. The survey also noted strong differences in terms of awareness, depending on whether consumers are interviewed about the websites where they had the opportunity to order make-up samples or on brands from which they have already received samples. Except that in both cases, Yves Rocher is ranked far ahead of its competitors. ""The results of this survey show that consumers want to test thoroughly a make-up product before buying it. This makes the sample an unavoidable tool since it has the most competitive unit cost of all testing tools available in the promotional mix of make-up brands"", explains Stanislas Feminier, Associate Director of Invescomm."
United States: the new horizons of the cosmetic market,"The Big Apple continues to play its role as a fashion and beauty trendsetter in North America. Despite the creativity of California, where many of the most innovative cosmetic brands have emerged in recent years, sustainable success and recognition can only be achieved with the recognition of the East coast. On this subject, Leila Rochet-Podvin, founder of the marketing intelligence firm, Cosmetics Inspiration&Creation, has no doubts. For her, ""the East Coast, and New York in particular, remains the sounding box and the amplifier of all the trends that have an influence on the American society"". Hence, twice a year, she undertakes a study tour in the shops of the metropolis, from Brooklyn to New Jersey, to unearth the most significant products, the most surprising brands, with the aim to understand what trends are at stake in the market, to explore behavioural changes and decrypt innovations. Last September 2, she offered a small overview on the results of her latest survey. After the shock of the 2008-2009 crisis, which stroke the U.S. much harder than it did Europe, the market recovered sharply in 2010 and growth remained strong all along the first half of 2011, with in particular a great comeback of colour, especially in nail polishes and lipsticks, and a stronger rise of the selective circuit compared to that of the mass. Nevertheless, crisis has left its marks, challenging points of reference and habits. ""During the crisis, the consumer became frugal, driven by a kind of de-consumption and prioritizing its purchases of products with higher perceived value, whether emotional or rational. At the same time, the emergence of web tools facilitated consumer access to information,"" explains Rochet-Podvin. Return to growth was therefore performed in a market environment very different from the one preceding the crisis. On the one hand, consumers have changed and, on the other hand, brands and distributors have reorganized themselves. On the side of distribution, the most noticeable fact is certainly the increasingly obvious blurring of the line between distribution channels. A chain like Ulta, which offers both prestige and mass market brands in an open serve concept, has emerged stronger from the crisis. Ulta currently has 400 outlets and is aiming the 1,000 mark in the short term. As for drugstores, if upselling was slowed down by crisis, the logical process of opening shops or specialized beauty spaces (Beauty 360 for CVS, or Look Beauty for Duane Reade) continues. Even Walmart, the world leader in mass distribution, is doing his best to attract beauty buyers by renovating its outlets (200 to 800 per year) and by proposing innovative exclusivities such as Hard Candy and GeoGirl. Department stores are not to be outdone. Macy's like Bloomingdales created new places dedicated to beauty by providing more open spaces for self service, and by inviting on an exclusive basis a number of niche brands. In its new developed site of 2,360 sqm dedicated to the beauty of its flagship store on 59th Street Bloomingdales offers some fifty niche brands, in partnership with the British chain Space NK. Concept stores that open in the trendy districts (City Chemist, Shen Beauty and skinnyskinny in Brooklyn) and, more generally, local neighbourhood boutiques that select specific products for their customers, also contribute to the rise of niche brands. The same for beauty corners that invite themselves increasingly in deco outlets, like ABC Carpet & Home. This rise of niche brands is probably under-evaluated by existing statistical tools, in particular because they do not take account of sales carried out in stores that do not belong to large chains. But it has not escaped professionals, a proof of that is, the very recent establishment, by the American Fragrance Foundation, of an Indie Committee, a committee dedicated to independent perfume brands. According to Rochet-Podvin two major underlying trends of the American society are transforming the beauty market. On the one hand the rise of multi-ethnicity and on the other hand, the evolution of the self-image among younger generations. ""Since women who are currently considered as belonging to ethnic minorities will constitute in the next thirty years the majority of the population, there is nothing surprising in the fact that this is already reflected by a change in the model of the American beauty type,"" she explains. In a nutshell, the ideal of the blue-eyed American blonde is out of fashion. Recently, a survey published in the magazine Allure revealed that for 64% of Americans, women of mixed race are the new beauty ideal. According to this same study, Angelina Joly stands out from actresses as the one who is acclaimed for her beauty. Ethnic diversity is increasingly valued and this is more and more observed in the ads. Today, a brand like Estée Lauder claims for its new Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator, a ""proven efficacy on all ethnicities"". ""As for the young generations, notes Rochet-Podvin, the evolution of their practices is so spectacular, that people say that they tend to get older younger."" This hyper-connected generation has become ultra sensitive to the importance of valuing one's self-image and more and more brands have a growing interested in them. In its latest report Inspiration from New York, Cosmetics Inspiration&Creation offers, based on its observations, a detailed analysis of seven themes in connection with the new world of femininity, of colours, of textures and ingredients, which were identified during the last twelve months. ""The main theme of this report is a new 'ELEVATION' in beauty and femininity, consumers demands and brands offer have increased, and combine with a 'RE-reinvention' of a consumer's aspirations who is looking for more innovation, provided it serve performance. This is what we synthesized in the word 'ReaLevation', i.e., demand for more ambition, more innovation and dreams, but also for more real and humane stuff. Colour, light, femininity, experience, blend of cultures and vitality are the keywords in this report,"" concluded Leila Rochet-Podvin."
"So different, so similar: colour cosmetics in Japan and China","No doubt, the world of beauty and cosmetics has today, its eyes focused on Asia. Despite the early hour, it was before a packed audience, on the occasion of the latest edition of MakeUp in Paris, that Florence Bernardin, Director of Information et Inspiration, a marketing intelligence firm specialized in the cosmetic sector and Asian markets, presented the latest trends in the Japanese and Chinese make-up markets. By way of introduction, Florence Bernardin provided a brief description of these two markets, which have some similarities (demanding consumers, an abundant supply of good and even very good quality) but also many differences. Among these, there is first a different historic relationship regarding make-up. Of course, in both countries, there is a heavy and long tradition. But, while in Japan the transition from ancient culture to modern use was made in continuity, the history of China is marked by the break due to the revolutionary period, with an interruption of intergenerational transmission. Make-up is truly part of the daily routine of Japanese women, it plays an important social role and it is even seen as an obligation. ""In Japan, women never go out without wearing make-up,"" explains Bernardin. While in China, women have rediscovered make-up only quite recently, as a result there is more distrust and fears concerning, firstly, the possible toxicity of products and on the other hand, concerning the image a woman would give of herself. Whether in terms of formulation or of result, the word ""natural"" appears to be an essential criterion in China. These differences are reflected in figures. In Japan, make-up represents 24% of the overall cosmetic market, against 10% in China. Another consequence is that the Japanese woman is particularly well informed and has a thorough knowledge of products. ""She is an expert at using cheap products with luxury products at the same time,"" emphasised Bernardin. The Japanese ideal of beauty is quite different from the Chinese ideal. The ideal shape of the face, of the eyes (almond-shaped in Japan, large and wide in China), of the nose and lips differ greatly from one country to the other. From all this, results of course, some very different preferences vis-à-vis the products. For Japanese women, complexion is a central concern and foundations are leaders in the make-up market (58%). In China, on the contrary, make-up products for lips are the top sellers (40%). In addition, it should be noted that 75% of young Japanese (15-30 years) use false eyelashes, to which they find a number of advantages (an ease of use, an immediate and stronger impact than that of a mascara, no risk for the product to run). This tidal wave is actually washing away the mascara market in Japan, a phenomenon not yet observed in China. After presenting the characteristics of the different segments for both countries, Florence Bernardin highlighted the case of BB Creams, the latest phenomenon in the Asian cosmetic market. What is it about? The BB Cream term is a contraction of Blemish Balm, Blemish Base or Beblesh Balm. In the beginning, this product was first used, after laser surgery, to cover, soothe and soften the skin. It is therefore a perfect example of multi-functional product. There too, Florence Bernardin noted some significant differences between the two markets. For Chinese women , it is a make-up product, used to cover skin imperfections, correct the skin tone, and provide a ""natural"" result. For Japanese women on the contrary, it is a multi-functional skincare product that enables to save time because it protects the skin against UVs and can be used either as a light foundation or as a make-up base. According to Kanebo Cosmetics, BB Creams ideally address the needs of thirty- and forty-something busy modern women. Under the Freshel brand, Kanebo offers a BB Cream line with five distinct roles: beauty lotion, emulsion, cream, sunscreen, and thin cosmetic base. Since the launch of the first item of the line in September 2009, the various versions of Freshel's BB Cream (Freshel Moist Lift W Cream, Freshel White C W Cream UV, Freshel Moist Lift BB Cream, Freshel White C Mineral BB Cream UV) have sold a total of 5,001,996 units.

MakeUp in New York: D day -16!,"""The scene is set and all the ingredients are there so that professionalism and friendliness are up to expectations,"" the organizers highlighted. As for exhibitors, Studio 450 is fully booked. ""And we were unfortunately not able to meet all requests."" As for exhibitors, precisely, there will be a well balanced number of companies specialised in formulation and in packaging. Exhibitors, where there will also be an even number of European and American companies. On the side of make-up animations there too, they will be full of pep with the presence of Eve Pearl, and the teams of Make Up for Ever and those of Make-Up Designory who will be working alternately during the two-day of this make-up celebration, not to forget also the support of Studio Make Up, the one of the members of the association Look Good, Feel Better and of those of the CEW. Finally, concerning the visitors, there too, the number of pre-registration has been increasing in recent weeks. ""We have, as of today, registered more than 650 visitors"", organizers explained, ""which heralds an excellent score for a first edition."" It must be said that all the players of MakeUp in NewYork were instrumental in this success. Starting with the exhibitors themselves, who have not ceased to show their enthusiasm for this first American edition. To the example of Brian J. Fox from Genealogy who recently stated that ""MakeUp in New York can provide this inspiration to U.S. companies and brands."" An opinion also shared by Nicole Masson at MAC: ""It is time for a fresher approach in beauty shows""."
Interest grows for the booming at-home skin care devices market,"Japanese women call them ""Moba Beau"", a contraction for ""mobile beauty devices"" a category that includes both electric-powered devices, such as mist-sprayers, and non-electric instruments such as roller type tools used to stimulate blood circulation. The category recently attracted a great deal of attention in Japan with major cosmetics and home appliances makers tapping into a fast growing market. Recently, Japanese cosmetics giant Shiseido collaborated with Panasonic for developing a special size of its Aqualabel Moisture Lotion to fit with the Ultrasonic Beauty Device Handy Mist produced by the electronic appliances maker. Earlier this year, Hong Kong-based company Jackel, specializing in promotional goods, packaging and full-service, created a new division entirely devoted to instrumental beauty, with the aim to supply the global beauty industry with electrical and mechanical appliances designed for the face, the eyes, the body, nails and hair. In a recently published report, Kline estimates the US market for at-home skin care devices at approximately USD 1 billion at the retail level for 2011 and expects exceptional growth for the next five years. [1] According to the market research firm, these products are finding a very receptive and growing audience of consumers wanting to save time and money by avoiding regular visits to salons or to the doctor's office. ""We knew this market was really taking off, but even we were shocked by its sheer size,"" said Karen Doskow, Industry Manager for Consumer Products at Kline. The direct sales channel, which includes home shopping networks, infomercials, and e-commerce, is the primary means of distribution in the U.S., with about 60% of the total market share, added Doskow. While sonic cleansing products are currently leading the way, with market leader Clarisonic, Kline's research points out a huge potential for anti-aging devices, that are expected to grow by a very healthy 50% this year alone. The research also mentions strong opportunities for manufacturers to develop mass-market options."
"MakeUp in Paris, A strong increase in visitorship","According to the organisers, the 2011 edition of MakeUp in Paris can be seen as the conversion of the promising try performed by its first edition in June 2010. With nearly 1,900 visitors, the increase from one year to the other exceeds 35%. As in previous year, brands (with over 61% of entries) were once again the most attracted by MakeUp in Paris, followed by retailers. ""The key principles driving the creation of this unique event in the B to B universe of the beauty sector have only increased, namely a strong presence of Marketing teams dispatched by the main decision makers, who accounted for one third of visitors, Marketing teams which were closely followed by Research and Development teams and then by those concerned by Processes and Production"", detailed Sandra Maguarian the Show Manager of MakeUp in Paris. The strong attendance of marketing teams (nearly 32% of visitors) seems really to be what makes MakeUp in Paris stand out. There are several explanations the organisers say: the location of the event at the heart of Paris, the quality of animations staging the products and the conviviality of the welcoming. Research and Development managers represent the second category of visitors, with almost 19% of the total. As for Purchasing departments, they account for about 8% of the total. Although MakeUp in Paris first gathered French visitors, the number of foreign visitors has also nonetheless increased, with +5% on 2010, representing 12.5% of the total. Germans and Italians rank first, followed immediately by UK and Americans visitors. Then comes Switzerland, followed by the Netherlands, Spain, Japan, South Korea, Lebanon and Poland. Organizers also noted the visit of Russians, Brazilians, Swedes, Moroccans, Tunisians, Romanians, Mexicans, Iranians, Indonesians, Hungarians, and even people from Saudi Arabia and Benin. The next edition of MakeUp in Paris will be held on June 21 and 22, 2012 at the Carrousel du Louvre."
Honesty in questions on the occasion of Benefit's latest mascara launch,"On the occasion of the launch of the new ""They're real"" mascara - a product that Benefit claims to have ""the ability to make lashes look so long as to not be one's own"" - the brand founded in California in 1976 by Jean and Jane Ford, commissioned a survey of U.S. and French women on the subject of lying and make-up habits. Benefit Cosmetics, which has made a name for itself by creating quality products with a sense of humour, wanted to obtain some basic information about the extent of lying among both U.S. and French women, subjects lied about, reasons it might be acceptable to lie, etc. The survey was also conceived as an excellent buzz maker, in line with Benefit's image as the ""friskiest luxury brand."" It was also an opportunity to learn more about make-up habits in the U.S.A. and France. From June 15 to June 19, 2011, consumers and markets research agency ICR conducted online interviews on nationally representative samples of 300 women in the US and 300 women in France, between 18 and 54 years of age. According to the survey, 62% of women in United States and 59% in France, lie at least once a week, and this is higher for 18-24 women: 74% in US, 70% in France. Younger women are also more likely to lie than older ones about makeup, spending and time getting ready, and French women are more likely than US women to lie about makeup and beauty issues. Is it a surprise? French women appear more tolerant than U.S. ones about the acceptability of lying. The survey also provides interesting information about the difference in mascara and make-up use on both sides of the Atlantic. Over half of both groups own two or more mascaras, but French women appear to own more items than their U.S. counterparts. Actually, 13% of French women do not know how many they own, maybe because they own too many of them to count! Eventually, when asked to mention ""the one essential makeup which a woman will not leave the house without applying"", French and U.S. women have quite divergent opinions on the matter. In the US, concealer/foundation and lipstick are top essentials while, in France, mascara wins, especially among the 18-24 years old. Almost 3 times as many young French women as young US women won't leave the house without it. Unless it is just another lie!"
Make-up: The dynamics of full service,"Full service is here to stay. Whatever may be the market's cyclical or structural difficulties, main key players participating in MakeUp in Paris agree that it is the symbol of a particularly heavy evolution of the trade, both for brands and subcontractors and that it is finding with make-up, a technical product par excellence, a favoured field of expression. Very complex to produce, many make-up products require, both for their formulation, and their packaging, a thorough industrial expertise that many companies, SMEs in particular, cannot afford or will not wish to acquire internally (when skincare and perfume are the core part of their business) and will therefore seek to supply from a third party. So far nothing surprising. However, full service, ""that offers everything"", is also attracting big decision-makers, and even very large ones... But, why do groups enjoying a global dimension, that have at hand most of the required expertise and also have considerable resources, appeal to this type of service? They do so sometimes to address specific needs, for instance in the case of a non-strategic one-shot launch, when they wishes to limit their own investment. They also rely on full service because it is fast, and therefore allows greater responsiveness for trendy products, and because it is also a very comfortable solution: ""we manage the planning and logistics and we smooth out programs over time,"" explained Marie-Christine Clerc, Sales and Marketing director of BCM Cosmétique. But there is no denying that there is a tendency toward the transfer of brand's activities to subcontractors. With, as a corollary, a transfer of risk when brands delegate to subcontractors uncertainties linked to packaging development. Which can have its pitfalls for players otherwise subject to strong price pressure, even if they must invest heavily to remain competitive in the race for innovation. So does it mean sub-contractors can be considered like service providers likely to be ruthlessly exploited? Not at all. Because it is a great opportunity for them. First of all, because by working with these major groups, full service players discover that overseas operations are a very valuable springboard for growth when the European market is still dull. But there is more to it. ""It's interesting, explains Nathalie Dessirier, Export and Marketing manager at Alkos Cosmétiques, because it gives us a broader view, allowing us to acquire increased experience."" And in this highly competitive market where innovation is permanent, ""the more we will increase our expertise, the more we will become unavoidable, claims Anne Challe, CEO of Fareva Color, because full service covers a wide range of interpretations."" ""At LF Beauty, we distinguish full service - which is more limited - from a turnkey service, which implies full support from the draft to the placing of products on the shelves thus bringing real value,"" revealed Francis Camilli, Senior VP. However, if full service represents a strategic development for many companies, it is not the only one. Because as mentioned above, it often involves seasonal collections, licensed products with a short life span, and thus very clearly raises the issue of the sustainability of the activity. Thus remains, as always, the critical importance of the relationship built with clients. ""We select our suppliers on their capacity for innovation, on their understanding of the brand as well as on the quality of our business relationship and, more and more, on their knowledge of regulatory issues, emphasised Stéphanie de Chaxel, Marketing director of Sothys. In the case of full service, they must almost act like if they were a real department of the company that would be outsourced and with the same quality level"". Good news: the regulatory challenge to which will be confronted companies is another opportunity offered for a win-win partnership."
"""The market is in need of services and skills,"" Alban Muller","Premium Beauty News - What are your expectations concerning the U.S. market? Alban Muller - The approach of this market is difficult, but we believe we can successfully introduce a new concept of eco-friendly cosmetics corresponding to societal expectations of consumers. Currently the U.S. market represents 15% of our turnover, but this proportion will grow as we expanded our offering of services. From a simple ingredient supplier, we have become partners for research projects and creators of natural formulas. Indeed, the ingredients offering has diversified, formulas are increasingly sophisticated and consumers are increasingly demanding and informed. The U.S. demand has changed significantly too. It became a market to buy skills. The reason is quite simple: the regulatory constraint is much stronger than before. U.S. cosmetics brands will have to comply with EU rules that are more stringent than theirs. Today, a U.S. exporter wishing to enter the European market must comply with a heavy and demanding body of regulations requiring. When the turnover expected in Europe is too small compared to the cost of acquisition of these skills, it makes sense to use a local supplier. Actually, we bet that many American brands will relocate part of their production to Europe. Premium Beauty News - How would you characterize the U.S. market? Alban Muller - The market is hungry for news and trends, always dynamic, with a high standard. Premium Beauty News - It is often said that North American customers are much less sensitive than Europeans regarding environmental issues? Alban Muller - I do not think that is true. American companies have often been accused of green-washing practices. However, we observe that the chemical industry has made considerable efforts and the cosmetics industry is progressing in this field. Furthermore, consumers get information more easily now. While in France, labelling is starting to display carbon footprint and environmental commitments, in the U.S., smartphone applications proposing to decipher product labels are increasingly popular. QR-type tags are increasingly used, allowing an easy and quick reading of products' main features. It is very convenient for consumers, but a bit less comfortable for manufacturers, as we know that 60% of consumers change their product when they read and understand the label. That's a major shift in the market that must be taken into account. Premium Beauty News - Broadly speaking, how do you see the major market trends in the cosmetic world? Alban Muller - I think the main change is concerning the growing search for external highly qualified expertise. Large companies are now fully aware of the advantages of outsourcing, when it is based on small and virtuous businesses. Network models such as the Cosmetic Valley can interface more easily public and private research. The explanation for this trend reflects both the crisis and the growing complexity of the technical and regulatory environment. Outsourcing also allows to tap into creativity and innovation and to reduce development time. The second major trend is the increased integration of environmental aspects into product design, particularly in terms of packaging. The industry is investing heavily to improve the life cycle of its products. Among the consequences of the tsunami that occurred last March in Japan is the acceleration of environmental awareness, especially among manufacturers. The mountain of waste that the waves washed away in the ocean is now concentrated in the Pacific. Each fish that dies by swallowing a plastic bag is a fish that man will not eat. We all understood the need to work on the biodegradability of our products and therefore of our waste. For 15 days, the Earth has 7 billion people, and it is a figure that is still expected to grow: the challenge of our species survival is clearly stated. Premium Beauty News - It is in these directions that you focus the development of Alban Muller International. Alban Muller - Yes of course: we are not only developing technical skills but also social skills. Our concern is to provide businesses with expertise in social responsibility, in full loyalty with the values of Alban Muller International, and by involving our clients. We want to ensure that we offer them concrete and tailored solutions, sustainable in the long term, to meet the many challenges they face. In this context of environmental issues, we provide relevant solutions in a timely manner, where all steps have been controlled. This calls for partnerships in the medium and long term, as well as contracts for specific developments, which are also a way for us to have secure resources to improve the quality of our services. It's a win-win situation because it helps us to optimize the cost of our research by focusing on the real needs of our partnering clients instead of working on risky and possibly inadequate ""marketing hypotheses"" that are cause time and energy wastes for all."
Men and fragrance: Top 10 of French consumers' favourite brands,"The survey, which was conducted online from 28 to 29 April 2011, on a representative sample of 1,000 male Internet users aged 18 or over (average age 39) relying on selective networks for their fragrance purchases, seeks to highlight consumer trends on a highly competitive market and the perception that consumers have of men's fragrances. While this study by Promise Inc. seeks primarily to decrypt consumer's perception of fragrance brands for men, it also highlights masculine consumption patterns. Thus, male buyers in selective distribution networks (e.g., Sephora, Marionnaud, Nocibé ...) purchase 64% of perfumes they use. These however do not forget woman. Since, 41% of fragrances bought in selective network are offered to women. Finally, if male buyers buy on average one fragrance every 9 months, they are offered on average a bottle every 16 months. According to the authors of the survey, the results, in particular the highest scores of image allocation per brand, help highlight three types of perfumers: luxury, virile and intermediate. ""It is also interesting to note that most of the ten fragrances for men the most kept in mind by consumer have been deep-rooted in this market for many years,"" they add. Apparently, a product must reach some maturity before it can emerge in the collective unconscious. Indeed, 80% of perfumes named by respondents in the rankings, were launched at least 15 years ago. ""Only Dior Homme and Allure by Chanel were created respectively 12 and 6 and years ago and benefited from the halo effect of these traditional luxury brands,"" says the survey. The image of the ten brands with the highest equity to the eyes and noses of respondents stretches between ""modern virility"" and ""expert luxury"" and, between these two poles, an intermediate positioning occupied by Jean-Paul Gaultier. – Luxury and prestige, the safe values of traditional perfume brands This first group gathers the fragrances created by High Fashion brands that expanded their luxury image to these products. ""Houses like Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel, traditional French luxury brands originally specialized in women's fashion, actually very quickly diversified themselves by launching collections intended for men and by also setting foot in the perfume and cosmetic sector."" Clearly perceived by respondents as ""major luxury brands"" (Chanel, respectively: 74%; Dior: 67%; YSL: 53%), they are also synonymous, in the subconscious of consumers, with very high quality and with a solid reputation in fragrances (Chanel: 69%; Dior: 63%; YSL: 40%). – Virility, a reflection of masculine identity for men's fragrance houses In this second group are the fragrances perceived as ""seduction weapons"", which are also the first beauty reflex that comes to men's minds. ""Some fragrances, more than others, characterized by manly notes, convey a virile and modern image and become attitude-fragrances,"" say the authors of the report. Thus, houses like Hugo Boss, Azzaro, and Diesel, who all started in men's ready-to-wear, are clearly identified by the French people interviewed, as so called ""virile"" brands (Hugo Boss, respectively: 52% ; Diesel: 51%; Azzaro: 38%). To respondents, they are also part of today's trends, they are modern and innovative. – Design and creativity, the intermediary positioning of Jean-Paul Gaultier Finally, considered totally new, in the context of this study, the respondents representation of the Jean-Paul Gaultier brand which stands out as a category of its own: that of an intermediate positioning. According to 64% of the French respondents of this study, the Jean-Paul Gaultier house offers bottles created by designers. 58% of them point out that Jean-Paul Gaultier has a keen sense of aesthetics and of design and 48% have characterized the fragrance brand of the ambassador of the white and navy blue jersey, for its creativity."
"Glass and make-up, in the field of intimacy!","The Espace Matières (Materials and textures area) at MakeUp in Paris, reminiscent of an art gallery, was a tribute to cosmetic material: stunning visuals of make up faces by Damien Dufresne, the Artistic Director, ""... like words on skin"" mingling harmoniously with amazing sculptures, ""... like countless moments of intimacy when the body meets with matter""... enhanced with glass bottles, in turn transparent, iridescent, delicately tinted or fully opaque. An area which was made possible thanks to the commitment of three companies G. Pivaudran, Solev and, ... SGD Parfumerie/Cosmétiques. An opportunity for Valérie Jacob, SGD's Marketing Director to recall for Premium Beauty News the importance that the skincare segment and more specifically, the make-up segment mean for her Group. Premium Beauty News - Surprisingly the glass industry seems to express itself much more in the fragrance segment than in the one of cosmetics and much less in the make-up segment. But figures show that cosmetic products account for more than 30% of sales in this packaging segment and that make-up, mainly through foundation products, is one of its dynamic vector. Valérie Jacob - Yes, you are right! The world of perfume is undoubtedly the one where our know-how in terms of glass making expresses itself the most flamboyantly. The world of cosmetics is more in connection with jars and bottles, which were often, up to now originating from our collection of standard items. But nowadays, codes for high-end skincare and make-up products are changing. There is currently a new trend highlighting the development, and a return in some cases to more sophisticated and creative glass containers. Premium Beauty News - What are the advantages of glass for skincare and make-up products? Valérie Jacob - There are numerous! First of all, glass is a neutral material, which therefore has no compatibility problem with formulas, and which in addition has a barrier effect protecting even the most sensitive of them. The weight, the brightness of glass, its multiple decorative options make it inevitably a ""premium"" image vector for skincare and make-up products. And of course, let's not forget a major ecological advantage: glass is 100% recyclable! Significant strong points to which SGD is giving value to. Taking advantage of our expertise in the pharmaceutical industry, we are reflecting on innovations for ""intelligent packagings"" in order to bring real functional benefits, to the foundation segment, for example. Remember that 60% of references are packed in glass. Moreover, the ""Fusion Beauty"" trend which gave rise to make-up products enriched with active ingredients or to formulas that change colour or texture when applied on the skin, enhances the use of glass containers. It seems worthwhile to reflect on the development of appropriate bottles! Premium Beauty News - A market watch and innovation approach that is always at the heart of SGD's strategy? Valérie Jacob - Absolutely! This is an integral part of the strategic marketing unit whose daily work is to deepen its knowledge of markets, to provide insight and enable the Group to project itself into the future. All this, of course, within the overall framework which characterizes SGD as we operate commercially and industrially in all parts of the world, Asia, North America and South America, and, of course, Europe. We are strongly market- and consumer-oriented, to provide optimal solutions to our clients. Premium Beauty News - Finally, does your desire to take part to the MakeUp In Paris show, an unusual move for a glassmaker, come from your observation that the assets of glass are still too little known in the world of make-up? Valérie Jacob - Yes for sure! Especially since the advantages of glass are not limited the material itself, but also extend to the decoration techniques that make it possible to obtain very peculiar touches, and unique colours and finishes. With our expertise and the beauty of the material itself, we offer brands opportunities to unleash their imagination to create bottles and jars representing a true visual and sensory experience for consumers, while highlighting colours, light, textures. At SGD, we give clients the freedom to enjoy a new vision of glass, to animate the worlds of make-up and skincare."
"HBA, trying to find its way in a recovering market","According to the testimonials of those who have been attending the show for many years, the HBA is presently unrecognisable compared to what it was ten years or even five years ago. All sectors were impacted by the loss of key exhibitors. This was particularly striking on the side of ingredient suppliers, who were still numerous a few years ago. ""A large number of exhibitors now focus on the Suppliers' Day organized by the NYSCC [1], which takes place in New Jersey"", pointed out Nicolas Meyrial, National Account Executive Personal Care, at Naturex specialised in plant-derived substances. Nonetheless, the participation, among others, of Catalent, Clariant, and Rossow USA was noticeable. The conclusion is the same for packaging, with a massive presence of Asian suppliers, but with yet, a smaller number of big players such as Arrowpak, Alpha Packaging, Coswel Korea, Elcos, Fusion Packaging, Lablabo, Mega Pumps, Topline Products or Yonwoo. As for formulators and full service players, the presence of important European companies was noticeable, especially in the make-up segment, such as b-kolor makeup & skincare and Technocosmesi, along with such American companies as Columbia Cosmetics, Lady Burd, and Wormser Corporation, or the Korean Hwa Sung. As for the organizers, while visitors figures are not yet available, they insist on the efforts that were made this year to concentrate invitations on the most qualified buyers. ""We did hear from several exhibitors that they met with high quality attendees from Avon, Coty, Revlon, Estee Lauder, L'Oreal, Lancome, Maybelline, MAC, Unilever, Tarte, Sephora, and more top brands that were in attendance along with several top independent brands,"" said Jill Birkett, Brand Director for HBA Global. ""Through comments on-site and through tweets and other real-time applications we did hear that attendees were pleased with the increase in European exhibitors, that there were exciting innovations on the exhibit floor,"" she added One thing that does not change on the HBA is its rich program of conferences, who for most of them required an entrance fee. These training are undoubtedly extremely popular, to such a point that some visitors only allow themselves a short detour to the exhibition area. Among the speakers, many of them are also former exhibitors who now limit their participation to one or two presentations before an audience they generally judge very interesting. ""Trying to accommodate the needs of the brand and product managers seeking education with a balance of time on the exhibit hall is always a challenge. This year, we added more education to Thursday so that we could have a longer break mid-day Tuesday and Wednesday to allow conference attendees the chance to spend more time on the exhibit floor,"" explained Jill Birkett. With a dozen rooms dedicated for this purpose and more than 70 conferences giving voice to a panel of three or four experts, i.e. over 200 stakeholders, the program addresses many topical issues in the areas of marketing, international trade and sustainable development. To note this year, a morning dedicated to French cosmetics which was orchestrated by the Cosmetic Valley and its president, Alban Muller, during which were exposed the operating mode and the activities of this cluster so unique in the world that groups together nearly 500 companies, universities and labs. The aim being to show how the ""Made in France"" integrated environmental concerns and the use of natural substances. If economic recovery is obvious after the downturn, many companies and consultants believe on the other hand that the U.S. market is still very much focused in trying to find the best price. Even in the high-end sector, customers are on the lookout for promotional operations and for the gifts that come along with them. While it was felt that, the ecological trend was on the rise on the U.S. market, sustainable offer was however not as prominent on the stands of exhibitors, as what could be observed in European or even Asian trade shows. Does this mean that American consumers and companies show a lack of interest for these issues? The opinions we collected differ widely. The ones note that the issue on parabens, for example, is here much less sensitive than in Europe. Others highlight that some companies such as Proter & Gamble have a real advantage regarding the use of plant based plastic packaging. Anyway, the market is structuring and developing itself. For some years now, for example, Whole Foods Market, the specialist in organic food, offers large areas dedicated to personal care products, under the brand name ""Whole Body"". Sephora in turn created a label called ""Naturally Sephora"" to identify the products that were meeting its corporate specifications. But mostly, certification is starting to grow withthe development of official U.S. standards under the guidance of the ANSI. [2] ""We have certified a hundred of products since February"", explained Jacklyn Bowen, General Manager of Quality Assurance International (QAI). Market figures are also not bad at all. Lagging behind for some time because of the recession and after stagnating in 2009, the U.S. market for natural cosmetics has strongly taken off in 2010 and has just passed the USD 5 billion mark, according to Organic Monitor, in particular through the impetus given by private labels which were launched by mass market operators."
MakeUp in Paris: the dynamics of success,"All the necessary ingredients were present! Exhibitors were satisfied, visitors, were enthusiastic, a place who lived up to the event and... to the visitors, quite an affluence indeed! Quite surprising too, to see so many visitors until the last remaining hours of the show on Friday afternoon. Words like ""they were really two very professional days but in a festive atmosphere,"" could be heard here and there. The make-up animations of course had something to do with this success. The presence of renowned make-up schools, and the one of a number of make up artists among the most brilliant of their generation, and especially their almost uninterrupted performance during two days challenged the imagination and whetted the appetite of everyone. As a proof of this, the numerous marketing teams from the biggest cosmetic brands that were walking up and down the aisles of the show ended up by gathering around the make-up animation clusters judiciously placed in the show area. As for the very professional atmosphere, it could be noticed immediately upon entering the show. ""This was largely due to the set-up of the booths themselves, which were almost all alike (all the product and nothing but the product!),"" the organisers of MakeUp in Paris insisted. With some of them looking like real small private-looking showrooms dressed in white and the other ones looking more like open spaces, where visitors in search of ideas could appreciate at a glance the offer of each exhibitor. Keeping the ""showroom"" appearance was an essential aspect in the strategy of companies specialized in formulations whose ultra confidential presentations mostly concerned the future. Another strong point this year was the quality of conferences and round tables. An occasion to further broaden one's knowledge around the theme of colours and trends, but also bove all to have available the main actors of this sector. Of course, an essential and final ingredient was present like the previous year: ""conviviality"". Obviously members of the big make-up ""family"" who, in other places and circumstances, would remain fierce competitors were happy in such a special occasion to meet one another. As for the Carrousel du Louvre, it can only be summed up in a single word: magnificent! what more could be dreamt of? At the very heart of Paris, this mythical place represents in itself what is actually the best the world around, in terms of Prestige, of Culture and of History and where MakeUp in Paris could only but write its own. An amazing place in which one willingly delves into (and it is rare enough!) with joy and where MakeUp in Paris will have sparkled with a thousand colourful points for two days in a row. MakeUp in Paris is only in its second edition, yet perceptions of sustainability and maturity, are undoubtedly already noticeable. Its younger counterpart, will see the light September next in New York. The organisers announced that most of the ingredients mentioned above will also be present across the Atlantic. Good luck!"
bareMinerals: success through recommendation,"Early in 2010, when Shiseido announced its intention to acquire Bare Escentuals, the 1.7 billion dollars offered by the Japanese giant, provided a picture of the exceptional success encountered by this company founded some thirty years ago in San Francisco. The valorisation of Bare Escentuals, which markets mainly the make-up brand bareMinerals, is indeed just as important as that of YSL Beauty when it was acquired by L'Oréal for 1.15 billion euros in 2008. The aim for Shiseido being to reinforce its positions in North America and Europe, on a young and dynamic market segment. In addition to North America, bareMinerals products are marketed in Europe (UK, Northern Europe, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland), and Japan. ""A jar of bareMinerals foundation is sold every 4 seconds in the world"", the company states. Initially best known for its foundation products, bareMinerals has now established itself as a global make-up brand: eye shadows, blushers, lipsticks, eyeliners and mascaras. Interestingly, it is the only brand of mineral make-up coming from across the Atlantic to have successfully managed a breakthrough in Europe, beyond the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. The reasons for this success? ""Quality products and our strategy to educate consumers"", explained Sophie Ifrah, Marketing Manager forBare Escentuals in France. Sold in France exclusively in Sephora outlets since 2006, it's mostly because it took the time to explain how to use the products that the brand managed to convince French customers who were at first reluctant to try the foundations. ""We never hesitate to go over the basics of make-up. And it's very well perceived. Women are always very much seeking for tips and advice. French women had a preconceived idea of foundation. For example, many women buy products which are way too dark for their complexion, hoping to achieve a healthy look. Actually, the foundation must be applied first, before the 'healthy glow' product"". For this purpose, the brand has a team of trainers as well as a team of make-up artists at the Sephora outlet on the Champs Elysées. For 35 years, the Californian company has refused to hire a spokesmodel or to select predefined beauty standards. Bare Escentuals puts simplicity at the heart of its bareMinerals brand: advice suiting each woman and her skin type. The goal is both simple and ambitious: develop close ties and complicity with consumers. ""Our customers must become the brand's ambassadors because our products convinced and satisfied them. Recommendation is the driving force of our success"", insists Ifrah. No wonder then the brand is so active on social networks, where it is considered a pioneer. New media are perfectly in tune with the ""marketing recommendation"" implemented by the brand. ""Facebook is the recommendation vector par excellence, it's a great sounding board, a completely new relay to the shopping experience"", emphasises Helene Couderc, Community Manager at Bare Escentuals France. ""But this is obviously a tool you need to know how to use which is not always that easy to achieve, so sometimes appropriate external expertise is required."" But regarding make-up, the media, whose influence is growing fastest is of course YouTube. Videos where young women give their peers, short make-up courses, testing at the same time their latest purchase can reach very significant levels of audience. ""YouTube is definitely an increasingly important prescription channel for make-up"", explains Couderc. ""The proximity effect comes fully into play."" Social networks are part of the brand's priority investments. ""This is not without risk but is consistent with our brand's marketing logic. On Facebook, the cost per click remains particularly attractive. Especially the very specific criteria selection possibilities in terms of hobbies, tastes, enable to select targets very accurately."" Another advantage of new media is an interesting rejuvenating effect, at a time when 'digital mums' replace 'housewives under 50' at the heart of advertisers' concerns. ""On our Facebook fan page, the most common age ranges from 25 to 34,"" notes Ifrah. An average age somewhat lower than that of customers in outlets. Beauty bloggers can obviously not be sidelined from this local strategy. ""We are in regular contact with several bloggers, and with most of those in the top 20-top 40 of Wikio"", Couderc indicates. And the brand is quite complimentary to them. ""They are young, responsive and very reactive, but also professional, they respect the embargoes and, in addition, some are followed by the beauty press."" Besides the prescriptive influence of these bloggers, seems confirmed by the few available studies. According to Hélène Couderc, ""we must act with tact, know how to be close while remaining professional and respectful."" Generally speaking, brands must be careful not to be too intrusive. The readers' confidence toward bloggers relies heavily on a close relationship, a common language and universe. Sponsored posts can be misunderstood, even if offerings to test some products are generally better welcomed. At bareMinerals in any case, bloggers, like fans of the Facebook page, and loyal customers and newcomers of Sephora stores are all pampered by a brand that regularly offers the opportunity for customized make-up sessions in Paris and in the provinces, simply through Facebook. During these sessions, they are first asked to familiarize themselves with the foundations and their method of application. They will then be in a position to advise their friends! That is the way the virtuous circle of marketing recommendation works, according to Bare Escentuals."
MakeUp in Paris: Focus on colour,"Premium Beauty News - Your participation to the first MakeUp in Paris in June 2010 made of you a precursor. The magnificent pictures of your work are still in everyone's minds. What will be the highlights of your presence, this year at the Carrousel du Louvre? Damien Dufresne - I indeed participated to the very first MakeUp in Paris and I am very grateful for the renewed confidence you are placing in me this year. I doubt the images of my ""exhibition"" are still engraved in everyone's mind, but in any case they are still in mine. It was a new experience for me, to make up and then take pictures of my own make-ups. Premium Beauty News - A 2011 event that will be punctuated by the ""Espace Matières"", tell us more about it? Damien Dufresne - Sandra Maguarian this year, entrusted me with the artistic direction of the ""Espace Matières"" within MakeUp in Paris. So I chose the subjects of pictures, the models, the main theme, prior to the shooting. Unlike last year, I didn't take the pictures, I decided to only take care of the creation of make-ups and of the art direction of pictures. I asked Alexander Pattein, a young photographer, to join me on this great adventure. We were also joined by the Imaginers Agency represented by Galaxie Vujanic, Niko Neki and Greg Jouslin to do the scenography of the exhibition. Together we tried to establish the connection between raw materials and images. I must take this opportunity to thank SGD, Pivaudran and Solev for their help in providing us with the raw materials. Premium Beauty News - Make-up has become a key strategic element for the development of a beauty brand. Probably more important than some years ago. What were the reasons, do you believe, for this trend to grow? Damien Dufresne - Because it is difficult to create an identity for skincare lines, while make-up lines allow brands to stand out. This identity, comprises the choice of textures, of colours, of packaging but also and especially the image conveyed by the media. To achieve a beauty image is not something obvious, the light must be ideal, the connection with the model ""intimate"" and the photo ""accident"" factor is much less obvious than with fashion shoots. The choice of the model is also very important, her complicity with the photographer, the glances, what the eyes have to say, what they don't say, what they are hiding. Emotion, is what makes the difference between two pictures. Major brands have understood this perfectly, they use images of high profile personalities to challenge the reader. Most of the time they are actresses, because they are the representation of roles they have played. It bothers me of course, because it's like moving make-up to the background. Premium Beauty News - Given your experience in this field, what do you believe was the main progress achieved in formulation and packaging in recent years? And how much still remains to be accomplished? Damien Dufresne - I have no experience whatsoever in terms of formulation, formulation is the matter of chemists, of laboratories. But my experience allows me, of course, to distinguish a good texture from a poor texture, but it enables me mostly to know how to combine textures and colours. Because a texture does not allow all colours. Of course, I regret the lack of collaboration between make-up artists and laboratories. I am convinced that labs as much as brands would benefit from having their range of shades developed by make-up artists. When visiting trade-shows, I often test samples and notice how much an inappropriate colour can reduce the attractiveness of a texture itself. Make-up artists are not chemists but chemists have never make-up anyone. As for packaging I'm not an expert either, but I regret of course standardization. Brands do know that packaging is the first asset to help them stand out. And that some customers are just as sensitive to the content as they are to the container. Without necessarily focusing on packaging as a ""luxury item"" no to say a ""collector's item"", why not try and elaborate better quality refillable packagings, instead of putting on the market quality textures in ordinary packagings? I believe the success of a brand in the long term, always implies a quality texture, a packaging worthy of the name and most of all a respect of the client. And I am convinced a satisfied customer returns by herself in an outlet and that for that, she doesn't need to rely on ads. And long-term is necessarily synonymous with loyalty."
"Brigitte Reiss-Andersen, New York: ""To make-up yourself, is to tell a story""","Working as a ""booker"" for a modelling agency in Stockholm, learning the basics of make-up very early, Brigitte Reiss-Andersen draws the attention of several fashion photographers. We are in 1980. Two years later, by chance, she meets José Luis, the legendary make-up artist and creator of Yves Saint Laurent's range of make-up. It's all about making up his twenty models who are on a fashion parade on the same day in Stockholm, and he needs an assistant. She answers his call. And they get on well! So well that he very quickly gives her the choice: to accompany him in Paris, or not. And before he knew it, the answer was yes and it was a deal! A luggage each, their plane tickets in the other hand, and they're on their way! This will last for two years. ""A very fulfilling and rich period,"" she admits, ""where I'll be collaborating with José Luis for prestigious fashion magazines as well as on big fashion shows (Montana, Alaia, YSL)"". Eventually, at the beginning of 1985 when Brigitte Reiss-Andersen decides to fend for herself and she hires her first agent. The saga continues and she is contacted by ELLE, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and creates the looks for the ads of Yves St Laurent, Biotherm, L'Oréal. In 1987, the question arises. Why not go to New York? ""It's quite funny, when you think about it, since it's my hairstylist, Frédéric Fekkai who gave me the idea when he told me he was going to establish himself on the other side of the Atlantic. It puzzled me at first, but very quickly, desire took over. Why not?"" There too, Brigitte Reiss-Andersen takes the decision in no time. ""When I arrived in New York, she says, the atmosphere was quite different from that of Paris. Here it is not only a poorly paid vocation, it is a profession of its own just needing to be developed."" Brigitte Reiss-Andersen reinforces her professionalism and... gets married! Her talent is not left unnoticed. She works with great photographers (Demarchelier, Penn, Leibovitz, Elgort), fashion designers (Kamali, de la Renta, Ralph Lauren) and spends her time between studios in Paris and New York. Then her long time friend, Frédéric Fekkai who is launching, with the Chanel Group, a range of products bearing his name, asks her to create a line of make-up. She quickly grows a true passion for this other world in the universe of colour cosmetics: branding, marketing, launches and public relations. She then works with Procter & Gamble, Walgreens and Sephora. Today she has the rare privilege of keeping her position at a top fashion make-up Artist (she can boast for more than two hundred cover magazines) and to be requested to work for the biggest names in showbiz. Among the twenty Oscars-winning movie stars she was requested to work for, there are Halle Berry, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Juliette Binoche as well as Catherine Deneuve, Mariah Carey and Michelle Pfeiffer. ""To me, she says, make-up has always been, at the start, something very spontaneous. When you make up someone for a magazine, it's instantaneous work. Therefore, my vision is quite natural and logical: make-up is a tool that allows a women to show the different facets of her beauty. She can change it. She can modify it depending of her desires, goals, and the identity she wants to take. At the same time, life changes every day. Obviously, to some extent, the use of the tools we have at our disposal every day has become ""simpler"". The make-up application must also be simple and quickly reach the desired objective. It must remain practical!"" ""What has also changed in the picture is that the great Beauty Houses are no longer the only ones to pave the way. Many others stakeholders have emerged to successfully influence the public: Celebrities ""parading"" on red carpets, fashion shows and blogs, for example. They are quick and efficient and are well suited to demand. This too has changed! I would say finally that a woman should not make up only according to the physical features of her face, but she should mostly make up for the story she wants to tell in her make-up and, somehow, for the message she wants to convey."" Does she see herself classic and discreet for her business lunch, or more casual during her vacations or with the looks of a femme fatale for her evening date? Her make-up will match her very desires and the ""role"" she has chosen."
"MAC, surprise them, keep on surprising them!","A marketing strategy that roots the brand deeply in the unconscious of consumers and which obviously can only but boost the suppliers sector whether derived from packaging or formulation. All the more because the U.S. firm does not hesitate to fully exploit the trump card of innovation. Explanations by Nicole Masson, Vice President Global Product Development. Premium Beauty News - With more than 1700 outlets spread in every corner of the world, MAC is indeed a big machine. Which does not keep you, on the contrary, from having a performing presence on the field. Nicole Masson - You are right! Our dynamism expresses, itself of course, through our will to constantly adapt to the market, to the consumers needs, be they visible or implied. It's also our job to identify them, to understand them and to provide the best possible response to women's needs. Our approach is global and not just hinged to a specific country, although it's clear that our interests in terms of brand development evolve according to global trends. Currently, our strategic priorities are called Brazil, Japan, Korea and, of course, China! Anyway, development in its broadest sense, is a constant concern at MAC. Most formulas are developed by our own laboratories. Of course, we have suppliers that work with us. As for packaging, we rely on the main players in the marketplace with a strong focus, from our part, on innovation. Premium Beauty News - The face, the eyes, the lips, the skin. You scope of activity is quite comprehensive! Nicole Masson - We are indeed present in all the segment of colour cosmetics, which does not necessarily mean that our development strategy is uniform. It is clear, for example, that depending of times, consumers will prefer to highlight their eyes rather than their lips and conversely. Today, lipstick has gained considerable importance. As you know, it's our flagship product and we have observed, for example, the enormous impact created by the launch of the Lady Gaga lipstick whose ""sharp"" pink shade almost started a new global trend. But we also focus a lot on the face, especially recently, with the help of Mickey Contractor, a renowned make-up Artist who has become very popular thanks to his talents and the textures he uses to impart the face of Bollywood actresses with that so distinctive matte and soft touch. In fact, there too, we created a whole collection of products associated to his talents. Premium Beauty News - This kind of ""marketing coup"" has truly become one of MAC's hallmarks! Nicole Masson - Yes, indeed! But it's in the logic of things. Women are fond of new colours, new textures, new effects, new gestures. Moreover, we nearly have a hundred make-up artists working with us to that effect in the world. At the same time and somehow paradoxically, they want products that last longer. Premium Beauty News - This trend for long-wear products, seems to have become a sustainable trend! Nicole Masson - Yes undoubtedly! And this explains the work we have begun, with this in mind, on our foundations, our lipsticks and our concealers. And it's not always easy to combine long-wear and quality textures. In this context, the role of packaging is obviously fundamental. We will also be launching by the end of the year a whole series of innovations in this field."
Towards fairer cosmetics,"It is not enough to be organic or natural. One's should be perfect! Or, at least, try to be. For example, by eliminating from formulas any suspect (according to the media) ingredient, ensuring that absolutely no animal has been used in the different development stages of the product and, increasingly, in building ethical supply-chains. Opening of the Fair Trade Fortnight in France [1], insiders of the perfumes and cosmetics industry operating in the fair trade business met in Marseille on the 13th of May 2011 to share their experiences. The event was supported by Technico Flor, a fragrance supplier well known for its natural ranges and eco-labels, and, more recently, for its Natfair line, which features natural fragrances and fair trade sourced ingredients. Hosted by the UNIDO (the United Nations for Industrial Development) and Chakib Jenane, the organisation's Director of Agro-Industries, around Valérie Roubaud (Terre d'Oc), Patrick Collin (Golgemma), François-Patrick Sabater (Technico Flor) and Jerome Vaquier (Ecocert), participants have expressed their interest but also their need for explanations. Actually, what exactly is a trade fair cosmetic? It is primarily a product with an ethical approach of trade, including the establishment of a partnership between the mark and some of its suppliers, usually small producers within developing countries. Fair trade is very consistent with the formulation of natural or organic cosmetics, because it fits perfectly in with sustainable development goals. Today certification is growing fast in this area as well. Max Havelaar, has started to certify cosmetic products, the association Bio Partner certifies - with the labels Bio Équitable and Bio Solidaire - various raw materials such as argan or vanilla, and in 2008 Ecocert created the ESR (équitable, solidaire, responsable) organic and fair trade label. This meeting was an opportunity to share everybody's field experiences. Valérie Roubaud, CEO of Terre d'Oc, described its involvement in Vietnam with concrete and strong social actions, such as health care coverage for all workers. Patrick Collin, Director General of Golgemma, a producer and marketer of essential oils, has presented its personal experience in the economic assistance of small Malagasy producers, thus also allowing them to develop quality products. In the opinion of all participants, fair trade carries strong values that company employees naturally seize. Speakers also noted that this a long-term investment that often requires a mobilization that is more human than financial."
"""The situation in China is still a source of concern"", Alain Grangé Cabane, FÉBÉA","Premium Beauty News - How important is the cosmetic industry in the French economy? Alain Grangé Cabane - In 2010, the cosmetics and perfume industry remains, with its trade surplus, France's third exporting sector in net balance [1] ( military weapons excluded) behind aircraft and spacecraft manufacturing and beverages. These excellent results are, among others, due to the attractiveness of French products, recognized for their safety and quality, and for their innovative nature. Premium Beauty News - Did the block put on the registration of files in China have major economic consequences for French companies? Alain Grangé Cabane - Undoubtedly, consequences for companies exporting to China are important. The blockage, which began on 1 April 2010, will weigh on sales in 2011 and even in 2012, since exports to China have not yet fully recovered. Premium Beauty News - While the situation seems to be slowly improving, are there still some regulatory grey areas remaining for companies exporting to China? Alain Grangé Cabane - Indeed, the situation is still a source of concern. Renewals of authorization for already marketed products, with a nearing expiring time limit (four year validity), are resuming at a regular pace. It is the same for so-called ""non specific"" products (shower gel, shampoo...) as opposed to products with a ""specific"" purpose (sun care, deodorant, slimming...) according to Chinese regulations. For new products and for some of the so-called ""specific"" products (e.g. products for babies or pregnant women), the situation remains critical, since the notion of ""new ingredient"" is not clarified to date, with the result that product registration applications are always refused. Premium Beauty News - What are the most promising export markets for French products? What are the French companies most favoured areas? Alain Grangé Cabane - Europe remains the main export zone since in 2010 it accounted for 64% of French sales: 53% of our exports go to EU member countries (with a growth of +3.8%), and 11% in Europe to non EU member countries. The best performance for 2010 concerned the Latin American region, since an increase of 24.5% in exports was recorded. The strong growth of Brazil (+40%) was a pleasant surprise too, as well as the one of other Latin American countries overall (Uruguay, Mexico, Argentina). Regarding the top 10 ""customer"" countries of ""Made in France"" cosmetics and perfumes, they are by order: Germany (a customary leader), the UK, Spain, USA, Italy, Russia, Belgium, Singapore, Switzerland and the UAE. To note however that in the case of Singapore, products are mainly transiting before they reach their final country of destination in Asia. In conclusion, an overall recovery is clearly noticeable compared to 2009. Premium Beauty News - What markets are the most difficult to access? Alain Grangé Cabane - We've already mentioned the case of China, of course... Otherwise, we can name Japan, for quasi-drugs, the USA and Canada for OTC/therapeutic products. Finally, we are closely following the case of Israel, as the authorities have embarked on the drafting of a new regulation, which turns out being for the time being, a clumsy interpretation of the European Regulation. The project, originally scheduled for June 2011, could not be applied by companies, as it stands. The FÉBÉA and the CTPA (Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association which was approved by the FÉBÉA) immediately alerted Israeli authorities. The implementation has therefore been postponed to a later date and discussions with European authorities are underway to shed light on the differences between the European Regulation and the Israeli project. Premium Beauty News - It's been nearly a year since you were granted the ISO 9001 certification for the management of the issuing of CFS (Certificates of Free Sale). Have you already reaped some benefits from these lengthy procedures? Alain Grangé Cabane - Absolutely. After a year of work, we obtained this certification allowing us to guarantee the issuance quality of FÉBÉA-CFS to exporters, bearing in mind that CFS are mandatory to export to 59 countries. But most interesting was the reaction of authorities of countries requesting the CFS. They greatly appreciated this initiative and congratulated the FÉBÉA for the pledge of seriousness it represented."
"""Towards a busy second semester,"" Daniel Saclier, Guerlain","Premium Beauty News - After last year's euphoria, it seems that there are signs of a slump in demand. What is your insight on this? Daniel Saclier - First, we must clarify what you mean by a ""slump"" in demand... I would like to emphasise on the fact that the trend in the perfume / cosmetic business in France remains dynamic versus 2010: growth figures have always been between 2 and 4%. During the first half of 2011 the stock replenishment operations were terminated for our basic packaging products. We achieved a good level of sales during this period. Our turnover is also on a good trend, with new launches (Shalimar Initial, Rouge Automatique) and the support of key franchises such as Terracotta, Idylle ... The second semester will also be active, but essentially focused on the launch of new products, thus contributing to supporting our growth. Premium Beauty News - What were the highlights in recent months in terms of product launches? Daniel Saclier - The first half of 2011 generated quite a lot of activity for Guerlain teams and this whatever the marketing axis concerned. Regarding skin care products, let's mention: the launch of new day creams in the new Abeille Royale line, in the wake of the successful launch of the serum, the launch of eye care creams for our Orchidée Impériale premium line, and eventually the new generation of products in the 2011 Whitening Collection for the Asian markets. Regarding perfumes: a major initiative in our historic franchise, with the launch of Shalimar Initial. Our in-house perfume creator, Thierry Wasser has revisited this iconic perfume to target a younger population. Eventually, as far as make-up is concerned: the re-launch of Terracotta, Lingerie De Peau (our expertise in foundation), and currently, a major new initiative, the launch of Guerlain's new lipstick, Le Rouge Automatique. Premium Beauty News - How are you dealing with sustainable development issues? Daniel Saclier - At Guerlain, we are fully aware of our responsibilities in order to address these environmental challenges. This is the reason why a real sustainable development strategy has been implemented and integrated into the brand's global vision since several years now. In this context, one of our goals is to constantly anticipate regulations to adapt our tools and processes. Thus, the environmental impact of our packaging is an issue we are working on, eco-design being a key point of our approach. Our Marketing, Purchasing and Development teams have been fully trained on this issue and we systematically measure the environmental impact of our new products. Finally, we have set up guidelines on a number of parameters (equipments, separability, volumes) and we will continue to actively work on these items in the future. We do not wish to communicate widely on these topics because we believe that the implementation of such an approach is part of our duty as a responsible company. However, we will inform our customers about our operations in the course our product launches. Premium Beauty News - The make-up segment and its products clearly appears to be driving the cosmetic market. For Guerlain, how much do they account for and how is the future of these products perceived? Daniel Saclier - Yes, undoubtedly the make-up sector and its products is a major axis for Guerlain as part of its policy to attract new customers. Such flagship products as Terracotta, Météorites, Rouge G, Lingerie De Peau, the collections of eye shadows 4&6, enable us to anchor in the long term our brand image whatever the geographical area concerned."
Japan: what is the impact of disasters on the cosmetics industry?,"Solidarity with the people affected by the disaster was the first response from the cosmetics industry after the giant earthquake and tsunami that struck the northern part of Honshu island on March 11. Of course, Japanese groups strongly responded. Kao opted for product donations and announced it will dispatch to affected areas thousands of soaps, detergents, toothpaste and toothbrushes, as well as sanitary napkins, and diapers, etc. For its part, Shiseido, the leading Japanese cosmetics company, has announced a donation of 100 million yen (about 830,000 euros) and the shipment of shampoos dry, soaps and hand sanitizers. The L'Oréal group also announced a donation of 100 million yens to the Japanese Red Cross. Canadian retailer Shoppers Drug Mart / Pharmaprix has pledged a US$ 150,000 donation and has launched a special operation for members of its loyalty program. Procter & Gamble, Amway, Temptu, Lush Shu Uemura, Hanae Morris also joined the charity movement. Another emergency for the industry is to respond to the immediate consequences the disaster had on the market. The earthquake and tsunami destroyed or damaged a part of production facilities and infrastructures. Beyond the area directly affected in the Sendai area, which accounted for 7-8% of the Japanese GDP, the energy crisis consecutive to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant is disrupting the production in much of the country. A month after the earthquake, there were still daily power outages and the problem is still far from being entirely solved. Logistical problems consecutive to the destruction of traffic infrastructures, amplified by the just-in-time organization of the economy, and of course the persistence of the nuclear risk, add up to the difficulties. Economical analyses agree on a drop of the country's GDP during the April-June quarter. The most optimistic forecast considers a 0.6% fall, while the worst scenario anticipates a 10% decrease. Most economists predict a return to growth for the July-September quarter, a real reconstruction-driven recovery being expected for the fourth quarter. The disaster immediately impacted Japanese companies. Shiseido just announced a 62% drop in profits during its latter fiscal quarter (3.8 billion yens compared to 10 billion during the same quarter last year), a fall that is mainly due to the additional costs resulting from the March 11 earthquake. However, global consequences should be limited. Of course, Japan remains the second largest market for cosmetics, but the penetration rate of foreign firms is relatively low and mostly confined to the high-end segments. Major world exporters should therefore absorb the shock, even if the travel retail business and sales of luxury goods will be affected initially. The global cosmetics industry could instead experienced sourcing difficulties with ingredients and intermediate products manufactured in Japan. Indeed, a consequence of the technological advance in surface treatment acquired by the Japanese industry during the 1990s, 30 to 40% of treated pigments and of certain powders (including titanium oxides) currently used by the global makeup industry is supplied from Japanese companies such as Nippon Shikizai, Miyoshi Kasei (see update below) and Nikko Rica. Although the production facilities of these suppliers were not affected directly by the earthquake and the tsunami, they are impacted by the organizational disorganisation throughout Japan. Even when the Japanese industry will have solved these problems, companies will have to reassure their customers about the safety of their products. From this point of view, the lack of responsibility of Japanese authorities is quite puzzling since, according to the Union European, they do not assess the level of radioactivity contamination on exported products. Recognizing that the risk of contamination is not limited to food, DKSH, a leading distributor of Asian specialty chemicals, has announced the setting up of an internal task force responsible for collecting all data on possibly concerned products and to anticipate potential regulatory changes. However, so far, no contamination of non-food goods from Japan was detected by importing countries. In a statement dated March 30, 2011, the Japan Cosmetic Industry Association (JCIA), the organization representing Japanese cosmetics makers, said that air quality in production facilities is usually controlled. The association, however, admits that ""slightly contaminated drinking water"" can be used in the industrial process, but that the doses involved do not present any danger to health. But in a market consisting of highly substitutable products, more guarantees may be necessary in order to convince consumers! Shiseido thus announced in a statement dated April 22 and published on its website that, following tests conducted in collaboration with a third party, there was no radiation detected on their products made in Japan. On the demand side, it is obvious that the short-term priorities of Japanese consumers will be redirected. What is absolutely unknown is the long-term impact of these disasters, especially of the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi that directly unsettle the Japanese production and consumption model. The need to share electric power resources, as well as TV reports on supply shortages affecting certain products and consumers testimonials saying that, after all, one's can easily live with less superfluous stuff, might transform Japanese consumers. It remains certain that Japan, which has already overcome other rough crises, still has the capacity to surprise us."
"Joël Palix, Clarins, ""Make-up is the fastest growing segment""","Premium Beauty News - After last year's euphoria, demand appears to be weakening. What is your view on this? Joël Palix - We aren't noticing any weakening in perfumes, consumption is on the rise for all mature, emerging and travel retail markets. Perfume remains a pleasure and gift product. Premium Beauty News - The industry recently became aware of the over abundance of perfume launches, what is the situation? Joël Palix - Distributors are being more selective in the choice of novelties and manufacturers have begun to better plan the number of market launches. On this first half of 2011 there are fewer major launches but brands continue to bring their classics to life with line extensions, flankers or new presentations. Premium Beauty News - What were the highlights in recent months for Clarins in terms of product launches? Joël Palix - Clarins launched a major innovation, Vital Light Day. For Clarins Fragrance Group (CFG), we launched Womanity last fall, and the new Swarovski brand with a fragrance and a line of make-up jewels called Aura. The first results concerning these launches are positive. Premium Beauty News - How are you dealing with the green wave which has a tendency to submerge the whole beauty ? Joël Palix - The Clarins Group is particularly sensitive to this issue because of our historical connection to plant-derived treatments. Christian Courtin, our CEO and son of the founder of the Group is a strong supporter of sustainable development and keeps us very much mobilized. Clarins sponsors the Solar Impulse aircraft and conducts many sustainable development initiatives with its ranges. Kibio, a new brand of the Group is involved in high quality cosmetics. Clarins Fragrance Group has innovated for its last two launches (Aura and Womanity) by choosing to create a fully rechargeable range and by setting up a eco-design process that makes the sorting and recycling of components easier. Our historic commitment to environment based on the Mugler Source, thus finds its natural extension. Premium Beauty News - The make-up sector actually appears to be the one driving the cosmetic market. What does it represent for your group and how do you see the future of these products? Joël Palix - So far, make-up is actually the segment that is growing the most rapidly in the selective market. It is the one being the closest to fashion, trends, immediate pleasure. Clarins has a highly developed range in this segment. For Clarins Fragrance Group, we are experimenting with Mugler and Swarovski shorter ranges. Barriers to entry are considerable and we are very careful with our development but opportunities do exist particularly in Asia and in the Middle East."
"Max, the magic of make-up!","Two months from now, this unusual make-up creator will be stealing the show again at the next MakeUp in Paris event. The two main highlights being, first his participation to the round table focusing on the creative process, trends and the future of make-up, and then an exceptional animation, Friday morning on the theme of foundation. Premium Beauty news - Since our last interview, many new events have arisen! Herlant Max - Yes, several new collaborations: one already concluded with the Rexam Group, where we are focusing on finding new gestures, and others to come with a manufacturer specialised in formulations and a brand. Premium Beauty News - Make-up gestures! Always your magician side? Max Herlant - That's true! We have already talked about this. Magic has been and remains one of the engines that drive me. But, again, make-up has nothing to do with magic even if it is true that people ask us to create illusion. It also requires a precise gesture. Premium Beauty News - You had expressed the wish last year to take part again in a television show has this project seen the light? Max Herlant - It's still a bit too early to go into details but I did take part in the first sequences of a show dedicated to well-being and for which I will be the host. Premium Beauty News - You seems to be quite critical about current make-up trends. Max Herlant - That's true! I find that globally, brands have cold feet in terms of innovation and that this trend towards product mass consumption is no help to boost the sector. Make-up, should be fun. A few professionals, of course, are standing out such as MakeUp For Ever who is really playing the card of innovation, Nicolas Degennes who is launching superb collections and Fred Farrugia who still astonishes us with his visionary side. Premium Beauty News - You are still involved in making-up a lot of showbusiness people and you'll be in front of the cameras soon. Max Herlant - Make-up is actually part of the show! But constraints imposed by today's cameras obviously have nothing to do with those of a few years ago. Hence the importance of mastering new HD textures. Techniques that can also easily be applied to everyday make-up. I am actually working a lot on this concept. Premium Beauty News - There is no need to dollop loads of foundation to hide skin imperfections anymore? Max Herlant - This will be the focus of one of my speeches at the next MakeUp in Paris. It is clear that women need to reconcile with foundations. Many of them use it incorrectly. I will try and demonstrate that it is a fantastic product to work with provided that one knows how to use it. It obviously plays an important part in rejuvenation and some foundations have almost the same effects as skincare creams."
"Nail Polish: between ""fastdry"" and ""longlasting""!","Premium Beauty News - The nail polish is in full boom. How do you position yourself in terms of marketing proposals? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Nail polish is, to colour cosmetics what handbags are for trendy looks: the accessory that will make all the difference. So that women can take pleasure when choosing and using their polish we need to work on both formulations and shades. It is all about finding a optimal definition of colors, of always gaining in comfort of application, staying power, gloss and drying time. Anticipating what will be the ""it-polish"" in two years... in order to be able to always offer the most appropriate qualities for each market. This is the mission of IL Cosmetics Marketing Team. Premium Beauty News - What are the main demands of your customers in terms of colours and effects. Can we identify main trends? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Innovations coming from our R&D Department allow us to offer qualities suitable for the various markets in which we operate. Overall, however, we notice that our clients chose formulas that offer a good compromise between ""fastdry"" and ""longlasting"". Öko-Test formulas are increasingly required, as is the case in the German market. Nail polish allows women greater eccentricity and originality than an eye shadow or lip gloss. It is a good way of playing with colours. This explains why pallets are nowadays extremely vast: from yellow to green, everything is permitted! Concerning effects, there is a strong demand for pearlescent, even if creams are timeless. Premium Beauty News - Where does your inspiration come from? What will the future trends and innovations be like? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Our inspiration stems from an alchemy between couture trends, forecasts from style agencies, innovations tapped from other sectors and the strong presence of our sales representatives on the global marketplace. Thus, our customers were able to discover our latest collections at the Cosmoprof Bologna 2011. For summer 2012 the tone is set with a palette ranging from cold-warmed tones with fresh and vivid touches to more-sophisticated shades pushed to the limits."
Professional skin care market rebounds in Europe and the US,"While Japan remained flat with 0.1% growth, a rise in visits to professional outlets for skin care treatments gave way to sales growth for the professional skin care products market in the US and Europe. According Kline & Company's recently released study [1], Europe posted a 3.0% increase in 2010, following a 3.3% decline in 2009, and sales in the United States increased by 2.7% in 2010. Growth in the US was stimulated by brands of medical care providers, such as SkinMedica and SkinCeuticals, which posted double-digit gains. Market leader Obagi, entrenched in the medical care providers segment, maintained its leading position in the U.S. market, experiencing a 13% sales gain for the year. In Europe and Japan, Guinot was the leading brand in 2010. Spas and salons remains the largest purchase channel in the United States, but Kline says their market share is declining due to stiff competition from other channels and a market increasingly focusing on facial treatments. Beauty institutes are the leaders in both Europe with 59% and Japan with nearly 68% of market share. ""While some brands are well established in a single professional channel, such as Sothys and SkinMedica, an increasing number of professional skin care brands adopt multi-channel strategies,"" the consulting and research firm comments. Marketers also want to appeal to a wider group of consumers, such as teenagers, mature clients, pregnant women, and men, by expanding their portfolio with specifically targeted product lines. Introducing smaller sizes of products for retail to appeal to a more frugal consumer would be another strategy to consider, suggests Karen Doskow, Industry Manager at Kline's Consumer Products Practice. Over the next five years the market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 4.2% in Europe, 6.7% in the United States, and 2.6% in Japan."

Vivaness 2011 highlights innovative natural cosmetics,"Vivaness, was held from February 16 to 19 at the Nuremberg fairground in conjunction with BioFach, the world's leading trade fair for organic products. Over 44,000 visitors attended both events, a slight rise compared to the 43.669 visitors recorded in 2010. Besides Germany (25,000 visitors), attendants mainly came from Austria, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The international visitorship rose to 42 %. While Vivaness remains a small event, compared to Biofach (200 exhibitors from a total of 2,544), the exhibition is the leading event in Europe as far as natural and organic cosmetic products are concerned. This year, the 200 exhibitors (183 in 2010) came from 22 countries (21 in 2010) including Germany (83), France (38), Italy (31), Austria (8) and The Netherlands (5). Every year, those interested in organic farming, and natural clothes and personal care products, including a number of politicians from Germany and abroad, meet in Nuremberg on the occasion of Biofach and Vivaness. The two German trade fairs have grown as Europe trendsetting event in the organic sector. No surprise that key players on this market have chosen Vivaness for launching their innovations or announcing their strategic moves. This year, the organisers have put the light on innovative and creative products in all segments of the market. A Novelty Stand gathered 67 innovations from skin care, body and hair care, perfumes and wellness to decorative cosmetics. Baby care and kids products were especially prominent. With its Babycare line, for instance, Töpfer GmbH showcased the first baby's oil bath with 95 % organic olive oil. Other illustrations are the allergens-free Argital baby care line of NCM GmbH or Logona's children's face paints. As far as ingredients are concerned, several innovations also struck the visitor's eye: native oceanic collagen and plain seawater (oceanBASIS GmbH), sage, grape, lavender, juniper berry, cypress, rose, sallow thorn, ginger and lime (Primavera Life GmbH), argan oil, baobab oil and sea buckthorn (Provida Organics Kosmetik & Umwelt GmbH), mango butter, acai berry, cranberry and pomegranate (Droste-Laux Naturkosmetik GmbH & Co. KG), oat and evening primrose (Eubiona) and lemongrass (Ortscheid GmbH). In the BREEZE section, Vivaness also showcased innovative products and concepts, trendy niche brands and young labels, selected by experts from the natural cosmetics sector. The section included products such as: – Intelligent Nutrients a comprehensive line of hair, skin and body care products based on a seed oils of black cumin, pumpkin, raspberry, red grape and cranberry, designed by Aveda's founder, Horst Rechelbacher, – Swedish brand Estelle & Thild, proposing cleansing, day care, night care and eye care products, – Câlinesse (Newcos SA, Switzerland & France), a certified beauty care range for women and babies with donkey's milk, – Nvey Eco, an Australian range of organic and natural decorative cosmetics and compostable make-up accessories. The harmonization of the different standards for natural and organic personal care products was a hot topic at Vivaness this year. BDIH, Cosmebio, Ecocert, ICEA and the Soil Association - the five founding organisations - have officially announced the launch of the COSMOS-standard certification. In parallel, NATRUE announced its partnership with NSF International to develop the first U.S. official national standard for natural cosmetics. NATRUE also staged a demonstration of its QR tag, an electronic system allowing fast display of information on products on mobile phones. As far as growth is concerned, there are good perspectives for natural and organic cosmetics. Experienced players are publishing good forecasts and new-entrants continue to blossom on the market. According to a recent study by Kline & Company [1], the natural cosmetics market will continue to grow steadily in Asia, Europe and the USA until 2014. The Asian markets will achieve two-figure growth rates and will reach a volume of 14.8 billion US dollars. Sales of over 6.3 billion US dollars are forecasted for Europe in the next five years and 5.8 billion US dollars for the USA. Regarding Germany in 2010, more customers switched to natural cosmetics and sales grew by 11 % to 795 million euros. According to Naturkosmetik Konzepte the market share of natural cosmetics reached 6.2 % in 2010. Within this positive context, today's main challenge for certified brands is to be able to communicate on their added value and their benefits compared to conventional cosmetics. The next Vivaness (and BioFach) will be hold on 15-18 February 2012 at Nuremberg fairground."

Marionnaud is gearing up for revival in France,"In a selective French market on the rise for the first time since two years (+2.6% in value and +1.6% in volume), Marionnaud's results also rose in 2010. The increased in attendance (+ 120,000 customers) has taken sales volume to a higher level, with a 2.4% rise. In value, however, the first network of perfume and beauty parlours in France (567 outlets and 704 cabins) suffered from its low cost policy with a limited growth of 0.8%. With a leap forward of 7.8% in volume in the make-up segment, the brand exceeds the performances of the French market (+5.4%), even if again, the low cost policy reduces the performance in value: 5,3% compared to the 5.3% of the market. Moreover, with a market share of 26.7%, Marionnaud remains the market leader for skincare products. ""We've increased the number of transactions performed on competitive segments of the market. These good results were achieved with no growth of the park but with more involved teams"", explained Miek Vercouteren, CEO of Marionnaud France. Marionnaud considers that its good results in make-up and skincare, ""segments where beauty advice and more globally customer relations are a determining factor"", highlight the strength of its teams of beauty consultants. For the brand, this is due to both the very low turnover of employees (-10%) and to the training program implemented within the Marionnaud Academy, who welcomed more than 2,000 consultants and beauticians in 2010. This sense of service was specially acclaimed by consumers who elected Marionnaud ""Retail outlet of the Year2010"" in the Perfume category as part of the annual survey conducted by the Dutch company Q&A Research&Consultancy. They evaluated the ""Expertise of the staff"" and ""Friendliness of staff"" as being the two main assets of Marionnaud's outlets, with a score of respectively, 7.15 and 7.36/10. In 2010 Marionnaud's priority was clearly to win new customers by engaging a fight on prices. The company sees no problem in the fact that the increase in attendance was accompanied by a drop in the average basket in value. ""Beyond the advice and service we provide our customers with, we commit ourselves in practicing all year long the best price in outlets, so that all women have a chance of feeling beautiful every day, whatever their budget,"" explained Sacha Tikhomiroff, Trade Director for Marionnaud. Depending of the outlet in 2010, the number of customers considering Marionnaud as offering the best value for money has increased by 6% over the previous year (The 2009-2010 Picture Price barometer of the OC&C firm on the price positioning of different outlets, published late December 2010). On the network side, the priority for 2010 was the renovation and standardization of the parlours. Nearly one Marionnaud outlet out of two has a parlour, which makes of the brand, with its 704 cabins, the first beauty parlour network of in France. The concept was globally rethought to make it more flexible and more modern. This renovation plan is continuing in 2011 with the launch of a harmonization program for the outlets network on the entire territory ""focusing on a new identity, suitable to all surfaces, and a revamped, more pleasant and efficient customer path."" Marionnaud will also resume its expansion policy by announcing the opening of more than twenty new stores in 2011, with to top it all off, the recruitment of hundreds of sales consultants."
"William Koeberlé, FFPS: ""The selective channel has returned to growth""","Premium Beauty News - As soon as you took office at the head of the FFPS you had to handle the issue on the renewal of the exemption regulation for the selective distribution. What is it about exactly? William Koeberlé - It was my very first priority. When Thibault Ponroy left the presidency of the FFPS, we were negotiating with the European authorities the renewal of the exemption for selective perfumery. Maintaining a coherent framework on in this matter was crucial for us. Selective distribution is first a means for market regulation. It enables high-end perfume and cosmetics brands to select their distribution network on the basis of quality criteria such as for example the shopping environment, and customer service at the time of sale. But in the end, the consumer must have the feeling he gets his money's worth, specially through a range of services and advice which are offered to him in point of sales. Among issues to address, there was the question of Internet sales. It was not, of course, the question of prohibiting online sales of perfumes and luxury cosmetics, but to make sure that they did actually meet quality criteria that compared to those found in stores. The market needs rules that make it as efficient as possible. Premium Beauty News - And how is this selective market performing today? William Koeberlé - We returned to growth in 2010, both in value (+2.6%) and volume (+1.6%) according to figures provided by the NPD. This is true for all market segments, except for perfume whose sales volumes are still on a declining trend (-0.6%) in spite of an increase of 2.1% in value. It is colour cosmetics that is the fastest growing segment with +5.4% in value and also in number of units sold. Skincare is also very dynamic: + 2.1% in value and 3% in volume. I'm pretty optimistic about the future and confident on the constant innovation spirit of brands which helps them to offer products that meet the needs of increasingly demanding customers. Premium Beauty News - There is a significant development of private brands. How do you explain this phenomenon which hitherto originated rather more from mass distribution? William Koeberlé - Private labels complement traditional skin care and make-up brands. They have their place on the shelves next to must-have best-sellers or original brands, with a true story, that help create differentiation. Private brands are actually meeting a growing need emerging from the market: Affordable quality. As such they are particularly attractive to young consumers, but not only. These ranges are an important element to help maintain the attractiveness of selective distribution. Premium Beauty News - What are your priorities at the head of the FFPS? William Koeberlé - My very first priority, as you understood concerned negotiations on the exemption regulation for selective distribution. Then I wish we could move forward, with our suppliers on the challenges pertaining to logistics, and on closely related issues such as sustainability. We have thought up specifications on this subject and we have proposed to the FEBEA (French trade association representing manufacturers specialised in beauty products) who represents our contacts within the brands, to start discussing this issue with us. We have everything to gain, suppliers and distributors, by working together on common specifications for logistics. Indeed, shortcomings and a lack of efficiency in the supply chain, don't bring value added to anyone. In practice we must take up a common language for flows, we must agree on common methods for calculating greenhouse gases emissions, for harmonized traceability methods, anti-theft procedures, electronic data interchange (EDI) and the creation of electronic catalogues with standardized products sheets. Eventually the third priority is our collective agreement and, through it, the key issue of trades in the perfume industry. Here again we touch issues related to the training of our employees and counselling, but also products, and the question of quality service provided to our customers."
"""The future of make-up is in new materials,"" Nicolas Degennes, Givenchy","After more than ten years as Givenchy's Colours and Make-up Creative Director, Nicolas Degennes, still hopes ""to surprise and be surprised"". He strongly believes that ""the future for make-up is still looking bright. In a world of exposure, it has become unavoidable. We are going to add to colour cosmetics skincare notions for an improved comfort and surface correction. The future of make-up lies in science which is evolving faster and faster!"" In 1999 Nicolas Degennes arrives at Parfums Givenchy. ""These ten years have been a collective adventure, he explains. We all 'professionally' grew up together. I also discovered a world I did not know. New concepts for me: business, profitability that becomes challenging. I was compelled to understand the expectations, differences and evolutions. I learn a lot."" And he learns fast. So, for Givenchy too, this adventure is bearing fruit. Representing a modest activity at the time, make-up now contributes to more than 20% of the brand's turnover. For Nicolas Degennes, to work for a brand such as Givenchy means: ""Being aware of what is a luxury brand. Respecting its codes and identity while insuring its evolution."" ""When I took over from Olivier Echaudemaison, stresses Degennes, I didn't specifically know Givenchy's make-up. The 4 Gs had disappeared. I wanted to rediscover the codes of the House to make sure it was still moving ahead."" But there was a life before Givenchy. And Nicolas Degennes's success is rooted in these years before. He enters the world of make-up in 1981 during a stay in the U.S. At the age of 18, Nicolas becomes the official make-up Artist of the American make-up brand On Stage. In 1985 he decides to join the Parisian school of Christian Chauveau, headed by Dany Sanz, the founder of Make-Up For Ever. He will then grow a passion for stage or film make-up, special effects, body art, transformations and the discovery of new materials... End of 1985, he joins the TV channel Canal +, which was just founded in France. An opportunity to meet artists, agents, and directors in an atmosphere of freedom and creation... He suggests pop singer Mylène Farmer to test another look and successfully dares the pallor and the strangeness of a white make-up. As the Canal+ Chief makeup artist, Nicolas Degennes takes in charge events such as Les Césars (French movie awards),and The Cannes Film Festival. ""I have a compulsive greed for images, he explains. And the channel decided to entrust me with the responsibility of its image. Against all odds, I decided to dress up the whole channel in black & white."" And it worked! When he arrives at Givenchy, Nicolas Degennes strives to rediscover the legacy of Monsieur Hubert de Givenchy through cosmetics. With Le Make Up, he revives the brand's initials and assumes this couture legacy of which he tries to transcribe the contents and philosophy. During ten years one collection follows another: Délice de Chocolat, Artycolor, without forgetting Diamantassiez the concept of jewel make-up, The Poetics, etc. There were also non-standard creations like Baby Lips, ""a material-free colour developer just a natural reaction, a rush of blood to the lips."" We can also name Lash Pearls: ""This was my first go at polymers. I love transformation. Makeup is not meant to be serious."" And of course, Phenomen'Eyes ""a revolution, a technical performance,"" Nicolas Degennes insists, ""with the famous patented spherical brush, that loads the eyelashes, even the shortest ones, even the ones in the inner corner of the eye, for a broad panoramic and very graphic effect."" The future of make-up, according to Nicolas Degennes ""will obviously come from new materials. A make-up to better suit people all day long. We'll have to invent new words for new products. Conceive make-up differently."" Nicolas Degennes will participate in the round table on the theme of art direction on June 23, 2011 during MakeUp in Paris in co-operation with MUP magazine."
"Marionnaud, Douglas, Limoni voted Europe's best perfume retailers of the year","The survey ""Retailer of the Year"" was created in 2003 by Q&A Research & Consultancy, a research and consultancy agency headquartered in the Netherlands and specializing in qualitative and quantitative surveys on consumer habits. The survey is conducted every year using a similar methodology in 10 European countries: The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and Portugal. The surveys are conducted on different sectors of distribution, and are base on panels of consumers who are asked to evaluate chain stores. The evaluation is based on average score obtained upon nine criteria: assortment, price level, customer friendliness, service, atmosphere, innovation, expertise of staff, promotions and price/quality ratio. Overall and for all retailers, the ""customer friendliness"" criterion is the second most important for customers with 14.4%, behind the ""value for money"" criterion (32.2%). As far as France is concerned, the survey was conducted between June and December 2010 on the basis of 46,520 consumer evaluations concerning 66 different chain retailers. In the ""Perfumery"" category, 3,142 consumers have rated the 3 main actors of the market. First on 8 of 9 criteria, Marionnaud was awarded the title ""Retailer of the year"" followed by Nocibé and Sephora. The retailers obtained the highest scores on the criteria ""Customer friendliness"", with a score of 7.36/10, ""Service"" (7.22) and ""Expertise of staff"" (7.15). Marionnaud and Sephora get the same score with respect to their ""innovation"" ability. Among the 66 chain retailers evaluated in France, in all business sectors, Marionnaud is positioned in the top 15 on the criteria ""Assortment"", ""Customer friendliness"", ""Expertise of Staff"", ""Innovation"", ""Price/Quality ratio "", ""Promotions,"" ""Service"" and ""Atmosphere of the store."" In the ""Health & Beauty"" category, however, it is Yves Rocher that ranks first with an excellent overall performance since the retailers reaches the third position of the general ranking, just behind fashion retailer M&S Mode (1st) and Ikea (2nd). In the rest of Europe, Douglas, was awarded the title in the ""Perfumery"" category in Germany, while DM-Drogeriemarkt ranked firts in the ""Drogerie"" (Drugstore) category. In Italy, Limoni took the first place in the ""Profumeria"" (Perfumery) category and Bottega Verde got the highest score in the ""Erboristeria"" (Heath and beauty botanicals) category. In Belgium, Ici Paris XL ranked first in the ""Perfumery"" category, together with Kruidvat in the ""Beauty and Health"" category. The Belgian chain retailers also took the first place in The Netherlands, while it is Dirx Drogist that got the highest scores in the ""Drogisterij"" (Drugstore) category. Marionnaud was selected again in Switzerland in the ""Perfumery"" category. There was no ""Perfumery"" category in the survey conducted in Spain."
MakeUp in Paris hoists the colours,"The first conference will focus on the influence of 3D technologies in make-up and, more globally on our approach to colour, on products, textures, but also to everything concerning distribution and communication, from packaging to advertising. The second will focus on a historical approach of colour in make-up and will address colours' interaction in fashion, body and make-up. Olivier Guillemin, who was born in Paris in 1961, is also a fashion designer, Secretary General of Intercolor, an international Association of creative research on colour trends in fashion and environment, and Creative Director and co-founder, along with Olivier Védrine, of the design, architecture and scenography agency [o,o]. For more than 10 years, he has been involved in Japan as a colour, design and fashion artistic consultant, for Shiseido, and more specifically today for the Maquillage brand. Olivier Guillemin has chaired the French Committee of Colour since 1993. Stylists, designers, art directors, visual artists, researchers, journalists and even writers gathered in this original club form a prospective breeding ground, to serve design and colour. Together, they give thought to the evolution and expression of colours linked to lifestyles. Twice a year, the French Committee of Colour imagines a chromatic evolution of the environment with the publishing of a colour range that enjoys a wide audience among trade shows and member companies. According to Olivier Guillemin, coulour acts as a sense enhancer. Colour is there to serve both, aesthetics and function, it attracts the look, but carries within itself very strong sensory connotations hinged on touch, hearing, smell, taste. ""To awaken one's sense, is indeed to be sure of offering that little extra bit of soul to colours that speaks to our conscience and unconscious mind. To observe to better create, but it's also to feel in order to better imagine."" The second edition of MakeUp in Paris will be held at the Carrousel du Louvre on June 23 and 24, 2011."
Blogs more efficient than magazines to drive beauty purchases,"According to a research jointly led by PR agency DeVries and online participatory information network BlogHer on the influence of media on women's shopping behaviors when it comes to beauty and personal care products, blogs are two times more likely (63%) than magazines (26%) to have inspired a beauty product purchase over the last six months. The survey was conducted through the BlogHer online network on October 2010 on a sample of 1,074 women across the United States, who had to answer 25 questions aiming at measuring the relative influence traditional media and blogs have on the products women purchase and brand preference. Women in the sample were significantly younger than the average U.S. population: a majority (48%) were 18-34, 31% were 35-44 and 13% were 45-54. However, it ""mirrors the general online population when it comes to attitudes about beauty products,"" say the authors. ""We've long believed at DeVries that trusted blogs have as much influence on purchase decisions as traditional media outlets, both inside the beauty category and out. We just didn't have data to confirm what we felt intuitively to be true,"" said Stephanie Smirnov, President ofDeVries Public Relations. ""Our research partnership with BlogHer was forged to validate our hypothesis about blogger influence on beauty purchase decisions, and it's been extremely illuminating."" Actually, women appear just as likely to trust the beauty product advice from a parenting (43%), health (42%) or lifestyle (37%) blog, as from a beauty and fashion blog (43%). Furthermore, when seeking recommendations about beauty product, women turn to and trust ""familiar"" bloggers more than store websites, social networks or message boards. However, while women tend to research online they continue to buy offline. According to the survey, U.S. women prefer buying beauty products offline. ""The brick and mortar store (offline) beats online shopping for beauty products by a margin of four to one. And this ratio extends across all beauty verticals; cosmetics, skin care or hair care. Women want a 3-D experience when it comes to beauty products; they have to see it, feel it and touch it,"" comment the authors. Cost and efficiency were cited as the top reasons for preferring online shopping, although most women (39%) still said they would prefer to purchase their cosmetics in a real store. ""Doing a deeper dive into the beauty product segment, specifically, revealed that even when purchasing ultimately takes place offline, online word-of-mouth maintains its powerful influence,"" added Elisa Camahort Page, co-founder of BlogHer, Inc. The full results of the survey can be found at: www.blogher.com/beauty-eye-blog-holder-0"
Make-up to drive Indian cosmetics maket,"Amid changing lifestyle and increasing consumer awareness, India cosmetics market now provides lucrative opportunities for existing market players as well as new comers. In a new research report titled ""Indian Cosmetic Sector Analysis (2009-2012)"", RNCOS explains that the cosmetic industry is among the most dynamic sectors in India and that colour cosmetics is the segment that should experiment the fastest growth, with a compound annual growth rate of around 12% during 2010-2013. ""Main reasons for the growth of the colour cosmetics segment are increased access to branded products through specialist retailers, supermarkets, and increasing population of working ladies in the country,"" explains RNCOS. According to UbiFrance, the French trade commission, lipsticks and nail polishes account for 60% of make-up sales in India. Hindustan Lever Limited brand, Lakmé, which was created at the end of the 1950s, remains India's leading beauty brand. M.A.C. (Estée Lauder) et Lancôme (L'Oréal) are among the leading foreign brands in the luxury make-up market segment. Along with colour cosmetics, the entire beauty and personal care market in India should sustain its upward growth trend in the coming years. The potential for growth is huge as most product categories only have low penetration rates within the Indian population. If 90% of Indian households use soaps, only 50% use toothpastes or shampoos and 23% only use skincare products. According to RNCOS, even Indian males are showing a growing interest to cosmetics and the fast emerging men's grooming products market is boosting the cosmetic sector. The mindset of male consumers is changing due to the increasing influence of media and western exposure."
Kanebo brings Tokyo women to light,"While many national economies in Asia are growing at a fast pace, Japan, the most developed country in the region, has been trapped in a protracted recession for years. Despite this general context, the beauty and fashion sectors remained dynamic. In order to better understand what fuels Japanese women's interest in this areas, Kanebo has carried out a lifestyle survey on women in Tokyo and in four other major cities in East Asia: Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei, and Seoul. According to the Japanese cosmetics maker, women in Tokyo place greater importance on their ""hobbies"" than women in the four other Asian cities covered by the survey. On the work front, they tend to emphasize ""personal relationships"" and ""work-life balance"", while women in the other four cities, emphasize ""high income"" and ""personal development."" On the one hand, Tokyo women stress personal relationships and are somewhat less concerned with their femininity than women in the other four big Asian cities. When asked what sort of person they wished to be, Tokyo women most frequently responded, ""someone considerate to others."" In contrast, women in the other four cities tended to reply ""cheerful"" and ""feminine."" On the other hand, Tokyo women like to be praised for their appearance, particularly for being ""stylish"" and having ""good taste."" In contrast, women in Beijing, Taipei, and Seoul like most to be praised for their ""work ability."" Significantly, only Tokyo women react very positively to being described as ""kawaii"" (cute). Respondents in all five cities named their ""eyes"" as their main ""attractive features,"" followed by skin. The frequency of makeup use differs considerably from one city to another. In stark contrast to other cities, 80 percent of Tokyo women and 60 percent of Seoul women use makeup either everyday or five days a week. Tokyo women also use the most makeup items, while Seoul women are the most ardent users of makeup bases. Tokyo women tend to consider makeup as a part of their personal etiquette, a contribution to the quality of their social image, whereas the Seoul women think of it as a means for ""concealing defects."" Taipei is close to Tokyo in this regard, while women in Shanghai and Beijing seem to use makeup for more various reasons. ""As Japanese women grow older, they may miss out on the pleasure of making up and begin to think of makeup as a social duty,"" commented Kanebo's research team. A comparison of ""preferred makeup styles"" revealed a preference in Tokyo for ""intricate makeup"" with an emphasis on lines that look natural and sophisticated at the same time. Women in Seoul, in contrast, embrace different makeup styles ranging from natural to intricate on different occasions, while Taipei women are inclined to the look of ""wearing no makeup"" at all. When asked to name their favourite colours, all women expressed a preference for pinkish tones. However, for eye shadows, Tokyo women preferred beige and brown shades. As a whole, foundation is the most important makeup item for the survey respondents. Kanebo plans to continue the survey through the comparison of lifestyles of women in Europe and in North America."
The beauty industry will be green in 2011,"In 2011, cosmetic products will be greener than in 2010. Actually, experts at Mintel Beauty Innovation state the so-called 'Down to Earth' trend will increasingly shape the beauty industry. Closely linked to sustainability this key trend addresses the practicalities of making and marketing green beauty, and is a continuation of the trend to greener product formulas that was important in 2010. According to the market research firm, 13% of skincare, hair care and cosmetic products launched in 2010 made the paraben-free claim (up 5% from 2008), while almost 9% of made organic claim (twice as many as in 2007). The all-natural claim was found in fewer than 3% of launches in 2010. ""Paraben-free claims actually outpaced organic and all-natural claims in new skincare, hair care and cosmetics launches in 2010 [1], backing up Mintel's Nu Natural trend that predicted that brands would emphasize results and free-from claims over certification,"" explains Nica Lewis, Head Consultant at Mintel Beauty Innovation. In 2011, ""free-from"" formulas (""free from parabens"", ""free from preservatives"", etc.) should continue to evolve in an effort to avoid petrochemically-derived ingredients. In order to be successful, cosmetics makers wanting to ride the trend will have to learn how to source natural and organic raw materials and how to manage the price pressure due to the varying supply and demand. They will also have to master the challenges of green chemistry: such as the use of sustainable surfactants, 'green' solvents and alternatives to parabens and other preservatives. New skincare products with environmentally-friendly packaging were also up 5% on the previous year - a trend Mintel expects to have real impact in 2011. ""2011 will see beauty companies placing increased importance on the environment, focusing on sustainable sourcing with attention to maintaining biodiversity. A renewed emphasis on repackaging to minimize waste will also be a factor,"" concludes Lewis."
MakeUp in New York : first edition set for September 2011,"In the wake of the success of MakeUp in Paris, its organizers have announced their intention to duplicate the concept in the USA. The first edition of MakeUp in New York will open its doors on September 14th and 15th, 2011 at Studio 450, ambitioning to be the first trade event in New York exclusively dedicated to the make-up industry suppliers. ""Because of its size, the US market is highly attractive. Compared to the parcelling of the European market, it can be considered as the biggest unified market in the world. Due to the high concentration of beauty companies in the area, New York is the best place for suppliers to display and promote their products,"" explains Sandra Maguarian, the show manager. ""Our aims is to create an event exclusively dedicated to the make-up industry suppliers, which gathers the most innovative and creative products of the make-up universe, and to bring together suppliers, brands and distribution in the very heart of New York,"" she adds. MakeUp in New York will host for two days, suppliers of make-up ingredients, make-up formulators, packaging manufacturers, full-service companies, designers, experts and many others, to present a whole range of innovations and trends.

A beautiful Christmas for the beauty industry in Europe?,"Now retailers are fully in the Christmas sales season, leading market research company The NPD Group reports that consumers are spending more on prestige beauty in 2010 in the United Kingdom and in France while Spain and Italy are lagging behind. The UK prestige beauty market (+8,8% in value) [1] is performing better in January-September 2010 than France, which has the next highest growth rate at 3.6%, and Spain [2], which is still facing decline, and Italy. All categories are growing but the British prestige market continues to be boosted by skincare (+12.4%), which accounts for 32% of the market. Fragrance remains the largest sector of the UK market with a 37% share. In France, all categories are growing but the prestige beauty market continues to be boosted by fragrances (+3,1%), accounting for more than 60% of the market in value. Make-up (+7,3%) showed the strongest growth at the end of September, whereas skincare (+2,2%) is growing albeit slowly as it struggles to recover from a particularly tough year in 2009. December is once again eagerly anticipated as it represents 20% of the prestige beauty market revenue in France and 28% in the United Kingdom. This figure is even higher for fragrances: more than 25% of 2009 revenue was achieved in December. Christmas is also the most important time of the year for sales of fragrance gift sets that accounted for 23% of the fragrances' revenue in December last year in France and for 32% in the United Kingdom. There is a particular emphasis on sales of gift sets this Christmas in France as sales were disappointing not only this time last year, but also during traditionally strong sales periods of Mothers' Day and Fathers' Day this year. During the first six months of the year the top sellers for women in France were the trusted classic fragrances ranges including Chanel No.5, Dior and Kenzo, whilst the top selling men's lines included more recent products from Paco Rabanne and Hermès. In the UK, the first semester top sellers for women were a mix of classis and new fragrances, whilst the top selling men's lines included leaned more heavily towards recently launched products."
L'Oreal to strengthen research capabilities in emerging markets,"The global cosmetics market undergoes significant changes - with emerging markets (with China, Brazil and India leading the way) already accounting for 53% of the world's consumption and 87% of its growth. The globalisation of beauty, is the first main trend identified by L'Oréal Research. Considering such a situation, the French group committed itself to understand and adapt to all women and men in the world in order to offer them the best of cosmetics in terms of quality, efficacy and safety. ""The ability to innovate for new markets must therefore rely on in-depth knowledge of the culture, needs and preferences of Chinese, Indian and Brazilian consumers,"" the company summarizes in a release. In order to place consumers at the very heart of Research & Innovation, L'Oréal has decided to create the ""Consumer Insights"" International division as well as regional R&I hubs, on the model of the one existing in Asia. The aim is to strengthen research in emerging countries that currently host only 10% of the group's 3,300 researchers. In the context where huge non-European markets are skyrocketing, L'Oréal is convinced that innovation must take place where consumers are based. ""The concept of design to value looks at consumer habits in a given location to develop an innovation."" According to L'Oréal, innovation stems from an association of market intelligence (observing beauty rituals, emblematic products, cultural habits) and in-depth knowledge of skin and hair's biology and physiology. The French cosmetics giant points out the example of kohl, an emblematic product in India, which is now being used as a source of inspiration for the development of new products. Second key factor of success, underlines to Laurent Attal, ""to invest in technologies that will generate even greater innovation."" L'Oréal is subsequently highly interested in genomic, and in the progress in stem cells, biphonotics and reconstructed skin … Anti-perspirants and oily skin products are strategic for emerging markets. ""In most of these countries, sweat and oily skin are seen as one and the same, and are intimately linked to climate, diet and physiology."" Third main trend regarding innovation: the efficacy perceived by the consumer and demonstrated by scientific and clinical proof. ""The notion and perception of performance is in continuous progression. For example, the quality of a shampoo or shower gel's lather is not appreciated in the same way by all cultures,"" explains L'Oréal. To address these diverse expectations, L'Oréal wants to combine instrumental evaluation methods that assess clinical efficacy and objective evaluations of the product's emotional and sensorial performance (brain imaging, ""eye tracking"" or sensorial mapping…)."
Perfumery and cosmetics: French online shops still to be improved!,"Yuseo, a consulting firm specializing in the ergonomics of interactive systems, asked 480 female Internet users to test 3 of the leading French online retailers of beauty products - Marionnaud, Nocibé and Sephora. The study was conducted from October 15 to 20, 2010. All participants were regular female Internet users, who already browsed online cosmetics shops. They were asked 60 contextual questions and had to perform 6 tasks each of them previously standardized to be similar for all sites. [1] Among the main drivers of Internet users to browse online cosmetics retailers are the opportunity to benefit from web-specific promotional offers and the possibility to buy without being ""pressured"" by shop-assistants. These motivations may be connected to a priori expectations vis-à-vis online cosmetics and fragrances purchases: time saving (not to queue) for 74%, attractive prices for 60%, and home delivery for 57%. On the other hand, the main expressed barriers vis-à-vis online sales are the impossibility to touch and test products (91%), excessive delivery charges (77%), and the difficulty to visualize the product (77%). According to Yuseo, the scores at the end of the test reveal several disappointments that can be related to e-shops weaknesses. The 450 women web users who participated in the study have retained a half-hearted impression of their experience. While information on products obtain a good rate, the access to the assortment is not always as simple as expected, and some processes sometimes appear unnecessarily complicated. Overall, the attractivity of online retailers , though initially very strong, is impaired. The product information (colour, composition, product benefits, usage tips, product quantity, ...) and the product offering provided by online retailers seem in line with the expectations and the needs of users. Product information is an important issue as for 91% of Internet users, the main inconvenience of searching and / or buy cosmetic products online is not being able to touch and test the products. Customers participating in the study also give good rates to the product offering, and have especially appreciated the wide range of brands available for each product category. Women users generally appreciate the simplicity and intuitiveness of the ordering process. ""This simplicity is particularly important as for 74% of them, the main advantage of searching and / or buying a cosmetic products online is the saving of time (not to queue). Therefore, it would have been shame to lose this benefit the purchasing the tunnel,"" explains the consulting firm. However, users interviewed by Yuseo generally felt they were required to do a lot of unnecessary actions. ""Consequently, the retailers' image was impacted negatively by the browsing experience. This degradation of the brand's image can affect the conversion rate of these sites."" Clearly, this means fewer purchases. ""Indeed, a significant proportion of the participants, who were initially positively oriented or undecided about visiting / using these sites, turned to negative opinions in terms of envy for future use after only a dozen minutes browsing the sites (i.e. the time needed to achieve the 6 required tasks)."" Actually, the proportion of interested Internet users dropped from 74% before the test to 47% after, and the proportion of hesitant users surged from 5% before to 24% after. Among the three online retailers included in the study, Sephora's online shop stands apart from its two competitors and gets better rates for both the browsing experience and the overall satisfaction of users. However, the study did not examine the performance of other important stakeholders, including online beauty relailers specialized in direct sales. In particular, one's can note the absence from the field of the study of Yves Rocher's online shop that, for the 4th year in a row was recently elected # 1 e-commerce beauty site by Internet users surveyed by the FEVAD (Federation of e-commerce and distance selling)."
Consumer packaged goods trends for 2011,"Mintel has identified several trends that may impact the development of consumer packaged goods in 2011. According to the market research company, marketers should get ready for a ""natural shakedown"". While all types of natural claims have grown in importance in all regions, and across all product categories, the term 'natural' remains vague and ""ill-defined"". As a consequence, misleading natural products are likely to come under fire and governmental authorities may opt for stringer regulations. Mintel also expects to see a new focus on accentuating the positives of what is in a product, rather than emphasising what is not in it (e.g. ""no parabens"", ""free from synthesized chemicals"", etc.). As far as sustainability is concerned, Mintel considers that rather than new developments, 2011 will be in the continuation of what we have seen. ""There will be a greater focus on reduced packaging that promotes environmental responsibility."" The development of hybrid products will of the responses of manufacturers to consumer needs. ""Consumers don't necessarily view products as being in one category or another, rather they look for solutions that meet their needs, and that may be something that straddles multiple categories."" Beyond hybrid forms, Mintel also sees a blurring of how consumers use products – for instance with personal care and home care products that do more than one thing. The border between professional and consumer products is blurring too. Mintel says that on the model of ""salon-style"" hair treatments for home use, mainstream brands are getting into a more serious ""professional"" arena, by offering consumers what used by specialists. Over the last year, more big brands have been revitalising old products and old ad campaigns, tapping into the escalating trend of nostalgia. Mintel anticipates more of these in 2011. The market research company says that many brands will use old formulations, old package designs, re-runs of advertising campaigns or new ads with a retro feel. ""These annual predictions represent continuations of current big-picture trends, rather than major changes in the marketplace and what companies are doing,"" notes Lynn Dornblaser, Director of innovation and insight at Mintel. ""Understanding the major trend areas and how they change from year to year is essential for companies to be successful when developing and launching new products."""
"Asia, much more than a (huge) market","Cosmoprof Asia, the largest tradeshow in the Beauty sector in the Asia Pacific region, which was held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 10 to 12 November 2010, has once again confirmed its dynamism. The event, celebrating its 15th year, posted impressive statistics: 57,400 sqm of exhibition area (+10% compared to the 2009 edition) that hosted 1,633 exhibitors (16% up on 2009). Furthermore, according to the organizers, more than 45,100 visitors attended the event over the three show days (a 10% increase compared to 2009), including more than 26,100 international visitors (11% up on 2009) coming from Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Turkey, Brazil and the USA. 18,900 attendees from Hong Kong (8% up on the previous year). ""Cosmoprof Asia has again confirmed its place as the definitive show in the region for the international cosmetic and beauty business. It's the reference point for new trends so that visitors come away with exciting new ideas and new business contacts,"" said Michael Duck, Director of Cosmoprof Asia Ltd. For cosmetics makers and their suppliers, China and Asia are the world's key growth markets. Japanese cosmetics giants, Kanebo and Shiseido, thus eye at the Chinese market as their number one strategic priority to fuel their international development. AmorePacific Corp., South Korea's leading cosmetics manufacturer, wants to become China's fourth cosmetics supplier. Procter & Gamble and Estee Lauder are increasing the number of brands and products they offer in the country, in order to make the most of the growth potential they hold. L'Oreal, the world's leading cosmetics maker, intends to quadruple its production capacity in Asia. Once again, China's huge but tricky market was the main focus of many exhibitors and visitors at Cosmoprof Asia. The two conferences on the development of beauty brands and on cosmetics regulations in China were fully booked. According to market research firm RNCOS, China's cosmetics and toiletries market shows no signs of slowdown. Especially, skin care segment has been a key growth contributor and steered overall industry to sustain its growth momentum. RNCOS forecast the segment to grow at a CAGR [1] of 12.7% over the next three years (2010-2013). ""The growing number of discerning Chinese consumers is leading into more diversified demand for skin care products. To meet the demand arising from different consumer segments, skin care players are introducing new products with added functionalities. Besides moisturizers, other products like, whitening, toners, and anti-ageing skin care have received positive response from the consumers and shown impressive growth,"" explains RNCOS. The latest edition of Cosmoprof Asia also highlighted the high technology level and innovation of the industry's leading packaging and full service suppliers such as Alcan Packaging Beauty (now Albéa), Du Pont, Iléos, Fiabila, FS Korea, Gerresheimer, HCP Packaging, Jia Hsing Enterprise, Kolmar, Libo Cosmetics, and many more. Each year, Asian suppliers from Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and, increasingly, from mainland China showcase increasingly interesting products, complying with the highest quality standards. ""Actually, there's no reason for Asian suppliers to remain specialised in low-cost and poor quality products. The natural trend is that leading companies provide increasingly sophisticate products,"" a European exhibitor told Premium Beauty News. The show was swarming with manufacturers presenting a countless number of vibrating, rotating, or heated mascaras, but also with companies showcasing innovative packaging designs. Libo Cosmetics, for instance, a supplier of make-up packaging headquartered in Taiwan, with manufacturing facilities in mainland China, showcased flower-shaped, fabric-covered or maple-covered compact series, besides extensive ranges of standard products, lipstick cases, mascara and lip gloss containers and supplies many of the most renown international brands. FS Korea is another illustration. The Korean supplier showcased its ranges of packaging made from eco-resin as well as innovative designs for compacts and make-up brushes."
Natural cosmetics: becoming commonplace?,"Premium Beauty News - The market of natural and organic products is rapidly differentiating itself and getting more complex? Yet does it still remain a niche market? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - No: it is becoming a mainstream market. The market is featuring annual growth rates of about 6-8% - which is twice as much and even more compared to the rates for ""classic"" cosmetics. Consumers are becoming increasingly more demanding and require from brands that they demonstrate not only the efficacy but also the safety of their products: they claim it's for the sake of their health that they use more and more bio and natural beauty products. Premium Beauty News - The Natural Beauty Summit is going to emphasize on the role played by distribution channels? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - We are going to focus on three ""non standard"" distribution channels: drugstores / organic food stores / internet. We will in particular address the necessary complementarity between online stores and the ""brick and mortar"" ones. This will give us a chance to see that distribution channels of natural and organic beauty products go well beyond traditional selective channels and that brands must have diversified strategies: there is no point in trying to obtain, at all costs, a referencing in specialized distribution channels... who not always know how to sell properly these products. Premium Beauty News - The proliferation of definitions and labels on natural and organic products are often seen as a source of confusion for consumers. What can be expected from the announcement of an ISO standard publication on this subject? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - Harmonization of the five European labels has just given birth to the European specifications Cosmos Standard, which have two levels of certification, natural and organic. Similarly, Natrue, the European specifications -soon to become international, which present a genuine definition of a natural cosmetic which should simplify the understanding of consumers looking for more clarity! ISO international standards which are currently in preparation relying, as a work base, on these two specifications will offer international guidelines within four years; in the end, these standards will bring forward a specific definition but most of all will help maintain the international market open and will encourage our industry to innovate in the field of natural cosmetics! Premium Beauty News - Presently, packaging seems to be the core issue in terms of sustainable development for cosmetics? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - Sustainable development in cosmetics is very often a matter of packaging choices, because in fact, it is easier to choose a more eco-friendly or environmentally friendly packaging than to entirely rework the formula it contains, like for example, incorporating more naturalness. Premium Beauty News - However what is meant exactly by eco-packaging? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - That's the whole issue actually. Bio-materials, bio-based polymers, regenerated plastics, recycled or recyclable packaging, durable packaging, certifiable packaging, material reduction, control of energy, carbon offsetting, local manufacturing... Eco-packaging cannot come down to only one of these approaches addressed solely but must be thought up in a transverse and global way. In a true environmental approach, brands should consider packaging differently. New consumer expectations, as well as legislation on environmental information, may be an opportunity to reconsider the manufacturing process as a whole, in order to then adapt a specific communication, legible and understandable to brands and end users, in search of environmentally friendly products and of brands commitments in terms of environmental responsibility. Of course, limits and constraints of such an approach need to be discovered (high cost, aesthetics, resistance, contents/container interaction...). Can we reconcile brands and consumers expectations with these new constraints and new environmental functions, he must enriched himself with? Specialists from ILEOS, Alcan and Leoplast companies will be there to expose us their views."
Container/content: a vital partnership!,"Premium Beauty News - Cosmetology and plastics processes... many subjects are common. And you have everything to gain by working together. Dominique Bouvier - Absolutely! I would even go further: We have no other choice! Because to address at the same time, regulations, often groundless concerns on the safety of our products, the organic wave and sustainable development, media campaigns harmful to the industry, changes in attitudes, consumptions habits, the pressure of decision-makers and globalization ... it is an absolute necessity for manufacturers specialised in contents and those specialised in containers, to talk to one another, exchange and share ideas. We must Co-fertilize ideas and test them together. Let's be frank, we must avoid the situation where ""full service"" would result in ""full"" customers, getting richer by the day, facing ""empty"" exhausted and poorer suppliers! Premium Beauty News - This looks like a real call to resistance! Dominique Bouvier - Yes, almost! Given the complexity of the world surrounding us, plastics specialists and cosmeticians would be well advised to support one another! If only because of changing regulations. But we must also resist to low-cost competition (products and packs), respond through quality and innovation, meet requirements of sustainable development (carbon footprint), respond to the needs of fast growing markets and, most importantly, sustain the high quality level of ""Made in France"" cosmetics, guarantee the origin and quality of products and their packaging in compliance with market regulations. Some regions of the world but also Europe are imposing us new rules which have set the bar very high! It is therefore necessary to pool our resources. Premium Beauty News - Partnership, indeed, but good old ""individualistic"" habits and a lack of enthusiasm to unveil carefully kept trade secrets are difficult to get rid off! Don't you agree? Dominique Bouvier - It's true! We often hear the following sentence: ""My customer is mine"" or ""my teams are the best."" We must find a way. Decision makers, brands, are common to all, and what they expect from us is a perfect understanding of our industrial domain, practical inventiveness, solutions, innovation... This implies that we share common data to better meet consumer needs. As for the argument ""my team is the best"", no doubt about that! But this should not keep us from uniting, teaming up, while preserving qualities essential for success. That is to say, autonomy and freedom of movement, dynamism and versatility. Creativity is not the prerogative of large structures, but comes from well ""sourced"" human beings functioning with well ""connected"" brains and ideas emerge from exchanges and openness. We must lift barriers to promote horizontal co-operation between the different trades. Conditions for success lie in mutual respect, the sharing of value and information, the equity of contributions and transparency. To work together successfully, you don't need a legal contract, you just need a charter of common and shared values. Premium Beauty News - Hence, this rapprochement with packaging converters is essential! Dominique Bouvier - Vital! The functionality in primary cosmetics packaging can be found at different levels: what I call ""Cosmetability"" is the intelligent answer of the product/pack duo, depending on the purpose of use. The more the sought benefits are sophisticated, the earlier the collaboration should begin. And ideally, in our businesses, marketers, designers and scientists should be working together... You do understand that this challenge is more than ambitious, and finally small businesses, with their lighter and more mobile structures have quite a few cards to play! In addition, the content/container compatibility calls upon a wide variety of scientific disciplines, so we obviously also need the support of academic laboratories. Among the CED members, there are some highly skilled researchers who can address appropriately, raised issues. Premium Beauty News - But there is also what you call ""the economic interest"" in a good content/container partnership? Dominique Bouvier - This economic interest should not be overlooked. Through a common market approach and therefore a joint offer, there are on top of it, possible economic gains in packaging operations. Premium Beauty News - The concept of sustainable development also generates new constraints? Dominique Bouvier - Yes, absolutely! And the issues concern material recyclability, biodegradability, waste disposal. The nature of materials changes with ""green"" materials ... Carbon labels to be placed on products in a near future (2011) will result in significant changes and these changes will need to be addressed in partnership between the two industries."
Kanebo Cosmetics accelerates its mature generation business,"On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Evita, its skincare brand dedicated to women in their fifties and over, Kanebo Cosmetics is launching the Deep Moisture line to further enhance the appeal of Evita, alongside the already available Moisture line, in a segment where skin hydration is a priority. When Kanebo launched Evita in 2000, post-war baby-boomers were advancing into their fifties. The new brand was designed for their need and explicitly claimed it, a premiere in Japan. Market's response was immediately positive. ""When Evita hit the scene, it instantly struck a chord among baby-boomer women,"" explains the company. By 2007, Evita's annual sales had overcome 10 billion yens (EUR 89 million). The skincare brand has become a best-seller in what Japanese call the self-selection market [1]. As of 2006, there were around 6.8 million former baby-boomers aged from 58 to 60 in Japan. These are the people who spent their teens and twenties in the era of Japan's rapid economic growth and have always taken the lead in the nation's consumption. According to Kanebo's market researchers: ""Women of this generation have been especially quick to catch on to trends and have taken on many new things. As consumers, their influence on the generations just below them is powerful. They are still prime movers of consumption in Japan and wield strong influence on the types of products that come to market."" Indeed, surveys of household expenditure in different age groups show that Japanese households headed by persons in their fifties spent more on cosmetics than any other household age segment. The creators of Evita say that key to the brand's success was a spot-on understanding of the cosmetic needs of fifty-and-over women. Chizuru Ishikawa, Manager of the Self Selection Brand Products Development Group at Kanebo Cosmetics, has been working with Evita since its release. ""When they hit fifty, women reach a turning point in lifestyle. They gain more leeway with time and money, and this brings more opportunities for leisure. They also think more about beauty care and take a renewed interest in sun care, fashion, lipstick, and other makeup items."" Furthermore, women in their fifties have different skin concerns than women in their thirties and forties. From the late forties through the fifties, troubles related to skin tone become more noticeable. From about fifty onwards, the skin tends to dry more easily. ""Dryness can become a big problem. The intensive moisturizing focus in Evita sets the brand apart from cosmetics made for younger skin,"" adds Chizuru Ishikawa. Kanebo Cosmetics is also carrying on investments in Chicca, its prestige make-up brand for fashion-conscious women in their late fifties and sixties, which was launched in 2008. On next February, the brand will release new colours for Spring 2011. Chicca, which proposes anti-ageing solutions through makeup effects, targets sophisticated, mature Japanese women, who want to stay attractive and feminine as they age. Kanebo Cosmetics has coined this generation the ""New Sixties."" Consistently, the brand benefits from the inspiration of a trendy makeup artist, Yasuo Yoshikawa, a Japanese born who's now based in New York, working with international fashion magazines, fashion brands and celebrities in the U.S. and Europe. ""Ever since its debut, Chicca has been winning over a steadily growing base of devoted users,"" says Kanebo Cosmetics."
Market survey - Samples get the unanimous votes from consumers!,"Premium Beauty News - What is interesting about the results of this survey [1] is the importance of samples for consumers that receive them along with a purchase or during a promotional campaign conducted by a brand! Ludovic Anceau - Obviously, it is quite reassuring for Socoplan and for our business. At least the results of this survey help set the record straight and this should encourage us to continue to put forward the fantastic medium represented by samples, which is not always taken into account by our customers' marketing teams. Thus, to the question ""How did you come to know a brand's product?"", over 51% of respondents answer ""Through a sample."" Over 71% of people state that ""it is with the help of a sample that they learned to appreciate for the first time a fragrance."" They are 68% in this case concerning a skincare or make-up product. Even better, not only have interviewed persons come to know the product through samples, but it is by far the method they prefer to test it (the tester is only appreciated by 26% of respondents and in-store demonstration is only appreciated by 16% of them!). Premium Beauty News - The success is the same for samples found inside magazines? Ludovic Anceau - The success is the same, indeed! 65% of consumers overwhelmingly applaud this promotion method to discover and appreciation a fragrance. The single advertising page only collects 13% of approvals and newspaper articles, 21%. This seems obvious, but a person who receives a sample will use it! 91% of them will use it straight away. And even better, 73% of them state that the sample led them to buy the product afterwards. Premium Beauty News - What types of samples are the most popular? Ludovic Anceau - It's an interesting point because opinions are very divided among consumers and sales staff, concerning this subject. The first prefer more sophisticated samples, while the latter are in favour of more simple samples like sachets. In both cases, anyway, people are always sorry to not have enough of them because samples not only help discover a product but are also a highly valued gift. By giving a sample, you also give a bonus to customer loyalty."
Nail polish: sticking to the needs of a market that is exploding,"Premium Beauty News - All indicators are ""green"" in your market? Pierre Miasnik - Yes quite true! We are really on an expanding market on which we are witnessing a real acceleration. In fact, it is the conjunction of several phenomena: The first one of them is of course, strong recovery, but it is mostly the second phenomenon which is much more interesting. A number of major brands specialised in cosmetics had neglected nail polish in recent years and had clearly lost market shares. They now realize that it's in fact a fantastic loss leader and that nail polish has truly become a powerhouse in the world of make-up. Colour has been brought back into fashion. And the price of the product has also remained affordable for the consumer. Premium Beauty News - Especially since, in parallel, you have made considerable progress on a technical level to improve the quality of nail polishes, their shades and their durability! Pierre Miasnik - Absolutely! This reflects Fiabila's commitment, for over thirty years, to develop the ""best"" products. And this with the entrepreneurial vision which has always been ours, where investments are the result of long term industrial strategies, not depending on financial investors with short term objectives in mind. We are now reaping the fruits of research works and new product developments for which we haven't stopped investing in recent years. This gave us a chance of filing many patents, especially concerning new materials and new polymers. And as we are big users of raw materials, it allows us to obtain top qualities. Premium Beauty News - In terms of industrial investments, concretely, what are your future plans? Pierre Miasnik - It is clear that our investments are focusing straight away on our French production plant and our U.S. site, without forgetting the completion of works begun in India, where we have been operating for more than 10 years. In France, this concerns both nail polish production and also the packaging facility. Did you know that this year, we have merely doubled our turnover in the United States. But we are also investing a lot in workforce. All our teams have been reinforced."
Luxe Pack Monaco bets on innovation and sustainable development,"Premium Beauty News - Luxe Pack created this year the Innovation Forum. What is it all about? Nathalie Grosdidier - For a long time we have always known that the show was a real springboard for innovative packaging. But we came to that conclusion, backed by figures from the last survey conducted among exhibitors: 62% of them save their new products to only launch them at Luxe Pack. This is a great finding that we had to put forward as much as possible. Hence this new forum which will bring together novel products and the opportunity for exhibitors to perform ""flash"" presentations. Premium Beauty News - Sustainable development was already a strong point this year at Luxe Pack New York. It will also be the case at Luxe Pack Monaco 2010! Nathalie Grosdidier - It is obvious that authorities and consumers are putting more and more pressure and environmental issues have become main subjects of concern for luxury brands. This is why we have put under the spotlight, at this 2010 edition, the responsibility of luxury companies and sustainable development. Luxe Pack Monaco is the ideal platform to debate and inspire a new vision of the luxury sector and of environmental issues. We therefore also decided to put forward this question: ""Luxury brands instigating eco-responsible behaviour?"" Prominent personalities representing luxury brands will give their points of view and share their thoughts and experience. This roundtable will be immediately followed by the presentation of the Luxe Pack in Green Award, in the presence of the members of the jury. Premium Beauty News - You are singling out exhibitors' eco-responsible solutions ! Nathalie Grosdidier - Yes, we support luxury brands in their quest for solutions integrating sustainable development criteria, by organizing the ""Luxe Pack in Green Awards"". The success of the event ""Luxe Pack in Green"", in 2009, has demonstrated the genuine interest of luxury brand owners looking for ways to reduce the environmental impact of their products. Luxe Pack Monaco is launching a new edition of this show and in parallel, this prize which will be awarded to exhibitors' best innovation, comprising one or more of sustainable development criteria, according to a charter defining selection criteria. The jury includes specialists in sustainable development among both, institutional players, luxury brands owners and media partners: Mr Michel Fontaine, President of the French packaging council; - Mr Alexandre Capelli, Sustainable Development Engineer, LVMH; Mrs Elizabeth Pastore-Reiss, Founding Director of the Ethicity sustainable development consulting firm; Mrs Catherine O'Meny Chief Editor and Founder of the website www.abc-luxe.com; Mr Stefano Lavorini Managing Director of the magazine Italia Imballaggio. They will award the Luxe Pack in Green 2010 trophy on Wednesday, Oct. 20, at 17:30. The latter is an original creation of Alnoor Design, a design agency which will be attending the Luxe Pack Monaco show and who designed it specially for the event. Premium Beauty News - Among other high points, we can also mention the work carried out by your ""Observatoire des Tendances (Trends Observer)! Nathalie Grosdidier - As you know, product launches of the year are decoded and analysed by members of the Observer. Signals, trend setting recurring details emerge from a structural movement: this is how major trends see the light. This work also relies on the analysis of social phenomena, the evolution of the individual and the transformation of its expectations. This identification of consumer expectations applied to packaging is a valuable basis to guide brand's development. Don't forget that members of the Observer are experts in packaging, design, communication and sociology. It will have this year, among participants such people as Béatrice Mariotti, Vice-President of Carré Noir; Véronique Liabeuf, Managing Director, Enjoy Design; Jean-Paul Cornillou, Head of the Packaging Section Strate, College; Isabelle Musnik, Content and Editorial Manager, Influencia and Guillaume Bregeras, Chief Editor, Formes de Luxe; and Eloïse Cohen, Deputy Chief Editor, Formes de Luxe. All these experts will be present to give us an account of their findings concerning new design trends found during an interactive workshop. Each trend will be presented by one of the experts and illustrated with new products in order to make their presentation even more pragmatic. Three trends were decrypted by our experts this year: Elixir, Malice, Comedia."
Natural cosmetics must do more to convince consumers,"According to Organic Monitor, the European market for natural and organic should expand by 12% in 2010. Although outpacing the total cosmetics market, growth is far below the 20% plus growth rates observed in previous years. These slowing market growth rates accompanied with an influx of new entrants are raising competitive stakes in Europe, says the market analysis company. So far, the natural beauty segment's healthy growth rates have attracted both emerging and mainstream international brands. As a result, competition steps up and retail shelf-space becomes crowded. In this context, competitively priced brands, in particular private labels, appear increasingly attractive. ""In Germany, private labels comprise about a third of all natural cosmetic sales,"" says Organic Monitor. The availability of low priced certified natural and organic cosmetics is changing the market. For instance, Alverde, the private label of DM drugstores, is emerging as the leading brand of natural cosmetics in Germany. Over 300 products are marketed under the Alverde brand, with many priced below 2 Euros. ""Consumers are attracted to the value prepositions offered by such brands - certified natural and organic products at low prices."" Similarly, most growth in the European market is coming from mainstream retailers, such as supermarkets, pharmacies and drugstores. Subsequently, some premium natural are organic brands are losing market share because of sluggish demand from organic food shops and beauty retailers The results of a recent report by Datamonitor [1], another market research firm, were also released this week and may be helpful to understand changing consumer behaviours. According to Datamonitor, more than half of consumers (52%) across the globe consider personal care products formulated with natural products as being better for them. This simple fact probably explains most of the impressive growth this segment recently experienced. However, the confidence in the safety remains accompanied by concerns over the efficacy of natural ingredients, also reveals the market research firm. ""Despite the growing concern over the ingredients used in personal care products, consumers were also found to be ambivalent over the efficacy of natural ingredients in personal care."" Actually, Datamonitor's survey suggest that marketers still have some way to go to convince consumers that natural ingredients are just as effective as synthetic ingredient. Only 37% of global consumers agreed with the statement that health and beauty products formulated with natural ingredients are equally as effective as non-natural products, whilst 44% neither agreed nor disagreed. Matthew Jones, consumer trends analyst at Datamonitor, comments: ""Shoppers will not be prepared to sacrifice performance benefits when it comes to personal care, particularly as many are actively seeking to minimise the time spent on personal hygiene/grooming. Price is also a factor, as consumer will find it difficult to justify any price premiums when there is doubt as to whether they will even see good results."""
European facial skincare market capitalizes on advances in science,"According to Mintel, the value of the facial skincare market in the five key European markets (France, Italy, Germany, UK and Spain) reached 6.1 billion euros in 2009 - up from 6 billion euros in 2008. France represents more than 36% of this market, with facial skincare sales reaching 2.2 billion euros in 2009. France is closely followed by Germany, where retail sales reaches 1.3 billion euros, and Italy with almost 1.2 billion euros. The UK ranks fourth with consumer spending amounting to over 1 billion euros (854 million pounds) in 2009. Eventually, Spain represents the lowest value with total retail sales of 371 million euros. The combined market value in these five countries is expected to grow even further to exceed 6.5 billion euros by 2013. ""Overall, the need to respond to a growing number of European women seeking to target signs of ageing has been at the heart of European product innovation and retail figures prove that it has been worth the investment,"" commented Nica Lewis, Head Consultant Mintel Beauty Innovation. Nearly two thirds (62%) of French women use anti-wrinkle products, Mintel reveals. ""However, wrinkles are not just an issue for French women. Italian women are not far behind, with 60% using anti-wrinkle products, followed by Spanish women (55%), the UK (51%) and Germany (49%),"" adds the market research firm. Fine lines and wrinkles are the top ageing concerns for women in all countries surveyed, with French and Spanish women (63%) coming top, compared to UK (62%) and Italy (59%). This compares to under half (47%) of German women who said that they were concerned with these aspects. However, although lines and wrinkles remain the biggest concern when it comes to ageing, many other aspects trouble European women. For instance, almost half of British (49%), Spanish (47%) and French (46%) women are concerned about dark under-eye circles and sunken eyes. Sagging skin worries up to 43% of German women and stretch marks upset 45% of Italian women. France and Italy have been the most active countries in Europe in product launches in the face and neck sub-category, accounting for 81% each, followed by Germany and UK with 78%, and Spain with 68% in 2009. In contrast, Spain led the way in the lip care sub-category, accounting for 25% of new product developments in the facial skincare sector, compared to Germany and UK with 12%, France with 9% and Italy with 7%. Furthermore, according to Mintel, the consumer's interest in facial skincare products is leading to new product developments with more and more scientific claims, including stem cell technology, ever-lengthening peptide chains, sirtuins and DNA repair. ""As we have previously predicted in our beauty trends, cosmetic science continues to capitalise on advances in biochemistry and medicine. This trend for Turbo Beauty features more quasi-medical results and 'mix-it-yourself' solutions, such as at-home kits, cures and gadgets. In anti-ageing launches in 2010 there has been emphasis on gadgets and glycation,"" Nica Lewis concludes."
Japanese companies invest in anti-ageing innovations,"The crisis hit Japan hard, with sales of beauty products dropping by -8.1% in 2009 in value, but only -0.5% in volume, revealing consumers' growing sensitivity to prices. The trend to favour lower-priced items of the same quality continued during the first half of 2010, with sales increasing by +1.32% in volume but continuing to decline by -1.6% in value. However, a closer look to figures reveals that high-priced luxury items, in particularly anti-ageing creams performed well. Kanebo's prestige skincare line Impress, for example, saw double-digit growth in 2009. Indeed, it seems that in Japan's matured market, with a rapidly ageing population, consumers remain focused on high-quality and innovative products but are looking for more value. Actually, the shift to lower-priced products mainly affects mid-range items, while high-quality products or breaking innovations are less affected. Despite the economy, cosmetics companies have therefore impressively increased the pace of new product launches. The number of skincare products launched in Japan with an anti-ageing claim increased by a staggering 85% from 2007 to 2009, compared to a 27% increase in the US during the same time period, Mintel Beauty Innovation reveals. ""East Asia and Japan, specifically, have always been at the forefront of beauty innovation,"" notes Hinako Sugioka, Mintel Beauty Innovation senior consultant. ""The steady increase in Japan's longevity, traditional eating habits and long history of whitening beauty are just a few of the reasons this region continues to excel in the personal care industry."" These launches include traditional skin care products but also anti-ageing food or beverages. For instance, Kanebo's Collagen Deep In, a beauty beverage formulated to enhance skin moisture and firmness and targeting women in their thirties, was launched on May 1, 2009 and reached initial annual sales forecasts within six months only. In this context, Kanebo is launching on November 19 in the domestic market and across Asia of Granmula, a premium priced skincare declination of its Impress line, with items that start at 20,000 yens (178.59 euros) and rise very quickly to 120,000 yens (1,071.56 euros). Through this launch, Kanebo aims at reinforcing its global prestige strategy with a strong emphasis in Asia and China."
Cosmetic brushes: the revival!,"This product, which was reserved until now to make-up professionals, is becoming attractive to an increasing number of consumers. Large retail chains of make-up products have contributed to its success by offering with their cosmetics, attractive kits consisting of several brushes. The result is a booming market with double digits annual growth rates. A niche which has attracted the attention of managers of the DuPont [1], group historically specialized in the production of fibres for toothbrushes and leader in the niche of mascara fibres. A ""niche"" where animal hair, still predominantly used, is probably seeing its days numbered. A ""niche"" for which DuPont has been marketing since a few months a highly technical and specially performing fibre,Natrafi. But actually? Do women use and appreciate the use a cosmetic brush? Every survey answers ""yes""! Even if their perception of the product is often far from reality. For 86% of them, the brush must of course become impregnated with powder to then perfectly restore it during application. For 46% of them bristles should be soft and 37% believe the brush should obviously not lose them. 67% think that brushes are currently made out of synthetic bristles and only 19% think they are made out of animal hair. More interestingly, European consumers say they would not use a brush if it was made out of animal hair! When 95% of powder brushes manufactured in the world are made, precisely of animal hair! ""Actually, explains Sarah Perreard, DuPont, this market was demanding a new fibre that, to paraphrase a well known ad would have the feel and performance of animal hair without coming from the animal industry... and who would not smell like it!"" An even more tenacious ""smell"" when brushes are made from goat hair (which is the majority!) or from pony hair. Especially that 87% of consumers believe that this practice is cruel to animals! In 2003, DuPont teams decide to seriously address this issue. The challenge is far from being simple. It consists in developing a fibre featuring all the qualities of goat or pony hair, that is to say which really becomes well impregnated of powder and perfectly restores it. Not easy when you operate a microscopic analysis of goat hair and you understand why powder clings to it so well. Conversely, synthetic fibre is at least very smooth. ""That's why the design of Natrafil is so clever,"" explains Sarah Perreard, ""because our engineers have recreated some roughness in this polyester fibre with the addition of various additives and a fibre extraction process which structures and softens the tips. A complex and patented process."" Incidentally, they did not know that by developing Natrafil, they were at the same time going to help future brushes, partly or totally consisting of this fibre, make a giant leap. ""It was a pleasant surprise. Tests conducted among make-up artists exceeded our expectations. They all admitted that brushes made from 100% Natrafil impregnated themselves and restored powder much better, applying formulas in a more uniform manner with increasing precision compared to traditional brushes made from animal hair. As for brushes containing different percentages of Natrafil fibres, they enabled adjusting the desired make-up performance according to formula or the use of the brush, be it to apply the exact quantity of required powder, to attenuate, to blend in, etc."" Note that Natrafil is also very effective for applying liquid make-up in the case, for example of body painting. ""Key assets of our fibre are: consistent quality complying with specifications, stable supplies not being subject to fluctuations from the animal hair market, and finally a better perception from consumers as well as a guaranteed hygiene,"" underlines Sarah Perreard. As a result, the DuPont Group, which currently produces the fibre in the United States and ships it to Shenzen in China for its processing, has recently invested in a second production line precisely in China. ""It is true that 90% of brushes manufactured in the world are manufactured in this region,"" explains Sarah Perreard, ""and they are almost entirely handmade!"" Another advantage in favour of the use of a synthetic fibre is to automate production more easily... To be continued."
"Alain Chevassus, Cosfibel: ""recovery is taking shape""","Specializing in the industrial production of transparent packaging and also of sourcing in Asia and North Africa in the field of accessories and promotional packaging but also make-up packaging, the Cosfibel group this year will reach 60 million Euros turnover for a workforce of 200 people. ""Fortunately, we made a number of choices in the past who turned out to be the right ones today,"" explains Alain Chevassus. ""On the one hand the development of a genuine expertise in the design of often sophisticated luxury boxes (an area where we've quintupled our business in five years). On the other hand, the diversification of our supply sources to avoid the 'all Asia' supply and to anticipate our customers choices (which is why we now have good operating bases in North Africa, especially Tunisia, where we will probably sign a joint venture soon). Finally, our customers recognition of our creative capacity and our technical and logistic expertise in the field of cosmetic packaging (the latest example to date being the complete line that we designed for Burberry). Not to mention the relevance of our industrial tool in terms of transparent packaging which allows us to develop our business very efficiently in alcoholic beverages. I must add that for this beverage sector, we will also offer injected boxes."" An appropriate decision, in any case, considering the fact that the Group has recently decided to set up a team directly in Scotland, the homeland if any, of Whisky. ""This new office is in line with our so called 'customer oriented' strategy through the development of the Urban Network® where we position ourselves geographically close to our customers which enables us to take the best decision possible by using all the Group's resources in terms of creation, production and logistics."""
Makeup in Paris in june 2011 at the Carrousel du Louvre,"Premium Beauty News - So MakeUp in Paris in 2011 will take place at the Carrousel du Louvre. For those who are not familiar with this location where is it exactly? Sandra Maguarian - Indeed, MakeUp in Paris in 2011 will take place at the Carrousel du Louvre from June 23 to June 24 next year. The whole world knows the Louvre; it is one of the most visited museums in the world. In 1990 an extension was built by the architect Leoh Ming Pei hosting an exhibition area, fashion shows and a shopping mall. The Carrousel du Louvre is located near the Place de la Concorde, just after the Tuileries Gardens. Premium Beauty News - Why such a choice? Sandra Maguarian - It is in Paris one of the latest, most modern and most functional exhibition area and personally, I consider it as the most beautiful! It is very well served by public transports, it is located in the golden Triangle of Paris which represents two major advantages for exhibitors and visitors. It is a place steeped in history where hopefully in turn, make-up will write its own. Moreover, while keeping in mind the desire of make-up professionals to come together in a friendly and human-scale atmosphere, the organization of this second edition of MakeUp in Paris required a larger space, allowing us to host more exhibitors and provide more space for animations and in particular conferences. Finally, the flexibility offered by spaces at the Carrousel du Louvre gives us the opportunity to secure future dates for MakeUp in Paris, since we are already booked on the calendar of events for June 2012. Premium Beauty News - Nearly all exhibitors from the 2010 edition have reregistered, and you've already received requests from new companies wanting to participate. What explains this keen interest? Sandra Maguarian - Yes you are right, almost 95% of exhibitors have reregistered. Such an early renewal rate is an increasingly rare phenomenon noticed by trade show organizers. Companies' reregistrations put aside, it is to be noted that 20% of them do it by doubling their exhibition space. As for new comers, the majority of them were companies who had strategically wanted to visit the first edition of MakeUp in Paris to make up their mind. It seems that they had a fruitful visit! This craze is the result of an event created in a highly professional manner, targeted, qualified. We have done our best to assist exhibitors in the organization of their participation and have worked very hard to attract the visitors they were expecting. The first edition of MakeUp in Paris, we believe was a total success. Premium Beauty News - Can we go back over the statistics of 2010, what are the main lessons? Sandra Maguarian - 1404 visitors attended the show. And more strikingly, 800 visitors coming from brands were present in June. Exhibitors have expressed it during the event and results of the analysis on visitorship have proved it, marketing and R & D managers were the most numerous. This means that the number of targeted visitors was the one expected. Above all, the surprise came from the fact we didn't expect as many international visitors coming from no less than 26 countries, from the U.S. to Vietnam including South Africa. Premium Beauty News - Make-up animations were one of the highlights of this first edition. One can imagine it will still be the same next year. Sandra Maguarian - Yes without a doubt. I can even tell you that some of them will surprise you! The Carrousel du Louvre offers us the possibility to organize animations in better conditions, sometimes on a larger scale to allow maximum participation and visibility. For the time being, I can't lift the veil on these animations, but I will keep you informed as soon as possible."
Kanebo Cosmetics to strengthen its presence on overseas markets,"Like other Japan's leading cosmetics makers, - such as Shiseido or Pola - Kanebo Cosmetics, belonging to the Kao group since 2006, has resolutely entered into a strategy of international development. Currently, Kanebo achieves 90% of its turnover in Japan and only 10% abroad. ""Our first objective is to reach 15% as quickly as possible"", explains Shinji Yamada, Director of the international PR Department of the Group. Confronted to a domestic market, which for the past eight years, has turned out to be totally lifeless, Japanese giants of the cosmetic industry have engaged themselves in massive international investments. And needless to say it was about time. In fact, although they still use a lot of cosmetics, baby boomers which were a true goldmine to the Japanese industry have reached 60 years of age and since 2005, population has started declining. Even worse, consumption of cosmetics, which was known for its stability, has also shown, some signs of slowing down. From this point of view, with a drop in sales of 8.1% 2009 was an unprecedented year. Even if the situation has partially improved in the first half of 2010, with a volume increase of 1.32%, the market has continued to decline in value (-1.6% according to the Ministry of Economy). Nonetheless, competition is not weakening on the Japanese market itself, quite the contrary. On the one hand, for Japanese companies looking for diversification, barriers to entry are low and many big players have recently set foot in the cosmetic market. These last years, the cosmetic offer has come from cosmetic players as unexpected as Fuji Films, with the Astalift brand or Ajinomoto, the food giant, and even Suntory, the famous Japanese beer maker, on the cosmetic food segment. On the other hand, the lack of dynamism of the Japanese market does not deter international brands who, given their low penetration rates, can rely on significant growth margins and are still eager to take their share of what remains the second global market. For Kanebo, the first step consisted in streamlining its brand portfolio to focus its resources on lines with a stronger international potential and explore new expanding growth markets. From about sixty in 2004, Kanebo has reduced its portfolio to currently twenty lines, while new products were launched, especially in cosmetic food, or on the 60-something age segment with Chicca. With the goal of becoming a real global player, Kanebo has segmented its international strategy in three levels: China, Asia and Europe-USA. China is clearly the Group's first priority which is carrying out in the country a large scale specific strategy based on six brands distributed through two channels: department stores (Lunasol, Impress, Coffret d'Or, and Aqua Sprina) and high-end drugstores and pharmacies (Free Plus and Kate). Regarding the rest of Asia, excluding Japan, of course, Kanebo is focusing on a dozen countries, with a strategy hinged on its premium brands (Lunasol, Blanchir Superior, Impress, Coffret d'Or) and on department stores, and targeting as a priority markets such as Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, where this segment is experiencing the fastest growth (10% on average over the past three years, against 4.4% on average for Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea). For Europe and the United States, the Group's strategy remains centred on Sensaï, its ""super prestige"" brand, distributed in department stores, selective perfumeries and in spas of some hotels since the opening in December 2009 of the first Sensaï Select Spa at the Victoria-Jungfrau Grand Hotel of Interlaken in Switzerland. Kate, Japan's leading make-up brand in the self-service beauty segment, debuted this month in Shanghai and Beijing. The brand is being launched at drugstores, starting with Watsons, Asia's leading health and beauty retailer. The number of sales outlets is expected to grow from 20 stores in the first month to 50 stores by the end of 2010, and 100 by the end of 2011. Kate mainly aims at young Chinese women born after 1980, a population that is reputed to highly appreciate Japanese trends in fashion and cosmetics. However, as self-service still has not taken root for beauty products in China, Kanebo has decided to provide Chinese consumers with the advices of beauty consultants in sales corners installed in the selected drugstores. Globalisation sometime means adaptation!"
HBA is a unique opportunity for product development in the cosmetics industry,"Premium Beauty News - What are the prospects for this new edition of HBA? Jill Birkett - We are excited about the 2010 HBA event. We feel that we have captured much of the education and networking needed to help our audience during these still challenging business times. With the changes in distribution, in markets, in retail, HBA has developed a strong conference program and networking series of events to allow the beauty and personal care industries to mingle, meet, talk and do business together. There are over 150 new exhibiting companies in HBA this year, including new raw materials and packaging suppliers, lab equipment, private label and natural ingredients companies from across the world and the USA. We are on track to meet or exceed our plans to register 16,000 attendees for HBA this September. Premium Beauty News - What is the proportion of U.S. and overseas exhibitors? Jill Birkett - Exhibitors are attending from many countries outside of the U.S., including Mexico, France, Benin, Poland, China, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Austria, Switzerland, Argentina, Germany, Singapore, Canada, Italy, Turkey, the U.A.E., Israel, Taiwan, Spain, Columbia, the U.K., Korea, India and others. Approximately one third of the HBA exhibitors come from outside the US, and more and more are responding to HBA's business platform of bringing the entire beauty and personal care product development community together for three days in New York City, the beauty capital of the world. Premium Beauty News - HBA has remained the first American trade show of the beauty sector, nevertheless it has had to put up with fierce competition. In this competitive context what is your vision of the future? Jill Birkett - As you know, beauty and personal care is not only a global business, but a very large business. This is fortunate for all of us who seek to serve these market segments! At HBA, we have focused on providing a quality event with an outstanding education program, as well as additional activities to provide interest, fun and education to our visitor base. We continue to build HBA as ""the place to be to do business"". The USA has been the largest market in the world for many years. Even as other global markets grow, the large base of beauty company headquarters and innovative start-up entrepreneurs means New York particularly is a great place to do business. So many visitors and exhibitors come to the city during and after HBA that many of them stay up to 10 days to have follow-up appointments after the show. Additionally, we once again co-located with the Spa & Resort Expo, which is a regional event for Spa Owners and Managers. Last year, over 600 HBA visitors thanked us for co-locating the events to provide them a better ""one stop"" business opportunity. We expect to continue to build on that vision. Premium Beauty News - What do you think of the opening, in a few weeks, of the new Intercharm show in Milan? Jill Birkett - Here in the USA, we have not heard too much about it from our customers. We are extremely focused, as you can imagine, on preparing for HBA and making it the best product development event for the beauty and personal care industry. Product Development is our business-orientation and it provides a unique opportunity for HBA. Many other events are focused on different segments of the market. The European community will decide if Intercharm is a good business opportunity for them, I imagine. Premium Beauty News - What is your point of view on the fact that the beauty sector's centre of gravity is shifting more and more towards Asia. Not only in terms of growth but also industrially speaking? Jill Birkett - This is not surprising given the world's overall population and shifting demographics. It's actually very exciting, and I'd like to say that Latin America is very much a part of that exciting growth. This actually provides opportunity for innovative manufacturers: new packaging needs to meet a different demographic, new labelling to meet new markets' regulations, new products to meet the needs of a different type of consumer. I believe forward-thinking firms will organize their business to participate in growing markets for the long term. We provide education, such as our Global Perspectives Conference, to help the industry stay ahead of the changes."
Fashion and beauty intertwined at InterCharm Milano,"InterCharm Milano, the new Italian exhibition entirely dedicated to beauty that will open its doors from 18th to 20th September at Fieramilanocity, will also host a fashion show, with the aim to bring together top and emerging talent from the world of make-up, hair styling and fashion, in collaboration with Vogue Italia.

Named ""BE fashion BE beauty"", the fashion show will be held on Monday 20th September to end the first edition of InterCharm Milano. This special event will feature 30 models on the runway."
Luxe Pack Monaco puts the light on innovation,"For its 2010 edition, Luxe Pack Monaco will focus on innovation. A ""forum of innovation"" will unveil the latest developments in packaging solutions from the exhibitors of the global event dedicated to luxury packaging, which will take place from 20-22 October at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. ""Exhibitors often choose to display their newly released products exclusively at the Luxe Pack Monaco trade fair, aiming to illustrate their creativity and expressing their support for this leading trade fair through their active participation,"" say the organisers. The ""Luxe Pack Innovation Forum"" will allow all participants to get a complete and rapid overview of the latest packaging developments. The forum will consist in scheduled presentations, not exceeding 15 to 20 minutes each and allowing exhibitors to unveil their new products and innovative solutions, which may at times feature the use of highly specialised technology. These sessions will take place throughout the 3-day event in a specially allocated space, according to a schedule that shall be published on the Luxe Pack Monaco website starting September. Innovations linked to sustainable development targets will also be displayed in a specific show-room: Luxe Pack in Green.

MakeUp in Paris fulfils its target,"As far as attendance is concerned, MakeUp in Paris scored beyond its organizers' expectations: 1404 visitors thave walked down the aisles of the first edition of this event entirely dedicated to te make-up industry, which was held last June 24 and 25, at the Espace Pierre Cardin, in the beating heart of downtown Paris. ""It's a fine score, actually exceeding our expectations. If there was a large number of visitors, there was also and above all, quality. We were certainly expecting a high level of attendance because the number of people who had pre-registered (1200) was a hint of an even higher number of visitors. But reality turned out to be even better with above all, a good quality of visitorship, a fact which was confirmed by exhibitors themselves"", explains Sandra Maguarian, Show Manager to the event organized by Beauteam. Two weeks after the event, the analysis of visitors' registration data showed that the MakeUp in Paris concept appealed to decision makers. There was a massive number of brands with over 800 visitors, including a significant number of foreign visitors! And that was a bit of a surprise for the MakeUp in Paris team. Indeed, 14% of overseas visitors made the trip to attend the event, which can be considered an excellent performance for a first edition. Among top countries, all categories considered, Italy comes first followed by England, Belgium, and then Germany. But there were also visitors from Canada, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Poland, Romania, Japan, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, United States and even Vietnam ... Overall 26 countries were represented! The goal to attract marketing teams and development managers was also reached. After analysis by categories of visitors, the first position to emerge among decision-makers is: marketing with nearly 500 people. Then follow R & D, Purchasing, Sales, Communication ... The date are apparently confirmed by the first feedbacks from exhibitors. ""The visitors were of high quality and were seeking for solutions and innovations, and they found a human-sized event allowing to point out relevant issues,"" said Eric Fresnel, President of Sleever International. From the exhibitors' side, satisfaction seems general too. The broad feeling of exhibitors and visitors collected here and there can be summarized as follows: ""An event on a human scale ... very friendly ... very professional!"". ""It was intimate, fun, and a much needed fresh approach to our industry. The quality and number of visitors was impressive. I am looking forward to the next edition with even more animation events,"" commented Romayne Apcar, CEO of HCT France: Actually, the HCT Group was one of the first companies to officially commit way back in October of last year. ""I was inspired to support this venture from the outset. MakeUp in Paris is worlds apart from other industry events. Its' specific focus on makeup attracted a select and intimate audience, and exposed us to a completely new group of potential customers,"" added James Thorpe, Managing Director of HCT Europe. According to the organizers, all exhibitors already requested to book their stand space for next year's event, some of them on a larger perimeter, and several other companies already want to register for their first time. Videos of the event are available on YouTube and some photos on Flickr."
The Nordic market of natural cosmetics attracts foreign brands,"According to a new research by Organic Monitor, few Nordic companies would be interested in natural and organic cosmetic products although the regional market is expanding by about 15% a year. ""Organic foods are well-established in the Nordic region, with the market share reaching 5% of total food sales in Sweden and Denmark. However, natural and organic cosmetics have much lower adoption rates with below 2% market share,"" explains Organic Monitor. According to the market research company a major factor behind this low interest is the success of the Nordic Swan eco-labelling system. Perceived as the official eco-label of the region, the Nordic Swan is present on a wide range of cosmetics and toiletries. With Nordic companies focusing on the Nordic Swan eco-label, consumers are turning to imported brands from North America, Australasia or other European countries when seeking 'chemically-clean' cosmetics. As a consequence, imported brands comprise up to 95% of natural cosmetic sales in countries such as Finland, claims Organic Monitor. ""A growing number of companies are adopting a segmentation approach to market entry, targeting specific channels and / or consumer groups. For instance, the UK firm REN Skincare has made inroads by focusing on beauty retailers and department stores. Aveda, the leading American brand, is concentrating on hair salons and spas,"" says Organic Monitor. According to Organic Monitor's report The Nordic market for natural & organic personal care products, healthy market growth rates are forecast to continue, with growth driven by new product launches and increasing distribution. As has happened in other European countries such as France and Germany, retailer private labels are expected to have a major impact in the development of the market. Marketing and distribution strategies in the natural cosmetics industry will also be discussed at the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit that Organic Monitor is organising in Paris on 18-20 October 2010."
US colour cosmetics market boosted by eye makeup sales,"The dynamism of eye makeup sales in the US sharply contrasts with the dull growth enjoyed by other categories of colour cosmetics. According to market research firm Mintel, since 2004, eye makeup sales have increased 38%, compared to just an 11% increase in the colour cosmetics market overall. Mintel questioned women about their make-up habits and found that mascara was the most dynamic product among colour cosmetics as 65% of respondents report using it. However, eye shadow and eyeliner aren't far behind: 63% of women surveyed use shadow and 62% use liner. ""Retailers' offerings seem to be working, as women report using mascara almost five times a week,"" says Kat Fay, senior beauty analyst at Mintel. ""The focus is now on more dramatic eyes,"" he adds. Brow pencils are somewhat less popular, but still enjoy solid market penetration with 38% of women reporting usage. Lipstick and lip gloss remain the most popular colour cosmetic products, achieving the highest penetration rates with 76% of survey respondents. Women report using lipstick and lip gloss six times a week, suggesting that these products are a daily staple. ""Incidence of lipstick or lip gloss usage increases with age,"" says Kat Fay. ""As women get older, lip colour is a relatively easy way to brighten up the face without having to put on a face full of makeup."" Other lip make-up products lag far behind as some 22% of respondents say they use a lip pencil, 9% use a lip stain and just 7% use a compact lip colour. While four out of five women surveyed by Mintel report using makeup, only 31% state that their makeup buying behaviour hasn't changed as a result of the economy. Other analyses point out the shift towards less expensive segments. Kat Fay suggests retailers highlight innovative ingredients in their products or utilise environment-friendly packaging to attract consumers and jumpstart the stalling beauty market."
Beautystreams puts beauty trends online,"There was hardly any online service to analyse trends in the beauty and cosmetics industry. Beautystreams intends to fills this gap. For its launch, the agency already offers access to a database of over 100,000 photographs, hundreds royalty free vector prints, and a solid global network of employees, partners and correspondents. The fledgling company based in Paris and New York aims at quickly attracting customers in the beauty industry, mainly the marketers of make-up, skin care and hair products. ""What do we offer? High-level analysis and forecasts of trends, by experienced professionals, maximizing the practical benefits of a multimedia online service,"" says Lan Vu, founder and CEO of Beautystreams. This former employee of Style Sight wants to bring the analysis of cosmetic trends into the digital age. ""Internet allows us to broadcast multimedia data that can be used immediately by our customers. Photos and videos can then be reused easily within client companies, as prints that are sold royalty free."" The core of the service is formed by the trends forecasts that are delivered two times a year, one for each season (autumn-winter spring-summer). Most of the illustrations in the forecasts section are based on photographs from Beautystreams' team members and correspondents. According to Lan Vu, this strategy avoids any kind of dependency on, sometimes outdated, databases that may provide videos already seen by thousands of people and it also offers subscribers the possibility of using images with HD quality. Just like Lan Vu, who totalizes a 20 year professional background in forecasting trends, or Bengt Jacobsson, a renown forecaster, member of thePremière Vision's Color Committee and a former employee of Carlin, all forecasters working for Beautystreams have strong professional paths. Beautystreams and its forecasters do not hesitate either to come across information in a variety of sectors, or from the most unexpected experts, that are interviewed every week to share their thoughts on trends in their area of excellence. A chef, a dermatologist, an architect and artists have already delivered their testimony. Once a month, a theme is analyzed through the focus of different industries. On the occasion of Beautystreams' launch, water was thus the subject of detailed investigations in areas such as architecture, design, decoration, textile, fashion & beauty. Of course, Beautystreams' offer is not limited to the analysis of these macro-trends or to seasonal forecasts. The company also proposes to enter into concrete stuff by studying how its forecasts can be embodied in different phenotypes (skin or hair colour...). Beautystreams already provides access to a database of more 75,000 photos from fashion shows and cropped on faces and hairstyles. Finally, Beautystreams' staffs also travel the aisles of beauty tradeshows around the world where they try to hunt out the most innovative developments, or the most representative of the main product trends. The introductory offer for an annual subscription is 10,000 USD for 10 logins."
Professional skin care products: results matter!,"After several years of strong growth, the global market for professional skin care products showed signs of fatigue in 2009. While Europe and the United States posted substantial declines, the exception to this trend came from the BRIC [1] markets spearheaded by Brazil, which posted growth of 11.1%, according to recently released study Professional Skin Care 2009 Global Series: Market Analysis and Opportunities from consulting and research firm Kline & Company. The report focuses on product categories and brands sold in professional outlets such as spas and salons, dermatologists' and plastic surgeons' offices, and beauty institutes. It also captures sales for professional brands through traditional retail outlets. ""The recession's impact in Europe and the United States resulted in a change in spending patterns, a decline in the frequency of visits to spas and physician's offices, and a shift to lower-priced brands,"" notes Karen Doskow, Industry Manager at Kline. ""But even in the face of a gloomy economy, industry leaders fought back with a healthy flow of new product launches, many of which targeted the anti-aging segment."" ""Professional skin care marketers acknowledged the need to diversify, segment, and innovate their offerings in order to cater to a change in demand for the products that are preventative or that are proven to help reverse signs of ageing,"" Ms Doskow further explains. ""Products that were unique, multi-tasking, or offering dual benefits certainly stood out for the recession-stricken consumer."" According to Kline, marketers of professional skin care products must capitalize on the latest scientific findings and innovations in ingredient research that help their products, to some extent, compare to results of cosmetic treatments performed by medical professionals. ""As consumers extend the time between in-office procedures, new products completing or replacing cosmetic procedures will grow in importance."" Products such as Babor's Skinovage Nanocell Age Protective Cream Serum, Germaine de Capuccini's Time Lift Timexpert Rides X or Skinceuticals' Retexturing Activator are examples of professional skin care products competing with in-office treatments. Anti-ageing products account for 41.1% in the United States and nearly 50% of sales in Europe and Brazil, says the report. Responding to consumer needs, the dynamism of each product category varies on a worldwide basis; skin whitening is a number one concern for marketers in China and Japan, and anti-cellulite treatments are a top priority in Europe or Brazil. Regional diversity also occurs in channel sales. In Brazil, the spas channel posted a whopping 86.2% gain. In Europe and the United States, the medical care providers channel enjoyed the highest growth. The direct sales channel in the U.S. professional market posted an incredible 10% increase, making it a top trend for the year. In this channel, marketers took charge of building relationships directly with customers through podcasts, and YouTube clips. Incorporating social media outlets into their marketing strategy has become standard practice in recent years. This, in turn, is quickly becoming a dominant way to reinforce brand imaging and promote new products. According to Kline's FutureView forecasting model, brighter days are ahead for this industry. As an example, the professional skin care market for the United States is predicted to grow by a CAGR [2] of 5.6% through 2014, or if exceptional conditions prevail, the market could grow as high as 11.3% a year."
"MakeUp in Paris, a successful first edition","According to the organizers, the first edition of MakeUp in Paris ended a very positive outlook. ""We recorded 1,400 visitors, well beyond our goal and our forecasts,"" says Sandra Maguarian, the show manager. ""At first glance, the visitors that we targeted have been there, about 60% of visitors belonged to the marketing, development and purchasing departments of cosmetic brands, all distribution channels combined!"" Despite untimely air conditioning difficulties that have greatly increase the inner temperature on the first day, the vast majority of exhibitors were glad of their participation in this first edition. ""All of them are ready to go ahead with us on a new adventure next year,"" said Jean-Yves Bourgeois, who manage the sale of exhibition surfaces. ""And we already record several new applications.""

MakeUp in Paris announces two days of festivities,"""It was necessary to reinforce the link between a profession and its market, giving it an opportunity to show the extent of its talent in serving brands with the help of professionals who stage these wonderful products which are an expression of a beautiful and attractive society,"" says Sandra Maguarian, show manager of MakeUp in Paris. It is precisely this alchemy that the Beauteam [1] team wanted to implement. We were not disappointed, far from it. Even a little dazzled sometimes by the enthusiasm of manufacturers, make-up artists, make-up schools and their talented students. MakeUp in Paris in 2010 is also a new form of professional events still more focused, friendlier. All components in the beauty industry will be represented. Be it with formulas, packaging, accessories, design, make-up professionals... ""MakeUp in Paris 2010 has already brought together the energies to make of this very first edition, the first one in a very long series!"" claim the organiser."

Premium Beauty News - How did you address the latest economic crisis? Javier González - Cosnova recorded healthy growth rates and navigated through the crisis very well because of its focus on the low-price segment. In Germany and northern European countries consumers have not been too sensitive to the crisis. Consumption has continued normally or almost normally. In the southern Europe, where the overall consumption was more strongly impacted, Cosnova benefited from the crisis. Actually, women do not see colour cosmetics as a luxury category, but as a primary need, and they will not use less cosmetics because of an economic crisis but clearly they will definitely try to save money and try to find better value. Cosnova is at the crossroads of this process. For us the crisis is more a friend than a foe! Premium Beauty News - What about product innovation? Javier González - Cosnova is characterised by an enormous creativity. One thing that makes us so unique is our huge volume of new products. Every year Cosnova is able to launch 1,000 new products and colours. Among our latest and most remarkable innovations are the ""Essence Blackmania"" eyeliner, which contains carbon black pigments and which were launched very successfully in 2009 and voted to ""Product of the year 2010"", or the ""Essence Colour & Shine"" eyeshadow, which features an innovative application device and special pigment effects. That is outstanding in the mass market, and Cosnova is one of the first brands to have such a product on shelf. Also mentionable is the ""Essence Nail Art"" which represents an extensive range of nail styling and nail art products especially for the young consumers. With ""Nail Art"" it is really easy to make your own nice nail styling at home. Because the ""Nail Art"" launch was so successful, the range was widened at the beginning of 2010. Another new and innovative product sub-range is the ""essence Pocket Beauty"", which features very convenient beauty products to carry in handbags. As far as our Catrice brand is concerned, let's mention the state of the art nail polish, which combines long lasting effect with extreme shine, and which is available in over 30 shades. Let's also mention the ""Maximum Resist"" Mascara that offers full volume and long lasting characteristics. Within 12 months, new colours, new packaging and new formulas will replace half of the standard range. Each year, Cosnova launches 30 theme-orientated, limited editions - 18 for essence and 12 for Catrice. Premium Beauty News - What were Cosnova's latest investments and developments relating to technology or manufacturing process? Javier González - Despite the crisis we have maintained high investment rates. Considering our high growth rate, we absolutely need to invest continuously. Two years ago, in just six months, Cosnova implemented SAP. Furthermore, considering that consumer prices for Essence products are about 2.00 euros and 3.50 euros for Catrice products, Cosnova has no other choice than to keep all processes extremely focused and efficient. Additionally, Cosnova has invested in new displays - the so-called beauty-shops. 6,000 to 7,000 older displays had been already replaced in shops in Germany and Switzerland at the beginning of 2010. We observed immediately a significant increase in product sales. The last point to mention is our flagship store. Cosnova has established its first retail shop in Offenbach. It is an experiment because we're not in the retail business, but we'll definitely learn much about our own retail potential and the shop represents a very good platform to sell other products than cosmetics, for example jewellery, hair accessories, sunglasses, scarves and so on. We want to know if there a potential for a move of Essence outside cosmetics market into a wider world of beauty to offer the consumers the whole beauty package. Premium Beauty News - Internationally, Cosnova is concentrating its expansion in Middle East, Africa and the USA. Javier González - The positioning of Cosnova in these areas is exactly the same as in Germany. Cosnova has founded and established a company in the US, Cosnova Inc., two years ago. It was definitely the right decision to expand in the middle of the crisis that hit the consumption especially hard. Our corporate philosophy to offer always high quality and up-to-date products at exceptional prices is paying off. The average price of Essence products in the US is about 2 dollars (excluding sales taxes). One year ago Cosnova has successfully started to work with Clicks, a strong retailer in South Africa. South African consumers consist also in an economically very strong and growing middle class of black people. In regard to different pigmentation, colours and textures, Cosnova has developed and launched specific products for the South African market. Actually, we did the same for the US market, where there are various ethnic groups with a wide array of different skin types. Premium Beauty News - What are you expectations for 2011? Javier González - In 2010 Cosnova will cross the 100 million euro line in net sales for the first time and we expect a very strong and healthy double-digit growth rate this year as well as next year."
Global luxury goods market to recover in the short term,"According to a new report [1] by market research firm Global Industry Analysts (GIA), the global luxury goods market should recover poise and gain steady momentum in the short to medium term to reach US$307.3 billion by 2015. The luxury watches market represents the largest segment within the luxury goods market, having contributed a share of about 17% in the total dollar sales, while luxury cosmetics market is projected to be the fastest growing segment over the analysis period 2007-2015. Europe will continue to retain its leadership as a producer and exporter of luxury goods, helped by the advantage of a weaker euro and its influence on luxury goods purchases and increased tourism. ""With its high correlation to a country's GDP, the luxury goods industry is extremely cyclical in nature, with economic ups and downs amplifying the response demand patterns. For instance, in periods of economic boom demand waxes higher than the growth in GDP, while conversely in periods of slowdown, demand recedes rapidly as consumers quickly axe their spending on high-priced luxury goods,"" GIA explains. The pal of gloom set over luxury markets in Europe, North America and Japan in 2009, is perfectly illustrative of this trend. These leading luxury markets faced the most severe impact of the global economic recession, with ""High Net Worth Individuals"" dramatically decreasing their spending. However, a quick bounce back to market fundamentals is expected. ""Diversification of the consumer base for luxury goods away from the conventional ultra rich consumers augurs well for the industry in the medium to long-term and as a result of which perception of luxury will emerge well beyond the traditional confines of fashion, and exclusivity to include quality and intrinsic product value,"" GIA says. ""The changing consumer habits and values are generating enormous opportunities for brands to draw potential customers as well as reinforce their relationships with their more wealthier and absolute luxury shoppers"". Growth in the luxury goods market should also be fuelled by the growing demand in developing Asian countries, such as China and India. Growing awareness over international prestige brands, coupled with rising standards of living, as well as the emergence of new classes of affluent consumers, particularly working women, are the main factors contributing to the penchant for living unique lifestyles in these countries. The Asia-Pacific market is expected to produce the fastest CAGR [2] (15.7%) over the analysis period 2007-2015."
"""I consider myself more as a product maker,"" Dany Sanz, Make Up For Ever","""Certainly, Dany Sanz says, trends exist! I remember very clearly the trend of the mid-1980s, when we started Make Up For Ever, with the surge of American culture. It was the times of the Palace one Paris' most famous and select night club, of glitters, of eccentricity and the beginning of Body Painting. From the early 1990s, we were back to natural, elegance, chic. Glitters had become vulgar. Then arrived the 2000s with a true fascination for the 1960s. It was the resurgence of Vichy check fabrics, bunches.... Today, we have to admit we are going round in circles! In such circumstances, it's obvious that one cannot be indifferent to things happening on the outside and many of my colleagues are paying much attention to that. It's food for my thoughts and ideas, but mostly I am looking for novelty."" As we can see, the creation in 1984 of her own brand, Make Up For Ever, is the logical continuation of a creative process almost permanent. Obviously the debate ""Professional"" vs. "" General Public"" Is not fully solved for this demanding and perfectionist woman. And the transition from a Make Up For Ever almost entirely focused on the development and manufacture of cosmetic products for professionals to today's Make Up for Ever, a subsidiary of the LVMH Group which has become a reference in the world of cosmetics, operating in more than 45 countries, has not always been and still isn't that simple. ""It's true, that there might be a bit of an unsolved issue here and I am far from being indifferent to the question,"" she admits. ""But at the same time, experience has shown that the professional approach was the right one. When I developed five years ago, the HD range (standing for High Definition), with performances that truly suited, the make-up requirements of artists subject to the raw precision of movie or television pictures, people were surprised that my approach was not more focused on general public. But I am attached to that pro image. And this range that I'm still continuing to develop, has had and continues to encounter great success with consumers"". The HD range, by the way, is continuously expanding. ""I was the first to develop an HD talcum-free powder and I've currently developed an HD blush"", she adds. Regarding the current trend consisting in sophisticated packaging and accessories that facilitate the make-up gesture Dany Sanz considers ""it's more a gadget than shear innovation"". ""There isn't a thousand ways to put make-up on! The real innovation must lie in the product itself and not in its applicator or its packaging. Which doesn't mean, she acknowledges, that there aren't any real technical advances, such as airless, which help preserve product performances. This does not mean, either, that we are not interested in packaging. We have planned for instance to change all our packs for eye shadows and we have decided to design our own moulds"". Finally, concerning current changes in legislation which consists in banning more and more products, ""it is really the toughest and most serious challenge our profession will need to address in the years to come"", she insists. Dany Sanz will tell the story of Make Up For Ever will during the conferences at Make Up in Paris, on June 24 and 25, Espace Pierre Cardin."
Economic downturn hit U.S. spas hard,"The recession hit spas hard Diagonal Reports reveals in a new report [1]. ""Spas describe 2009 as a disaster"", says the market research firm. Revenues fell by 15% compared to the previous year. ""Such a drop shocked spas which had become accustomed to continuous expansion. A decade of double digit growth had led to oversupply of spas, which has made the problem worse. In addition, costs had spiralled out of control during the boom. Initially, spas delayed their response to falling revenues and did not react – by reducing prices - until late 2009"". Massage and facial treatments account for more than half of revenues in spas. According to Diagonal Reports, changes in people's lifestyles (such as prolonged computer use) and their desire to improve their wellbeing have driven demand for massages. It augurs well for the future of spas that these massage therapies attract the widest range of consumer segments in terms of age and gender. Facial skincare is also one of the most recession resistant spa treatments. Consumers are willing to continue spending and even to pay premium prices for quality professional services to maintain the face, which is their most visible body part. Diagonal Reports also notes that an unusual situation has emerged as regards brand share in the spa market. ""Long established companies in the personal care market failed to develop suitable spa lines, leaving a gap in the market which has been filled by mainly new start-ups. Spas served as the launchpad for the development of an entirely new category of beauty care products."" Organic and science brands have filled in the gap and taken over this market, accounting for nearly all sales and have squeezed out traditional beauty brands in the process. According to Diagonal Reports, no significant upturn is expected in spa spending until 2011 or 2012. The budget-minded consumer is here to stay and the free spending levels of 2007 and before will not return any time soon. Spas must now move into a more mature phase of their market development. Spa usage has been democratised and spas have gone mainstream. The consumer switch from luxury to maintenance treatments benefits a certain type of spa operators. Convenience is the key word. Compact services are now in demand and spas which offer ""smaller price and smaller time packages"" to their clients are now expanding in the US."
"""We are in an era of greater limpidity of the complexion,"" Damien Dufresne","Damien Dufresne, whose outsized talent built him a reputation, will express his vision of makeup through a gallery of photos exposed during the two day event, 24 and 25 June, at the Espace Cardin, Paris. Damien Dufresne is used to work with prestigious companies in the beauty industry, such as Amore Pacific, Intercos or L'Oreal. In cooperation with MakeUp in Paris [1], he has accepted to share his personal insight on the world of makeup. MakeUp in Paris - At 22 years old, Manager of a hairdressing salon, in Lille -one of the busiest cities in the North of France, employing 15 people, then Manager of a ""make-up bar"" in Paris in 1997, a few steps away from the Place des Victoires, you obviously have a strong entrepreneurial spirit! Damien Dufresne - That's true! It's one side of my nature. It probably helps me to better understand the constraints of companies I'm asked to work with. Incidentally, it's through this ""makeup bar"" and because of my privileged contacts with consumers, that the Amore Pacific Group got interested in me. And, as you know, I have been working for ten years as Artistic Director for the Hera range, but I'm also a makeup man for the trend books of the Intercos Group and make-up man for the L'Oreal events. MakeUp in Paris - But above all, you are a ""make–up man""! Damien Dufresne - Yes, I consider myself a make-up man and I pride myself of saying so. The side I like the least is the ""Make-up Artist"" one, I prefer saying I am a craftsman. A craftsman is someone who works with his hands. Which also involves passion. It takes time to become a make-up man. I first learned the technique and it then took me some time to forget all about it to only let my inspiration express itself. Today what means a lot to me is probably what interested my industry partners in the first place: working on the global design of a make-up range, participate in the lab to the development of new colors materials and textures, draw on my ""studio"" experience to use the creative and ground-breaking side of it and use my knowledge of what the ""woman in the street"" demands to adapt it to the everyday make-up. MakeUp in Paris - What is the purpose of make-up? Damien Dufresne - It is above all an element of fun, a moment of pleasure. It's only made to make you feel better. We cannot make a woman actually look more beautiful. On the other hand, with make-up, she can have that feeling of looking beautiful and therefore more self-assertive. That's what counts! The perception of beauty is something very personal too. We're all beautiful to someone ... Beauty can sometimes also be exotic because of its differences. For my part, I am susceptible to Asian beauty because it has an element of mystery to it. I have done quite a few make-ups on women and I am always amazed to see how one brush stroke can change the look a woman takes at herself. And this last look in her mirror illustrates the moment when she finds herself again, ready to face scrutinizing looks. At the same time, make-up is something ephemeral, it's a game, the game of seduction, nothing more. MakeUp in Paris - What do you think are currently the major trends? Damien Dufresne - I don't like speaking of ""trends"" that much, because that would mean that all women should wear make up the same way, I prefer personalized advices because each woman is different, each woman is unique. A make-up changes throughout life. A successful make is also a make-up you only do once for one woman only. But to answer your question, we can say that we are in an era of greater limpidity as far as complexion is concerned, thanks to new technologies, that eyeshadow are brighter and that lipstick is making a great comeback. MakeUp in Paris - Where do you draw your inspiration from? Damien Dufresne - Inspiration comes from the woman who is wearing your make-up, the important thing is the emotion that must arouse from make-up. The same type of emotion, all things considered, I find when visiting an art gallery. The technique is important, but what matters most is imagination! Serge Mansau told me one day: ""Never let go the hand of the child you were once... or you will lose yourself"". I believe he was also thinking of the proportion of poetry we all have within ourselves. MakeUp in Paris - What will be the highlights of your presence at MakeUp in Paris? Damien Dufresne - What changes the most today is that I take pictures myself of the make ups I did with my colleagues. It's no longer the vision of a photographer on the work of a make-up artist, it's the same and single vision. But I don't think of myself as a photographer, it's a full-time job, just like mine, it was just the desire to get behind the camera."
Foundations: key factors of success,"For women, finding the right foundation is similar to the quest for the Holy Grail. ""It's like finding the right pair of jeans"", and that's saying something! Very receptive to advice from ""experts"" - girlfriends, specially bloggers, internet users in general, and even in very special cases, the pharmacy's sales staff and ultimately, selective- they will use whatever time and money it takes, multiplying tests until they find the right product. The product which, among other qualities ""melts in into the skin leaving no lines, concealing imperfections with no plaster effect, and which holds"" So once they have found it, not surprisingly, they stick to it ... Until a bigger, more beautiful and efficient product appears, until there is a change in their skin, more sensitive, drier, oilier, more mature - until the desire for a change is back! Women want the packaging to be aesthetic and practical. And even if they don't slip their foundation case in their hand bag, they still want it to be an option, therefore glass, they appreciate otherwise, has no place, they believe, in the universe of complexion. Moreover, there are two opposing camps in the field of packaging: some are in favor of a pump bottle-only system , which they consider hygienic and handy, while the others no longer want to hear about them, complaining about out of reach product drying up at the bottom precisely because of these pump-bottles! Texture should be fluid but not too liquid; in compact version, soft and velvet-like, or in the form of mousse. ""It should glide easily on skin"", ""melt into skin"". Texture is women's first real contact with the product; texture allows them to apply easily or not foundation ... So, if they dislike a texture, they will have a tendency to reject the foundation in a whole! It never will have a negative influence, it will only add to the positive side of a judgment. Women are no experts in putting make-up on, they say! So they appreciate all the help they can get to easily apply the product, including the texture, whether fluid or velvet-like. What about applicators? Of course, they use sponges, brushes, roll-ons when available, but they often end up using their fingertips. An ideal foundation should cover but not mask, it should melt in but not be inexistent. It should conceal imperfections, without marking fine lines, with no plaster effect, no lines, in a word, it must be natural not to say ""undetectable"". Even if women believe that a 12,16 or 24 hour foundation is more a discourse used by brands than a fact, -still the product must be long lasting and keep the skin from shinning or drying up. They expect so much from the product and its properties that they are eager for promises. But be careful, better offer little than not hold your promises. If the product claims to be Infallible, Tone on Tone, with Lifting Effect, and of 16 or 24 hour duration... then it better be. Otherwise, women will go for it the first time, but won't be attracted a second time on the contrary they will be extremely critical with products / brands that disappointed them. There are a number of internet users to regret not finding the suitable colour for their skin. And the extremes –very clear skins, mixed-skins- are the ones complaining the most. If sometimes women find prices too high, it is usually indicative of a dissatisfaction with the purchased product. Actually, they are willing to pay the price for the cult product, the one that achieves everything. But be careful again, if they loosen the purse strings, they want their money's worth: in which case it's zero tolerance. Another interesting fact is that they also gauge the price by the quantity of product required for a good make-up which explains why some expensive foundations are considered worthwhile because they are used up less quickly than others, ""a small dab is enough""… The ideal foundation looks like a Holy Grail even harder to get hold of for: – Middle-aged women: they are seeking advice. How must they put make-up on, what product should they use, which one will erase their imperfections and have a real tensing effect? In her case, there's virtually no prescription from Internet users. – Women with oily skins: which product should they use to avoid a shiny complexion? Prescription from Internet users: a mixture of foundation + powder. – Women with sensitive skins: when soothing creams or anti-redness creams give no results, what is the best way to conceal the small red spots and other symptoms generated by sensitive skin? Prescription from Internet users: 1/ products from the pharmacy and/or pharmacist's advice. 2/a mixture of products (green-based cream + day cream + foundation). – Women with dry skins: which product should they use to avoid dehydrated skin? Prescription from Internet users: ultra-rich moisturizer + fluid foundation."
Cosmoprof Bologna: taking stock,"Premium Beauty News - What was your feeling regarding this new edition of Cosmoprof, prior to the opening day? Aureliana de Sanctis - The 43rd edition of Cosmoprof Bologna was opening obviously under the best favorable auspicious:2254 exhibitors, that is an increase of 0.26% on 2009, including 1325 overseas visitors, 59% of the total. In terms of stand space, it represented 180,000 m2, an increase of 2% on 2009. 39,516 visitors had preregistered online before the show, compared to 31,600 persons in 2009. This significant increase was obtained by using the Web as a communication media but also through Google planning with 4553 direct purchases. Premium Beauty News - You obviously suffered of the cessation of flights as of Thursday evening. What was the exact impact on the show? Aureliana de Sanctis - As of Wednesday, April 14th the skies of northern Europe started closing because of the Icelandic volcano. The impact was particularly noticeable with the arrivals of delegations of international buyers except for the Cosmopack meetings which were planned Thursday morning and which took place at a rate of 88 meetings on a total of 120. The impact on others was more serious, only 60 meetings out of 120 for the SPA. Hairdressers for the ""On Hair"" shows arriving from London could not make it to Bologna, while those who were coming from Paris were able to participate after travelling by car, thanks to our intervention. Nevertheless, because of the hype we did to have selective perfumery settle again in Bologna as well as significant investments in terms of communication, we can say that this edition of Cosmoprof was a success: the number of visitors increased by 4.88% compared to last year with 6,808 more visitors. The number of foreign visitors was of 33,404 out of 146,331 visitors overall. Premium Beauty News - Competition between the major international shows of the Beauty business is not weakening. What is your insight for the future concerning your event? Aureliana de Sanctis - Cosmoprof does not fear competition. Our show has been the # 1 show in the beauty industry for 43 years. Shows organized by competitors are at the same time niches events and finally very local events. They are very much different from Cosmoprof who is acknowledged as being the largest international show in the world and the only one guaranteeing an international platform with its Las Vegas and Hong Kong editions. If there is a different offer, we are remaining in a situation of free competition. It's up to the exhibitors to decide where they want to invest depending on their business objectives. Cosmoprof, since its creation in the 60s, followed the development of the beauty sector and has always kept its promises in terms of reliability and quality; all the exhibitors we have met agreed to that. We are grateful to all the exhibitors who in 2010 trusted us and helped us to achieve a prestigious and useful event for the sector. In the future we will continue with the aim that this event remains not only a show but also a place for meeting people, exchanging ideas and sharing experiences. A true multimedia and multisensory platform facilitating the development of the Beauty world. Premium Beauty News - What do you think of the opening in a few months of a new tradeshow, Intercharm, in Milan? Aureliana de Sanctis - Competition is the spice of business. We are in a free market and we are working to improve our show either in terms of content, developing our own features, or in terms of spaces. Intercharm is a project that we are observing with appropriate attention, as a local show intending to be the expression of the Italian market. Premium Beauty News - The centre of gravity of the beauty business is moving more and more towards the Asian area. A situation that can only benefit to Hong Kong tradesow. Aureliana de Sanctis - Cosmoprof Asia is a well known show playing a leading role in the development of the cosmetics business in Asia including Japan, Australia, Taiwan and Korea. This year, it will be the 15th edition of the show and we noticed that the nature of it is changing: at first an event focusing on the support to foreign brands to help them find a retail system in Asia, it has gradually changed to become a business platform facilitating the creation of new strategic partnerships in technology, production and retail. Today, Cosmoprof Asia is acknowledged as being the second benchmark in the world: all the players in the beauty industry meet during the first quarter in Bologna, then they go to Hong Kong, with a wide participation of buyers and exhibitors attending the show, especially from France. Remember that we are present in mainland China with Guangzhou International Beauty Expo, the largest trade show in China, which is getting great results. Given our performances in Asia, we are looking very closely for opportunities in Beijing and Shanghai. Premium Beauty News - What about your new show in Turkey? Aureliana de Sanctis - BeautyEurasia in Istanbul is another very important project in a rapidly developing area in terms of cosmetic products consumption. Cosmoprof and BeautyEurasia will provide a new professional platform to reach professionals and distributors in this area. The area includes countries such as Turkey, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa: a target of 500 million people. Will congregate there people from, the Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan and parts of eastern Russia."
U.S. make-up users want simplicity from their brands,"Market Force Information, a customer intelligence and market survey company, has examined which cosmetic brands are most popular among U.S. consumers and why, as well as their favourite places to shop for cosmetics. The survey was conducted in March 2010 among 5,000 consumers [1]. When the consumers were asked what they loved most about their favourite makeup line, they chose brand trust over all of the other factors - the actual product attributes mattered much less. More than two thirds said they love their makeup because they trust the brand, while only one third cited loving it ""because it feels wonderful."" Surprisingly, claims such as ""humane testing"" or ""environmentally safe"" were not weighted strongly and emerged toward the bottom of the list. According to the beauty survey conducted by Market Force Information, Cover Girl is consumers' favourite cosmetics brand. Out of 60 cosmetic brands, Cover Girl was cited by 14 percent as their favourite, placing it on top. Clinique was second on the list with 10 percent of the mentions, and Maybelline (L'Oreal) and Mary Kay tied for third with 8 percent each. Cover Girl led the other brands in most of the attributes consumers care about most, scoring highest in categories such as great value, brand trust, wears well throughout the day and easy, no-mess application. Clinique was named second in brand trust and rated highest of all the brands in the uses humane testing/is environmentally safe category. Although Mary Kay was the fourth favourite cosmetics brand, it still scored well for several attributes, including ranking third for brand trust. ""When we drilled down into our data to determine which brands appealed to different types of makeup users, we discovered that the cosmetic enthusiasts—'cosmaholics' and 'aspiring stylists'—experiment with lots of makeup and no single brand stands out to them,"" said Janet Eden-Harris, chief marketing officer for Market Force. ""Meanwhile, those characterized in the study as an 'everyday woman' or 'minimalist' exuded much more brand loyalty, and Cover Girl was their clear choice."" A common sentiment that emerged in the survey is that makeup wearers want a natural and authentic look, rather than something ""ultra-modern"" or ""sophisticated"". More than 40 percent selected the adjectives ""natural"" and ""no fuss"" to describe their favourite makeup line. Conversely, adjectives like ""edgy"" and ""sassy"" were at the bottom of the list. When consumers were asked where they go to purchase their cosmetics, their answers showed there is no one clear retailer category of choice. The majority - 29 percent - said they purchase them from mass retailers like Walmart and Target, and another 21 percent buy from drug stores such as CVS or Walgreens. Slightly fewer, about one in five, shop for cosmetics in department stores. Sephora was a crowd favourite in the specialty retailer category. Out of the 12 percent who reported buying cosmetics from specialty retailers, more than one third said they purchase from Sephora. Six percent of respondents had been to a home party in the past six months and two thirds of them saw the Mary Kay makeup line, although only 1 percent said they shop for cosmetics at home parties."
Fiabila: successful strategy in the nail polish segment,"Premium Beauty News - Apparently, the nail polish segment still has been spared from the crisis. Pierre Miasnik - It is a fact that nail polish is trendy and getting trendier every day. The European market in 2009 shows a double digit growth rate and is not declining, quite the contrary. As far as we are concerned, our consolidated turnover has made a leap of 20% between 2008 and 2009 and the trend should be even higher in 2010. Premium Beauty News - Since your creation in 1977, your strategy development is as regular as clockwork. In 1996, as a forerunner, you implant yourself in Mexico. In 1999, you set foot in India. In 2000 in Japan and the following year ... in the United States. What is your next move? Pierre Miasnik - Like everyone else, we are of course carefully following what's going on in South America, particularly Brazil. And this year could well be the one to establish ourselves on this continent. But we also have ambitions for our main and historical production units in France, in Maintenon and Plaisir. We have eventually obtained the rights to use a large area adjacent to the former which, in addition, recently received significant investment concerning production safety. As for the conditioning unit, in Plaisir which employs 95 people, eleven of them dedicated to Quality Control, it will receive two new lines next June. Our Indian unit is being expanded with the construction of a new production tool that takes into account climate related issues allowing the plant to be upgraded at the required quality levels to support the inexorable market development. Premium Beauty News - You pride yourself on the fact of only producing nail polish! Why is it so? Pierre Miasnik - For a very simple reason! You can only manufacture properly things upon which you have a knowledge! This trade is already complex and difficult enough to try and satisfy increasingly more demanding customers, why do you want us to develop other businesses thus reducing our investment capacities in our core business? I will even stress on the fact that our ""mono-product"" position can only help reassure and reinforce our current and future customers. Especially since we are asked to comply with Flawless Quality policies which only a company entirely dedicated to its business can claim providing. Moreover, do you know that twenty people on a total of 85 work every day at Fiabila Maintenon, in the R&D department. Not every company can say that. And we are quite proud of having established control standards which have become genuine ""standards"" in the industry. Premium Beauty News - Isn't it all about everything having to be ""still more this and still more that"" for nail polishes? Pierre Miasnik - If you want to caricature, yes! Actually it is ""still more""! And it starts with ""still more"" regulatory constraints on components, manufacturing standards and level of purity. You cannot imagine the complexity of our business whose fundamentals are constantly questioned at the mercy of a particular administrative decision issued from a country whose intentions are not always focused on protecting users but are really technical trade barriers. As far as we are concerned, we have implemented very stringent procedures at all production levels to ensure full compliance of our products to regulations and standards across the world. Premium Beauty News - The industry is taking more and more interest in water-based nail polish. What is your point of view? Pierre Miasnik - We have applied for two patents on water-based nail polishes and of course, we are still focusing on the subject. But you must bear in mind that the more the proprieties of solvent-based varnishes improve in terms of ease of application, drying, brilliance and hold, the more the gap automatically widens with water-based polishes. Especially when ""85% bio sourced"" polishes will be available upon registration of our patents. Concerning our strategic priorities, we can point out our research efforts to improve the performance of nail care and filing a patent on the use of aldehydes, and finally, our research efforts in polymers with the creation six months ago, of a brand new department, at Maintenon."
ADA and Marietta join forces to serve international amenity market,"Two leading hotel cosmetics producers have joined forces in an effort to significantly expand their business in the worldwide amenity market: ADA Cosmetics International, Europe's leading producer of hotel cosmetics, and Marietta Corporation, one of the largest hotel amenity manufacturers in North America. The two companies intend to create synergies between their key competencies to better serve the international market. Their cooperative activities will focus on international bids to offer international hotel chains a worldwide, single-source solution to their amenity needs. Marietta and ADA will provide a wide portfolio of quality cosmetics that can be distributed to any hotel location in the world, especially in North America, South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. ""Our customers want modern products of consistently high quality that can meet any international requirements including reliable delivery anywhere in the world,"" says Donald Sturdivant, chief executive officer of Marietta. Bothe companies intend to consolidate their international market share and their international growth. According to Wilhelm B. Könning, CEO of ADA Group, the partnership with Marietta could be a huge competitive advantage in international bids. Aside from these joint activities, both companies will continue to approach their core markets in North America and Europe independently. The companies own manufacturing facilities across the United States and in Europe. Partner quality-control and sourcing facilities are located around the world. Production facilities are ISO 9001 and REACH compliant in Europe, FDA-registered in the United States, ISO 9000 and 1400 compliant in Asia, and strictly follow current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) worldwide."
Biodiversity: lack of trust in the cosmetics industry,"In 2009, the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) launched a worldwide biodiversity barometer, to measure levels of awareness of the French, British, Americans and Germans. In 2010, it was extended to test Brazilians. The results of the 2010 barometer were revealed at UEBT's annual conference ""The Beauty of Sourcing with Respect"" on April 16, in Paris. According to the survey, common knowledge about biodiversity has progressed in one year: from 56% to 60%. A significant point: Brazilians show the highest awareness of biodiversity, 94% of people have already heard of it, out of which 47% could give a correct definition. ""In general, nature is ever more present in the minds of the consumers. If Fair Trade remains today the most well known notion, deforestation and the conservation of biodiversity are equally important. Here too, Brazilians are in the lead, with biodiversity a key theme, much more important than Fair Trade,"" says UEBT in a release. According to the UEBT, respondents do not have much trust in companies from the food and cosmetics sector, and particularly of their ethical sourcing practices related to biodiversity. ""Nevertheless, it is urgent to build this relationship of trust, since there is such a high number of people who would be ready to stop buying a product from a specific brand, if they knew ethical and environmental rules had been neglected in its sourcing and production process,"" says the UEBT. This applies to the food sector (81%), and even more so to the cosmetics industry (84%) according to the survey. Similarly to the compliance with natural and organic criteria, an independent third-party organisation appears as a guarantee of objectivity. Actually, an official report of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) already noted in 2008 that few of the companies involved in sourcing the ingredients incorporate some or any of the requirements of the convention into their practices. According to the UEBT research, only 21 of the top 100 companies in the cosmetics industry mention biodiversity, out of which a small minority claims to take it into account in its sourcing practices. This being said, it is possible to note an increase of mentions of biodiversity in the press: 2009 witnessed an increase in the number of articles on this matter in France, Germany, the UK and the USA by 32%. This just goes to show that the conservation of biodiversity, an emerging issue in 2009, has now become a topic of debate in environmental matters."
Marionnaud relies on private labels and exclusivities to boost sales,"Building on the successes of its first incursion in the market, using its own brand name with its Bio par Marionnaud range (organic range), launched in 2008, and of its bath products range marketed in autumn 2009, Marionnaud announced the launch of a new range of face and body care products: les soins essentiels de beauté Marionnaud (essential beauty care products by Marionnaud). Reflecting the will of the brand to invest significantly in this direction, the new Marionnaud line, will be backed this time by a real global launch strategy, with a total of 11 countries targeted. After investing heavy in a network of 1,200 outlets, the company wants to intensify the development of the Marionnaud brand by placing its private labels at the heart of its offer. In doing so, Marionnaud follows the lead of Sephora, the other giant in selective distribution, whose strategy for a masstige offer using its own name turned out to be a real success. With 35 products and 29 high quality care formulas, Marionnaud intends to provide a complete offer with ""a quality leveling the one of major brands"" with ""extremely competitive prices"" (average selling price 10 euros), while allowing consumers to enjoy beauty tips offered by selective perfumery. The new range, available in shops as of May 25, 2010, features face care products such as make-up removers, cleansers, moisturizers, a range of toners, a body scrub and first wrinkle care tonics, and beauty care products for the body, feet and hands. ""The development of private labels allows us to respond to needs that traditional brands cannot deal with. This also allows us to take an interest in market segments, the expectations of which we are aware of, by offering quality products, often cheaper, while increasing our customers loyalty by showing them we are paying attention to their needs"", commented Miek Vercouteren, General manager of Marionnaud France. Another objective of the group: to reinforce its identity by symbolizing it in products bearing its values. With a market share of 27.8% in value at end of December 2009 and nearly 270 beauty parlors in France, Marionnaud considers itself as a care expert. Hence, the company has imposed on its suppliers very demanding development criteria, with stringent specifications regarding formulation in order to ensure that formulas are allergen-free, paraben-free and with no synthetic mineral oil, and with original or just comfortable galenic forms. In the end, Marionnaud selected two European manufacturers (Intercosmétiques in France and Intercos in Italy), usual partners for the most prestigious cosmetic brands. Regarding the quality of advice provided, Marionnaud also seems determined to keep promises which were often not up to the situation in the past, with selective channels. Perfectly in line, in fact, with what stated Miek Vercouteren during the last debate organized by the CEW France. A training program dedicated to the new skincare range, has been set up. ""We want to share with sales consultants and customers tips concerning the appropriate gestures to apply products and turn them into beauty rituals. In France, the program is implemented both in the Marionnaud Academy, and from the e-learning portal where product data sheet and selling tips are offered to consultants"", the company said in a statement. Marionnaud has also recently signed its most recent exclusivity with the Danish make-up brand, Gosh, which will be distributed as of the month of May as an exclusivity in 100 outlets. Earlier this month, the Prize for the 2010 Best men's fragrance, granted by the Fragrance Foundation France and Marie Claire magazine, was awarded to Jamais Le Dimanche by Egofacto, a brand retailed exclusively by Marionnaud since January 2009."
Perfume industry professionals want to react against the crisis,"Rather grim were the first observations made by the dozen participants to the roundtable organized last week, in Paris, by the association, Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW) France. France is seeing perfume, lose each year more market shares. 66% of shoppers entering a perfumery store leave the outlet without having bought something! Whose fault is it? How can the issue be solved? A very rich debate of nearly three hours restoring in the end, some hope. Clear-cut observations. ""Too many perfumes kill perfumes! ...,a perfume can't be compared to a brand of washing powder! .... Prohibitive prices compared to the quality of the offer ...! There is no more desire! ... A lack of listening from the industry on what consumers 'really' want!.... A sales and marketing strategy based on short term profits ... An overall decline in quality ... Poorly trained mass retail outlets who do not properly convey the right messages on perfume brands and their fragrances..."" Meanwhile, the crisis has not helped. A crisis ""which, unlike political correctness, is far from over yet"", insisted Mercedes Erra, Executive President of Euro RSCG. A crisis that has further enlarged the gap between an industry standing its ground and consumers whose values have obviously been deeply impacted by the recent months of economic events. ""We would have every reason to be, recalled one participant in the audience, as we belong to the million of French people who only have, altogether, 150 euros to barely manage to make ends meet at the end of each month!"" It seems only normal, in such conditions, that the first purchase criterion has become ""Is it useful or not?"". The second one ""Am I right to buy this?"", the third one, ""Does it please me?"", the fourth one, ""Can I make it myself?"", the fifth one, ""Can I wait for the sales?"". 91% of French people wish to improve their consumption habits! They are only 60% in England to highlight the same need and 64% in the United States. What matters the most is ""quality""! Other interesting changes in consumers scale of values, according to Mercedes Erra, ""It's the end with dialogue for the sake of dialogue and innovation for the sake of innovation! People want the basics, want to see the evidence of a real know-how"". A series of changes that are not going to be to everyone's taste in the perfume industry. ""To some people only"", stressed José Manuel Albesa, Chief Brand Officer, Puig. ""Because for our part, we tackled this issue head-on relying on the fundamentals of our business. In other words, by giving time to time, by paying more attention to criticism than to praise, by being able to stop everything and start over again regardless of the industrial and commercial commitment, and above all by doing everything in our power to insure that the product actually expresses a story! And take risks!"". What has changed in recent months? Quite honestly, a lot of things even if, in the opinion of speakers, there is a long way to go from honest intentions to acts. ""In any case, the work can only be achieved together"", noted Joel Palix, President of Clarins Fragrance Group. ""We must return to real creation. More money needs to be invested in the product and less elsewhere. Don't forget that a so called 'popular' perfume only represents at best 3% of consumers! Retail channels need to be more selective about the products they accept in outlets and our contacts with customers must be the result of a true relationship"". Message received loud and clear by Miek Vercouteren, CEO of Marionnaud France, whose commitments hold in six points: – more brand segmentation and brand selection, – limit the offer, – increase value added, – pay closer attention to what consumers have to say, – know more about the elements of ""value"" of the brand, – improve the training of sales consultants. ""There has been and still are too many launches and, especially, too many unnecessary launches "" adds Céline Sanzey, In charge of the perfume pole at Sephora. ""We must abandon the struggle for the gain of market shares to contribute instead altogether to market growth! I am also expecting from brands what I call 'categorical logic' according to existing outlets. The same brand will not express itself the same way from one outlet to the other and from one shopping environment to the other! And above all, I expect creativity!"" Now, specifically, for Chloé Jay, Director General of Keihl France's, L'Oreal Luxury Products Division, ""We must admit that creativity was not at hand. We must stop doing marketing just for the sake of marketing and try designing a 'a great classic'. Finally, many in the industry will have done the same thing! For instance, we must review the olfactory composition, review the tests in order to take into consideration different criteria in relation with emotion, sensitivity..."" ""Olfactory... , let's talk about it"" insisted Armand de Villoutreys, President of Firmenich's Fine Fragrance World Division. ""With over 900 launches per year worldwide, the industry has mechanized creation. But creation must be protected, the level of requirement must be upgraded. We need clearer briefs. It is clear that the value of the perfume element has declined over recent years and this cannot last! As for testing, one must stop 'averaging' the brand!"" ""A long way to go,"" emphasized Marc Smia, founding partner of Kea & Partners. ""It is clear that the gain in market shares might kill the market. We must elaborate and set up a strategy of allies. Without a strong and powerful purpose, there is a high risk of trivialization of the market"". Yet, a major absentee at this roundtable, the whole industry of packaging and full service. ""That's right"", stated José Manuel Albesa from Puig. ""It's an essential and very experienced link that we are also much more involving at the beginning of our briefs"". Three hours of debate and freely exchanged talks, between, for once, all the industry players, who demonstrated undoubtedly that the sector had perfectly-integrated all the issues and challenges. ""Brands have understood the need to clarify their offer,"" concluded Barbara Le Portz. ""In a word ...., fewer but better !... And it's probably necessary to stop trying to please everyone by placing the consumer at the center of the game. It would be better to try and increase the market than to try and increase ones market shares. As for retail channels they have also understood the essential part they had to play in this new process that's taking place. By upgrading the training of sales consultants. We must enchant customers again!""."
"IL Cosmetics : ""The offer must suit the real needs of the market!""","Premium Beauty News - What will be the strong points of your presence in Bologna? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Our three entities, International Lacquers, Luxcos and Interpack, specialized in the manufacture and conditioning of nail polish and make-up products, will take this opportunity to unveil their new collections of nail polishes, lip gloss, mascaras and eyeliners. Actually, we are the only nail polish manufacturer with significant market shares to have extended our activity to the production of make-up. We relied on our mastery of technologies required for developing complex products such as nail polishes to work on other products. In addition, nail polish is a niche market, our strong growth, also needs to rely on make-up products considering their potential of expansion. The market of exclusive subcontractors for nail polish, our core business, includes 4 main players. This figure could also drop in the future. Regarding our scope of activities, it is international, with customers in over 40 countries. We take advantage of our position to conduct detailed analysis in order to present the appropriate trends for each market. So, we collect information on the different markets on which our clients, with whom we have a privileged relationship, are present. These detailed information concern formulas but also trends. We can also rely on an international network of consultants and we work with different trends offices too. Data collected by these various means help us to keep track of markets evolutions in terms of trends, distribution channels, but also in terms of prices or even sales trends. We then proceed to an analysis of needs and positioning for each of or our clients to offer them customized solutions at all levels. Packaging for example, plays an important part. For nail polish, the brushes need to be adapted to the formulas they come along with. Thus, a wide and flat brush will be appropriate for instance to apply in one stroke a coat of nail polish. To provide our customers with quality solutions, we mainly work with European suppliers. Finally, in order to assess the performance of products we propose, a team of experts will test them. In addition, a consumer panel meets weekly. Premium Beauty News - What current trends were you able to identify with the help of these studies and how do they directly impact the ranges you offer? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Several can be identified on the color cosmetics market. Firstly, consumers want to feel totally confident with their make-up: they want to be sure it will hold all day through, regardless of their program, without blurring nor running. For nails, long wear is a key criterion in the same way quick drying is. These two main directions in formulas have long been antagonistic. We can now offer formulas combining the two performances. Concerning eyes, consumers today, want products which will stay true all day long, such as new generation smudges or water proofs. The ease of use and comfort during application are also important criteria. For nail polish, for example, formulas must be non streaking and must apply easily and evenly on nails. Our sensory analysis tests for all products, take into consideration, different applications criteria such as the glide of applicators, comfort or coverage ... Premium Beauty News - But it is not just a question of ease of use. The consumers clearly expect other things? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Products must be enriched with active ingredients so to bring benefits. It is the emergence of ""care benefit"" products. Thus, for nail polish many formulas are now enriched with active ingredients which help strengthening nails, nourishing them or promoting their growth. Consumers expect from enamels and makeup products to do more than just provide color. Glosses may also have a plumping, smoothing / softening or moisturizing effect. We will have the pleasure of presenting at Cosmoprof, each of our formulas meeting different markets needs."
Paradoxes of the market of niche fragrances,"It was a brilliant idea! This is of course what say today organizers of Esxence, which just held its second edition in Milan. For attending exhibitors, there is really no comparison with the dedicated hall at Cosmoprof Bologna, the so called ""Masterpieces"" section. ""We were dealing with real professionals during these four days, and all this at the same time in a very friendly atmosphere much better adapted to our market."" A market, very difficult to identify. The organizers of Esxence would rather refer to it as an ""art perfumery,"" a concept which combines products quality and originality with a special attention given to distribution. A perfumery of character that contrasts with mass production, deeply impacted by crisis and which professionals attending the event believed is even hit harder by ""a real identity crisis."" ""Launching a new perfume like you launch a brand of detergent cannot help improve the situation,"" they explained. So do niche perfumery brands manage to succeed where others are struggling? ""Small successful brand, there are a lot more than you think,"" says Sylvie Dumontier from Parfums L.T Piver. ""To start with ours!"". L.T Piver is now worth 7 million euros in turnover, with 40 people, a factory in Chartres, a presence in 150 outlets in Italy, 45 perfume shops in France and 150 beauty parlors. ""And we have just started tackling the U.S. market,"" adds Sylvie Dumontier. Bashar Nasri, President of France Excellence and owner of the brand Maison Dorin shares the same enthusiasm. An amazing and stunning performance that begins in 1998 with the acquisition of this brand. ""Maison Dorin was born in the latest period of history of the Ancien Régime where art and beauty had all the highest honors"", explains Bashar Nasri. Maison Dorin is one of the oldest heir to the tradition of French perfumery recognized by the choice of the aristocracy. As of 1780, it becomes supplier to the Court. Thereafter, its story is modeled in large part on the international influence of France. The Paris expositions in 1839, 1855, 1867 and 1889 opened the eyes of foreign merchants to French luxury products, and won an unequivocal place among exporters of England, Russia, Spain and the Americas and worldwide. Because it is also a paradox for this Milanese show entirely dedicated to the art of fragrance and with no counterpart in France, that more than half of all stands were rented by French brands. Nothing surprising considering the French tradition of excellence in that matter. However, these niche brands, or of art perfumery, find it difficult to become popular on the French market! The first explanation seems to lie in the distribution system. While in France independent perfumeries were massively absorbed by specialized chain stores - such as Sephora, Marionnaud or other Beauty Success - they resisted much better in Italy. And Italy has almost twice as many specialized outlets than France. And in order to not share the same destiny as their transalpine colleagues, Italian independent retailers invested heavily in quality and differentiation. And France still represents 41% of total perfumes and cosmetics imports in Italy. Not surprising then, that some of the most successful French companies congregated at a show almost tailor-made for them and their suppliers. Like Marie Huet, a passionate who in March 2007 took in charge the destiny of the Parfums d'Orsay, a very old perfume house to which she decided to restore its former glory. ""Le Chevalier d'Orsay, she explains was born in 1801 to a Bonapartist general and a mother Baroness. In 1908, la Compagnie Française des Parfums d'Orsay is created. Over 5 million perfume bottles are sold in 1931"". Like Parfums Nicolaï, whose story is more recent. Patricia de Nicolaï and her husband Jean-Louis Michau launched together in 1989, this perfume brand, by using a simple and strong concept, coming from a long family history: ""a perfumer free to decide upon his choices, to create top-notch fragrances, with no marketing constraints"". A dual purpose: Patricia de Nicolai was experienced in working with one of the best creative teams in perfumery, and wanted to continue her work more independently and freely. Jean-Louis Michau, organizational consultant and researcher in economics, also wanted to set a new challenge for himself. The brand currently has a conditioning workshop located at La Ferté Saint Aubin, near Orleans, in the French Cosmetic Valley. On a covered area of 2.000m2, the production capacity can meet quickly any requests. Nicolaï has one of the richest collections of all in contemporary perfumery: 12 fragrances for women, 6 men's fragrances, 5 eaux de cologne, 4 eaux fraîches. from all these creations, a personal style emerges, with a predilection for white flowers and amber notes. The house has also strongly developed the creation of fragrances, currently declined in candles, sprays, and fragrances for lamps. Since 2006, all fragrance lamps have been grouped under the brand La Maison du Parfumeur. With four owned-stores in France (the latter being situated in the area of the Palais Royal in Paris) and more than 700 outlets worldwide, the brand now has the necessary basis for considering development on a larger scale, while maintaining high selectivity."
The US natural personal care market needs more authenticity,"On the occasion of the New York edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit [1], leaders and trendsetters of the natural personal care industry in the USA shared their views and opinions on the different pathways to sustainability. With the North American natural personal care industry dogged by green-washing accusations, they called for companies to authenticate their natural and organic products by adopting sustainability initiatives and consider third party certification. Horst Rechelbacher, founder of Aveda and Intelligent Nutrients, opened the 2-day conference by encouraging cosmetic companies to remove synthetics from their product formulations. However, Dr. Liliana George from Estée Lauder Companies recalled that ""using natural and organic ingredients does not make a product green"". She highlighted the need for a life cycle assessment, stating that consumers look at recyclability, pollution and packaging when considering sustainability. She looked at the use of green chemistry to reduce the environmental impact of beauty products. One key aspect of sustainability is ethical sourcing of raw materials. The Brazilian company Beraca shared its experiences in setting up sustainability projects at the edge of the Amazon basin. The subject was further explored by the presidents of Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps and Canaan Fair Trade. The two companies have partnered to ethically source organic and fair trade olive oil from Palestine. The Personal Care Products Council outlined the legal framework and loopholes in labelling and marketing organic and natural cosmetic products in the USA. Once the legal context clarified, an update on the tricky issue of eco-labels and regulations was given by the leading certification agencies. Joe Smillie from QAI International gave details of the newly introduced NSF ANSI 305 'contains organic' standard, which could become regulated similar to the USDA NOP standard for organic foods. Details were also given of the NPA and OASIS standards, followed by Cosmos and NaTrue, the leading certifications in Europe. Although there are differences between the various standards, all certification agencies agreed on the need for authenticity to validate legitimate brands. This sentiment was echoed by Jeff Binder from the North American retailer Saffron Rouge. A survey of 1,252 of its customers revealed that 77% have trust and confidence in third party certification, whereas 72% did not trust natural and organic claims made by brand owners. His company found that natural and organic brands that formulate and process their own ingredients have greater authenticity over others. His paper delivered a key message to brand owners, ""natural claims have an expiry date that is past, whereas third party certification was the way forward."" Tim Brasher, CEO of Jurlique, an Australian brand that has gained an international following partly because of its green and clean image, confirmed that authenticity was a critical success factor, provided that it can be proved and combined with performance, safety and value. He explained that Jurlique grows its own organic ingredients on its Australian farms.

MakeUp in Paris wants to stage colour-cosmetics,"MakeUp in Paris will bring together for the first time in the same venue the making-off of the make-up: developers and formulators, packaging manufacturers, converters, full-service businesses, designers, make-up schools and make-up artists. While there no more exhibition space available, the organisers say that: ""nearly 400 people have so far pre-registered online. For a very large part, they work in marketing, development and purchasing teams and not only from the big names in the Beauty industry but also from a number of small to medium sizes companies"". A wide variety of geographical areas are represented: Western Europe, of course, North and South America, Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia. ""Each of the 32 partners received his roadmap to organize in the best way his presentation space and actively participate to the make-up animations which will enliven these two days dedicated in staging their products,"" says Sandra Maguarian, MakeUp inParis' Show Manager. Make-up schools and renowned make-up Artists such as Damien Dufresne, Max Herlant, or Takuya Motohashi will co-operate to this animations. Each of the industrial partners is going to stage his products at a given time and during a determined period of time. Thirty make-up animations will be set-up in the aisles of MakeUp in Paris, truly comparable to plays showing visitors major make-up trends in the world. ""Suprise and amazement will be at the turn of every aisle, every showroom or showbox to welcome visitors."" Make Up For Ever, the renown French brand of professional make-up, spontaneously adopted the concept of MakeUp in Paris by providing their assistance in the setting-up of the ""make-up spaces"". The brand will also detail its success story during a conference where Dany Sanz and Jacques Waneph will explain how a make-up virtuoso launched successfully a training school and then a make-up line for professionals, which ended up being one of LVMH group's biggest commercial success. Furthermore, the CEW France, an association gathering about 270 women who all have responsibilities in the Beauty business, will organize a meeting on the occasion of MakeUp in Paris."
Global colour cosmetics market projected to reach US$41.4 billion by 2015,"""Characteristic growth drivers, such as, higher disposable incomes, propensity to spend, deeper product penetration among youth, and preference towards expensive formulations, which currently lie dormant as a result of the weak economic climate, are all forecast to spring back into action in the post recession period,"" reveals markets research firm Global Industry Analysts in a new report titled Color Cosmetics: A Global Strategic Business Report. Europe and Asia-Pacific have the strongest consummation rates and dominate the global colour cosmetics market. Colour cosmetic is a dynamic segment driven by innovation. Formulators are creating sophisticated products to offer multiple benefits such as moisturisation, UV protection, aging treatment, long-lasting effects, ease of use, and convenience. As a consequence, the delineation between skin care and colour cosmetics continues to fade, as consumers look beyond dynamic colour, and luminescence effects of colour cosmetics. Also, cosmetic products that include natural, and organic ingredients such as plant extracts, and vitamin E are rising in popularity, and make-up products are also affected by the trend. Foundations have shied away from the use of heavy opaque pigments, to incorporate light-capturing crystals, such as mother-of-pearl, topaz, and rose quartz, in order to produce a perfect skin illusion, without the feel and look of makeup. Foundations have also become more closely allied with skin care product formulations. Intense lip colour, non-smudge wet look formulas, and colours enriched with vitamins A, C and E have proved to be popular. Manufacturers eyeing a gold mine of opportunity to pump their sales would need to combine shimmering, shiny textures, long-lasting formula, and caring properties, in a convenient stick form for easy application. Eye make-up is one of the fastest growing categories with lot of new battery operated mascaras providing volumizing and wet look features."
Formulations and packaging trends : transversal thinking is a key to success,"In the not-too-distant future, the ability of personal care brands and their suppliers to create value will rest upon their ability to generate a transversal thinking, according to Gerald Martines, Director, New Product Development - Make-Up, Rexam Personal Care Division. The industry veteran gave his vision at the recent PCD Congress in Paris, a worldwide ""crossroads"" show dedicated to packaging innovations for the perfume and cosmetic sectors. ""In the current, global economic context, it is critical to raise the bar on innovation in order to provide brand owners with novel solutions that address the challenges of our times, prepare us for the future and differentiate themselves from the competition,"" Martines explained during his PCD Congress seminar. ""That is why we use the term transversal thinking,"" Martines said. ""Savvy marketers and suppliers will work together to knock down product category silos and develop new-breed offerings that create marketplace excitement through real end-user benefits"". According to Gerald Martines, formulations are impacted by mega-trends such the pursuit of ageless beauty, health, safety and comfort. Packaging is impacted by other mega-trends, such as concerns over sustainability, convenience, the never-ending quest for differentiation and the global move towards affordable premiumization. ""Industry leaders are at the crossroads of cultural anthropology, chemistry, engineering and commerce – an exciting place to be"". According to Gerald Martines, key areas to watch include: – Convergence. Martines anticipates more ""hybrid"" products, such as crossover cosmetic and skin-care offerings. The recently launched L'Oreal Collagen Care lipsticks are one example; – Complex Formulations. More multi-purpose, fragile, preservative-free formulas are on the way, in virtually all market segments, from colour cosmetics to anti-aging serums. – Diversification of Formula Chemical Composition. Lipsticks are an example, Martines states, with the growth of non-conventional formulas with softer textures, higher concentration of active ingredients, volatile chemical bases, etc. vs. the traditional ""wax-and-pigment"" products; – Blurring of Boundaries Between Packaging Categories. It is predictable that airless packaging will see its applications grow outside of its traditional chasse gardée of skincare and into colour cosmetics, for example, according to Martines. – Integrated Packaging Solutions. Such as compacts that conveniently and cleanly dispense loose powder or liquid formulations, instead of the traditional pressed powder. – New Regulations. With more stringent regulations applicable to cosmetics on the way by 2011, we may expect development of more hybrid products. ""Thus, we will see more active ingredients, less structural additives and preservatives and more multi-benefit formulas – resulting in packaging that offers neutrality, airtight design, high barrier properties, UV protection, precision dosage, and new dispensing systems for non-conventional formulas,"" Martines said. ""We are in a fast-changing, challenging environment – it is an incredibly exciting time to be in our industry."""
Esxence enhances artistic perfumery,"After its first edition just one year ago, Esxence, the event dedicated to artistic perfumery, is making a reappearance in Milan (Italy) from 25 to 28 March 2010, at the Palazzo della Permanente (via Turati 34) which, since 1884, has been one of the most prestigious locations for art exhibitions in the Lombardy's capital. After its unexpected and extremely positive debut last year, Esxence takes on an international flavour, welcoming 133 brands (compared to 86 in 2009). The application of each participant has been closely examined by a panel of European distributors and retailers, with the aim to admit only the brands that are consistent with the event's focus on artistic perfumery. The selection process included a ""qualitative-artistic analysis"" based on the image and the philosophy of the brand, and its ""aesthetic-stylistic coherence"", as well as an analysis of the brands' distribution profile with criteria such as ""quality and selectivity"" and a ""market share that must not exceed 0.2%"". According to the organisers, artistic perfumery could be defined as a business which mixes ""artistic and craftsman like contents"" with ""the highest levels of professionalism, quality and personality"". Actually, this conception is a kind of return to the basics of luxury, in the same way as the slow-food concept is not only a reaction to the fast-junk-food business but also a consistent and holistic theory of what makes life good. ""Artistic perfumery is a way of thinking, creating and bringing to life products with a slow philosophy that penetrates the final consumer, who is led to absorb not the product tout-court but, first of all, a concept, a creative desire made to last and not subject to trends and hit and runs,"" the organisers confirm. Esxence aims to become a unique opportunity for insiders of the artistic perfumery sector, including brand owners [1], designers, distributors and retailers, to meet each-others. The event aims at creating opportunities for reflection and the creation of new ideas. Experts, such as Michael Edwards, author of Perfume Legends: French Feminine Fragrances, a cult book that narrates the story of the greatest fragrances, and Maurice Maurin, perfumer, creator of great masterworks and author of La Sagesse du Créateur de Parfum, will also contribute to the event's programme. Among the innovations in this 2010 edition will also be the presence of the persons behind websites and blogs, all accredited and recognised in the world of artistic perfumery - such as the American contributor, Sniffapalooza, or the Anglo-German, Basenotes, the Italian blog Bergamotto&Benzoino and the web-site, Extrait.it - who also contributed the organisation of the event. Esxence will see the participation of the Osmothèque, the World Conservatory of historical fragrances located in Versailles, France. ""Well aware that the final consumers play a fundamental role in the development and awareness of niche perfumery"", the organizers of Esxence will also welcome certain connoisseurs by invitation on Saturday 27 and Sunday 28 March, 2010. The public will be able to further its knowledge of the brands on display or make new olfactory acquaintances through the presence of the Osmothèque and workshops to discover essences from different continents, organised by Mouillettes & Co., experts in the sector."
What kind of growth for global cosmetic markets in 2010?,"The year 2010 looks better, and several operators, in particular from the supply side, have already noticed a marked upturn. According to Eurostaf, ""from 2011, the market should resume with growth rates close to those experienced between 2004 and 2007. However, this general picture hides contrasted situations"". In geographical terms, perspectives for growth appear very different from one region to another. Western Europe, the world's biggest cosmetics market, North America and Japan, still represent the bulk of sales. But these markets are mature, with important penetration rates for all product categories. Growth in these countries should remain moderate, with the possible exception of the men's market. In contrast, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia (excluding Japan) are developing very rapidly. Among the emerging markets, three of them already rank among the 10 largest consumers of cosmetic products: Brazil, China and Russia. Brazil even stands first for hair care products, and perhaps also for perfumery. Hence, no wonder if cosmetics giants focus their efforts in these new markets. For L'Oreal, these markets should represent 50% of the group's sales in less than 10 years. Furthermore, while the group already operates 60% of its activity outside Europe, this proportion should increase to 90%. Actually, L'Oréal intends to attract and retain nearly one billion new customers. A strategy of growth that is shared by many others: such as Yves Rocher, who intends to develop outsourcing and to open offshore production facilities to better serve Indian, Chinese or Korean woman, or by Shiseido, who wants to increase the share of overseas markets in its turnover from 35% today to 50% by 2017. Although they remain marginal in terms of market share, organic and natural cosmetics continue to surge and appear crisis-proof. According to a recent study by Kline, the natural and organic cosmetic market posted another double-digit growth in 2009, and its compound annual growth rate since 2004 exceeds 15%. Nothing indicates that this growth should be interrupted, especially as natural products are also very popular in emerging countries. Brazil is already the world's second largest consumer of natural cosmetic products and Indian and Chinese traditions promise a good potential to naturals. As far as the different market segments are concerned, skincare products appear as the strongest propeller of growth while makeup, hair care products and hygiene products should experience a more moderate progress, finds Eurostaf. However, the potential of makeup is very strong in Asia, including Japan. From this point of view, with the purchase of Bare Escentuals, Shiseido appears to win on all fronts, acquiring a specialist of natural makeup, which holds strong positions in North America and a good growth potential ins Asia. The crisis has also increased the disparities between levels of ranges: prestige and high-end ranges suffered while mass-market ranges were more resistant."
Brazil: double-digit growth forecasted for the next five years,"Sueli Ortega - Which categories showed the best results in 2009? João Carlos Basílio - In the Personal Care segment, toothpaste is one of the categories that can be highlighted, because it is a category with a very high penetration rate, an acquired societal habit. The category's growth rate was about 8,4% in volume in 2009. The expectation of the industry was that this sector product category would generate a growth rate similar to the growth of the Brazilian population - 1,8%, or at maximum 2%. However, in 2009, this category grew 8.4% in volume (17,5% in value), that is to say, far beyond the general economy or population growth, in a category that encompasses all the social classes, it is a sign of a bigger potential for it and for other related categories. Other top sellers were the soaps, with a growth in volume between 15 and 18%, and with revenues growing by 27%. We have observed that liquid soaps have conquered the bathroom area little by little and it is being incorporated now into the shower box, where the greatest preference in the country is still the bar soap. And vegetal soaps are also penetrating the market. Actually, everything has its roots in economics. Over the last years, the animal tallow has been used as ingredient for diesel fuel, and as a consequence the price of animal tallow triplicated. So the price difference between animal tallow and vegetal mass, which was 10 times, was reduce to 2 or 3 times. Thus, the price of prestige soap decreased by 3 to 4 times, which allows a soap production of very good quality, with a differentiated mass and at an accessible price. Society is more and more considering its cost benefit. Sueli Ortega - Does the fall of exportations led to actions and new programs for the export sector? João Carlos Basílio - What happened is that Brazilian exports of Personal Care, Perfumery and Cosmetics sector fell by 15.5% in volume in 2009 and 9.3% in value, dropping to US$ 364 millions. Exports were impacted by the evolution of currency rates - in particular the valuation of the real against the dollar. However, our analysis is that the performance of our sector can be considered as very good. If you do not consider commodities but only manufactured products, the fall of Brazilian exportations exceeds 25%. In some cases it reaches 40%. Our sector fell by 9.3% in a very difficult context for the export of manufactured goods. It is something like - it is bad, but it is good. It wasn't a positive result, however in face of the negative picture that crisis was reflected through the exportations of all countries; to us the picture was very good. Now, the positive side of this issue is that we have today 42 companies involved in an exportation project and are in a covenant with Apex [1], these companies grew by15%. Exports grew by 15%. In other words, companies that are under the Apex umbrella and receive ABIHPEC´s consulting had an excellent performance, they grew by 15%, with a US$ 92 million result. Sueli Ortega - Were Brazilian exportations for the sector stronger in South America? João Carlos Basílio - Yes, but the weight of South America is more important for overall Brazilian exports. As far as our sector is concerned the dilution is greater. We sell in 128 countries. In this region the main buyers are: Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. Sueli Ortega - How did the perfumery market perform? Brazil was already the second world's perfumery market in 2008. João Carlos Basílio - We have ranked as the second market for perfumery products since 2007. We have consolidated these numbers in 2008 and we are getting closer to the first place. In 2008 Brazil had already a 10.7% market share worldwide. The United States had 16.1%. In 2009 the weight of the US market has probably decreased while Brazil's contribution should have progressed to 12% or 13%. We anticipate because, as I told you, these data are not consolidated yet, but I can dare to say that we are nowadays the largest fragrance market in the world. We had a growth of 15.72% (a 16% high in value and 3.5% in volume in 2009). If you consider the inflation in the period, around 4.5%, this means that we have achieved 11 to 12% real growth, which is good, exceptional! Sueli Ortega - Brazil stands out for its performance in the hair market. What is the market share for this category in 2009? João Carlos Basílio - If we take the conditioner category, Brazil is already the biggest worldwide market since 2005. This means that 1 out every 5 conditioners sold in the world is sold in Brazil. We are the world's main consumer of hair conditioners. If we take the category of permanent wave and relaxers, we are also the greatest market worldwide since 2005. If we take the category of permanent and relaxing we are also the largest market since 2005. If we take hair dye, we are already the largest market of the world since 2007, we had 14% market share in 2008. We had in 2009 a 25.345 thousand tons volume in sales. Certainly in 2009 we will surpass the 15% market share in the world. Sueli Ortega - And regarding the makeup market? Is Brazil walking at large steps? João Carlos Basílio - It is a very good market, impressive. Here in Brazil the products for nails and lips always predominated. Yet today, face and eyes products are growing too and products for nails have become the smallest market in the makeup category. In the eyes segment, our market grew by 30.74% in volume, and in the face segment it grew by 30.84% in volume. Currently lips are still the largest market in the country, but eyes makeup is already very close, it is growing by 26% in value. Sueli Ortega - What are the forecasts for growth in 2010? João Carlos Basílio - Just consider that toothpaste had a growth around 8.4% with the highest rate of penetration, and that all other categories were growing. So I can say that ABIHPEC´s forecast is that in the next 5 years we should continue to have a double-digit growth. Real growth, deflated. The ABIHPEC is celebrating 15 years this year and we are also completing 15th years of growth in the double digits."
Vivaness 2010: natural cosmetics enter new era,"Vivaness (World Trade Fair for Natural Personal Care and Wellness) was held from February 17 to 20, 2010 at the Nuremberg fairground, together with BioFach (World Organic Trade Fair). About 43,500 trade visitors, of which 38 % foreign visitors, attended both events: a 7% drop compared to the 46,771 visitors recorded in 2009. The number of exhibitors was also declining: 2,557 this year, compared to 2733 in 2009. ""The organic-market has stood up to the crisis. The passed 4 days of the fair demonstrated this sector has kept the pot boiling. The organic-trend and the trend to an ecologically sustainable consumption continue,"" commented Claus Rättich, Member of the Management Board, NürnbergMesse. However, Vivaness alone is a much smaller event: 183 exhibitors (205 in 2009) from 21 countries (24 in 2009) including Germany (88), France (29), Italy (16), Great Britain (12) and Austria (8). The show comprehensively reflected the market and trade buyers looking for an overview of trends, new products, new brand positioning and international developments for natural cosmetics were on the right track there. The benefits of the visit was enhanced by the Vivaness Forum, the congress programme accompanying the exhibition, which provided production, marketing and trade professionals with the latest figures and assessments from international experts - a worthwhile look into the future of the market for natural beauty care! Despite of this dull economic context, the natural cosmetics market is still growing. Lows and highs of the economy have astonishingly little effect on a market that has been recording stable growth from more than a decade. According to the British market research institute Organic Monitor, worldwide sales are growing by 1 billion US dollars a year and are currently estimated at approximately 7 billion US dollars. As in the case of organic food, the demand is concentrated on Europe and North America. The American market accounts for 4.5 billion. In 2008 the entire German market for certified natural cosmetics had grown by almost 10 % to 672 million EUR and reached a market share of 5.3 % of total sales of cosmetics. Estimations indicate that European sales figures rose by 13 % in 2009. The market volume in Europe could reach 2 billion EUR in 2010. France and Germany show the fastest growth. At international level, the United States and Asia, primarily Japan and Korea, are the leading buyer markets. Consumers' priorities are clearly changing from a meant-is-cool mentality to more awareness of value for money, and a stronger focus on product quality. Besides the powers of persuasion of the products and the general trend to naturalness, the growing popularity of natural cosmetics is also due to their growing availability in all sales channels, including mass market, an increased media presence and a variety of innovations. German and international companies are positioning themselves with innovative products. There is now much more investment in researching and securing highly effective, selected natural raw materials and in effectiveness tests than in earlier years. Makers of natural and organic cosmetics are adopting a new corporate culture: the development of new processes, and the investment in very modern production facilities are now as important as the attention to sustainability, environmental protection and biodiversity or fair trade. ""Sales Hit of the Year"" awards were presented once again in 2010. A total of 298 new products had registered for the organic event of the year. The Vivaness exhibitors showed 63 innovative individual products and product lines and BioFach exhibitors 235. The decisive factor for winning the award was the number of times the new products were scanned at the POS in organic food shops and organic supermarkets. The Jury Awards for BioFach and Vivaness also took other factors into account, such as company's innovativeness or the overall market presence. This year's winners at Vivaness were the Dr. Hauschka's Skin Soothing Mask and Weleda's Pomegranate Beauty Shower. The Vivaness Jury Award went to the neobio brand of Logocos AG for a wise and bold brand policy. Last year's relaunch helped the brand to achieve a modern and innovative presence. Neobio managed to attract a young target group and several products made it to the Top 50 new product sales. Many new green cosmetic brands are currently capturing the international market. The spectrum ranges from inexpensive trade brands to luxurious green glamour products. This broad spectrum of products is reflected in diversified and innovative marketing concepts. The increasing availability of certified natural cosmetics in all trading formats means there are good candidates to a rapid expansion. However, the recent emergence of new labels and test symbols, and certification procedures have not helped to made orientation easier for trade and consumers. The harmonization of standards has to be pushed further. The next Vivaness (and BioFach) will be hold on 16-19 February 2011 at the Nuremberg fairground."
The future of aerosols,"Premium Beauty News - Aerosol, a product which celebrated its fiftieth anniversary last year and for which controversy has not failed! A product yet more alive than ever! Michel Fontaine - You have summarized the subject quite well! This product has been and remains, dare we say, fantastic! And its designers were far from imagining the huge advance that their invention was going to generate over the years. Figures are stubborn! The consumption is annually of 11 billion units worldwide, including 4 billion in the United States, 600 million in France. China, who ten years ago, was a only dwarf in this area will this year, use 1 billion units! Not bad for a product promised to oblivion by the end of the 1980s! Premium Beauty News - Truly, this industry has also learned a lot! Michel Fontaine - Quite true! The use of freon as a propellant gas is ancient history. We are in the era of hydrocarbons and tomorrow we will be able to use compressed air. Which proves by the way, the huge adaptability of this industry to new constraints whether environmental, technical or consumerist. Premium Beauty News - Yet, you are organizing during Aerosol Forum [1], a workshop with a slightly provocative topic: ""A world without aerosols?"" Michel Fontaine - But this is precisely where we are going to understand the vital nature of this conditioning. After fifty years of high technology developments, aerosols can be seen in the daily life of everyone, in the bathroom, kitchen, workshop or garage. They also take a part in the packaging of some drugs. And in the industry, they are also used for highly developed technical products. But throughout the two days other topics will also be tackled with subjects related to Design and Sustainable Development, and to latest technical innovations. Premium Beauty News - Another novelty, the formula ""Paris Aerosol restaurant! Michel Fontaine - Indeed, the meal will give the participants an opportunity to switch from theory to practice. The meal will be embellished with aerosol conditioned products and products elaborated by Pierre Dominique Cécillon (Academie Cinq sens, Paris) and his team. The purpose of which will be to convince dinners of the the potentiality of aerosol technology for every day meals and catering."
Natural personal care industry to attract investments in 2010,"Improving economic conditions and easing of capital restrictions will make investors target the high-growth natural personal care sector in 2010, analyses Organic Monitor in its new Strategic Insights report [1]. After a lull period of 18 months that followed the financial crisis of 2008-2009, major deals have restarted in the natural personal care industry. Bare Escentuals was acquired by Shiseido last month in a US$ 1.7 billion deal, whilst Clarins completed its purchase of Kibio a few weeks ago. European companies are expected to be involved in major deals in 2010 because of the lack of 'investable' companies in North America. Indeed, ""many leading American companies have already been acquired, leaving relatively few suitable privately-owned companies."" Companies in North America - such as Bare Escentuals and Burt's Bees - have been purchased at over 3-5 times their sales revenues. High prices are being paid by investors looking to emulate Estee Lauder's success with Aveda. Since its purchase in 1997, Aveda has grown manifold to become a global brand of natural personal care products. The report finds the most successful natural personal care companies are those that receive investment and continue to operate as separate entities. Aveda and Burt's Bees are cited as such companies that have continued to show positive growth. In comparison, those that have been acquired and integrated into larger corporations (such as Sanoflore, bought by L'Oreal in 2006) have not realised their growth potential. ""A major reason is that natural personal care companies are typically small enterprises with strong ethical values which do not always fit well into larger profit-driven organisations,"" Organic Monitor comments. Organic Monitor's upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, taking place at Grand Hyatt Hotel, New York, 24-26th March 2010, will highlight the report's key findings, with details of the major deals and future growth projections."
"Dieter Bakic: ""2010, still a challenging year !""","Premium Beauty News - How was your activity like in 2009? Dieter Bakic - For stock packaging, we encountered decreased re-buy quantities and product launch activities in all countries. The only difference was the point in time, when the activities slowed down. USA was the first one, shortly followed by Russia and then by Europe. For design services, we had a high level of activity in 2009. Some customers wanted to be ready with new shapes when the market turns and others sought for competitive differentiation via colours and graphics. Premium Beauty News - Is the recovery really back and what are your predictions for 2010? Dieter Bakic - We feel a higher level of activity compared to the same time in 2009. Although customers are still cautious and are ordering smaller volumes at shorter lead times, the outlook is more positive than one year ago. This does not mean that recovery is fully back and we believe that 2010 will still be a challenging year. Premium Beauty News - Environmental labelling, legislative pressures of all kinds ...., how do you cope with regulatory developments in your area. Are they constraints or opportunities? Dieter Bakic - Opportunities because these developments make you consider new aspects and ideas. Moreover, only by overcoming constraints you add value to your product and service portfolio and that is what customer's value and why they finally purchase from you. Premium Beauty News - Relocation, partial of full subcontracting in Asia or elsewhere... what is the ideal balance? Dieter Bakic - The decision to produce in a low cost country depends for us on the type of customer you serve, the products involved and the speed of reactivity you need. We decide on a case by case basis and consider aspects like what regional market we want to supply, the necessary level of automation, size of investments, environmental and transportation costs and the complexity of the supply chain. The balance can be different depending on the project and the customer."
Japan: long live the elderly!,"""People live to be old in Japan, nowadays"" explains Florence Bernardin, director of Information & Inspiration, who developed a passion for this country she visits several times a year. Japanese people, and specially Japanese women, actually set new records in terms of longevity. The number of centenarians in the country exceeds 40 000 (including 37 000 women). Japan is in fact facing an unprecedented demographic crisis. With a birth rate not exceeding 1.37 children per woman in 2008, some demographers have announced that the population could fall from 127 million today to 100 million in 2050. One thing is sure: the country is confronted with a rapidly aging population. Yet, people over sixty years of age brought up with consumer society have very different behaviors from generations that preceded them. They do not want to give up their status as consumers, even though their needs change. According to Florence Bernardin, ""Purchase of cosmetic products by the 60 years of age generation, represents 19% of the total cosmetics market. With an annual increase of +4%"". There is a lot at stake for cosmetic manufacturers, knowing that according to a survey ordered by Shiseido in 2007, 50% of women of this class of age believe there is not a single brand meeting their needs. Different type of answers are found in surveys concerning the Japanese market: – Firstly an hyper range segmentation per age group. The cosmetic market in 2008 witnessed the launch of lines entirely dedicated to women over 40 years of age, who account for more than 60% of the cosmetic market in Japan. Kanebo debuted on the 60-something age segment with the launch of Chicca, followed by Shiseido with Elexir Prior. Both products lines were highlighted with their reference icons for a greater proximity with targeted women. – Then a discourse where nostalgia is put forward, and which is complemented with a rise in the price range. High-end creams was the most developed category in 2008. The number of creams exceeding 20,000 Yens (retail price = 150 Euros) has increased by 24% compared to 2004. – Finally, older men are not forgotten and in turn become the target of brand marketing. But the Nippon archipelago is also struck by an unprecedented economic slump which goes back to the early 1990s after the burst of the financial and real estate bubble in the late 1980s. Successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to revive the economy through costly programs of public works which as a result, exploded the national debt. The Koizumi government (2001-2006) tried to remedy this situation through a policy of structural reform. Without much success, since a new recovery plan was required to overcome the last financial crisis (2008-2009). Under such circumstances, according to the OECD, Japan's public debt could reach 200% of GDP at the end of 2010. This situation has severe consequences on the lifestyle and consumption habits of many Japanese and has forced firms to adapt their strategy. Thus, Shiseido, like other major Japanese companies, has chosen to direct its development overseas, particularly aiming at Asian emerging markets. In the home market, responses to crisis have been multiple, from plain and sharp price decline, to more sophisticated consumer appeal attempts, particularly in seeking greater proximity (development of the retail offer in places such as stations, by developing pocket stores, ephemeral stores, vending machines) and facilities (payment with the travel card, mobile phones, etc..). Brands and retailers have also provided consumers with new shopping experiences during which luxury is synonymous with exclusivity, where consumer places become places of emotional discovery, etc.. The Internet is obviously playing a major part, if only to be a source of information for consumers (according to 70% of Japanese women over 20 years of age) but also as real growth engine through e-commerce. The conclusion of Florence Bernardin? ""In a difficult market, only innovation and responsiveness may help provide good products and good ideas at the right time. This requires constant attention, close follow-up of emerging trends, and the ability to identify good ideas as they arise""."
Potential of social media is underexploited by cosmetic brands,"John Marshall Roberts, communications strategist and CEO of Worldview Learning, will explore the gamut of social media outlets available to beauty companies, highlighting their applications in marketing, sales, public relations and customer service. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other social media channels have particular significance to natural and organic personal care companies since these companies sometimes struggle to communicate their brand / product values to consumers. Research by Organic Monitor finds that consumers cannot always distinguish pure natural and organic products from competing ones. Indeed, many often confuse conventional beauty products with legitimate natural / organic ones because of the lack of regulations for product labelling & marketing. Thus, word-of-mouth is the most important communication channel for natural & organic brands. According to Organic Monitor, most buyers get product information from friends & family. Furthermore, most users of natural & organic beauty products are well-educated and IT savvy, making them ideally placed for social media marketing campaigns. ""Social media can dramatically increase return on investment for marketing dollars if done correctly, as they allow brands to generate a global following of loyal customers with relatively low investment,"" John Marshall Roberts states. He highlights Burt's Bees and Sephora as two companies that are using social media effectively, however Roberts states the use of social media in the natural & organic beauty industry remains largely underexploited, and that there is tremendous room for growth. On the occasion of the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which will be held at Grand Hyatt Hotel, New York on March 24-26th, Roberts will give case studies of companies who have successfully integrated social media channels into their marketing strategy."
Bioplastics market to rise together with sustainability trend,"New bio-based polymers have been available in the market for approximately one decade. Recently, standard polymers like polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC or PET, but also high-performance polymers like polyamide or polyester have been totally or partially substituted by their renewable raw materials equivalents. The starting raw materials are usually sugars or starches, partially also recycled materials from food or wood processing. The production capacity of agro-based plastics is projected to increase from 360,000 tons in 2007 to about 2.3 million tons by 2013. This corresponds to an annual growth of 37 percent. In a study commissioned byEuropean Bioplastics, the European association representing the interests of the industry along the complete bioplastics' value chain, and theEuropean Polysaccharide Network of Excellence (EPNOE), researchers from Utrecht University found a substitution potential of up to 90 percent of the total consumption of plastics by bio-based polymers to be technically possible. As a consequence, producers of bioplastics are investing heavily in production capabilities. ""European Bioplastics' members are investing in new plants, in further innovation and cooperations. For example, Nature Works just doubled its production capacity of PLA and Braskem made big investments for this year's start-up of bio-based PE. BASF introduced new biodegradable plastics for coating paper and shrink-film, while Purac, Sulzer and Synbra kicked off a cooperation in the field of foamed PLA products,"" said the association. ""Of course we still have a long way to go, before we can actually talk about real market penetration. On the other hand, Rome wasn't build in a day, either,"" says Andy Sweetman, Chairman of the European Bioplastics' Board. However, assessing the environmental impacts and benefits is not always easy, especially when it comes to the development of new materials, there are potential pitfalls, which both consumers and environmentalists will be all too quick to point out. While bioplastics are supposed to be fully biodegradable and made from entirely renewable resources, questions have been raised about the sustainability of certain farming methods used to grow the raw materials. ""There are a number of alternatives on the market but most of them cannot guarantee that they did not use genetically modified plants to produce the starch which is the raw material for the bioplastic. We chose to take the safest possible route and to refuse all products that cannot guarantee they are free from GMO material,"" says Jonas Adler, who is commercial manager of Iggesund's value-added products. Iggesund recently launched Invercote Bio, a biodegradable version of its high-end Invercote board, which is coated with bioplastic. Despite the fact that virtually no schemes to recycle the material currently exist, Adler considers that ""paperboard coated with bioplastic has a fantastic future, because it fits into all the future waste scenarios prescribed in the EU's packaging directive, be they recycling, energy recovery, composting or anaerobic treatment. No other material is suitable for all these different scenarios – and sharp-witted customers have already realised this."""
Maesa: optimism for 2010,"Maesa, which is positioned as a designer and manufacturer of beauty products, scented products, as well as tailor-made packaging products, is considering the year 2010 with confidence. According to Julien Saada, the group's President, ""2010 can only, it is obvious, be better than the year we just passed"". Explanations… In January 2009, Maesa moved to new headquarters, in a 1700 square metres building that gathers under a single roof all the group's operations located in France. The new premises also feature a laboratory for the formulation of cosmetic products, and two design workshops. In parallel, the group strengthened its sales team for the English market as well as its export team. The divisions ""promotions"" and ""packaging"" are merged under the supervision of Nathalie Bringant, while Zorbit LCC (turnover; 45 million dollars), Maesa's US subsidiary, a specialist of luxury packaging for luxury and beauty brands, that the group acquired on December 2008, changed its name to Maesa LLC. Maesa's managers prefer describing their activity with the words Engineering Beauty that match with a mission that covers all the operations ""from design to the finished product"". Other people would describe such activity a full service. ""There are four miin axes within our business model, tells Julien Saada, bringing added value to brands and retailers, manufacturing on demand, outsourcing the development and the production, and being a source of cost reduction for brands and retailers"". From a commercial perspective, the main highlights for Maesa consisted in the creation of cosmetic ranges for famous international brands, such as, for instance, the creation of two full make-up lines for Oviesse, the Italian leading retailer of mid-market clothes, a subsidiary of the Coin group. The group also created the entire cosmetic range of Old Navy, a subsidiary of the Gap group, and, four collections of scented products for Alinéa and the development of a range of scented products for Target. Another highlight, which perfectly suited with the motto ""from branding to finished product"" that is claimed by Maesa, the launch of the first eau de parfum for the brand of high-end ready-to-wear clothes, Zadig & Voltaire. Or also, the creation of a perfume, 50 Cent, which is named after the famous US rap singer, and which was launched at Macy's. Maesa, also created a perfume and its derived products for Kim Kardashian, as well as make-up palette for Lauren Luke, a make-up artist who is using the internet for selling its products along with makeup advices. For the first time in Europe, Maesa's team also created a whole range of specific primary packaging for Marionnaud's Asiatic bath line, as well as Sephora's coffrets and gift packs for Christmas 2009. As far as the group activity for exclusive brands, let's mention a perfume line for Kat Von D, in exclusivity at Sepfora in the US, and a makeup line for Bare Escentuals. Eventually, regarding outsourcing, Maesa's team have created the coffrets for Interpafums' Quicksilver and ST Dupont brands, as well as a coffret for promotional scents for Estée Lauder. ""Regarding the outlook for 2010 for the beauty sector, explains Julien Saada, it is good. In particular thanks to the new contracts we signed with speciality retailers, the confirmation of our rise on the packaging market in Europe in partnership with prestigeous brands, and the rationalisation of our customers portfolio. Our historic and strong positioning among retailer's private labels remains an asset when consumption is boosted by governmental measures in a dull economic context. Furthermore, we are feeling the emergence of a new dimension regarding the contracts we are signing for developing the cosmetics range of international brands. There is clearly a growth in the choice for outsourcing among prestige beauty brands""."
MakeUp in Paris takes advantage of a dynamic make-up market,"In every country, every retail channel, the segment is growing at least in value where sales volumes are already high. Of course, the famous ""lipstick effect"" according to which women would have a tendency to buy as much or even more lipstick in times of crisis has had a contrasting influence according to countries and segments. Variations are mainly due to maturity reasons and lack of genuine novelties on some marketplaces. Make-up for the eyes, which is the largest segment of the market and the one that has offered the most innovations, has performed very well, thanks in particular to its champion, mascara. With its brand new brushes (with spikes, motorized, adjustable or retractable…) and new formulae (super lengthening, curving, protective or volume…), the 2009 vintage was simply outstanding. So mascara has been widely acclaimed by women who welcome those launches that brands described as major, or even revolutionary. Women also acclaimed the second segment in make-up, foundation creams, attracted by the latest formulae and the latest packaging advances in mineral powders on the one hand, and assertions for care, ranging from moisturizing to the sacrosanct anti-aging offered by foundation creams, on the other hand. Because if consumers believe the product is worth it, if they perceive the value added, they will still and always go wild over it. The dynamism of make-up sales probably explains why the arrival of new players is announced in a market that still has a reputation for being complicated due to the high number of references it requires. Dolce & Gabbana with Procter & Gamble, Michael Kors with Estée Lauder (Very Hollywood), Ungaro with Avon (U by Ungaro) and even Burberry are moving to the starting line to offer women a key giving them access to their universe. These new comers will thus increase pressure on a market that is bcoming increasingly complex. Besides the French company, Couleur Caramel and the Australian company, Nvey Eco, among others, operators in conventional beauty have also set off for the big adventure of the so called ""ethnic"" skins or the one of natural makeup: L'Oréal and its Bare Naturale line, Yves Rocher with Couleurs Nature, Revlon with Almay Pure Blends, and Bourjois with its new brand, Une, displaying natural shades and packaging inspired from new technologies… A number of initiatives that should allow the market to continue to attract even more women –in France, they are only 2 out of 3 to use make-up - and thus guarantee its prosperity for tomorrow. MakeUp in Paris, the new appointment of the make-up industry, will take place on June 24th and 25th, 2010 at l'Espace Pierre Cardin."
"""Recovery is still fragile,"" Joël Palix, Clarins","Premium Beauty News - How did the market react during the end of the year festivities? Joël Palix - For fragrances, 2009 has probably been the worst year our profession experienced for a very long time. France, Britain and Germany resisted rather well. Italy and the Middle East are on the decline. Spain, travel retail and the United States have fallen sharply. Asia is slightly progressing. I am generally speaking of the profession here and not of our brands which performed well in particular Mugler. Premium Beauty News - Is recovery really back? Joël Palix - There are some encouraging signs, the last quarter was good, Christmas sales in stores too. Premium Beauty News - Environmental labelling, legislative pressures of all sorts, how do you cope with regulatory developments in your sector? Joël Palix - All this must be perceived as an opportunity like sustainable development, but the big issue remains in the fact that restrictions on ingredients have reduced the palette the nose of the perfume designer was working with. Premium Beauty News - Relocation, partial or full subcontracting in Asia or elsewhere... What sort of balance do you think, needs to be found? Joël Palix - Precisely, the proper balance must be found between cost, flexibility and also creativity. Playing with manufacturing options accordingly."
Bright prospects for MakeUp in Paris,"The organizers of MakeUp in Paris - who also own Premium Beauty News - are delighted with the enthusiastic welcome the beauty sector offered to their project. Only two months after its launch, ""80% of the available space has been rented to suppliers in the make-up industry most of them being heavy weights of the sector,"" comments Sandra Maguarian, Show Manager. Among them are: Ancorotti Cosmetics, Faber-Castell Cosmetics, Fiabila, HCP, Jackel and Strand Cosmetics Europe. ""We are receiving enthusiastic reviews and a lot of support from all sides. People we meet have understood that this is not a simple show in the classic sense, but much more an event meant to enhance efforts for innovation, research and development which are so important in the universe of make-up"", adds Sandra Maguarian. For instance, Pilar Gonzalez, communication manager at Geka Brush explains their choice to participate in MakeUp Paris because they ""feel it will be an extraordinary and unique event focused on make-up. This is a event we are looking forward to."" For Katherin Hecht, Faber-Castell Cosmetics, ""it's just the right time, the right place and the right team of connoisseurs to organize such an event"". As far as brands are concerned, Daniel Saclier, Guerlain, considers that ""MakeUp in Paris is an excellent initiative that I am sponsoring on behalf of the Guerlain brand at a time when, precisely, make-up has become a key axis of development for the growth of Guerlain, combining dynamism in formulation research and packaging design with always more complex technology."" Among the particularities of MakeUp in Paris, an original program of events, that goes far beyond traditional expert conferences. In collaboration with Anne Camilli, consultant specialized in the universe of makeup, the organizers of MakeUp in Paris developed a dozen poles, whose purposes are to illustrate all the possibilities of use offered by make-up. On each of the poles, exhibitors will be able to enhance their products. ""The make-up schools and the make-up artists that were approached also responded enthusiastically,"" explains Sandra Maguarian. MakeUp in Paris, the new appointment of the make-up industry, will take place on June 24th and 25th, 2010 at l'Espace Pierre Cardin."
Cosmetics marketers must adapt local strategies,"According to data from the latest study conducted by research firmKline & Company, global beauty brands cannot adopt a single strategy to address the needs and particularities of consumers worldwide. ""The takeaway message is that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for success,"" says Carrie Mellage, Director of Consumer Products Research for Kline. ""The unique features of each country require marketers to think globally, but act locally,"" she adds. As an example, Carrie Mellage highlights the particularities of Brazil's rural population, which is a huge potential market but depends heavily on direct person-to-person sales. On the contrary, ""the more sophisticated and fickle shoppers in the mature beauty markets must be lured with exclusive offers, steep discounts, cool iPhone apps, and social media connections."" Growth rates differ widely from one country to another with a huge gap between mature markets and emerging economies. Similarly, the dynamism of the various retail channels is unequally affected. Kline's research points out that ""in the United States, the weak economy has forced department store share of the total market down another two points versus 2003 levels"". At the global level, the dynamic growth in emerging economies, combined with their relatively important rural population is boosting direct sales operators. Actually, Kline says that direct sales have emerged as the fastest growing retail channel for beauty products, posting a robust 8.6% increase in sales - nearly double that of the overall market. Kline also highlights the successful shift operated by chain drug stores in many countries. They have ""dramatically increased floor and shelf space for beauty products and introduced a more posh shopping environment that mimics the feel and service levels of specialty or department stores"". Kline estimates drugstores grew by 5.4%, ahead of the market's overall 4.7% growth. However, the structure and dynamism of retail channels are linked to historical factors and vary dramatically from one country to the other. In China, for instance, growth is led by expansion in the number of doors across all channels, including department stores, mass merchandisers, and specialty stores. Meanwhile in India, unlike any other outlet in the world, independent, owner-operated shops (kirinas) remain the mainstay of the personal care market with 78% market share and 9% growth in the past five years. In such a context, it appears that winning companies are those opting for different retail strategies from one country to another. ""Savvy brands are employing a mix of complementary channels,"" explains Karen Doskow, industry manager for consumer products research at Kline."
Exports of French cosmetics rely on emerging markets,"French exports of cosmetic products declined sharply at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2008 in a context of global crisis, but this situation did not last long, as recovery began in the second quarter of 2009 with a confirmation in the third quarter, notice the French Customs. In 2008, French exports of cosmetics (perfumes, beauty products, hair preparations, other cosmetics) amounted to 9.6 billion Euros. They have grown steadily since 1998, with an annual average of 6.2%, against 4% for all French exports. The dynamism of this sector results from its innovation capabilities, its high-end positioning, aging of population and rising living standards. In the context of recent crisis, the resilience of the French industry is also explained by ""a successful positioning in emerging markets."". According to Customs, ""strong sales in cosmetics is explained in part by favorable positioning in fast growing emerging markets, while the EU plays a less important role in French exports (50% against 64%). Between 1998 and 2008, sales growth in emerging countries is two times faster than it is for all exports of cosmetics"". The share of emerging countries in total sales of cosmetics rose from 14.9% in 1998 to 24.6% in 2008, with particularly strong sales in China and Russia A trend confirmed by Jean-Paul Agon, the Managing Director of the L'Oreal Group, in an interview to the French newspaper Le Monde, dated November 6: ""In the ten coming years, our customers will mostly be Chinese, Indian, Brazilian or Indonesian."" While the group L'Oreal already achieves 60% of its business outside Europe, this proportion is expected to rapidly rise to 90%, according to Jean-Paul Agon ""Sooner or later sales catch up on demography"", he claims. The Department of Customs also notes that the number of exporting companies in the cosmetics industry evolves against the national trend: while the overall number of French exporters tends to decrease, the situation is quite different in the cosmetics industry where the number of companies venturing into international markets continues to grow. The companies concerned are mostly SME. ""Companies exporting cosmetics are less concentrated than the national average. There are relatively more companies with 20 to 250 employees or with more than 250 employees in cosmetics than there is for the whole economy (41% of operators against 26%), with in both cases, about 80% of sales exported"", notes the Department of Customs. French exports, however, remain in the hands of large groups. ""For perfumes, the top ten exporters account for almost 60% of sales, two large groups being behind a quarter of all sales. For beauty products, the top ten exporters draw half of all sales, including one fifth initiated by just one big group"" say the Customs. In the end, France retains its leading position in the global cosmetics industry, with nearly 25% market share worldwide, followed by Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom."
French women have a confused perception of organic cosmetics,"Today, nearly one French women out of three (28%) uses at least one organic cosmetic product. Yet, according to a survey from Cegma Topo, conducted on a cross section of 563 women aged from 18 to 64, few of them have a clear vision of what that concept covers. "" Behind this very fashionable term, perceptions are still vague, "" notes the company specialized in analyzing consumer perceptions. After collecting information from French female consumers on their beliefs and practices regarding organic cosmetics, Cegma Topo notices that confidence in these products is stronger every day, resulting particularly in an increase in the number of facials in terms of consumption. According to Cegma Topo, for consumers, the ""chemical free"" argument is considered to be the first appeal for these products. But the reality behind these products is unknown. ""3/4th of French women have in mind that an organic beauty product is composed by 95% of ingredients derived from organic farming"". Even though the Cosmébio-Ecocert label, which is currently the most commonly used in France, simply ensures that 95% of ingredients are of natural origin and that at least 10% of the total amount of ingredients (and 95% of botanical ingredients) come from organic farming. ""There is quite a confusion between natural products (essential oils, Argan oil, ...) and organic products! ""adds Cegma Topo. The survey reveals that the only element guaranteeing the organic nature of a product, in this case, the labelling, is recognized as such by 52.9% of users. But for non-users of organic cosmetics it is mostly the general appearance of the packaging that is used as a reference. Cegma Topo also notes some confusion between the label and the brand marketed. Two issues seem to represent the biggest restraint for purchase: price and product efficiency. ""One French women out of three may give up in the purchase of organic cosmetics because of the price. French women are not ready to invest more than a few extra Euros to buy an organic product versus its non-organic equivalent. However, they don't expect to pay less either. Otherwise, the product's credibility would be compromised"", explain the authors of the study. ""Some vagueness still remains regarding products, their efficiency, labels ... One French women out of four would not buy some organic cosmetics if she was suspicious of the product's efficiency. A doubt to be dispelled by the players of the organic industry"". concludes Claire Certenais, Customers Director at Cegma Topo."
Colour cosmetics to drive cosmetics sales in Russia,"A recent research study by industry research firm RNCOS has found that by 2012, nearly 16% of the cosmetic industry's revenue generated in Russia will come from colour cosmetic segment. ""This segment has emerged as the one of the most dynamically growing segments of the industry, influenced by fashion trends and innovations,"" comment the authors of the survey. According to RNCOS, the sales of colour cosmetic products have grown by almost 11% in recent years, generating total business of more than US$ 1.5 billion (around EUR 1 billion) in 2008. The consumption of make-up and other coloured cosmetics among Russian women is the highest in the European region, with an estimated 80% of Russian women using colour cosmetics. The report titled Russian Cosmetics Market Forecast (2008-2012) also found that the impact of financial crisis on colour cosmetics has been minimal as compared to other segments due to favourable shift in consumer behaviour among mass and luxury product categories. ""The forecast given in the report is based upon the correlation between past market trends, statistical analysis and industry drivers,"" RNCOS claims."
A new breed of consumers!,"Premium Beauty News - Why are consummers between16 and 31 years of age are different from others? Yannick Brunat - Of course , this doesn't mean that other consumers do not interest us. But one must admit that those born between 1978 and 1993 greatly impact our consumer society and therefore those who, like us, will seek to manufacture products that will attract them. They have significantly changed the codes. It's the ""digital"" generation, the one that blurs the boundaries between work and private life. They don't react like ""classic"" consumers. In short, they are fascinating and invite us to question ourselves. Who are they? They are usually very motivated and optimistic, they change jobs very quickly because they are free, they want to earn a lot of money, they are flexible in finding a balance between work and leisure, they like travelling and multiplying experiences, they invest on personal connections if only through their many business trips and urban experiences. Premium Beauty News - It's all work, hobbies and leisure! Yannick Brunat - In a way, yes! Work is an important component of success. This generation wants to win! This obviously affects its way of life, and vice versa! This age group lives in a very ""electric"" environment and spends a lot of money for that. It's of course essential for this generation to stay connected anywhere at any time. The mobile phone has obviously become a must. Premium Beauty News - Internet has a huge influence on this generation? Yannick Brunat - Yes absolutely ! If you compare with other generations, it's the generation that's the most online as it represents 30% of all Internet users. It's also the same generation that uses two to three times more modern techniques of communication than the baby boomers (born between 1967 and 1977). Premium Beauty News - What about their consumption of cosmetic products? Yannick Brunat - This generation spends a lot of money to be fit and to be ""in""! They really want to take care of their skin and are ready to spend money for quality products. Premium Beauty News - Packaging is also important? Yannick Brunat - Absolutely. This age group relies on individualism and the desire to be different. They respect brands and seek authenticity. They break stereotype. They are seduced by technology, by new gesture, by nomadic solutions. At the same time, they like simplicity. Premium Beauty News - And with brands ? Yannick Brunat - Here, clearly, this generation wants to know how a brand can be part of its environment and contribute to its personal lifestyle. If we give a ranking to the motivations, we find that price is not the most important concern for this generation (unlike others), but that the brand's perception is, on the contrary very important. And the environment comes after as does the place where products were manufactured. The Baby Boomers generation is the one that feels the most concerned about price. The brand matters much less. The environment, on the contrary, is very important. And to complete this survey, the brands most commonly named in the United States by the generation of 16/31 years of age, are: H & M, Adidas, Apple, Levi's, Volkswagen, Converse. If we look at perfume brands, we find for women: Jean-Paul Gaultier, Dior, and for men: Hugo Boss, Diesel, CK One…And for cosmetic products: Clinique, Mac… And make-up: Chanel, Shiseido. Premium Beauty News - Lots of information for you and you own product development? Yannick Brunat - It's true that it has helped us in our recent developments. The ModulArt range for instance."
Natural and organic cosmetic standards are proliferating,"Organic Monitor's new Technical Insights report critically assesses the leading international natural and organic cosmetic standards. Although standards are gaining in popularity, their adoption is mostly on a national basis. Very few standards have built a regional - let alone international - presence. Furthermore, the differences between the most popular standards in each region remain wide. Standards are the most widely adopted in Europe where almost two-thirds of all natural and organic cosmetic products are certified. Ecocert and BDIH are the leading standards, partly because of the high adoption rates in France and Germany, respectively. Ecocert's popularity is partially because it has a natural and organic standard, whereas most certification agencies only propose one option. Although various standards have been introduced in North America over the last 18 months, very few products have become certified.}} Organic Monitor estimates less than 5 percent of natural and organic cosmetics are certified in the region. Backed by leading natural cosmetic companies, the Natural Products Association (NPA) standard is the frontrunner. The NSF ANSI 305 'made with organic' standard is expected to gain popularity once certification begins. The absence of an organic cosmetic standard however, is leading to a number of American companies to adopt the USDA NOP standard. Although designed for organic food products, it is popular with cosmetic companies that use food-grade ingredients. Natural and organic cosmetic standards are also being introduced in other regions such as the Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The adoption rates however are exceptionally low. Many natural cosmetic companies in these regions focus on exports, making them favour European standards. The Ecocert standard has become the most popular in countries such as Japan, Malaysia and Brazil. Organic Monitor also undertakes a critical review of new regional and international initiatives such as Cosmos and NaTrue. The Cosmos standard, scheduled to be implemented in January 2010, has been developed over seven years of negotiations between leading certification agencies in Europe; its launch is expected to mark a milestone for the European natural cosmetics industry. However, its goal of becoming an eventual European standard is facing competition from NaTrue. More than 150 products have become certified by NaTrue since the standard was launched a year ago."
"Natural cosmetics: ""Consumers are expecting new answers""","Premium Beauty News - The market of natural and organic cosmetics now seems to have reached a turning point? Sandie Jaidane - The market share of natural and organic cosmetics in Europe hasn't stopped growing for ten years, but consumers and their expectations have changed considerably. Our aim, during the Natural Beauty Summit is to have a better understanding of these changes. To help us, we will present many exclusive market researches, on consumers and semiology and perception of the press, conducted in France and in other countries. RISC International will present in particular, the results of a survey started in 1992 in ten countries and will analyze consumers' high expectations for natural ingredients and science. Furthermore, IPSOS will present a survey carried out on 4000 consumers in four different countries (France, United Kingdom, United States and Italy). Premium Beauty News - Retail for instance has changed a lot? Sandie Jaidane - Today, the whole of retail is significantly positioned around natural products. Specialized networks are developing everywhere across Europe. Online sales amount for nearly 30% of turnover. Retailers are launching their own natural brands. For many brands the first question is: where to sell? How to conciliate demand with current referencing? Premium Beauty News - And what about the organic cosmetic product? Sandie Jaidane - Today, the big question for the female consumer is: are natural and organic products efficient? Because actually marketing of fear, based on concerns related to some ingredients, has left marks. The consequences are, that for not having advertized on the ingredients present in cosmetics instead of those that were removed, natural products are too often perceived as neutral, with little or no efficiency at all. On this topic, the Ephyla company will be presenting the results of its survey on luxury cosmetics. and will also explain the significant progress of third generation natural formulae. Premium Beauty News - This raises the question on the efficiency of new ""green ingredients""? Sandie Jaidane - There is a large number of issues on the subject: are green ingredients true palliatives to synthetic or petro-chemical ingredients? Can we really substitute everything? What are the limits to ""everything natural""? Premium Beauty News - You also address the issue regarding controversial ingredients. It is a sensitive subject. Sandie Jaidane - It is the first time a conference deals with such a tricky topic. The aim is to take stock of scientific knowledge on some cosmetic ingredients that led to media controversy involving their safety. It is a well known expert in the world of cosmetics, Pierre Perrier of Essential Consulting, who will try to put the various surveys in perspective for us. We will also talk about the palliatives used as substitutes for these ingredients: are they as efficient and in what quantity? What hindsight do we have? Are their manufacturing process more environmentally friendly? Premium Beauty News - You will obviously raise the subject regarding labels and certifications. What is the situation today? Sandie Jaidane - In recent years there has been a increase in the number labels and logos delivered by certifying bodies, stamped onto the packaging of cosmetic products. For France only, we will name Cosmébio, Coméco, Nature & Progrès, Ecocert and Qualité France. BDiH and Demeter for Germany. The Soil Association in UK, AIAB, ICEA for Italy, Ecogarantie for Belgium, BIOSCI for Switzerland… More recently appeared, Natrue and soon there will be Cosmos Standard, two new European labels. Of course consumers do not perceive the exact meaning of these labels or their differences. The result is that everyone is lost, even the brands who would like to choose a unique label for their country but also in order to penetrate international markets. The Natural Beauty Summit Europe will be held on November 23rd and 24th 2009 in Paris. For further information please refer to: www.naturalbeautysummit.com"
Luxe Pack Monaco: the saga goes on,"Prior to the show, crisis related issues, of course, were on all lips. Booth cancellations from some of the big market players were no help in order to restore confidence among the other members of the sector. On top of it, other factors intervened: on the opening day, not only the weather was dreadful, but in addition, half of the flights coming from Paris were canceled due to a strike by ground staff at Paris' Orly airport. But no matter what, the 2009 edition of Luxe Pack Monaco was eventually, in the opinion of a majority of exhibitors we met, a good year ..., a very good year even. ""All the key players in the market showed up"". Or... ""We were surprised by the quality of visitors and by the high level of demand"". Hence, newly available stands, quickly found takers from companies on the organizers' waiting list. When a good idea turns into a saga In over twenty years, this show has definitely anchored itself in the global landscape of luxury products suppliers. And the two other Luxe Pack taking place in New York and Shanghai, only confirm the relevancy of this concept. And yet it was nowhere near winning in 1988, reads the book published to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the show in 1998 (a collector's item in the hands of a privileged few!). One understands that at the time, many heavyweights in the industry were turning their nose up to join this new concept. But one also learns that the first forty few exhibitors from the outset (many companies from Oyonnax, but also international firms) believed strongly in Luxe Pack Monaco and as they literally appropriated the concept, thus contributed greatly to the success of the event. By the end of the first edition (which recorded 400 visitors!), Everyone had the feeling that the idea would make some progress. And indeed it did, much faster than what the creators had imagined. The following year, the number of exhibitors rose to sixty and the number of visitors doubled. In 1990, it was a sure thing. And all this happening...under a tent! Believe it or not, for over ten years Luxe Pack was held underneath a tent set up near the Heliport, the very same one used to host the annual International Circus Festival! Pioneers recall heat, water ingress during storms, early chilly winters. ""But what an atmosphere!"" recall with nostalgia exhibitors and visitors from the outset. A true family..., happy to gather again, every year, in a particularly friendly and warm atmosphere. Today Luxe Pack Monaco has obviously improved itself. But one feels that this event was tailor-made to fit in naturally into this puzzling yet, beautiful building of the Grimaldi Forum. The 2009 edition which recently closed its doors was a true surprise for many people. Activity was intense in the aisles and on the stands ... And among exhibitors, a true commitment for innovation seemed to be the appropriate answer to crisis. Strange atmosphere, where some branches of the sector still have their activity in hot water (sometimes very hot), showing falls in activity from 30% to 50%, while others nevertheless, flirt, with +15%. Strange atmosphere where those who had decided not to exhibit were quickly replaced by those who where dreaming of nothing else. Strange atmosphere where, despite inquiries on a high (not orders), almost all professionals where being pessimistic for the coming months. A show being at the crossroads? Surely. Where ""nothing will ever be the same again"" was on everyone's lips. But where the question ""how will it then be?"" encounter quite different answers, if any! In any case, you can be sure of one thing: targeted events have good days ahead."
MakeUp in Paris is underway,"Premium Beauty News - This event is clearly happening at the right moment. Thierry de Bachmakoff - Makeup is a world apart in the universe of beauty because it creates a visual link with the other magical worlds of fashion, photography and cinema. This is what gives this event such richness because it crosses, mixes up, and combines very varied creativities and truly deserved a special place in the world of events. Anne Camilli - I agree with Thierry de Baschmakoff, the universe of makeup has a place quite unique within the beauty business, essentially because of its infinite capacity for renewal. Its great richness comes from various sources of inspiration. It is made of Art and Science. There is therefore every reason to promote makeup through a different event. Premium Beauty News - Anne Camilli, within the organizers' staff you will be in charge of the cultural and organizational aspects of the event. Thierry de Bachmakoff, you will assist the team with the stage setting. Why and how do you think this event will be a success? Thierry de Bachmakoff - A combination between festive, irrational and superfluous, one of the bases of luxury, combined with the most audacious techniques to express this visual extravaganza can lead us to think without too much exaggeration, that this event will be a sheer delight....for the eyes and incidentally for business. Anne Camilli - Makeup is alive, animated. It is colour, but colours are ""unpredictable"". They cannot easily be classified into categories as describes Dominique Simonet in Couleurs, le Grand Livre. I find it essential to enhance makeup through special events, exchanges, exhibitions etc. ... and to highlight the more or less visible links it shares with other artistic universes. To my eyes, the concept of exchange is important because it is a source for improvement. Premium Beauty News - Makeup is undoubtedly one of the most innovative sector in today's world of beauty. Creativity is everywhere. Makeup Artists, Makeup Schools, manufacturers, all of them will contribute to make this two day event a ""great makeup celebration"". So why not join the party? Thierry de Bachmakoff - Glamour, light, codes, emotions, colors, glances, clichés ..... everything is makeup as soon as the curtain rises, then yes you can refer to it as a makeup celebration, our scenography will make it a conceptual.... and surprising point of honour. Anne Camilli - Make-up is a stage setting the beauty of which is the theater. It is a matter of getting across to the audience and for all the actors in this industry to play to a full house on the 24th and 25th of June next, with a mission to highlight, the imagination, the creativity, the inventiveness of their universe! MakeUp in Paris Thursday 24th and Friday 25th of June 2010 Espace Pierre Cardin, Paris (France)"
"""We expect a good turnout for Cosmoprof Asia,"" Aureliana De Sanctis, SoGeCos","Premium Beauty News - What are the perspectives for the next edition of Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong? Aureliana De Sanctis - Cosmoprof Asia being the Asia Pacific leading beauty exhibition in the region the show represent the most important business meeting point in the year and also the most effective way to make multiple contacts with existing and potential customers in Asia. International group pavilions have confirmed participation such as France, one of the most important contingent of companies at the show, Germany, Italy, Spain, Israel, the UK, the USA, and new this year South Africa and Poland. Upon completion of the expansion project, after two years of renovation, the Hong Kong Convention Centre will become more visitor-friendly and easy to navigate. All the categories represented will benefit from a customised visitors flow along the redesigned hall sectorization. Premium Beauty News - The impact of the economic crisis seems to be lower in Asia than in other areas. Aureliana De Sanctis - It is true. Despite the economic challenges affecting the global economies, the cosmetics market in Asia holds on and sales figures remain impressive. For this very reason we expect a good turnout for Cosmoprof Asia 2009 both in terms of exhibitors and visitors from the region. Premium Beauty News - On the other hand, do you think that the year 2010 will be more difficult for your European business? Aureliana De Sanctis - We think, and signals give us reason, that the year 2009 represented the heights of business' slowdown in the beauty sector. In reference to signals of optimism, they are supported by a positivity that Cosmoprof North America has tested. In fact, a strong business recovery was perceived during the manifestation. This is the advantage of being an international platform, allowing us to understand business trends in advance. Cosmoprof Worldwide in Bologna (Italy) sustains this signal with 60% of spaces already confirmed seven months before the beginning of the fair. This fact underlines the importance of performing every years events that support the industry also in hard time. Premium Beauty News - Could you tell us a few words about your new projects worldwide? Aureliana De Sanctis - I can only anticipate we are working on very important partnership transactions and acquisitions of international and national realities that will contribute to the Cosmoprof's capillarity in the world."
"""Things have changed in retail"", Thibault Ponroy","The theme of the last and traditional early morning rendezvous of the BeautyFull Club, moderated by Thibault Ponroy, was Selective Distribution, What alternative for brands? The president of the French Federation of Selective Retailers reviewed the situation of selective distribution in Europe. According to him, ""sharing information and knowledge on consumer behavior is essential because it allows all the actors of the beauty sector to have a better visibility and a real capacity for anticipation"". An initiative that would imply ""the creation of vertical links and bridges, the decompartmentalization of the different actors involved in our business."" In short, a true call for dialog within the beauty industry, aiming at a better anticipation of sale volumes. Thibault Ponroy was of course questioned on the attitude of retailers in recent months, he stressed on the fact that distribution could not be used as a variable of adjustment by keeping high levels of stock out of proportion with actual needs. ""De-stocking is not a goal. The actual phenomenon is mainly an inevitable readjustment in times of crisis of all the financial and economical indicators of companies in the distribution sector… Things have changed in distribution. It has concentrated and professionalized itself, and switched in 15 years from a structure composed mainly of SME (even VSE) to a structure composed of multinational groups, with shareholders often leaders in their field, familiar with best management techniques and quoted at the stock exchange"". The enthusiastic discussions and the number of people attending this new rendezvous truly delighted Charles-Emmanuel Gounod. The President of BeautyFull Club, who believes that ""talks are useful and essential to the Beauty industry,"" has invited all participants to join the Club and take part into its activities."
Asian companies turning to natural and organic cosmetic standards,"New research by Organic Monitor finds a growing number of Asian companies are taking the certification route, with most opting for European standards. The Ecocert standard is the most widely adopted, including companies in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Australia. ""Natural and organic standards are increasingly becoming a point-of-difference for these brands,"" says Organic Monitor. In Malaysia, the Buds Cherished Organics brand is reporting a sales surge since the Ecocert-certified range was launched earlier this year. Produced by the Malaysian company I-Green, it is the first Asian brand of certified organic baby care products. The company believes organic certification is responsible for its large take-up rate. The success of the Buds Cherished Organics brand is leading the Malaysian company to start exporting to neighbouring Asian countries and Europe. It is also looking to start certification of its other brands. Asian consumers are turning to natural and organic cosmetics as they become more aware of the possible risks associated with certain synthetic chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries. Health scares, especially those involving Chinese products, have raised consumer interest in product quality and safety issues. ""Certification gives a guarantee that products meet high production standards and are less likely to contain potentially harmful chemicals,"" explains the market research firm. In China, the Australian brand Jasmin Skincare is capitalising on consumer demand for 'chemically-clean' cosmetics. The company is also reporting a large sales rise since it started marketing its certified products. To gain confidence with such Chinese consumers, Jasmin Skincare executives have even stated their products are safe enough to eat. Certification is key to Jasmin Skincare's success. It is one of a growing number of Australian cosmetic companies adopting the Organic Food Chain (OFC) cosmetic standard. Its products are made from certified organic ingredients, many of which are USDA certified. Other Australian companies are adopting European cosmetic standards, with Ecocert again the most popular. Nature's Care has recently launched a range of certified organic personal care products. It has adopted the Ecocert standard because it is more internationally recognised than OFC. To many companies, certification not only provides a guarantee that high production standards are met, it also opens up export markets. ""In this respect, American brands risk losing out in the fast growing Asian natural cosmetics market. American brands such as Nature's Gate and Aveda are very successful in Asia, however these brands have not adopted natural and organic cosmetic standards. With very few American companies adopting standards, European and Australian brands look to capitalise on growing Asian demand for certified natural and organic cosmetics,"" Organic Monitor comments. To help Asian companies adopt natural and organic cosmetic standards, Organic Monitor is conducting a dedicated workshop on October 14th in Singapore. Titled De-mystifying natural and organic cosmetic standards, the workshop is led by Judi Beerling, technical research manager at Organic Monitor. Natural & organic cosmetic standards will also be featured in the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, held in Frankfurt, Nov 16-17th."
European natural cosmetics sales approaching EUR 2 billion,"Organic Monitor's 2009 edition of The European Natural Cosmetics Market report [1] finds that natural and organic cosmetic sales have been affected by the financial crisis. However, healthy growth is continuing because of increasing distribution and high consumer demand for 'chemically-clean' and ethical cosmetics. The UK market has been the most adversely affected. The market growth rate has dropped from 16 percent in 2008 to 8 percent in 2009 because sales have been hit in organic food shops and health food retailers. However, natural and organic cosmetic sales continue to expand at double-digit rates in other European countries. The French and German markets are the fastest growing in Europe. High growth rates are occurring as product penetration increases in mainstream retailers. Both countries have observed a large number of retailer private label launches in recent years. Certified natural and organic cosmetics have been introduced under private labels of supermarkets, drugstores, perfumeries, organic food shops and discounters in these countries. Private labels are so successful in Germany that they comprise over 10% of total sales. Natural and organic products now comprise 3% of total cosmetic sales in Europe. The market share is above 4% in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. High growth in the German market is projected to raise the market share of natural & organic cosmetics to 10% in the coming years. Apart from private labels, a major retailing trend is the growing number of concept stores for natural and organic beauty products. Dedicated stores are being opened by leading natural cosmetic brands, large retail groups as well as private investors. Most developments are in Paris where highly established brands such as Dr. Hauschka as well as large retailers like Monoprix are opening concept stores. Actually, rising competition is leading natural and organic cosmetic brands to expand distribution outside traditional sales channels. With competition for retail shelf-space stepping up, Organic Monitor expects market winners to be companies who can successfully differentiate their products. New entrants and existing participants are advised to consider strategies based on product differentiation and market segmentation; companies should target specific consumer groups or sales channels. The latest figures on the European Natural Cosmetics Market, including market growth projections and business opportunities are highlighted in a dedicated workshop in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit. Taking place in Frankfurt (November 16-17th), the summit will also feature presentations from certification agencies and ingredient suppliers."
Make-Up in Paris: the new meeting place of the make-up industry,"Premium Beauty News - A very simple question: why ""Make-Up in Paris""? Sandra Maguarian - Jean-Yves Bourgeois, who gave birth to this project, has an experience of over thirty years in the cosmetics business and, thanks to its extensive relationship in this industry, he was able to identify the interest of an event entirely devoted to make-up. Nowadays, make-up is probably the sector generating most innovations and technological developments in the beauty industry. Whether a box or a makeup pencil, a lip-gloss, a tube of lipstick, a mascara, a nail polisher, or an airless container ..., technology is everywhere. This is probably the industry that requires the most advanced expertise at all levels: formulation, packaging and marketing. Did you know, for instance, that the gesture for making up is not the same in Japan and in Europe so that formulae and textures adapt accordingly? Regarding formulae, they are evolving constantly. The whole being subject to more and more stringent legal obligations. Once again, it's time for innovation with products that will contain molecules capable of modifying specifically a defined skin condition or to adapt to specific signatures. Custom-made cosmetic is probably becoming more than just an idea. Who says ""technique"", says ""innovation"" and ""emulation"". Make-Up in Paris will reflect all these aspects. Premium Beauty News - It is therefore a unique event to share with unique people? Sandra Maguarian - Actually, make-up is a world apart, which comprises its specialized schools, its make-up artists, its own wordings, its own customs, its language, its codes and its magazines. The United States incidentally were the first goers in this field. In Europe, nothing! Not one dedicated event to gather this industry. Make-Up in Paris has the ambition of becoming the personalized and unavoidable meeting place of this business where all actors can congregate in a professional but friendly place, and participating in a set of unavoidable events. Premium Beauty News - This confirms the tendency for targeted events? Sandra Maguarian - Current economic trends call for an overhauling of business events as we have known them for thirty years in Europe. Expert events focusing on high specificity segments have been fully tried and tested. Make-Up in Paris will be very specifically ""this event"". Because it is truly an event, not a show in a traditional way. The selected location and its lay-out will enable the world of make-up to fully express itself. The various adjacent events will suit with visitors' expectations, may they be brands, suppliers or retailer,s and of course, all the professionals-to-be. Premium Beauty News - Economically, this segment is one of the healthiest of all? Sandra Maguarian - Quite true! In recent years, the make-up business has been among those showing the steadiest progression rates and the strongest growth prospects. It is the most resilient sector to the crisis. Maybe because of the famous Lipstick effect! Premium Beauty News - What is the offer and who are the customers? Sandra Maguarian - The beauty business is constantly changing! And the crisis accelerated a bit more these changes with as a main trend: the need to widen the offer while providing flawless service. First consequence, the emergence of a new kind of suppliers able to supply all or part of the service. Another important outcome, ""added value"" is, more than ever, a key word in an industrial sector that has seen its margins decreased significantly over the last ten years. How can you create added value, except by offering a broader and optimum service to a demanding customer-market? Container and content are more than ever indivisible for several reasons: – The shift towards more ""fragile"" and more natural formulae, continues to reinforce the idea of content protection. – The need for a complete offer compels the relevant industrial sectors to widen their specialization (manufacturers of cosmetic components widen their skills towards packaging and those in packaging do the same towards cosmetic components). – Creativity requires good symbiosis between container and content. Aiming at not simply proposing a ""global service"" but also a ""global offer"", operators in the makeup segment must follow or even anticipate trends. The arrival of the first make-up artists in the world of manufacturers (whether in packaging, in formulation or filling) occurred only recently. As well as the emergence at formulators' of research departments specialized in packaging! Make-Up in Paris will allow professionals worldwide from marketing, development or purchase departments, to participate in an ""outstanding"" event. I insist on our will to create a true moment for exchanges and to recreate during this event at the heart of Paris, the universe of makeup with its profusion of colours, its inventiveness, its youthfulness. Premium Beauty News - So, when and where? Sandra Maguarian - Jean-Yves Bourgeois and myself, with our entire team, will host the make-up business on the 24th and 25th of June 2010 at l'Espace Pierre Cardin, Avenue Gabriel, just a few steps in parallel to the Champs-Elysées.

The natural cosmetics market needs better consistency,"Since years natural cosmetics represent a growth segment par excellence and without doubt this trend continues and will exert influence on the whole cosmetics market in general. Considered worldwide, sales are growing by US$ 1 billion per annum and are currently estimated at around US$ 7 billion in total. As in the case of organic food, the great demand for natural cosmetics is concentrated on Europe and North America. Customers in Germany spent about EUR 672 million on natural cosmetics in 2008, a significant increase of 9.7 % compared to the previous year. The organic natural and ""near-natural"" segments would already represent 10 % of the German market. And the market isn't saturated yet! The rising environmental consciousness and health awareness among consumers, as well as the desire for sustainability are fuelling the growth. Speakers at the second Natural Cosmetics Conference - which took place from September 22 to 23, on the occasion of the Nuremberg fair - particularly turned their attention to increased market differentiation, and to the specificities of marketing natural cosmetic brands. Elfriede Dambacher, who has been managing Naturkosmetik Konzepte, a consulting firm, since 2003 to advise manufacturers and trading companies in the natural cosmetics markets, primarily specialising in strategic marketing and sales consulting and the development, and publisher of the Natural Cosmetics Report 2008 and Natural Yearbook 2009, said that variety keeps the market on the move, and asked if natural cosmetics could be viewed as the pacemaker for the international beauty sector. Indeed, the natural cosmetics business is one of the few economic sectors that show favourable development rates. Reasons for growth rank from consumer trends (cultural and social changes) to the search for alternative energies and raw materials and the shift from material prosperity to social wealth, or from prestige luxury to ethic luxuriousness! Increased media presence, and the rising number of distribution channels are also important factors of growth. According to Elfriede Dambacher the segment is currently evolving from a demand-driven to a supply market, which means new challenges for everyone involved. Irene Domberger and Dr. Stefan Kraus gave some practical examples and addressed key issues such as: Is premium natural cosmetics the growth market of the future? Do natural cosmetics need their own POS concepts? How much green glamour is credible? Since 2006, Irene Domberger has been working with a French producer on the development and introduction of a new shop concept under the name of Autrepart Nature. The aim is to integrate products and manufacturers who offer exclusively natural cosmetics and also specialise in the organic segment. The basic philosophy is ""no risk for customer's health, fair trade and no animal tests"". Dr. Stefan Kraus is the founder of the Dr. Kraus pharmacies. The concept combines well-known international cult brands with natural cosmetics classics. Dr Kraus also sells online. Irene Domberger and Dr. Stefan Kraus got to the point that much more innovative shop concepts have to be developed in the future. They also consider that ""shop in shop"" concepts are of major interest. These concerted actions would provide authenticity and confidence and establish an appropriate basis for and a better perception of the entire natural cosmetics market. Hana Hrstková, manager of the Kline Market Research's office in Prague, confirmed that consumer's awareness in is growing and will help pave way for new product receptivity. As far as the US market is concerned, she explained that mainstream marketers of personal care products have a low penetration rate in the natural cosmetics segment and that they would have interest to help natural brands with high growth potential to develop. She said there are many excellent candidates for acquisition. Regarding opportunities in Europe she explained that more retail shelf space is opening up to naturals, that distribution channels will continue to broaden with natural products becoming more readily available, that smaller less developed product categories offer growth opportunities to marketers, that new standards will help to decrease confusion among consumers and that Russia and other Eastern European markets are less mature markets where consumer interest and demand for natural personal care products is on the rise. Eventually, all speakers agreed that the potential of natural cosmetics has hardly been exhausted! However, the development of the segment needs better consistency. The next Natural Cosmetics Conference will be hold on 14-15 September 2010 at the Congress Centre in Nuremberg."
Organic Monitor launches international summits on sustainability in cosmetics,"Organic Monitor - a research and consulting company focusing on organic product industries - is launching a series of international summits on sustainability and green chemistry in cosmetics.

The workshop will look at the opportunities food ingredients provide, highlighting the technical and formulation challenges."
"Beyond Beauty Paris: ""A good year 2009""","Premium Beauty News - The 2009 edition of Beyond Beauty Paris was apparently a success, despite the crisis. What do you believe the reasons where for this success? David Bondi - For three main reasons I think: – The need to reassure oneself collectively by meeting other people, especially when the economic environment is difficult. – The proximity between the exhibition area and the offices of the major French groups, which impacted noticeably the progression of the revisits rate. 45% of visitors revisited Beyond Beauty Paris a second day or more, this is important, and I think this also due the quality of the offer in each of the 3 shows. [1] – The need for renewal: discovering small nuggets niche products, organic products, thinking about future product developments, etc... Premium Beauty News - The choice of the Porte de Versailles proved to be a good one! What was the eventual number of visitors? David Bondi - We have welcomed this year 19,000 visitors including 28% of foreigners. A better year than expected and a slight decline in international, due to lower investment travels and probably also because of fears of H1N1 flu. When we realized that, for the L'Oreal group alone, nearly 450 people had pre-registered, we understood the importance, both of our relocation at Porte de Versailles and of an international event in Paris. Our tradeshow with 505 exhibitors is the second biggest professional beauty event in the European market. [2] Premium Beauty News - Very good attendance rate also at conferences including on Monday morning in the first hours! Apparently packaging and full service are hot issues. David Bondi - These topics are at the heart of Creative, Beyond Beauty's section devoted to suppliers. With 1/3 of the offer in packaging, 1/3 in private label and 1/3 in ingredients and other partners: the whole chain is represented. As far as conferences are concerned, our commitment is also to provide a high quality panel of speakers with free access for all professionals. Premium Beauty News - What conclusions do you draw from this edition David Bondi - Refocusing our offer around the Beyond Beauty Paris event featuring three shows, more clearly staged, was generally appreciated by visitors who had a better comprehension of the event. We will beef up even more the scheduling of conferences, which is one of the strong points since the creation of the event in 2003. We will be persistent to demonstrate to operators who are still reluctant to exhibit that the quality/price ratio is ideal in Paris, at the start of Autumn because manufacturers, for understandable reasons start to rationalize their non-media investments."
