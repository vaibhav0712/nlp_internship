French parliament backs bill against hair discrimination affecting black women,"Olivier Serva, an independent National Assembly deputy for the French overseas territory of Guadeloupe and the bill’s sponsor, said it would penalise any workplace discrimination based on ""hair style, colour, length or texture"". Similar laws exist in around 20 US states which have identified hair discrimination as an expression of racism. In Britain, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has issued guidelines against hair discrimination in schools. Serva, who is black, said women ""of African descent"" were often encouraged before job interviews to change their style of hair. Backers also say that men who wear their hair in styles like dreadlocks are also affected. The bill was approved in the lower house National Assembly with 44 votes in favour and two against. It will now head to the upper Senate where the right has the majority and the vote’s outcome is much less certain. Serva, who also included discrimination suffered by blondes, redheads and bald men in his proposal, points to an American study stating that a quarter of black women polled said they had been ruled out for jobs because of how they wore their hair at the job interview. Such statistics are hard to come by in France, which bans the compilation of personal data that mention a person’s race or ethnic background on the basis of the French Republic’s ""universalist"" principles. The draft law does not, in fact, contain the term ""racism"", noted Daphne Bedinade, a social anthropologist, saying the omission was problematic. ""To make this only about hair discrimination is to mask the problems of people whose hair makes them a target of discrimination, mostly black women,"" she told Le Monde daily. A black Air France air crew member in 2022 won a 10-year legal battle for the right to work with braided hair on flights after a decision by France’s highest appeals court. While statistics are difficult to come by, high-profile people have faced online harassment because of their hairstyle. In the political sphere they include former government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye, and Audrey Pulvar, a deputy mayor of Paris, whose Afro look has attracted much negative comment online. The bill’s critics say it is unnecessary, as discrimination based on looks is already banned by law. ""There is no legal void here,"" said Eric Rocheblave, a lawyer specialising in labour law. Calling any future law ""symbolic"", Rocheblave said it would not be of much practical help when it came to proving discrimination in court. Kenza Bel Kenadil, an influencer and self-proclaimed ""activist against hair discrimination"", said a law would still send an important message. ""It would tell everybody that the law protects you in every way and lets you style your hair any way you want,"" she said. The influencer, who has 256,000 followers on Instagram, said she herself had been ""forced"" to tie her hair in a bun when she was working as a receptionist. Her employers were ""very clear"", she said. ""It was, either you go home and fix your hair or you don’t come here to work"". During the parliamentary debate deputy Fanta Berete, originally from Guinea, said she, too, had been told in the past to straighten her hair in job interviews. Aurore Bergé, minister in charge of gender equality, said the government was ""looking kindly"" on the initiative which she said was useful in drawing attention to this form of discrimination.
Some right-wing deputies rejected the bill, with Republicans deputy Xavier Breton saying it was the outcome of an ""activist ideology"" that he said was aimed at ""dividing our society"" by establishing ""a hierarchy"" of discriminatory acts."
Niche perfumery: the top trends spotted at Esxence 2024,"White flowers were in full bloom at this 2024 edition of Esxence. The trend blossomed at the end of the health crisis and reached its peak this year. Tuberose, jasmine, orange blossom... If we had to choose just one bouquet of white flowers, it would be Un Bel Amour d’Été by Parfum d’Empire. A hymn to carefreeness, bursting with gardenia, magnolia and champaca, created by Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, with this well-known material, qualitative and carnal signature. Gourmandise finds new inspiration. Moving away from praline and caramel notes, the gourmet palette is exploring other olfactory territories. Like the popcorn note, somewhere between peanut and caramel, in God Bless Cola, the Versatile brand’s latest addition. The gourmand style is also evolving, with creamy effects recalling the texture of a pastry in the mouth. Nicolaï’s three new creations are a good illustration of this. Pavlova, Saint-Honoré, and Macaron Bourbon are three fragrances inspired by desserts, whose mellow texture is tantalisingly realistic. This 14th edition of Esxence also gave pride of place to fruity notes: banana, passion fruit, pear, peach... Beyond their presence, it is how the note is treated that attracts attention. The fruity accords are more refined, with a more subtle, naturalist style. Of particular note is the beautiful, velvety peach-skin effect of Rue de la Paix, a floral bouquet celebrating 100 years of the Isabey brand. While over the last two years, sandalwood was the dominant scent, since last year it has been replaced by vanilla, a new comforting ingredient. Among the pods that spread their bewitching, regressive notes in the aisles of the show were Orchid K by Ella K. A vanilla with powdery accents, enhanced by a hint of incense, by Sonia Constant. In the same gentle vein, musks are still very much in evidence, prized for their intimate sensuality. Like the latest launch of L’Orchestre Parfum, Mono Cachemire, by Nathalie Feisthauer. An airy, enveloping veil, imagined as a second skin. Although not dominant, green facets were used in many combinations. They give formulas a more natural touch or revamp a classic theme. The best example is undoubtedly Cèdre Figalia by Atelier Materi. A fig, green, woody accord, in which perfumer Céline Perdriel chiselled a crumpled fig leaf effect, using spinach absolute. All in all, this 14th edition gave pride of place to a joyful, hedonistic niche perfumery. This cheerfulness drew on white floral notes, fruit, and gourmandise. This atmosphere can also be seen in the design of the stands, which were extremely colourful this year. Rather than being seductive, the new products are part of a quest for well-being and inner balance. Much like the many smaller brands that populated the show, all of them pursuing a soothing approach."
"Shady bleaching jabs fuel health fears, scams in West Africa","The young woman is one of a growing number of customers across West Africa who seek to reduce the melanin in their skin because being fair is associated with higher status, privilege and beauty. The global market value for bleaching treatments is projected to jump from an estimated $10 billion in 2021 to $16 billion in 2030, Dozens of Facebook pages in Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Niger and Senegal promise ""uniform whitening"" thanks to various creams or injections. It is a gateway to a huge web of scams. A lab analysis requested by AFP of one popular product in Ivory Coast showed it contained no whitening agents. Experts also warn that the trend is far from harmless, with the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2023 calling it a ""global health problem that needs urgent attention"". Although creams still dominate the market, injectable liquids are proving increasingly popular with young people. The effect is thought to be ""faster"" and ""more uniform"", according to Marcellin Doh, the president of a civil society collective in Ivory Coast fighting the skin-whitening fad. While the risks of creams are well documented — some cause premature ageing or contain carcinogenic substances –- the dangers of injections are less well known. Specialists confirm there is little oversight regarding the ingredients or manufacturing process. Some jabs contain strong anti-inflammatories, according to dermatologist Sarah Kourouma of the Treichville University Hospital in Ivory Coast. ""Given their side effects, we assume that they are steroids,"" she told AFP, adding that prolonged use in high doses can cause depigmentation, diabetes and hypertension. Wealthier women, meanwhile, turn to expensive injections of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant, which can be prescribed in the treatment of cancer and Parkinson’s. ""Young, educated women aged between 25 and 30 (inject themselves) every week, sometimes every second day,"" Kourouma said. They risk developing ""skin pathologies such as acne and conditions that leave scars and black spots that are very hard to treat"". Her observations were echoed by Grace Nkoro, a dermatologist at the Gynaeco-Obstetric Hospital in Cameroon. Nkoro said she had seen several patients develop skin problems and even kidney failure after ""buying these injections on the internet"". Neighbouring Ghana issued a public health alert in 2021, warning that glutathione injections ""pose a significant health risk"" with ""toxic side effects for the liver, kidneys and nervous system"". There are also concerns over the way in which these products are being administered. In many cases, merchants at a market or in a store will provide the jab — an ""illegal practice"", according to the Ivorian Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authority. In other instances, people inject themselves at home. The lack of medical supervision can lead to the spread of communicable diseases like hepatitis, experts caution. ""If you don’t clean the equipment properly, you could potentially inject bacteria into the bloodstream and risk total body infection"", Kourouma said. Although Ivorian authorities outlawed certain whitening products in 2015, the ban did not directly target those containing glutathione. As a result, they are still widely available in markets and online. The manager of an Abidjan-based online store, who wished to remain anonymous, said she imported ""good-quality"" products from Southeast Asia, Italy and Switzerland. According to her, the jabs were ""basically medicine"". AFP contacted another vendor on social media claiming to sell glutathione injections in Abidjan and purchased a batch of 16 vials and powders produced by Dermedical Skin Sciences for 75,000 CFA francs ($124). A lab analysis by a Paris-based hospital showed the vials contained vitamins, proteins and sugar — but no glutathione. Attempts to contact Dermedical Skin Sciences proved futile. The company website lists a lab in the Italian city of Milan but Google Maps only shows a municipal swimming pool and golf course at the given address. There is also no company registered under the name ""Dermedical Skin Sciences"" with the Italian Chamber of Commerce. An Ivorian trader promoting a brand named Glutax told AFP that a wholesaler in Manila was behind the products. The capital of the Philippines is home to a dizzying number of retailers supplying the African market with skin-whitening products. Further online searches showed the existence of a Manila-based firm called Glutax. Contacted by AFP, the company confirmed it was headquartered in the capital and was a global distributor of bleaching treatments. Glutathione-based injectables are banned for use in the Philippines because of their “potential danger or harm to health"". Despite the risks and scams, WHO figures show that skin-whitening practices remain widely used in Asia and Africa. Zimbabwean researcher Shingirai Mtero of the Nordic Africa Institute said these beauty standards were ""inherited from the colonial period"". ""African countries emerged from colonisation... But that does not mean that they emancipated themselves from the realities and prejudices that were imposed on them."""
"Trend: ’looksmaxxers’, these men ready to do anything to look their best","Fans of ’looksmaxxing’ are said to be ready to use all possible means — sometimes even the most dangerous — to improve their physical appearance in order to appear more attractive to others, especially women. According to Urban Dictionary, the term was initially used by ""incels"", in other words, involuntarily celibate and often masculinist men. It would have originated on incel discussion forums and in the manosphere before becoming a broader trend on social networks. Since then, younger generations have embraced the practice and made looksmaxxing a trend on social media. On social media, countless videos are posted with the #looksmaxxing hashtag, showcasing comprehensive and demanding beauty routines that aspire to a certain beauty ideal. However, ’looksmaxxing’ isn’t just about cosmetics — although social media users might have you believe so — it’s a much broader process, encompassing fashion, sport and even food. ""The past year has been me taking things girls have been doing to look better and telling guys to do the same,"" explains Dillon Latham, now followed by over 1.4 million users on TikTok, speaking to the New York Times. His TikTok account is filed with videos aimed at advising those who wish to improve their appearance — or at least who aspire to a certain idea of beauty. How to get abs, how to smell good, what clothes to wear and what not to wear, how to get rid of acne, how to make your features more attractive, or even how to improve the symmetry of your face, are among the tips shared by the social media user. On the whole, it’s a relatively basic, harmless beauty routine that involves relatively standard practices and techniques, such as going to the hairdresser, waxing, teeth whitening, exercising, following an optimal skincare routine, taking up facial yoga, or even indulging in ’mewing’ — tongue posture exercises to achieve a squarer jawline, get rid of a double chin, or make the face look more balanced. These are relatively common practices known as ’softmaxxing,’ and are they’re very similar to the kinds of things women have been doing for years. But more extreme — and controversial – practices, known as ’hardmaxxing,’ also appear on social networks. This could involve cosmetic surgery, particularly implants, as well as skin whitening and extreme diets. One such practice, ’bone smashing’, recently went viral. This involves breaking the bones of the jaw to make it squarer, a sign of virility according to some. Still, despite going viral online, this dangerous trend is actually (and fortunately) far from gaining a huge following in real life, even among ’lookmaxxers.’ One thing is sure, the community of men keen to improve their appearance continues to grow, reflecting a willingness to embrace certain norms and imperatives of what masculinity looks like."
French exports of perfumes and cosmetic products continue to soar,"With an increase of +10.8% in 2023, French exports of cosmetic products hit a new record at EUR 21.3 billion, compared to EUR 19.3 billion in 2022. This is the third consecutive year of double-digit increase (+18.8% in 2022 and +22.5% in 2021), after the accident linked to the pandemic in 2020 (-11.8% ). “Crossing the 20 billion euros mark is a clear symbol of the vitality of our industry. Despite the pandemic and the logistical hurdles that followed, our exports have doubled in 10 years,” Emmanuel Guichard, General Delegate of FEBEA, told Premium Beauty News. Among the categories driving the growth of French exports, perfumes appear as the powerhouse of the sector. In 2023, sales outside France jumped by +10.5% to reach 7.1 billion euros, a figure that has doubled since 2019. Makeup products and skin care products for the face also showed a good performance with an increase of +9.9% (EUR 11 billion), while hair products recorded the strongest growth (+15.8%). “One of the many assets of our sector is to be strong in most beauty categories,” emphasizes Emmanuel Guichard. The year 2023 was marked by a sharp slowdown in two key markets for the French beauty industry: the United States and China. Exports to the United States, the world’s leading buyer of cosmetics made in France, increased by +2.8% in 2023, compared to +26.7% in 2022. While one in five French perfume products is exported to the United States, exports in this category only grew by +1.9% (to reach 1.2 billion euros) in 2023. Exports of makeup and care of the face, growing by +5.3%, reached 1.1 billion euros in 2023. China, which in 2020 became the number one customer for French beauty brands, continued its slow-down. In 2023, French exports to China increased by +1.7% to reach 1.99 billion euros. In this context, the countries of the European Union have served as growth relays for the French cosmetics industry. The area represents 40.2% (EUR 8.6 billion) of total French exports in 2023, a figure up +20.8% compared to 2022. In the Middle East, exports of French cosmetic products decreased by -2.9% due in particular to a sharp drop in exports to Saudi Arabia (-19%), partly offset by growth in the United Arab Emirates (+6%). “The strong increase in our exports to the European Union is a good surprise compared to the trend of previous years. This shows that French companies are able to find new growth drivers and to reposition on new markets when the global context evolves,” added Emmanuel Guichard. In total, more than 60% of French cosmetics production is exported. In 2023, the sector was the second contributor to the trade balance, behind aeronautics and ahead of wines and spirits. France remains the world’s leading exporter of cosmetic products."
Trade shows: Three beauty trends spotted at Cosme Tokyo 2024,"With almost 34,000 visitors across all six shows, the halls at Tokyo Big Sight Expo centre were busy throughout the entire three days of the fair. Besides Japan, the biggest exhibiting country this year was Korea, with K-beauty brands dominating the Cosme Tokyo hall in particular. This highly visible presence of Korean cosmetics at the show reflects the changing dynamics of the Japanese cosmetics market. Indeed, during the last few years, Japan’s beauty retail market has seen a massive influx of Korean beauty brands which are now widely sold in drugstores, convenience stores and variety stores/beauty specialist retailers. As far as beauty trends are concerned, Cosme Tokyo was all about ingredients this year. In a market with highly educated and informed consumers, skin science and other dermatological approaches of beauty are more than ever a key factor of success in Japan. Exosomes were undoubtedly among the most prominent active ingredients showcased at Cosme Tokyo 2024. Frequently, exosomes were combined with anti-ageing ingredients already highly popular in the Japanese beauty market, such as stem cells, PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide), NMN (Nicotinamide mononucleotide) or placenta, as well as classic actives from the Korean beauty industry that have become popular in Japanese skin care in recent years, such as cica (centella asiatica), bakuchiol or niacinamide. For example, Japanese salon beauty manufacturer Wave Corporation reformulated several products in its existing Spa Treatment HAS line with exosome technology and re-named the entire line – the Exosomes range now includes sheet masks, undereye masks and a highly-concentrated exosome serum. Lady Bio’s Dualvie Clocell Therapy cream features both bakuchiol and exosomes. Korean brand Nine Tails launched three new exosome-based products, including the Exo Collagen Serum which contains exosomes, collagen and niacinamide. And Korean-Japanese brand Precime ecently introduced Exosome Mineral UV Protective Cream, a liquid tinted face cream with SPF34 PA+++ formulated with exosomes and cica-derived madecassoside and asiaticoside. NMN was another very popular and highly visible ingredient at Cosme Tokyo 2024, not just in skin care but also in nutritional supplements and functional foods/beverages. When applied topically, nicotinamide mononucleotide is said to help increase skin elasticity and minimise fine lines and wrinkles. Femcare beauty brand Seins Mous‘ new Champagne Carbon face and neck serum cream does not just include human stem cells but also NMN to further boost hydration and improve skin elasticity. Japanese skin care brand Aderay’s new Aderay Warp Mask is an all-over eye sheet mask. The mask material is infused with nano-sized NMN and hyaluronic acid which quickly melt into the skin, deeply hydrating and redensifying it. Eventually, Japanese newcomer brand Tokka Labo‘s most recent supplement includes NMN from fermented broccoli florets and broccoli seed powder as well as willow orchid extracts. The importance of active ingredients was also visible in the many functional anti-ageing beauty launches at the show, especially from the Korean exhibitors. Retinol, cica, niacinamide, ceramides et. al. were very much in evidence, as were highly-concentrated serum, ampoule and essence products. For example, the Dr. Rosa range, introduced by Korea’s Cosmax, featured three new functional serums. The Dr. Rosa Cica Exo Calming IV ampoule is based on 83% centella asiatica extract and promises to soothe sensitive and barrier-impaired skin. And Korean makeup brand tFit recently launched two new functional face care line, including the 4-sku Pluvipoe pore care range which offers two different pore-refining serums and a pore-cleansing pudding mask. The active ingredient in Korean newcomer brand Vegetology’s 6-sku face care range is antioxidant-rich grape flower stem cell extract which is cultivated in a bio reactor in the brand’s own production facility. A different approach to anti-ageing – albeit still ingredients-focused – came from Japanese newcomer beauty brand Rupika which presented a truly innovative beauty product. Rupika Beauty Tooth Gel is packed with glutathione, colloidal gold and tiger grass extract as well as various anti-bacterial ingredients. The dental beauty essence utilises the superior ingredients absorption powers of the mucosal membranes: The mint flavoured gel formula is massaged into the gums – as an additional benefit, gum massage relieves muscular tensions in the jaw and neck area – so the active ingredients are absorbed much more quickly into the body than via topical application. Minimalist, gender-free and vegan beauty was also visible at the show, albeit more amongst the younger beauty brands. Japanese newcomer brand Borderfree offers a compact 3-sku product range of cleansing foam, facial essence and facial cream. With a strong clean beauty vibe and minimalist packaging, this is a classic GenZ/Millennial beauty brand. Korean functional beauty brand Geekko offers a similar brand experience: With 5 highly functional face care products packaged in eye-catching heavy glass flacons, fabric labels and concrete-gray cardboard boxes. With colourful, simple packaging and a distinct unisex slant, Korean indie brand Shupong is also focused on the GenZ/Millennials demographic. The newcomer brand’s line-up comprises six products including an innovative pimple patch dispenser reminiscent of an adhesive tape roller which is launching very soon. Finally, Hong Kong-based face care brand Pretti5 focuses on TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) plant extracts in classic clean beauty formulations. Manufactured in Japan, the brand’s line-up offers 14 face care products plus the most recent launch, a body cream."
"U.S. prestige beauty grew 14% to $31.7 billion in 2023, Circana reports","The growth streak has continued for the US beauty industry in 2023, said Circana. Sales of prestige beauty industry grew by 14% in value, year over year, to reach $31.7 billion in 2023. In comparison, mass market beauty sales experienced a year-over-year dollar increase of 6%, says the market research firm. In the prestige channel, which includes department stores and beauty specialty retailers, makeup was the fastest-growing category based on dollar sales, while skincare captured the top spot as the fastest-growing category based on units sold. In the mass market, makeup and skincare were the only two categories to grow based on units sold. Within prestige makeup, lip makeup was the strongest performer, growing at twice the rate of the overall category, up 31%, led primarily by products such as tinted lip oils and balms. Looking at prestige skincare trends, face serums and creams, body sprays, body lotions and creams, and body cleansers were among the top performers in the category. Prestige fragrance sales also concluded the year on a high note, found Circana. Looking at product trends, growth is happening on opposite ends of the spectrum. Higher fragrance concentrations including eau de parfums and parfums, which are also higher priced, gained three share points in 2023. On the other hand, lower-priced products, including mini/travel sizes and body sprays, gained traction. Unit sales for mini women’s fragrances grew at five times the rate of other sizes, and the size of the body spray market nearly tripled since 2022. The mini trend also manifested itself in gift sets, which was the fastest-growing segment of the fragrance market in 2023. Across prestige hair products, hair styling was the fastest grower, with dollar sales up 24%. This growth was to a large degree powered by innovation: Hair launch volume more than doubled versus 2022. Hair was also the only beauty category to capture more of its sales online, with e-commerce accounting for 52% of the volume. “The beauty industry is strong and the outlook remains positive for both the mass and prestige sides of the business in 2024,” said Larissa Jensen, global beauty industry advisor at Circana. “This performance is remarkable given the phenomenal growth it has experienced for the past two years, but the industry should not rest on its laurels. Consumers continue to cope with economic pressures, and being in tune with their shifting mindset is a must. Flexibility, creative thinking, and effectively harnessing high consumer engagement are all part of the winning formula to drive continued growth.”"
"From ’clean girl’ to ’glass skin,’ skincare is the new star of beauty routines","Influencers and beauty content creators seem to be (re)discovering the art of skincare, and now swear only by makeup removers, cleansers, serums, exfoliants, masks, moisturizers and other products designed to care for the skin. In the launches from major cosmetics brands or on social networks, the emphasis today is clearly on skincare: there are countless techniques and hacks designed to help people get a fresh, luminous, yet natural complexion. According to a report published by Circana last July, more than half of American makeup users (53%) are looking for hybrid makeup and skincare products, up six points on the previous year. This could involve nourishig skin while evening out skin tone with tinted serums and CC creams, moisturizing lips while coloring them with tinted lip balms, smoothing fine lines with anti-aging creams that are also tinted, or nourishing lashes while lengthening them with mascaras enriched with various active ingredients. These hybrid, or two-in-one skincare products have seen unprecedented growth in recent months. On TikTok — a hotbed of beauty trends — the hashtag #hybridskincare has already generated over eight million views, and that’s just the beginning. Beyond the time-saving benefits of these products, these new beauty routines reflect a desire to take care of skin without ditching makeup completely. And this inevitably brings Korean skincare, often based on dual-purpose concepts, firmly back into the spotlight. This is supported by a report by the Fresha platform, which says that Google searches for ""Korean skincare"" rose to an all-time high over the past five years, by 258% [1]. On TikTok, the #koreanskincare has notched up over 7.5 billion views, further demonstrating the popularity of such products. Today, the crave for ’perfect’ skin is reflected in a surge in beauty trends that that focus on this coveted fresh, luminous, but not overdone look. According to data provided by Fresha, searches for products designed to achieve a ’glass skin’ effect, characterized by a naturally fresh, dewy complexion, have increased by 202% over the last five years, while the aesthetic has accumulated over four billion views on TikTok. In the same vein, online searches for ’glowy skin’ have soared by 178% globally in the last seven days, driven by internationally renowned influencers including Hailey Bieber, with a hashtag nearing four billion views on TikTok. All these trends — which are converging towards lighter, more natural makeup, without ditching it completely — seem to fall under the banner of the ""clean girl,"" the queen of fresh, natural aesthetics, originating sometime in 2022. It’s a phenomenon that has slowly taken hold, and which now seems destined to last and to shake up certain beauty habits. “The ‘clean girl’ aesthetic is here to stay and is gaining more and more popularity due to its healthy glowing skin look. With celebrities such as Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber joining in on the trend, fans are also feeling influenced to also achieve the look,"" commented a spokesperson for Fresha. The trend is also seen in the ’high maintenance to be low maintenance’ routine, which is based on undergoing demanding and costly treatments from time to time in order to limit the time spent in the bathroom each morning. Add to that a strong interest in foods and supplements designed to nourish the skin from within, as well as in practices designed to enhance well-being, and we’re well on the way to a whole a new vision of beauty, based on a holistic approach encompassing aesthetics, as well as physicality and mental well-being."
Trends: How climate change will transform cosmetics,"Climate change is accelerating and becoming part of our daily lives. And while the beauty industry – brands and suppliers alike – is taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint, it is also looking at the practical consequences of the inevitable rise in temperatures. “Climate goes beyond sustainable development,” says Pascale Brousse, founder of Trend Sourcing. “It is important to look at the damage to health and skin, the implications for beauty, and how the industry will respond with skincare, makeup, and perfume”, she adds. According to Pascale Brousse, global warming is creating an ecosystem of consequences for the skin, leading to the emergence of a new climate-related dermatology. “We are going to be subject to an intense climate upheaval. Droughts, floods, heat peaks combined with humidity, and above all, pollution, will have an impact on the skin. There are more and more allergies, and they last longer because seasons are less marked. Dermatologists have observed a rise in cases of dermatitis, acne and skins damaged by pollution and climate, be it in Asia, South and North America, or Europe”, she continues. More intense exposure to pollution and UV rays also intensifies skin ageing, and all these factors require developing new skincare products tailored to the skin’s needs. Given these changes, the new generation of skincare products will be more responsive to the environment, she announces. “Contextualization will be developed for consumers who will be more receptive. We already have a few examples of these ‘Climate-Tracking Cosmetics’, including a limited edition by Clinique associated with an application that forecasts the weather and environmental factors. Likewise, Prose partnered with a climate tech company to set up an air quality index”. “Following the example of the Japanese, maintaining the body’s thermoregulation – a sign of good health, vascularized skin, and therefore, of better complexion – will become an objective”, she continues. What’s more, climate stress affects more and more people, leading to a growing interest in holistic beauty routines combining body and mind care. “We are going to want products increasingly related to emotional experience, like perfumes that act on our state of mind. Tomorrow’s cosmetics will be based on scents, colours, sounds, and sensations to create synesthesia. We will have multidimensional routines to treat both the body and mind. Skincare products and perfumes will be the new shrinks”, promises Pascale Brousse. Lastly, the shortage of certain natural ingredients due to extreme weather conditions likely to affect harvests may force us to make new choices. Securing supplies is emerging as a key issue. What will be the ingredients of tomorrow? Which natural ingredients are the most resilient? What can we already observe in crops? The consultant has devoted an entire chapter to helping brands with ecodesign and the rise of resilient skincare. Her analysis focuses in particular on smart sourcing in the face of climate change, which has become reality, thanks to biotechnologies, among others. Climate is changing, and beauty is adapting. In this new study, Pascale Brousse takes stock of the key issues to address and outlines a number of avenues for the future."
The age of thrill: five key beauty trends for 2024 and beyond,"As technology and science become integral facets of our always-evolving lifestyles, a growing demand exists for elevated and indulgent experiences. Consumers are newly energized by radical innovations that deliver extraordinary sensations and take performance to new heights. This thrill-seeking culture will impact our vision of beauty, awakening a more pluriversal mindset and establishing next-level expectations, propelling beauty in a Protopian trajectory. “In an era marked by uncertainties and polycrisis, there is a growing demand for emotionally compelling and exhilarating physical experiences, especially with our ever-evolving lifestyles. Consumers are now invigorated by groundbreaking innovations that offer extra-ordinary sensations while elevating performance to unprecedented levels. This trend of seeking thrills is set to influence our perception of beauty, giving rise to a more individual mindset, and establishing elevated expectations, propelling beauty into an Elysian [1] trajectory,” explains Leila Rochet, Chief Inspiration Officer of Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation. In the future, all experiences will be hybrid and product innovation will be committed to maximizing performance. New technologies and scientific discoveries, fore fronted by Artificial Intelligence, will transform consumers’ expectations, taking results-focused beauty to even higher levels. In the summer of 2023, Ulta Beauty partnered with Haut AI to bring personalized skincare diagnostics to the in-store experience. Following the launch, Haut AI developed SkinGPT - a skincare platform that uses generative AI to visually simulate the effects of products over time, based on a combination of a personalized quiz, uploaded images and clinical data. AI-powered bots will become a familiar feature outside of the professional salon space, meeting the demand for faster and budget-friendly options. Clockwork’s $10 mani-bot is rapidly spreading across the US, targeting residential complexes and airports strategically. In beauty, a mindset rooted in science and focused on solutions is making waves and is being embraced by consumers driven by tangible outcomes. Amorepacific’s latest innovation, the Lipcure Beam (CES Innovation Award 2024 – Korea) employs precision sensor and diagnostic technology to deliver next-level care. In the Future, Beauty will go far beyond beautification to meet the needs of consumers driven by tangible outcomes and by the need to optimize their daily performance. Beauty adapts to always-on-the-move lifestyles, as the thirst for leisure and the rising nomad economy drive innovation. The travel surge (and of “bleisure” – business & leisure) calls for refreshed routines, adaptive textures, and re-engineering of packaging, modifying the practical nature of beauty products. At PFW SS24, (September 2023 - France) Miu Miu presented a collection inspired by the future omni-traveler. Workwear was mixed with beachwear, sportswear was paired with eveningwear, as the brand played with the concept of “prototypical fashion”, reflecting the growing eclecticism of people’s daily lives. Climatic changes will also continue to impact choices and behaviors, calling for new climate-adaptive textures and packaging. Like the After Sun Gel from cult suncare brand Vacation (April 2023), which is primed to cool and soothe the skin after sun exposure. Demand for intelligent SPF hybrids will also rise as daily defense becomes central to the preparation for a better future. Combining a cooling sensation with SPF 50+, the TIRTIR Off The Sun Air Mousse SPF 50+ (April 2023 - Korea) features 2% Zero-Cooling Complex which is proven to reduce skin temperature by -4.8 degrees Celsius. In the future, beauty will need to take an adaptive approach and prime innovations for both the physical and emotional demands of on-the-go lifestyles. Utu is a skincare brand that has been specifically developed to adapt to outdoor lifestyles. Its philosophy is to protect, nourish and rejuvenate both the skin and the planet. Consumers are turning to lavish indulgences and grandiose gestures as a riposte to the daily grind of the recession. A new cohort of thrill-seekers are maxing out on experiences and eschewing convention to party through the permacrisis. The monumental economic success of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour underscores the cultural craving for escapism and consumer readiness to indulge. Beyoncé’s Renaissance tour also sparked social media frenzy (#renaissancetour: 3.9B TikTok views), inspiring countless copycat looks. In Korea, crystal nose-bridge embellishments have become a new way to wear face gems, thanks to fans spotting them on K-pop idols Jennie and Rosé from Blackpink during their Coachella performance. The new era of decadence is being shaped by the rediscovery of nightlife, which catapults lavish looks to center stage. This extravagant energy is encapsulated by Lisa from Blackpink’s showgirl-esque performance at Paris’ Crazy Horse cabaret, where she took up residency in September 2023. Unseen Beauty (UK) is one brand that is driven to deliver extra-ordinary experiences, bringing unexpectedly luxe finishes to makeup. The SPECTRA Eye Colour contains glass microspheres, half-coated with aluminum to transform the product into a bright, reflective silver under a phone camera’s flash. Making it the ideal accompaniment to a night out. For beauty, the desire for extra-vagance will call for an abundance of celebratory styles and the innovation of spectacular finishes, and the reclaiming of evening beautification. Value is being rapidly redefined by consumers who are demanding greater environmental responsibility, driving brands to consider the future implications of products. As the climate crisis continues to unfold, innovation will come to the foreground of beauty as consumers look for solutions to increasingly prominent issues caused by environmental deterioration. Waste solutions will continue to rise, and will be encircled into new retail concepts, such as Greez (February 2023 - France) - a resale platform for unsold cosmetics. And as secondhand continues to thrive in fashion, some beauty retailers are also finding there is value in “perfectly imperfect” products like This is Beauty (June 2023 – US). A better future calls for a symbiotic approach, blending science, technology, and nature to deliver bold and ambitious products that benefit both people and the planet. The acceleration of vertical farming (employed to great success by Ulé and Caudalie), opens up new territories of tech-driven sustainable sourcing. German brand Gezeiten worked with marine biologists and biotechnologists to study over a hundred compounds to develop Earth Marine CellTech Complex® - a combination of patented marine extracts and a mineral-rich submarine water concentrate. Plastic free solutions will continue to rise with packaging companies like Verity (US) proposing metal as a solution for beauty, or Notpla (UK) which is exploring the potential of regenerative packaging(UK). In beauty, a more holistic approach to innovation must emerge, privileging a more global life cycle approach and scrutiny in sourcing. As stress levels continue to rise in this period of permacrisis (61% of Americans say their stress is at an all-time high, while 89% of Chinese adults are actively seeking ways to reduce stress), emotional-bonding becomes essential in daily behavior. In beauty, this manifests in the rise of comfort-boosting textures and new psychodermatological narratives, which are propelled by TikTok. The issue of skin sensitivity and barrier protection presents a new opportunity for brands to innovate from a perspective of emotional care.  The success of Rare Beauty (expected to exceed $300 million in sales in 2023 according to Fast Company), opens the path to more emotion-infused beauty products. In this next phase, brands must consider the emotional implications of products, as consumers look to integrate new levels of care into their daily beauty routine - from the first touch to the finished look - while addressing the biological processes that take place under the surface. In this context, circadian beauty will continue to flourish. Complimentary skincare and supplement brand You’re Looking Well (UK) has developed the Night Pill & Night Cream (August 2023) to help users optimize their sleep. In beauty, brands will double down on emotionally-bonding facets - texture, color, scent, packaging - to provide consumers with uniquely sensorial moments. New territories of emotional satisfaction proven by science will also emerge as 70% of US consumers express interest in beauty and personal care products with mood-boosting qualities (Mintel 2024 Global Beauty and Personal Care Trends).

The state of UK beauty retail: “We are inundated with brands” – experts,"Last November, beauty brands, investors and consultancy firms met at Beauty Independent’s two-day debut Dealmaker Summit EU/UK in London, UK. Amongst the plethora of trends discussed during event, the future of beauty retail was spotlighted. “For many brands, retail is very, very important,” said Nader Naeymi-Rad, founder and publisher of Beauty Independent. “...For many, retailers are, especially now, that key accelerant to get them to the next level. D2C [direct-to-consumer] is great but it can only get you so far. At some point, you need that retail to access those Sephora members, Douglas members etc.,” Naeymi-Rad told attendees. But, he said retail landscape had been through “a lot of changes” in recent years. What was once a very simple divide between mass supermarkets and pharmacies and prestige department stores, travel retail locations and salons had now become a diverse array of stores and marketplaces, from curated multi-brand online platforms like Feelunique to specialist beauty stores like Sephora and mass online majors like Amazon. Clare Horner, group beauty director at UK luxury department store Harvey Nichols, said competition for shelf space was fiercer than ever today due to the “abundance of brands” in beauty. “There has been a massive shift; we are inundated with brands now. The selectivity is really the main challenge,” Horner said. And a lot of this, she said, was linked to lower barriers of entry for brands and the boom of innovative founder-led brands. Whilst Harvey Nichols still stocked many established beauty brands, she said the teams were now also increasingly on the look out for innovative new offerings, particularly via founder-led brands with stories to tell. “It’s definitely a challenge now for brands. There has been this abundance of new brands and now the retail landscape is on the move again,” she said. “We lost Debenhams just before COVID, and that really affected that middle-ground of department stores, and then there’s the whole pure-play rise. And retailers like Cult Beauty were very strong in launching new indie brands to market; they really took the space that Space NK used to be in with indie brands, and now it’s on the move again. I think it is very challenging for brands to find the right foothold.” Part of this challenge, she said, was also linked to the costs associated with entering retail. “Trading in retail is an expensive operation and you can’t come into it with little or low budgets. At Harvey Nichols, we still do give new startup brands an opportunity if we believe in them, but there has to be a strong level of investment in the product they’re bringing to market, even if the brand doesn’t have super deep pockets.” Nigel Lawmon, VP of global merchandising for hair care at beauty retail major Sephora UK, agreed, stating brands today had to be investing around 30% in retail and marketing to succeed in the market. Discussing what Sephora looked for in brands, Lawmon said: “We definitely want to see a brand have had some success in their first market from a D2C perspective. If they have that, that takes them up another notch because they’ve proven themselves and they’ve got some money behind them. If they’re doing £5 million in their D2C, that’s good. “...We need the brand to help drive their own awareness and then Sephora adds that credibility to the purchase for the consumer,” he said. Detailing how Harvey Nichols worked with beauty brands, Horner said it centered around creating in-store experiences. “We don’t even classify ourselves as a department store; we classify ourselves as a large boutique for fashion, beauty and food. For beauty brands that work with us, there is a formula and a way of working in our store environment and it’s all about the experience and the expertise. Smaller brands, for example, sit within a space called ’Beyond Beauty’ and we have our own team trained by brands in that space. But beyond that, we really encourage brands to come in and get involved in beauty masterclasses – connecting with our customer,” she said. Asked how Amazon had impacted and would continue to impact beauty retail, Horner described the model as “fascinating” but said it had not yet to made significant headwinds in luxury beauty. “The luxury brands don’t want to play there (…) because they don’t like how their brands are represented. And Amazon are clearly working hard at that and trying to onboard those brands but, so far, they haven’t managed to do it.” Irrespective of this, she said Amazon wasn’t the easiest route to market for any type or size of brand, because of this brand representation issue but also the struggle in standing out from the crowd. “I just think: try and build your brand with your own DNA, get it to a certain level, build awareness, and then think laterally about what retail options you pursue. I think Amazon is just so big, you can get lost in that landscape.” Lawmon agreed, stating Amazon was not necessarily the platform that offered most opportunity for beauty brands. “Amazon are a great logistics company and they shift a significant amount of volume, and we co-exist with them and they haven’t ruined our business like they dominated books and DVDs. They took those over and destroyed the high street. But with beauty, you’re building brands and also offering high levels of customer service and you’re bringing experience through stores, as well as loyalty schemes. These are all the aspects brick and mortar have on a much higher level than the transactional level that Amazon has.”"
These three celebrities had the most influence on fashion and beauty in 2023,"These days trends come thick and fast on social media, but there’s no doubt that celebrities still have the power to make certain ones go ultra-viral. Some can even boast of turning everything they touch — or promote — into a genuine fashion phenomenon. This year, that was the case for these three celebrities who left their mark on the fashion and beauty history books, at least for the year 2023. Even if you didn’t go to the cinema to see the ""Barbie"" movie, you’ve at least heard of it as it was impossible to miss this phenomenon, the year’s highest-grossing feature film, which also meant a neverending series of pink outfits worn by one of the film’s stars, Margot Robbie. Not content with showing off her exceptional outfits, including numerous dresses by Chanel (of which she is a spokesmodel) at screenings of the Greta Gerwig-directed comedy, Margot Robbie also shone on the red carpets of multiple fashion events. From the Oscars, where she caused a sensation in a long black sequinned dress by Armani Privé, to the Met Gala, where she wore a vintage creation by Chanel, to the Chanel Cruise 2024 fashion show in Los Angeles, where she stood out in jeans and visible lingerie, Margot Robbie was clearly in the spotlight this year. On TikTok, which has become a true incubator for fashion and beauty trends, not only does the #barbiecore hashtag now boast over a billion views, but #margotrobbie has tallied almost 14.5 billion views, including 340 million dedicated to the #margotrobbiebarbie hashtag. It wasn’t on a catwalk that the platinum-album-selling American singer made her mark this year, but on stage. On the occasion of her ""Renaissance World Tour,"" Queen Bey treated showgoers to a veritable wardrobe marathon, with hundreds of outfits custom-designed by top fashion designers and couture houses. In total, this series of concerts enabled her to put on no fewer than 56 musical ""fashion shows,"" a record for the ""Break My Soul"" performer, who has over 319 million followers on Instagram. Among the multitude of outfits in which Beyoncé appeared on stage were clothes and accessories specially designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, Balmain, Schiaparelli, Mugler, Jacquemus, Marine Serre, Paco Rabanne, Loewe, Alexander McQueen and many others. This sartorial showcase also enabled these labels and designers to gain — even more — visibility. It’s an image that shouldn’t have caused such a stir — why point the finger at a woman who doesn’t wear makeup? — but it did propel Pamela Anderson to the top of this year’s beauty trends. And not just any beauty trend, since it’s the ’no makeup’ trend that the Canadian-American star catapulted into the spotlight, an aesthetic choice that prompted even more questioning of societal beauty norms. This despite the fact that Pamela Anderson confided to Elle magazine that she abandoned her beauty routine after the death of her makeup artist, Alexis Vogel. This flash of attention dates back to last fall, during Paris Fashion Week, where the 2024 spring-summer collections were on show. While Pamela Anderson has been starring in a moving, candid documentary on Netflix since January 2023, she made several appearances without a trace of make-up at the fashion event of the year, causing a sensation in mainstream media and on social networks. And this was no ’one shot’ move: the actress repeated this tour de force in early December at the Fashion Awards 2023. An ""act of courage and rebellion,"" as Jamie Lee Curtis described it on her Instagram account. ""The natural beauty revolution has officially begun,"" the American actress enthused. A revolution for something that should no longer require a revolution, but one that is helping to shatter a few more of the expectations made of women’s appearances."
What were the main beauty trends on TikTok in 2023?,"TikTok is nothing short of a trend incubator and in just a few years has become a leading destination for users seeking inspiration in fashion and beauty. Not content with causing tips and products to go viral in these fields, TikTok is also a reliable barometer for assessing the just how widespread a trend is. So, with the end of the year fast approaching, we highlight the key makeup trends revealed on the platform over the course of 2023, based on the number of views per hashtag. And the results bring some surprises: makeup inspiration from the series ""Euphoria"" is among the most popular, despite the fact that the last season was broadcast on HBO at the beginning of... 2022. On TikTok, the hashtag #Euphoriamakeup generated no less than 2.6 billion views, with a host of tutorials and inspirations to boot. It’s worth noting, however, that these figures aren’t exclusively linked to the year 2023, but they do testify to a definite craze for beauty looks from the hit HBO series. On the other hand, ’strawberry makeup,’ one of summer’s key trends, seems to have made its mark in 2023, with some 530 million views. And it’s model Hailey Bieber who’s behind this look, tested and approved by a host of beauty enthusiasts. Also wildly successful was ’latte makeup,’ another must-have for 2023, which is slowly but surely approaching 500 million views (495 million to date, to be exact). The beauty look is essentially defined by warm, almost caramelized tones, giving off the effect of a light tan. In other words, three of the most popular makeup effects of the year. And indeed, the trend has given rise to numerous variations on the theme, such as ’espresso makeup’ and ’pumpkin spice latte makeup,’ the autumnal variant. Both have already exceeded 60 million and 70 million views respectively. Among the other major beauty inspirations of 2023, ’passport makeup,’ which translates into beauty looks designed for passport photos, stands out with over 400 million views. The same goes for ’glazed donut nails,’ which generated more than 380 million views, thanks — once again — to Hailey Bieber, whose influence in the world of beauty is unquestionable."
"Cosmoprof India 2023 wraps up on a high note with over 9,000 visitors","“We are excited about the success of Cosmoprof India. For three incredible days, over 9,000 attendees from 55 countries ‐ suppliers, brands, retailers, distributors, and professionals ‐ had the chance to meet each other, explore the cutting‐edge trends and product launches, and get inspired by new tools and solutions,” said Enrico Zannini, General manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. The B2B show, dedicated to the fast‐growing Indian beauty market hosted over 450 exhibitors from 19 countries. Held from 7 to 9 December 2023 at the Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai, the event welcomed 9,000 visitors from 55 countries, a 20% growth compared to the previous edition. According to the organizers, visitors from international brands grew by 49%, compared to last year, and best represented countries among visitors were India, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, United Kingdom, Australia, France, Italy, Nepal, South Korea. “The conjunction between Cosmopack India, with leading suppliers presenting their latest and most innovative solutions, and Cosmoprof India, with finished product brands launching their brand‐new collection, is really appreciated by stakeholders”, continued Mr Zannini. Cosmoprof India 2023 provided a strategic overview to both the development of the local industry and international trends and brand‐new solutions, owing to the presence of five country pavilions: Australia, Korea, Italy, Taiwan, and UK. Cosmoprof India is set to return at the Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai from 5 to 7 December 2024."
"Make-up: On Tiktok, a quest for fuller lips","The quest in more varied beauty styles is reflected in the fall in interest in injections that modify the natural shape of the lips or the rest of the face, and a much greater craze for makeup techniques that promptly help achieve prominent cheekbones, smoother skin or fuller lips. At the same time, there’s also a renewed focus on more demanding beauty routines, in terms of skincare, waxing, eyelash extensions or hair treatments. This kind of time-consuming process is seen as an investment that helps streamline routines to save time in the bathroom every morning. In short, beauty can swing either way right now, from ""less is more"" to ""more is less,"" and that seems to suit most people just fine. In this quest to find the most ingenious tricks to replace less natural beauty procedures, such as injections, social network users are turning en masse to professional makeup artists. And it’s Mary Phillips, who does make-up for celebrities such as Sydney Sweeney, Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner and Dua Lipa, who attracted the most attention whe it comes to boost the volume of lips, making them look fuller than ever, without the need for fillers. To achieve this goal a simple lip pencil is all you need. In a video viewed over three million times, Mary Phillips gives a complete tutorial on this makeup technique. All those interested need is a lip pencil slightly darker than their lip colour (but not too dark). Then, they just have to draw a line starting at the outer corners. The makeup artist recommends following the natural lip line, then continuing outside this line when approaching Cupid’s bow. For the lower lip, on the other hand, it is recommended to stick to the natural line, extending a little with a slightly more prominent line in the centre. Once this step is completed, one’s just has to subtly blend everything with a brush, and apply a touch of concealer to camouflage any pencil that may have overrun, then to fill in the lips with gloss or lipstick, depending on the desired effect. As a result, lips look plumped, but without having lost their natural shape. This trick is reminiscent of a technique shared in 2021 by Mario Dedivanovic, Kim Kardashian’s favorite makeup artist. Mario’s technique involves drawing quite a thick line on the upper lip, overlining the lip on the Cupid’s bow, before bringing the liner in along the lip line as you work down to the corners. Then, again, overline the bottom lip in the center only, then follow the natural line of the lip up to the corners. Finally, fill in with a lipstick of the same shade, or a lighter shade, for optimal effect. A subtly different method, but one that proves that a simple lip liner can be all you need to achieve full lips as ’naturally’ as possible. A series of solutions in line with the growing rejection of invasive aesthetic procedures, such as hyaluronic acid injections or similar filling techniques."
"Beyond ‘clean beauty’, US consumers increasingly seek sustainable products","When people talk about sustainability, it might mean different things to different people. Some may choose to use reusable bags at the grocery store or limit their water consumption while others support fair trade brands. Most associate sustainability more with environmental impact than social causes. According to a NielsenIQ survey, 61% of U.S. consumers associate sustainability with benefiting the planet, 57% with preserving natural resources, and 54% with reducing pollution. Only 33% associate it with better conditions for workers and 26% with societal contributions. While definitions of sustainability may vary, it is becoming more important to consumers. 62% stated that sustainability is more important to them than it was two years ago. It’s prevalence in the news and visible real-world effects are propelling this awareness into purchasing action. ""Initially focused on eliminating perceived ’harmful’ ingredients, consumers now seek products that not only meet clean Beauty standards but also minimize environmental impact,"" explained NielsenIQ. According to the market research firm, sustainable segments across beauty, are experiencing substantial dollar growth, with compostable products growing by 30.9%, cruelty free products up 18.1%, and plastic free products up 12.2%. Thus, U.S. consumers are transitioning from an ingredient-focused clean beauty 1.0  — with claims like ’paraben-free’ or ’sulfate-free’ — towards a clean beauty 2.0 that also encompasses environmental concerns, before perhaps also amalgamating the societal issues. Consequently, consumers are paying more attention to packaging waste, with a significant +64% increase in searches for refillable options. ""Consumers are letting us know that sustainability is important to them, and it is a trend we can expect to continue to see in the beauty category. Brands must communicate clear messages about their sustainability efforts to cater to consumers seeking products that align with their sustainability goals,"" concludes NielsenIQ."
"Soft, sensual and contemporary, ’Peach Fuzz’ is set to be the color of 2024","Everyone was banking on red, but it’s a ""velvety"" and ""gentle"" shade of peach that the global experts at the Pantone Color Institute have chosen as the color of the year for 2024. It’s a shade imbued with positive qualities, conveying warmth and comfort and symbolizing community, which undoubtedly reflects a need for nurturing and empathy as well as an air of calm and a feeling of sanctuary. Announced simultaneously on Pantone’s website and Instagram account, the color of 2024 is also synonymous with soft sophistication and sensuality. ""A warm and cozy shade highlighting our desire for togetherness with others and the feelings this creates ....Subtly sensual, [it) is a heartfelt peach hue bringing a feeling of tenderness and communicating a message of caring and sharing, community and collaboration,"" Pantone explains on its Instagram account. Adding, ""Highly suggestive of good taste ... Peach Fuzz is a gift to the senses, creating a symbiotic relationship between our sense of taste, sight, touch, and scent."" The economic, social and environmental crises, as well as geopolitical instability, have no doubt contributed to the choice of this soft, poetic and light hue. As Laurie Pressman, vice-president of the Pantone Color Institute, points out: ""At a time of turmoil in many aspects of our lives, our need for nurturing, empathy and compassion grows ever stronger as does our imaginings of a more peaceful future ...in a world which often emphasizes productivity and external achievements, it is critical we recognize the importance of fostering our inner selves and find moments of respite, creativity, and human connection amid the hustle and bustle of modern life."" ""Peach Fuzz 13-1023,"" its full name, succeeds ""Viva Magenta 18-1750,"" a hue between red, violet and pink, again evoking positive values, but more focused on strength, dynamism and energy."
’High maintenance ’: the beauty trend shaving minutes off morning routines,"The ’high maintenance to be low maintenance’ tend, which has already scored over 50 million views on TikTok, encourages women to invest in more demanding, more costly but more long-lasting services – most of them being carried out by professionals – in order to free up time day to day. This new beauty routine (1.4 million views for #highmaintenanceroutine) is all about getting more sleep, and waking up (almost) ready to leave the house. Actually, ’high maintenance to be low maintenance’ may already be firmly entrenched in women’s daily habits, with tricks like permanent hair removal, which has been popular for several years now, eliminating the need for daily care. It’s an undeniable time-saver, with the added bonus of avoiding ongoing maintenance that can be both restrictive and costly in the long term. On TikTok, it’s now customary to share your ’high maintenance routine’ and show how it saves you time from the moment you wake up. While laser hair removal is undoubtedly the most popular beauty service, it’s far from the only one. In fact, the new routine can be tailored to individual needs and budgets, since there are no strict rules. Salon services include eyelash extensions, brow lamination sessions for full, perfectly defined and neat eyebrows, eyelash lifts for naturally curled lashes, keratin treatments for permanently silky hair, gel manicures (which can also be done at home) or nail extensions, plus microblading for semi-permanent eyebrow redesign and restructuring, and Brazilian hair straightening. There are many other services and techniques that can be carried out by a professional, but these are among the most popular with social media users. Botox is also cited as a way of avoiding multiple facial treatments. But those who don’t have the budget for these services can be inventive at home. For hair, a blow-out can hold several days, for example, just as numerous tricks spotted on the social platform can get you perfectly defined curls in record time. These include using socks and the ’ponytail blowout’. But an intense, optimal haircare routine, carried out at least once a week, also means less time spent in the bathroom every day. On the makeup front, tantouring seems to be a top hack for many people. This involves creating permanent, or almost permanent, contouring using a self-tan products. These are just some of the tips that can help streamline a morning beauty routine to gain you a few extra minutes of sleep without having to neglect your appearance."
Trade show report: Three beauty trends spotted at Cosmoprof Asia 2023,"As usual, Cosmoprof Asia took place in two venues - Cosmopack (supply chain / packaging) at AsiaWorld Expo, and Cosmoprof (finished products) at the Hong Kong Conference and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) in Wan Chai – with overlapping opening days (14th to 16th November for Cosmopack, 15th to 17th November for Cosmoprof). Cosmoprof Asia’s usual features were also back this year, including the Cosmotalks series of lectures and panels, Cosmo on Stage (workshops and product demonstrations) and the annual Cosmoprof Asia Awards. The event attracted 65,582 visitors from 119 countries. This marked a remarkable 64% increase compared to the previous edition held in Hong Kong in 2019 (which was impacted by the protests), and brought the visitor numbers close to the levels achieved in 2018. Strolling the aisles of the event, Premium Beauty News spotted three key trends: One of the most visible trends at the trade show were active ingredients-led face and body care launches, featuring ingredients such as niacinamide, peptides and retinol. Retinol proved to be particularly popular amongst new Asian launches, especially Korean and Japanese brands while cica (centella asiatica) continues to be a standard ingredient in Korean cosmetics. Korean face care brand Dr. Oracle new three-sku RetinoTightening range contains 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone retinoate, 0.04% adenosine and 2% niacinamide to help improve wrinkles on face and neck. The line-up includes a cream cleanser, ampoule (serum) and moisturiser. Japanese beauty manufacturer Cogit took the basic formula from its best-selling Cica Method range and added retinol in its brand new Cica Retinol Body Lotion. Several face care products featuring the same combination of cica and retinol are set to launch within the next few months. Korean brand Dermafirm introduced two launches this September: The Cica AC range comprises five face care products for problem skin formulated with centella asiatica extract while The Peptide is a more anti-ageing focused range and features a moisturising cream, serum and cream mask formulated with 22 different types of peptides. Microbiome-focused beauty has been a global trend for several years now, and the word “biome” was visible in a number of new brand launches at Cosmoprof Asia. Russian natural cosmetics brand Natura Siberica extended its Biome range, which was launched last year, and added more than 20 segmented face care products to the line-up. All products are formulated with fermented ingredients and pre-/probiotic actives. Bulgarian organic beauty brand Alteya Organics also focused on biome protection in the launch of its new Rose Hydrobiome range which contains rose water, marine ingredients and fermented extracts to moisturise the skin. And Dr. Oracle’s new 4-sku CentellaBiome line, which contains 7 different types of cica extracts (cica root extract, cica leaf extract, madecassoide, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, asiatic acid and cica extract), was formulated specifically to protect and boost the microbiome of sensitive and troubled skin. Another major trend were aromatherapeutical/functional fragrance and wellness-focused products launches, especially in the home fragrance category. The related category of sleep beauty/sleep tech (a category which includes digital devices, functional foods and beverages, supplements and beauty products designed to improve sleep quality) was also visible at Cosmoprof Asia 2023, particularly amongst the Asian exhibitors. Driven by the pandemic, the global market for sleep tech reached almost 17m USD in 2022 and is forecast to grow by almost 18% CAGR until 2028. In Japan, the sleep tech market doubled during the pandemic, according to Asahi Shimbun newspaper whilst Korean company MediC&C has organised an annual Sleep Tech expo in Seoul’s COEX expo center since 2020. Unsurprisingly, a lot of new aromatherapy/sleep beauty launches came from Korean and Japanese brands. Korean functional fragrance brand Arth was launched in summer 2022 and offers a wide range of scented candles, bath/body care, scented multibalms, solid perfumes, room diffusers, and EDT perfume sprays. All fragrances are unisex and formulated with essential oils to help boost emotional health, offering aromatherapeutical benefits such as improving sleep quality and boosting emotional health. Aromang, another Korean indie brand, combines aromatherapy with colour therapy. Aromang launched in 2019 with a product line-up including sleep-enhancing pillow sprays, body oils, face oils and guasha massage tools. The brand’s offline POS – there are three stores across Seoul that retail Aromang products – offer  colour therapy to guide customers unsure about which fragrance they should choose. Japanese personal care manufacturer NatureLab recently brought out new range of wellness-focused fabric softeners in its Laundrin range - aromatherapeutically-scented household cleansing products, especially laundry detergents, fabric softeners and fabric sprays. The Laundrin Tea collection range comprises four tea scented variants (darjeeling lemon, white tea, earl grey tea and oolong tea) that offer a soothing and uplifting at-home fragrance experience. On the sleep side, Naturelab’s launched a sleep-enhancing night-time range. The line-up of Lavons to the Moon line includes room diffusers, fabric softener, fabric spray and scented wardrobe sachets available in two relaxing fragrances. Japanese body care brand John’s Blend recently introduced an aromatherapeutical bath and body care range available in three fragrances: yuzu, Japanese cypress and spearmint. Each fragrance sub-range is available as fizzing bath tablets, room spray, hand cream and bath oil, with the aim to achieve a relaxing at-home experience even in small living spaces. Anti-ageing high-tech products and devices are a staple at any Asian beauty trade show, and Cosmoprof Asia 2023 was no exception. The Asian exhibitors in particular were quite innovative in this category. Chinese beautytech brand Nicemay, for example, introduced a new at-home LED mask equipped with options for red light (said to stimulate collagen production) and blue light (to refine pores and improve skin texture). Amongst its more high-tech face mask launches, Chinese beauty manufacturer NBC Nox Bellcow presented an EMS (electric muscle stimulation) sheet mask with integrated electrodes. Once the mask is activated, a very low electric current transmitted through the electrode patches will tone the muscles and tighten the contours of the face. On the low-tech beauty side of things, sheet masks are traditionally a huge category in the Asian facial skin care market and there were plenty of new launches in this sector. NBC’s new Nano Instant Tightening Mask is a sheet mask that leaves a creamy/foamy serum layer on the skin once it is peeled off. Thanks to the nano-sized ingredients which include hyaluronic acid and collagen, the serum layers disappears into the skin extra quickly. Korean sheet mask manufacturer Adwin’s recent sheet mask innovations didn’t just include a new skin-brightening knee mask (flower shaped for easier application on the knees) but also two hydrogel masks with ingredients targeting specific facial areas. The Purederm Multi Area Only Gel Masks feature a different-coloured hydrogel strip across the eye area. This strip contains ingredients especially selected to hydrate the delicate eye area whilst the rest of the face benefits from more active ingredients. Another new Adwin launch was the exfoliating Purederm Sebum Melting Clear Mask formulated with AHA and BHA acids. This isn’t a typical sheet mask but rather a half moon-shaped mask sheet was designed to be placed over the nose and the surrounding areas to soften sebum plugs in the nose pores. Unlike pore strips which are torn off and can damage the delicate nose skin, the sebum mask sheet can be easily removed and the blackheads/clogs extracted by hand or with an extraction tool. In 2024, Cosmoprof Asia will take place from 12th to 15th November (12th to 14th November for Cosmopack, 13th to 15th November for Cosmoprof)."
Euromonitor International unveils top six global consumer trends for 2024,"Artificial intelligence, sustainability and social, economic and political factors will determine global consumer trends in 2024, according to the latest report from Euromonitor International.

Thus, according to Euromonitor, the top Global Consumer Trends in 2024 are: Ask AI - New tools are evolving into co-creators for consumers, influencing their decisions and reshaping their expectations of brand engagement. As more than 40% of consumers said they would be comfortable with voice assistants offering personalised recommendations, these platforms will become increasingly integrated into consumers’ daily lives. According to Euromonitor, businesses should utilise generative AI to enhance personalisation and improve the overall customer experience. Delightful Distractions - Consumers seek an escape from daily stress and anxieties to break away from the mundane. Some 29% of consumers would be comfortable with brands tracking their emotions and personalising experiences to their moods. Greenwashed Out - Environmental concerns remain top of mind. More than 60% of consumers tried to have a positive impact on the environment in 2023. While consumers are attempting to live more sustainably, they question whether companies and governments are fully utilising available resources to create a meaningful impact. They want organisations to step up and show proof of their eco pledges. Progressively Polarised - Political and social issues are at the core of personal identities. These belief systems influence perspectives, values and attitudes. In 2024, consumers will not refrain from expressing their convictions, found Euromonitor. Social responsibility, political affiliation and sustainability initiatives will motivate spending. Value Hackers - With the ongoing cost-of-living crisis consumers are adjusting their financial mindset and 44% of consumers planned to save more money in 2023. They are employing increasingly clever strategies to get the very best deals. Wellness Pragmatists - Consumers are seeking fast and effective solutions to improve both their physical and mental wellbeing. Demonstrated effectiveness will play a significant role in their purchasing decisions: 85% of consumers would be willing to pay more for beauty products with proven efficacy or benefits. In a context where consumer preferences are closely linked to the sustainability agenda, technological progress and the impact of sociopolitical issues, “companies should handle sensitive subjects with caution while staying true to their brand’s core values,” commented Alison Angus, Head of Innovation at Euromonitor International."
Men and women in the U.S. are more comfortable with the idea of aging,"In a society that idolizes youth, growing older can feel like a shameful malediction. However, a rising trend of folks are embracing their silver strands. This is supported by the findings of new research conducted by the beauty and wellness booking platform StyleSeat, which polled over 2,000 Americans about their perceptions and experience of aging [1]. But if the overall U.S. population is more comfortable with the idea of aging, social pressure makes it much more complex for women. While 70% of men say they have no problem with aging, only 57% of women say the same. The survey findings show that Americans, men and women alike, are generally accepting of the process of aging and the changes associated with it. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (63%) agree with this statement, and almost three-quarters (73%) even consider older people to be comparable in beauty to their younger counterparts. Surprisingly, younger generations are more prone to say that “beauty is ageless”: the Gen Z leads the charge with 84%, trailed closely by millennials (73%), Gen X (72%), and boomers at 67%. Here again, however, there are gender disparities, with 81% of women having no trouble equating old age with beauty, compared to only 65% of men. Looking more closely at the changes that aging brings, it seems — in theory at least — that Americans are all for a natural approach. More than half (54%) say they prefer authenticity to camouflaging the signs of aging. Baby Boomers (68%) lead the way in embracing their natural skin, followed by Generation X (62%) and Millennials (53%). Younger people, who nevertheless consider beauty to be ageless, are much less inclined to accept showing signs of age, at least in the future (only 22% chose authenticity). Here again, there’s a gulf between men and women. Only 35% of American women are likely to keep things au naturel as they age, compared with 73% of men. If gray hair cannot be associated with age alone, it is undoubtedly one of its symbols. In the United States, only two in five of those concerned say they accept going gray and forego coloring their hair to hide it. But this is — again — more the case for men (54%) than for women (25%). The survey also reveals that one in five Americans opt to change their hairstyle to look younger, including 24% of women and 17% of men. After asking respondents a series of questions, the authors of the study ranked the US states most inclined to accept age-related changes. With a score of around 91/100, Iowa came out on top of the list of states most accepting of aging, ahead of Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota and Kansas. Conversely, with a score of 75/100, Michigan is the worst performer, followed by Maine, Alabama, Florida and Nevada."
Pharma-Recharge Consortium: A successful pharmacy bulk test,"Eight cosmetic brands – Mustela (Laboratoires Expanscience), Garancia, La Rosée Cosmétiques, Bioderma (NAOS), A-Derma, Ducray, Eluday, and Klorane (Laboratoires Pierre Fabre) – united for the first time to set up a shared ecoresponsible project and offer 15 of their products in bulk at physical stores, so they can be purchased as refills in 500-ml glass-based pump bottles. Supported by (Re)Set, a consulting agency specialized in economic and environmental transition, the Pharma-Recharge Consortium launched the experience at the Carré Opéra pilot pharmacy on June 22nd, with a simple, easy-to-use concept compliant with hygiene standards. “63% of French people would like to buy their usual packed products in bulk [1]”, says Antoine Maret, Open Innovation Director of Laboratoires Expanscience for the Mustela brand, “but there is no real solution in points of sale. To understand and respond to consumer behaviours, we are now entering a cooperation era. A triple win, economic, ecological, and ecoresponsible cooperation”, he adds. The system takes the form of a piece of furniture shared by the 15 fountains of products and designed by Mobil Wood, an expert in ecodesigned furniture made from wood of French origin. The fountains were designed by Jean Bouteille, a pioneer company specialized in bulk and reuse solutions. The user follows the steps on the control module to fill in their bottle. The latter is to be fixed to the fountain selected, so a predefined dose is automatically poured, and then a label with the batch number and instructions is immediately issued to be affixed on the bottle. Then, the user washes the bottle, takes it back following the instructions given, and refills it for a price inferior to 15% to 20% to the initial price. The washing instructions are provided on the regulatory label automatically printed by the module and are also displayed on the piece of furniture, in the pharmacy. The first time, the bottle costs €1.99, and the number of reuses is counted every time the bottle is refilled. The items selected by the brands are daily products with a high sales volume. They are also chosen for their compatibility with the fountains, in particular in terms of viscosity. They are usually hygiene products like shower gels, shampoos, or micellar water: an oat-based shampoo by Klorane, the Bioderma Atoderm Cleansing Oil, La Rosée’s Makeup Remover Micellar Gel, the Mustela Organic Cleansing Gel, Garancia’s Pschitt Magique Micropeeling... Driven by two main reasons for buying refilled products, i.e. reduced plastic waste and cheaper price, the pilot experience seems to have appealed to both consumers and the pharmacy staff. After four months, a survey of 150 users revealed that 90% of them were satisfied of the experience, and that 99% supported reuse for hygiene and beauty products. These encouraging results led the consortium to deploy its common project further in various regions. The furniture will be installed in four other pharmacies this November: two in Eastern France, one in the South-West, and one East of Paris. The experience will span six months, until May 2024, so a first assessment can be carried out, but the consortium has announced that several additional brands are already in line to be integrated to the project."
TikTok slated to disrupt the beauty retail space in the U.S.,"TikTok Shop US brings shoppable videos and live stream sessions across the country, thus giving brands, merchants, and creators new tools to sell directly through the app. According to Nielsen IQ, 85% of total TikTok Shop sales during its September launch in the US where in the health and beauty category. Within that category, the top-selling products were: facial skin care, vitamins & supplements, fragrance, teeth whitening kits, lip cosmetics. “It’s not surprising to see facial skin care and lip cosmetics (products that qualify as beauty impulse purchases) rising to the top of the list, but categories like Vitamins & Supplements and Teeth Whitening Kits generally aren’t considered impulse categories. TikTok Shop is already driving an interesting new retail dynamic,” commented the market research firm in a press release. Nielsen IQ also reports that in September, TikTok Shop ranked twentieth in health and beauty sales among e-commerce retailers in the U.S. In view of this meteoric growth, Nielsen IQ thinks TikTok is poised to disrupt the retail space, especially in the beauty category, where social media profoundly influences purchasing decisions. “The visually appealing nature of beauty products lends itself to the medium of social media, enabling the creation of compelling ads and organic content that resonate with audiences,” said Nielsen IQ. Of course, influencers a have also played a pivotal role in attracting consumers and driving sales within this ecosystem. In this context, Nielsen IQ announces the launch of a new measurement tool and data tracking service for TikTok sales. “TikTok Shop is a rapidly growing platform, and brands and retailers need to understand how their products are performing on it. Our new measurement will provide them with the insights they need to make informed decisions about their TikTok Shop strategies,” explained John Busardo, Senior Vice President and Beauty & OTC Vertical Lead, Nielsen IQ. Please note: The way TikTok is disrupting traditional perfume code will be on of the topics discussed during the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit, which will be held in Paris on October 30, 2023.

Textured hair in France: in the spotlights like never before,"Over 565% growth in 2022 for Les Secrets de Loly, four openings in less than four years for Baraboucle, the latest of which is coming soon in Lille, brands from the United States and the UK, such as Carol’s Daughter and Bouclème: the French market for natural care products for textured hair is booming! The term ""textured hair"" is actually quite recent. It covers all hair types that are not straight, including wavy, curly, frizzy and kinky hair. ""Not so long ago, the term ""ethnic hair"" was still used. We’ve come a long way! We made our debut in Carrefour hypermarkets in the 2000s with what was known as a ""tropical"" operation, and for a long time we remained in the ""products of the world"" section before moving into the hair care section much later,"" recalls Jean-Claude Cheffre, Head of the Activilong brand, part of the Labomai Group (Laboratoires Miss Antilles International), which was created in 1953 by his mother, Yannick Cheffre [1]. ""For a long time in mainland France, textured hair was almost totally excluded from retail shelves and even among hairdressers, who didn’t know how to style this type of hair,"" points out Camille Scouarnec, Product Manager at Énergie Fruit. From the mid-1970s onwards, French nationals from French overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM) began to move to mainland France. It was at this time that the first specialised salons appeared. Unlike today’s salons, techniques in vogue at the time included texture modification, with the inevitable hair straightening, artificial curls made popular in the United States by Michael Jackson, and chemical colouring... ""These denaturing looks were everywhere: on French television, in the beauty pages of magazines, and were gradually becoming familiar to people. So when we leave our hair natural or braid it, it’s as if our hair hadn’t been done,"" explains Josiane Ologbi, founder of the minimalist brand Iwalewa. ""In the United States and now in Europe, we’re gradually moving away from these preconceived ideas, and that’s fantastic! It’s still hard in some African countries, such as Senegal, which I visit regularly. It’s difficult to get rid of beauty standards that have been ingrained for decades, but it’s happening,"" she says with a smile. In addition to the pressure arising from aesthetic - or even social - standards opposed to the nature of our hair, straightening practices and other texture modifications are proving to be very aggressive and raise health issues: burnt, broken, ultra-sensitised hair. A recently conducted American study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) even showed a link between the use of straightening products and the development of uterine cancer. ""When I created Les Secrets de Loly in 2009, the range of products for textured hair in France was fairly limited, but there was already a backlash against silicone-laden products and a pressing need for hair care products with natural ingredients,"" recalls Kelly Massol, founder of the Les Secret de Loly brand, which now sells a product every eight seconds in France! As for Michele Scott-Lynch, founder of the British brand Bouclème, which has been gradually entering the French market since the beginning of the year, she explains that it was when her daughter asked her to straighten her hair that things clicked. ""I spent all my teens and twenties fighting against my hair, trying to change its appearance and straighten it, and damaging it as a result. There was no question of history repeating itself"". This is why, in 2014, she launched a brand to care for every type of hair curl with tailored routines to cleanse, condition and define them. ""What’s important to understand is that the curlier the hair, the drier the lengths and the greater the need for hydration,"" stresses Camille Scouarnec. This is because sebum accumulates at the roots, slowed down by the hair’s surface, leaving lengths and ends dehydrated. ""At Énergie Fruit, our motto is to offer clean, transparent products for all, without compromising on pleasure or efficiency. Since the brand was created in 2012, we’ve been offering a shampoo and mask for curly hair under the name ""Coco Curl."" By talking to our online community, we realised that the routine wasn’t comprehensive enough. That’s why this year we’ve launched a styling gel and an anti-split end and anti-crease sublimating oil. What’s more, we’ve also launched the Nutri-Intense range, with three products: a shampoo, a mask and a styling milk, for curly to frizzy hair,"" specifies Camille Scouarnec. ""With the proliferation of products on offer, retailers are now paying very close attention to the textured hair segment,"" says Jean-Claude Cheffre with a smile. Until now, French people with curly and frizzy hair had little choice but to order products from the other side of the world or buy them at high prices from only a few distributors, who were often only to be found in large cities. ""With Les Secrets de Loly, my ambition has always been, on the one hand, to offer a range of natural products for maintaining curly hair and, on the other, to make this brand accessible to everyone! That’s why, with my sales manager, we’re working hard on our distribution network. We’re present in Monoprix, thousands of chemists, health and beauty stores, hairdressers and, since 18 September, we’re available at Sephora,"" explains Kelly Massol [2]. The brand has also done remarkable work on its social networks, growing from 20,000 followers at the end of 2017 to more than 250,000 in September 2023, thanks in particular to the creation of Christmas boxes with influencers such as La Petite Gaby, Babyatoutprix, Kaaymbl, Crazy Sally... The brand has even ventured to broadcast its first TV advertising campaign in November 2020, in the midst of confinement, on the channels of the TF1 Group. The ad will be viewed by 2.5 million people. A true stroke of genius on the part of Secrets de Loly, whose claims are to dare - at last - wear one’s hair naturally. During this time of return to basics, the ""natural beauty"" trend took off, both in haircare and skincare. Morgane Brisson, founder of the Baraboucle hairdressing salons, says that there really has been ""a ""pre"" and an ""post"" confinement period in the move to natural curls. I believe that people realised how good it felt for their hair not to be straightened and tied up all the time."" After three openings in Paris between 2020 and 2023, Baraboucle will soon open its fourth salon in Lille in November, providing an opportunity to target Belgium, where demand is strong, and to meet the needs of people in Lille who used to travel back and forth to Paris just to get their hair done and seek advice. It takes an average of six weeks to get an appointment at one of the brand’s three current salons, which shows the need to democratise the range of treatments on offer, but also to increase the number of places where hair curls can be taken care of. Since the start of the new academic year, a certification programme devoted entirely to curly, frizzy and kinky hair is available in five accredited pilot centres (in the Île-de-France, Hérault, Southern France, Moselle and Normandy regions), with other establishments set to join the list shortly. The programme, which will last 217 hours (31 days), will be made up of 8 modules. ""The implementation of this certification is a real step forward for the industry, and the hype around it is a good thing, showing that there are real skill gaps in terms of hairdressing and styling textured hair. On the other hand, it’s going to take years to develop, and it only concerns people who are still at school,"" stresses Kelly Massol. ""The truth today is that there are fewer than two hundred hairdressing salons in France that know how to handle this type of hair. It’s an issue that Les Secret de Loly has been drawing attention to for quite some time now, particularly with the increasing cross-breeding in our country. We don’t realise how many white mothers take their frizzy-haired daughters to their usual hairdresser for the first time and find themselves facing a wall. There are thousands of them,"" she explains. That’s why the founder of Secrets de Loly has decided to open her hair academy specialising in textured hair in the first quarter of 2024, in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. The centre will be dedicated solely to training existing hair professionals. At the same time, in 2019, L’Oréal organised, alongside industry professionals, a reflection on the way to upgrade the hairdressing sector, which led the French group to create Real Campus. ""It is part hairdressing school, part entrepreneurial school, and awards a bachelor’s degree. It’s the highest qualification you can get in hairdressing. At Real Campus, curly, frizzy and kinky hair bootcamps are organised, teaching participants the different techniques involved in hair care rituals, massages, styling and haircuts,"" concludes Margarida Condado, International Development Deputy Managing Director of L’Oréal’s Consumer Products Division."
Are noticeable cosmetic surgery procedures going out of fashion?,"Cardi B had her butt injections removed. Courteney Cox, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cameron Diaz and many others have either scaled back on facial injections or stopped getting them in order to move away from the ultra-smooth, mask-like effect... Even the Kardashian clan is said to be taking a step back with reports suggesting that Kim and Khloe have removed their butt implants (although neither has publicly admitted to having the operation), and Kylie Jenner deflating her lip volume. Lip fillers, Brazilian butt lifts (BBL for short), breast implants... these types of noticeable cosmetic operations are fading from the spotlight. The aesthetic trending on social media no longer is one of ultra-plumped lips, dramatic cheekbones, XXL buttocks and breasts. The famous hourglass shapes that have been a staple on social networks for years are gradually being replaced by more natural looks. The result, on TikTok, is a host of young women going to their surgeons to ask for reversals. It’s largely a matter of removing implants and fillers to get back one’s former appearance. Fran, a 24-year-old flight attendant who spoke to Refinery29, had spent over £5,000 (or over US$6,000) in 2018 to get ""Instagram Face,"" but found that influencers were going back to more natural looks. ""’I’ve had Botox, dermal filler, weight loss injections, microblading, microneedling, and facial contouring,"" she explains. But when she realized that this aesthetic was going out of fashion among her friends and influencers she follows, she regretted her operations. ""I felt like a bit of a clown when people started going natural, wearing tinted concealer and doing the soap brows, while mine were tattooed on. I was still giving Bratz Doll."" In 2023, the silhouette that is trending is the slim figure of the early 2000s. As a result, many of those individuals who have gone under the knife want to have their implants or fillers removed. On TikTok, hashtags linked to lip reductions total millions of views: #lipdissolving has almost 87 million, #lipfillerdissolved over 44 million. The #breastreduction hashtag totals 1.5 billion views. In the United States, plastic surgeons are seeing an increase in requests for breast reduction with such procedures increasing in frequency by 54% between 2019 and 2022, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Meanwhile some very specific operations have nearly disappeared. The ""fox eye"" style for example. This operation, also known as ""cat eyes,"" involves raising the eyebrows and eyelids to obtain almond-shaped eyes. ""Fox eye thread lift procedures were a trend that was very popular last year, but now fortunately seems to be going out of fashion,"" Dr. Elizabeth Hawkes told Refinery29. According to her, the hype was probably due to filters and apps that alter the shape and size of the eyes. ""But it’s a very unnatural look based on a social media trend and generally looks awful."" But can we really call this trend a return to a truly natural look? After all, the current trend towards cosmetic reversals does not mean the end of interventions. And of course, there always seems to be a multitude of new beauty trends flourishing on social networks. But the trend now is to take away more than add. Particularly when it comes to facial procedures. Just look at the craze surrounding ""chin lipo"" or ""buccal fat removal,"" which involves removing or reducing mouth fat."
Southeast Asia and India slated to be next luxury beauty growth drivers,"Global consultancy Kearney and Luxasia, one of the largest distributors of luxury beauty in Asia Pacific, recently released a whitepaper titled ""Unlocking hyper-growth in Asia’s luxury beauty landscape"". According to the report, Southeast Asia and India are poised to witness the next ""gold rush"" in luxury beauty, reaching a market potential of USD 7.6 billion by 2026, almost tripling in size within 10 years, with a projected 11% CAGR between 2021 and 2031 [1] (figure 1). The research also reveals that Southeast Asia and India are nearing an inflection point and are poised to enjoy a decade of double-digit growth in luxury beauty (figure 2). In contrast to China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea, other markets in Southeast Asia and India are relatively unsaturated, with limited presence of both international luxury beauty brands and compelling local ones. As these economies mature, the upper- and middle-classes are projected to surpass 1 billion people in 2026 [2], with more consumers expected to trade up from mass to luxury. These market conditions trigger the proliferation of local beauty brands, which tend to play in the masstige category, leaving the luxury beauty segment as an opportunity for international brands. “This presents a limited but golden window of opportunity for luxury beauty brands to enter now and flourish,” said Luxasia in a statement. However, harnessing growth remains tricky, due to diverse market ecosystems in Southeast Asia and India. Luxury brands today face six major challenges in this fragmented region, which include: multidimensional omni-retail networks; heterogeneous local product preferences; divergent marketing approaches; challenging regulatory frameworks; costly and idiosyncratic supply chain landscapes; and partner selection amid information asymmetry. Thus, there is no longer a Southeast Asian consumer or an Indian consumer, highlight the authors of the report. ""Each consumer is now ’glocal’ and is likely aware of a brand’s messaging in the US, Europe, and North Asia markets but also deeply rooted in local preferences. It’s crucial to represent brands globally in an integrated manner and react locally to global trends."" Correspondingly, the report outlines six execution imperatives to effectively tackle these challenges. These include optimizing the retail footprint to create multi-touchpoint experience hubs; harnessing continued e-commerce growth unique to each market; forging capabilities to ride social commerce acceleration; building deep local consumer understanding through data aggregation and analytics; leveraging logistics partners to build a robust and flexible network; and winning with the right omnichannel brand-building partners. Since the beginning of the year, many international luxury players have announced their entry into India, or into Southeast Asian markets, with Shiseido and Nars being the latest examples. The impressive growth of the Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN trade show, launched just one year ago, also illustrates the dynamism of the region."

Skincare: Performance remains the #1 priority for consumers in the USA,"Premium Beauty News - What does “Transformative Beauty” mean? Leïla Rochet - This is a time of huge transition in the US - socially, politically, economically, environmentally - and these macro shifts are having a significant impact on how people relate to Beauty. Change is in the air, and it is being fast-tracked by new technologies that are quite literally transforming the Beauty landscape in front of our eyes. Transformative Beauty highlights the need for brands to look at innovation through the lens of progression and transformation as people strive to meet radical wellness ambitions, achieve self-determined levels of perfection and adapt their regimes to their transient lifestyles. Transformative Beauty is both an aesthetic and emotional aspiration. Premium Beauty News - What are the main lessons from the report? Leïla Rochet - Performance continues to be the #1 priority for consumers - derma-brands are dominating Google searches and the SkinTok conversation. When you match these expectations with new ambitions of longevity (linked to anti-aging) and the emergence of new technologies then you have the prospect of Amplified Skin. This is a universe of biohacking, AI-optimization and ultra-precise solutions. There are some really interesting new narratives opening up in this space. At the other end of the spectrum we have a universe that is much more grounded in lifestyle:  Flex Care encompasses the impact of increased travel, soaring temperatures, increased time spent outdoors, remote working… These are becoming really powerful influences on skincare, driving brands to prioritize climate adaptable formulas, cooling sensations, and portable formats. And it is impossible to ignore the influence of Hailey Bieber on Gen Z skincare trends - in Just Dew It we get into  the roots of the latest desire for an ultra-hydrated complexion which can be traced back to her viral social media posts. But this is also about the fetishization of wellness. What does this look and feel like in skincare? What are the new techniques and textures that elevate the daily moisturizing ritual? Premium Beauty News - What effect is the normalization of aesthetic procedures having on the skincare category? Leïla Rochet - Gen Z has really taken the taboo out of procedures, thanks to TikTok.  The platform has become the go-to space for people to share their transformation journey, and the culture of creativity has helped spawn a whole new vocabulary for tweakments which are now commonly used in clinical settings. Skincare brands should be inspired by Gen Z’s open and candid approach. In terms of innovation, there is now a huge opportunity to develop new categories for products that replace, replicate or prolong the effects of treatments. For example, we are tracking a big surge in at-home acid peels. And the market for aftercare is set to grow exponentially as more and  more people opt for cosmetic procedures. Premium Beauty News - How is the rise of AI aiding transformation? What are the implications for brands? Leïla Rochet - We can not escape the influence of AI. It is having - and will continue to have - a seismic impact on the industry as a whole. In skincare, this is quickly shifting from AI-powered skin-health quizzes to mega-personalized biohacking tools- such as Skin Dossier’s Precision Skin Health Advisor which aggregates a cross section of data (blood and urine samples, geolocation) to develop the most accurate product, supplement and medspa treatments. AI is also powering the incredibly nuanced analysis of ingredients, which will allow labs to optimize formulations for absolute potency and personalization. As consumers become more comfortable and familiar with AI, their expectations of its capabilities, applications and end-benefits will increase. Brands will have to keep pace, but we see huge potential for AI to support a truly intersectional beauty space. Transformative Beauty: Skincare & Wellness Inspiration from the US was released Early October 2023. Also available at the agency, Transformative Beauty: Makeup report released summer 2023.

Mintel: Three trends set to transform beauty in 2024,"According to Mintel’s new report [1], beauty consumers place more significance on value, driving the importance of quality and proven ingredients; consumers also prioritise wellness and accelerate the power of the mind-body connection; in parallel AI transforms the industry through efficiency, innovation and inclusivity. Consumers are prioritising wellness to feel better in body and mind, said Mintel. And the next chapter of the market will be “mind-body beauty”, where mental well-being and physical appearance are interconnected. Practices like psychodermatology (exploring the relationship between psychological well-being and skin health) and neurocosmetics (which focuses on the mind-skin connection), for instance, will gain traction with consumers around the world. “The mind-body connection is critical in elevating beauty’s role in overall wellbeing,” said Sarah Jindal, Senior Director, Beauty, Personal Care and Household Research, Americas. “Brands will look to offer a comprehensive approach to beauty, improving external appearances and enhancing mental and emotional well-being through technology integration, partnerships, inclusivity and personalisation. Advanced data analytics, DNA testing and personalised algorithms will enable brands to innovate customised beauty products and regimens tailored to individual mental and physical needs.” According to Mintel, artificial intelligence will permeate the beauty industry in the form of personalised recommendations, virtual try-on experiences and data-driven insights. AI will transform the beauty industry by making it more personalised, efficient and effective, but transparency and good governance will be critical to growth. “By analysing data, learning patterns and generating insights, AI is addressing ethical concerns and speeding up new product development. Brands should leverage information, like customer feedback on social media, to identify gaps and create innovative products tailored to specific needs. Going forward, expect to see AI enabling highly tailored beauty experiences based on individual preferences, genetics, environments and lifestyles as well as assisting with precise skin analysis, personalised product recommendations and real-time wellness monitoring,” added Jindal. The beauty industry will experience a paradigm shift as consumers prioritise efficacy and functionality over extravagant packaging and flashy marketing campaigns. “Today’s consumers are looking for transparency; they are more inclined to seek justification for premium pricing based on tangible results rather than superficial factors. Research, clinical studies or certifications to substantiate their claims of effectiveness will gain credibility and trust. We are seeing a new wave of ‘new-age minimalism’ and ‘coded luxury’ as consumer focus shifts away from amassing an extensive collection of products to curating a carefully selected range of high-quality essentials. Expect to see companies invest in advanced formulations, cutting-edge ingredients and technologies for targeted solutions,” concluded Jindal."
"Show report: Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN 2023, the rise of a major regional event","“The exhibition attracted +78% attendance compared to last year, mainly coming from Thailand and ASEAN countries. In two-year time Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN has become a reference destination for stakeholders from all over the world,” said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere Group. Indeed, the show that was launched last year with some 500+ exhibitors has already doubled in size compared with its first edition. Cosmoprof CBE Asean 2023 took place from 14th to 16th September 2023 at Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre, with around 1,000 exhibitors and 13,255 visitors from 69 countries. Just like for Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna or Cosmoprof Asia, exhibitors at the fair came from different sectors of the beauty industry, including suppliers (contract manufacturers, packaging and ingredients suppliers), and brands and finished products marketers. However, unlike Bologna and Hong Kong, supply chain exhibitors were the majority at the fair, with only around 1/3 of the exhibition space dedicated to retail beauty. China was the country with the largest number of exhibitors at the show with a presence almost exclusively in the supply chain part of the fair. Thailand was next, with a majority of exhibitors from the supply chain area although some of the country’s biggest domestic retail beauty brands, such as Mistine or Karmart, had prominent booths near the main entrance. Korea followed with exhibitors primarily from the finished beauty sector. Japan had a significant exhibition presence as well, while Italy was the only European country with a collective pavilion. According to the National News Bureau of Thailand, the ASEAN region [1] recorded an average economic growth of 5% from 2000-2022. With a combined population of around 672 million in 2022, ASEAN accounts for around 9% of the world’s total population and contributed 6.4% to global GDP. With beauty and personal care sales expected to reach USD 29.97 billion in 2023, the ASEAN is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 3.56% from 2023 to 2027 (source: Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN). However, as far as demographic, economic, political and social development is concerned, there are major differences amongst the ASEAN countries making it a highly complex region. Almost all ASEAN countries have their own B2B beauty trade shows, some of which have been taking place for many years, such as: Beauty Expo Malaysia, the Cosmobeauté shows in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam; Beauty Connect Expo in Cambodia and Myanmar, Vietbeauty or Philbeauty. However, these are usually small and very domestic events, with only a handful of non-Asian exhibitors or visitors. Up until recently, there was no major pan-ASEAN beauty trade show. Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN is set to fill that space! Mistine is probably the most famous Thai beauty brand and its exhibition booth at Cosmopof CBE ASEAN was constantly surrounded by visitors throughout the three days of the show. The company showcased at least a dozen new makeup launches, including new cushion foundations, both for its international markets and the domestic sector (the brand has product ranges with specific textures and packaging for its global markets that are different from the Mistine ranges developed for the Thai market), a range of lip-creams flavoured with Thai tea aroma, new pressed powders and blushes as well as lipsticks and glosses. Browit by Nongchat was launched in 2017 by Karmart in collaboration with makeup artist Chatchai Peangapichart (Nongchat). Although Nongchat has since extended his brand into other makeup categories and skin care, its focus remains the brow and lash category. At the trade show, Browit by Nongchat presented half a dozen new eyeliners, mascaras and brow pencils. During the pandemic, the eye and brow product category grew strongly in Thailand and the segment is set to continue on its upwards trajectory – even in September 2023, many Thai still wear protective face masks. The company also presented two other new beauty ranges which were both launched in collaboration with famous Thai influencers. The 3-sku Intimi range – spearheaded by influencer @nn.ladarpha, includes a brightening toner for underarms, elbows and other body areas, a women’s intimate wash and a men’s intimate wash. Lip colour range Lip It was developed together with mega influencer @nisamanee_nutt. The new line offers a clear SPF15 lip balm, two waxy lip mask sticks and two creamy tinted twist-up lip creams. Cathydoll is another hugely successful Karmart-owned brand, offering makeup, face and body care and, most recently, perfumed body lotions and sprays. The personal fragrance and aromatherapy categories in Thailand are growing in line with the domestic home fragrances sector – anything that helps with relieving stress is popular with local consumers. In the face cosmetics category, one of the newest Cathydoll launches was an SPF 50 mist specifically created for touch-ups during the day. Ultra Light Sun Mist is scented with a fresh, light herbal-citrus fragrance and can be sprayed over makeup. Considering how many cannabis shops and cafés have opened up in Thai cities over the past twelve months – the government abolished its hitherto very strict anti-cannabis legislation in summer 2022, supporting the domestic hemp industry in a bid to bolster the pandemic-affected Thai economy – the lack of CBD beauty exhibitors was striking. There was only one CBD exhibitor with a significant retail range at the show. Dr. CBD launched its Earthlab beauty and supplements brand in 2022. It’s latest launch is a sleep-boosting supplement. With 19 million Thai suffering from insomnia in 2019 (a number which is likely to have gone up significantly since then), sleep tech/care is booming in Thailand just as strongly as in other Asian (and European) markets. Earthlab’s Dé Leep contains CBD as well as GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), vitamin B complex, l-theanine and turmeric to help improve sleep quality and duration. The Earthlab products are widely retailed in Thailand both online and offline, including trend perfumeries like Eve & Boy and Sephora. Spa beauty is a major category in the Thai beauty market and a few smal domestic spa brands were present at the show. Giffarine’s Pattrena range, for example, was extended with six face care products based on Jasmine rice as a key ingredient. The line-up includes a cleansing milk and cleansing foam, cream scrub, moisturising cream, face serum and cream gel. Karmart’s Reunrom home fragrance brand offers a wide range of room fragrances inspired by iconic places in Thailand, such as various well-known Bangkok neighbourhoods. Amongst the newest Reunrom launches is the Song Wat range of scented aroma oil and room diffuser - Song Wat is an historic road in Bangkok’s Samphanthawong neighbourhood. And Saraburi, another new launch of aromatic oil and room diffuser, is inspired by the eponymous city in central Thailand. The Reunrom brand has grown considerably over the last few years, and its product ranges are available both in perfumeries and drugstores as well as branded stores and shop counters in luxury malls and department stores. And in August 2023, Mistine launched scented candle and home spa range Amorn Apothecary to commemorate the brand’s founder Amornthep Derojanawong. The new line offers three scented candles, a body scrub and a body oil formulated with three types of Thai rice (white jasmine rice, red jasmine rice and black glutinous rice). Launched in 2020 during the pandemic, Taiwanese brand Oooh offers hand sanitisers and liquid hand lotions that come in stylish refillable packaging. The brand recently launched a range of sophisticated unisex EDTs. The formulations contain antibacterial persimmon-derived tannin extract which helps to destroy the odour bacteria in sweat, so the fragrance can be applied on sweaty or humid skin and still stay true to its scent notes. A few clean and/or natural beauty launches were also visible at the show, although primarily from Korean exhibitors. Ecobe, for example, was launched in March 2023 specifically for distribution outside Korea. The brand offers clean and vegan face care products packaged in simple, stylish glass bottles. And clean beauty brand Lalaits launched in 2020 with a natural-positioned range of face and body care formulated with marine ingredients such as algae and lava sea water sourced from Korea’s famous Jeju island. Thai indie brand Varenn was launched in 2021 and has already achieved a solid online and offline distribution. At the show, Varenn presented two new oil-based products which will be launched in the next couple of months: the aromatherapeutical Intensive Night Revival Body Treatment Oil is a moisturising plant oil blend scented with a relaxing, sleep-promoting fragrance. And Day to Night Lip Serum Oil is a rich oil-based lip balm cream which can be used as an over-night lip treatment or to soothe dry and cracked lips during the day. Functional anti-ageing face care was primarily the purview of the Korean beauty brands, like Trimay. For instance, the Korean brand was launched in 2018 and offers around 120 face and body care SKUs. Spicules Tox, one of the brand latest anti-ageing launch, features active ingredients manufactured as tiny spikes (or spicules) that create a micro-needling effect when the cream is massaged into the skin. Next year’s Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN is set to take place from 13th to 15th June 2024 at Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre in Bangkok. “The new dates will better reflect the season trends and habits influencing business activities in the region,” said the organizers."
"U.S. makeup market to proceed with resilience despite headwinds, finds Mintel","After rebounding with 9% growth in retail sales in 2022, the color cosmetics market continues to exhibit strong growth; however, inflation accounts for much of this. By the end of 2023, total retail sales of the US color cosmetics market are estimated to increase by 10% and exceed USD 13.6 million. With many consumers returning to pre-pandemic, in-person activities, demand for innovation—especially in the facial and lip cosmetic segments—is expected to boost total market sales this year. However, according to Mintel, the market is expected to level off over the next five years, growing 9% to reach USD14.9 million by 2028. [1] ""In today’s cost-conscious environment, value is the name of the game. Persistently low consumer confidence continues to drive cost-conscious shopping behaviors, including the popularity of dupes, with social media playing a big role. This is especially true among younger consumer groups, which are more likely to be influenced by and take inspiration from social media,” said Joan Li, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. According to Mintel, three-quarters (74%) of makeup users agree that affordable makeup products work just as well as premium ones, suggesting a makeup culture favorable toward ’dupes.’ Indeed, a third of makeup consumers ages 18-24 (33%) and 25-34 (35%) say they have purchased a makeup ’dupe’ because of something they saw on social media. However, the ’lipstick effect’—in which color cosmetics are viewed as an affordable luxury during times of financial uncertainty — protected the category from high inflation’s threat to discretionary spending, so far. Nevertheless, looking ahead, the color cosmetics market is expected to level off. “Our research forecasts that growth will slow due to headwinds from continued trade-down behaviors, the mainstay of work-from-home and hybrid lifestyles, and competing growth in beauty-adjacent categories like ingestibles and skincare,"" highlighted Li. Makeup consumption is all the more likely to slow down as interest in this category seems to be waning. Mintel data reveals that 35% of makeup users are applying less makeup than a year ago compared to 25% who are using more makeup, indicating an overall decline in engagement in the category. The most popular reason for decreased usage is fewer out-of-home occasions (37%), followed by loss of interest (32%). Breaking down these reasons by age, however, it becomes clear that reasons for wearing makeup less frequently are overwhelmingly driven by older individuals, particularly women 55+. Interestingly, men represent the primary growth behind those who are applying makeup more often, as 43% of men ages 18-44 say they are using makeup more often than a year ago. ""Our research shows that men’s appearance concerns are focused on complexion and blemishes, which leads them to prefer facial cosmetics over other segments,” said Li. As far as younger consumers are concerned, Mintel found that two in five (42%) women ages 18-34 who use makeup products say they wear makeup less often than last year due to skin health concerns. The following top reason for wearing makeup less often is having less time (39%). However, 67% of makeup users ages 18-34 say they are paying more attention to ingredients used in makeup products than a year ago. ""Given that there were fewer out-of-home occasions to inspire color cosmetics use, 18-34-year-old Americans may continue the habit of using makeup on an every-other-day or weekly basis, demonstrating a ’flexitarian’ approach that is perceived to be more convenient and healthier for the skin. As the health and wellness industry expands to include emotional well-being and skin health, consumers will increasingly challenge beauty brands to clearly communicate the roles brands play within the evolving industry,"" concluded Li."
A third of the population rates their well-being as the lowest ever,"Almost a billion people worldwide were affected by a mental disorder in 2019, just before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to data published by the World Health Organization (WHO). Social and economic inequalities, as well as war and the climate crisis are among the factors contributing to a degraded well-being of the world’s population, in addition to the health crisis. In 2022, the WHO estimated that depression and anxiety had risen by more than 25% in the first year of the pandemic. But it would seem that the malaise runs much deeper, as people’s morale has not improved with the ""return to normal,"" as a new global study reveals. Carried out by Edelman Data & Intelligence for sportwear brand lululemon, this third edition of the Global Well-being Report surveyed respondents in 14 countries, including the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, Japan, Singapore, China and New Zealand, with 1,000 people per market, for a total of 14,000 participants [1]. The findings underline the importance of taking into account people’s mental health, and taking actions to bring about change. Something called for by the WHO just a year ago. The authors of the report selected three criteria — physical well-being, mental well-being and social well-being — to reflect the balance that enables people to feel good. The survey results show that well-being is now considered a priority for over two-thirds of the world’s population (67%), including 80% of Spaniards and 72% of Singaporeans and Thais, and, by contrast, just 44% of Japanese and 62% of South Koreans. In France, 68% of the population consider well-being to be a priority, but 40% consider it impossible to achieve. This figure rises to 44% worldwide, and even 48% in Thailand, Singapore and South Korea. Another fact to bear in mind: only 12% of those surveyed worldwide believe that their well-being is where it should be. On the global scale, more than one in three people say their well-being is the lowest it’s ever been (34%). This sentiment is pronounced in Thailand (48%), Singapore (40%), and South Korea (39%), but much less so in Japan (20%), mainland China (28%) and France (29%). The current state of the world, all issues considered and the foreseeable future are sources of worry, as 41% of the world’s population say they are discouraged when they think about it. Nevertheless, some populations are optimistic about the future: this is the case in China, where 67% are optimistic, compared with a global average of just 42%. Looking at what’s standing in the way of respondents enjoying a higher level of well-being, be it mental, physical or social, climate change is cited as a key concern. More than four out of ten people surveyed worldwide (41%) stated that it heightens their feelings of anxiety, compared with 59% of respondents in Thailand, 58% in South Korea and 44% in Hong Kong. Environmental issues are less of a source of anxiety for Germans (34%), Australians (34%), Canadians (35%) and New Zealanders (36%). Global media coverage also plays a role in how anxious individuals feel. One in two of those surveyed say that certain topics in the news have an impact on their personal well-being, inflation being one of them. More than half the world’s population (56%) say they are worried about how they will meet their needs in the face of ever-rising living costs, and 54% are alarmed about how their finances will be managed in the current year. It’s worth noting that the Spaniards and the French are the ones who feel most affected by certain issues raised by the media, at 57%, while respondents in China (44%), Japan (46%), Canada (48%) and Singapore (48%) appear less so. Societal expectations of all kinds also influence levels of well-being around the world. Internationally, nearly four out of ten respondents (39%) consider that the pressure to conform to societal norms has a negative impact on their mental well-being. In Thailand, more than half the population suffers from this pressure. And it’s a vicious circle, since such norms also play a role in whether individuals feel that they can speak freely about mental health. Worldwide, more than four out of ten people (42%) say they feel obliged to feign happiness even when they’re down. More than one in two respondents (55%) feel that ""society is judgmental towards those who have lower mental well-being."" Lack of time, lack of financial resources and the taboos surrounding mental health are all obstacles that get in the way of people taking care of their well-being or seeking out help. Respondents also signaled a lack of infrastructure, support or services dedicated to mental health. Nearly three quarters of those surveyed (74%) consider that institutions do not do enough to facilitate the well-being of society, and seven out of ten employees even feel that their employer has a responsibility to improve well-being. And the level of well-being has consequences, both professionally and personally. On average, individuals miss five days of work a year due to low well-being, compared to nine days in Germany and three in Japan. Internationally, employees also say they are less committed (48%) and less likely to accept responsibility (37%) when their well-being is low. And this would even have an impact on their role as a parent, since more than four out of ten respondents (44%) feel they are ""not the parent their children need them to be"" when their well-being is low worldwide. But individuals are seeking out solutions for feeling better. These include physical activity, setting limits in one’s professional and personal life, focusing on positive things, taking time for oneself, and simply expressing one’s needs freely to those closest to them."
Make-up trends: Brown lipstick is on its way back,"Down, but not out! After being shunned during the Covid-19 pandemic, lipstick has managed to make its way back into people’s makeup kits, even daring to get a little bit wild during the summer season. But now the focus is on fall and its warm, rich colours, with the return of a trend straight out of the 1990s: brown lipstick. The shade is winning over the younger generation on social networks, as well as at New York Fashion Week. For several weeks, and especially as fall approaches, brown lipstick has been spreading at speed on social networks, to the point where the hashtags #brownlipliner, #brownlips and #brownlipstick have reached over 156 millions, 90 million and nearly 85 million views respectively on TikTok. The result is a host of tutorials celebrating this key trend of the 1990s, reminiscent of Rachel Green’s iconic beauty looks in the hit show ""Friends."" By turns matte, glossy, dark, light, sophisticated or natural, warm or icy, brown lipstick can be worn in almost any way. Users all seem to agree on two points: the need to use a pencil to define the lip line and enhance the colour, and the need to keep face and eyes simple to avoid a makeup overload. But social media users aren’t the only ones to have embraced this trend. The celebrities present at New York Fashion Week also seem to have jumped on the brown lipstick look. Avril Lavigne, Julia Fox, Paloma Elsesser, Emily Ratajkowski and Elsa Hosk all flaunted the color on the fringes of the spring-summer 2024 shows held in the Big Apple, while many designers swapped red and pink for brown hues on the catwalks. This was the case at Sergio Hudson and PriscaVera, among others. In recent months, all signs have been pointing to the return of brown lipstick. It started back in 2022 with ""brownie glazed lips,"" which brought controversy for Hailey Bieber, the star who helped popularize the look. More recently, the ""Cherry Cola lips"" trend celebrates a brown shade reminiscent of the famous soda, albeit with a cherry red tint. Then there’s ""espresso makeup,"" which gives pride of place to warm, deep brown shades. Although the comeback is still in its infancy, brown lipstick could shape up to become one of the major inspirations of fall 2023."
Exports of French cosmetic products remain on double-digit trend,"Driven by demand from the main European markets and the United States, French exports of cosmetic products continue their impressive growth. According to the Federation for Beauty Companies (FEBEA), the country exported a value of 8.6 billion euros of products over the first five months of 2023, an increase of 15.6% compared to 7.4 billion euros over the same period last year. Hence, French cosmetic products continue to win over consumers around the world! After an increase of 18.8% in 2022, this mid-year report for 2023 confirms the dynamism of the two most successful categories of French beauty, “Perfumes” and “Make-up and face skin care”, which respectively grew by 16.7% and 16%. Alone, these two categories account for nearly 86% of French exports. But “all categories of cosmetic products recorded good results,” said the FEBEA. Although international demand remains strong, China has ceased to play the leading role and the European Union and the United States have taken over. With 3.4 billion euros exported between January and May 2023 (+26.1% compared to 2022), the European Union remains the leading export market for French cosmetics; the region accounts for more than a third of total exports. Germany, the largest European beauty market, is also the main importer of French cosmetics. Export to this country grew by 22.2% in the first five months of 2023. Exports to Spain grew by 22.6%, confirming the country’s position as the second largest market in Europe for the sector. Italy, with an increase of 21.3%, consolidates its third position. As far as the US market is concerned, French exports grew by 15.4% during the period. The United States remain the first buyer of French cosmetic products. To date, one in five perfume products is exported to the USA. On the contrary, exports to China, which increased by 1.1% over the first five months of the year (compared to the same period in 2022), are a bit disappointing for the French industry, despite an increase of 5.9% of the “Makeup and face skin care” category. The Chinese economy is struggling to restart and this is impacting the entire Asia region where exports only grew by 6.7%. For its part, the Middle East has not picked up the slack and recorded a slight decline in performance at the start of the year, with a drop in exports of 0.4%. According to FEBEA, this figure is mainly explained by the sharp decrease in sales to Saudi Arabia (-25.4%), while the United Arab Emirates continued to show strong growth (+14.5%). “These disparities do not prevent the French cosmetics industry from continuing, overall, its remarkable export growth,” commented Emmanuel Guichard, general delegate of FEBEA. “The sector contributes significantly to the improvement of the French trade balance, despite current economic and geopolitical uncertainties. These performances reflect the sector’s capacity for innovation, and in particular that of SMEs and VSEs which represent more than 80% of companies in the sector. Their dynamism and creativity contribute to increase, year after year, the attractiveness of French cosmetics around the world.” In total, more than 60% of the total production of the French cosmetics industry is exported."
"Social media increasingly influence purchasing decisions, says Klarna","Advertisements, TV shows, magazines... where do you look for inspiration when it comes to new trends, or even future purchases? While these sources of influence have been around for decades, we now have to add social media to the mix, as a space where brands, retailers and other influencers share their picks and new products, particularly in the sectors of fashion, beauty and gastronomy. And it would seem that these digital channels are particularly effective in winning over potential buyers, to the point of transforming their consumption habits and purchasing behavior. At least, that’s what Klarna’s latest Shopping Pulse report, carried out in collaboration with Nepa in 18 countries worldwide, including France, the USA, Norway and the UK, suggests [1]. Nearly six out of 10 American consumers (58%) say they have already purchased a product after seeing it on social networks (in the month preceding the survey). This figure rises to 70% among American Generation Z consumers and 96% among millennials. In just a few years, social platforms have become powerful influencers for the younger generations — at least those of purchasing age. “The shopping discovery path is shaped in different patterns across countries and generations but one common unifying factor is the tendency to rely on digital channels to an increasing extent,” the study reads. However, when it comes to social media influence, retailers have a higher impact than influencers in most countries. The Netherlands, Belgium and Poland being the only exceptions. Influencers have a bigger impact than retailers on Gen Z, and the opposite is true for older generations. Facebook comes out on top, with 62%, as the preferred social platform for shopping in the US. The social network created by Mark Zuckerberg is a bit ahead of YouTube (55%), Instagram (42%), TikTok (40%), Snapchat (29%) and Pinterest (23%). This ranking is based on the responses of all the American respondents, across all generations, but changes somewhat according to each generation. Those in Generation Z, for example, turn to Instagram to make purchases (49%), followed closely by TikTok (48%), YouTube (40%), Facebook (43%), Snapchat (35%) and Pinterest (15%). While American consumers are particularly keen to use social networks to find inspiration, and even to purchase products online, the 58% of those who have already done so is followed by Australians with 54%, 44% of Britons, 43% of Greeks, 42% of Spaniards, and 41% of Portuguese and New Zealanders. The phenomenon is therefore not confined to North America, even if some nations are (for the time being) more reluctant to transform a purchase thanks to social platforms. This is particularly true of the Czech Republic (28%) and Finland (29%)."
"Canadian beauty industry sales rise 19% in the first half, Circana reports","All beauty categories registered double digit growth in value and makeup was the fastest-growing category, with sales revenue up 25% in the first half, contributing over 40% of total beauty industry gains during this period. Face makeup sales grew by 33%, led by blush, bronzing and highlighting products, and setting sprays. “In Canada there is a heightened focus on complexion and healthy skin,” said Circana. This trend aligns with skincare being the largest category in Canada and growing – with sales revenue up 16% in the first half – and the ongoing ‘skinification’ trend, as makeup products with skincare benefits continue to sell well. The ‘skinification’ trend is also playing out when looking at the evolution of lip makeup sales. Lip was the fastest growing segment in makeup, with sales up 42% in the first half, according to Circana. While lip color performed well, the strongest growth came from other lip makeup, predominantly hybrid products such as lip oils and balms. Collectively, these products, which are primarily intended to hydrate and moisturize with a tint of color, represent only one-quarter of lip makeup sales but contributed over 40% of the sales revenue gains in the first half. The hair product market in Canada is also growing at a healthy clip. Hair category sales revenue posted a 17% increase in the first half of 2023. Hair styling products grew the fastest, followed by hair care including shampoos, conditioners, and masks, as consumers prep to go out while also continuing their at-home treatments and rituals. “Amidst pricing pressures and financial uncertainty, Canadian consumers remain focused on health, wellness, and an overall investment in themselves, and they continue to see beauty products as an important component of these priorities,” said Alecsandra Hancas, Canadian beauty industry analyst at Circana. “Every beauty category is growing in terms of both revenue and units sold in 2023. The highest pricing increase came from fragrance, which is also telling of the consumer mindset and the high value they place on emotionally driven purchases.” Looking at channel performance, consumers returned to in-store purchasing and continue to spend more, on average, especially when shopping for makeup and fragrances. In-store sales outpaced the online channel, with sales up 20% in the first half, versus last year, and accounted for 75% of sales. Online sales, which remain elevated but have stabilized since pre-pandemic 2019 levels, grew across every category in the first half. Similar purchase patterns are happening online and in-store, with the strongest growth coming from the makeup segment, led by lip and face makeup. A similar market momentum was recorded in Canada’s southern neighbor. According to Circana, U.S. prestige beauty sales grew by 15% in the first half of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, with makeup ending the first half of 2023 as the fastest growing category."
"National beauty brands are quickly gaining ground in China, finds Dynvibe","“When it comes to beauty, Chinese consumers are increasingly turning to local brands. The growing nationalism of society and the pride vis-à-vis made in China goods only partly explain this phenomenon, which is also fuelled by the increase in the quality delivered by local brands”, explains Anne-Cécile Guillemot , co-founder and Consumer Insight Director of the social intelligence agency Dynvibe at Premium Beauty News. In statistics, international brands continue to dominate the Chinese cosmetics market, especially in the premium and luxury segments. Today, four of the top five cosmetics brands sold in China still come from overseas, but international dominance is less clear in the top 10, which has recently entered several local players. However, most Chinese brands remain focused on the mid-range and low-end segments. To bridge the technological gap that still separates them from the best international standards, Chinese brands are investing massively in R&D and do not hesitate to buy foreign laboratories, such as Yatsen, with Galénic and Eve Lom, or S’ Young International, with Pier Augé and EviDenS de Beauté. With some success, according to a recent note from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), which assures that the innovation cycle of Chinese cosmetics brands generally takes three to six months, while the R&D time of international brands is more than twice as long! And that’s not all, according to Anne-Cécile Guillemot. “Chinese brands are offering higher quality formulas in increasingly attractive packaging. But they also have a better understanding of consumer expectations. In the mass market, they now offer quality equivalent to their international competitors with better price positioning,” she underlines. For the co-founder of Dynvibe, not only do local brands perfectly understand Chinese culture and codes, but they are carefully monitoring trends emerging on social networks. Their agility allows them to respond very quickly to specific expectations and emerging market trends such as high performance skincare, well-being and scientific claims. “We can cite the case of brands like Out of Office or Into You and its now famous Lip Mud,” she says. Very attentive to their audience, Chinese brands are also very reactive when it comes to responding to international trends such as the blurring of boundaries between the well-being and beauty categories. “Well-being and mindfulness are a major global trend that is also visible in China, where consumers seek to relieve the stress of their hectic daily lives through skin and body care rituals,” explains Anne-Cécile Guillemot. “Consumers therefore appreciate brands that are able to establish with them a real emotional connection on these subjects.” For instance, in order to go beyond skincare, Proya has launched campaigns aimed at raising public awareness and encouraging discussion on social issues, in particular the mental health of young people. Users are highly interested in the videos the brand uploads on these topics because they express their frustrations and address issues they don’t dare address in public. The brand also invites medical professionals to discuss youth mental health and provides free online therapy support for those who need to be heard. Young users massively comment on Proya’s publications and seize the opportunity to share their emotions in public. Enough to create strong emotional bonds!"
Make-up drives sales of mass and prestige beauty products in the U.S.,"U.S. prestige beauty industry sales amounted to USD 14 billion in the first half of 2023, a 15% increase versus the same period in 2022. In comparison, the mass beauty market generated USD 28 billion and grew 9%, according to Circana, formerly IRI and The NPD Group. “Beauty continues to be the darling of retail through the first half of 2023, maintaining its position as the only industry to grow based on units sold across the general merchandise and consumer packaged goods categories Circana tracks,” said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at Circana. “The beauty industry is hitting the right notes, meeting consumers’ emotional needs through new and existing products, which is especially welcomed at a time when spending power continues to be squeezed.” Makeup ended the first half of 2023 as the fastest growing category within the prestige market, with sales revenue up 18%, and outpaced sales at mass merchants by growing at twice the rate. Within the category, lip makeup was the fastest-growing segment, and inclusive of both prestige outlets and mass merchants. These results come during a time when makeup usage is also on the rise. According to Circana’s 2023 Makeup Consumer Report, makeup usage increased by 3 percentage points in the past year and has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Face serum, body spray, and facial cleansers were the top gainers in the prestige skincare market for the first half of the year. Fueled by new launch activity, clinical brands brought in the majority of the prestige skincare sales gains. Overall facial skincare usage in the U.S. remains flat compared to last year, according to Circana’s 2023 Facial Skincare Consumer Report. While usage remains consistent, product preferences are shifting. Consumers are increasingly turning to hybrid products that together address skin concerns and provide makeup coverage. In addition, more channel blending is taking place as 67% of consumers feel that skincare brands at drug stores or mass merchandisers are as good as higher priced department store brands, a sentiment which is up from last year. Gift sets, higher concentration fragrances, and mini sizes are outperforming the overall prestige fragrance market. Sales of fragrance gift sets grew by 26%, or twice the rate of the market. Eau de parfums and parfums were the only formats to experience a year over year increase in units sold. Minis, or fragrance sizes under one ounce (28 ml), accounted for 38% of total fragrance juices sold. Although sales revenue is significantly higher in the mass market, hair product sales continue to grow at a faster clip in the prestige business, with online capturing about half of the sales. Furthermore, hair is the category with the highest average price increase in the prestige beauty market, growing at three-times the rate of the overall industry. Styling was the fastest-growing segment in prestige hair for the first half of the year."
"The ’honey lips’ makeup trend marks the return of luscious, shimmering lips","On social networks, honey is now being embraced by beauty enthusiasts — and, more specifically, makeup fans — whose latest obsession is ’honey lips,’ a lip colour and finish inspired by the characteristics of the product, channelling shine and shimmer, with a rich, luscious effect that sets it apart. The idea here isn’t to use honey directly — despite its many benefits for the skin — but to try to reproduce the shine and luster of the sweet substance on the lips. It’s an idea that’s become a viral hit on social networks, with the #honeylips hashtag scoring no less than 3.2 million views in just a few weeks on TikTok. It’s the beauty content creator, Eva Larosa, who is behind one of the most-viewed videos on the subject. And that’s without counting those for her ’honey girl makeup’ tutorial, which shows viewers how to create a complete makeup look inspired by the sparkling amber hues of honey. So how do you get ’honey lips’? As we’ve seen, you don’t need to go digging around in your pantry to recreate this beauty trend. A lip liner, gloss and eyeshadow are more than enough to get to work. To begin with — and as for any lip look — dead skin should be exfoliated to ensure you’re working with a smooth, even surface. Next, apply gold eyeshadow at the cupid’s bow and in the center of the lower lip, line the lips with a pencil in the same shade as the lips or slightly darker, and finish with a high-shine gloss. And that’s it. ’Honey lips’ are part of a wider trend that has been seen for several weeks in the beauty world, which involves drawing inspiration from food, drinks and other sweet treats to perfect summer makeup looks. Examples include ’syrup nails’, espresso makeup, with its coffee-inspired hues, and strawberry makeup for a healthy ""sun-kissed"" glow. We should also mention the “tantouring” trend, which also marks the return of audacity in make-up!"
More and more men are taking the Botox plunge,"Male demand for aesthetic procedures has been on the rise. On TikTok, hundreds of videos show men getting Botox injections. And the phenomenon is gaining momentum on the social network, with the hashtag ’Brotox’ racking up 17 million views. Patients and practitioners alike are multiplying the number of videos showing men getting the injections. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Botox injections are the most popular minimally invasive cosmetic procedure for men. In 2020, some 265,000 men in the US underwent the procedure, an increase of 182% since 2000. In fact, men account for 6% of Botox injections in the United States. Liana Sahakyan, a nurse and co-founder of Lauréate Aesthetics in Los Angeles, is only too familiar with this rise in male demand. About 20% of her clients are men, she tells the NY Post. ""We’ve observed a steady increase in male patients seeking various cosmetic treatments over the past few years. While Botox is the frontrunner, procedures like dermal fillers and laser treatments are also gaining traction among our male clientele,"" she told the US media outlet. This demand has become all the more apparent since the Covid-19 pandemic. Plastic surgeons and dermatologists have experienced overwhelming demand for their services in the wake of the pandemic. This is due in particular to the ""Zoom boom,"" and the ubiquity of videoconferencing. And that’s not to mention social networking, which has changed the way we perceive ourselves. The advent of selfies, for example, has set new standards for beauty, and is at the root of cosmetic procedures such as rhinoplasty and bichectomy. This is particularly true of Generation Z. Shelly Woods, an advanced aesthetics practitioner and founder of Skin Techniques, sheds light on how aesthetic modifications have moved into the mainstream: ""For Gen Z, Botox has become another way to personalize the way they look — it’s now treated like a haircut or hair colour,"" she told Metro UK. ""As the trends change, young people are the ones leading those trends on platforms like TikTok and influencing the new standard."" In addition, the specialist told Metro UK that Gen Z males are ""more aware now than ever"" of their aesthetic image. This booming business is being fueled by beauty ideals and standards imposed on men, which make aging a taboo. Shelly Woods points out that men are now under ""huge pressure to stay healthy and fresh,"" and as a result seek, to convey a certain ideal ""that they see on celebrities, influencers, films and on their social media pages."" Like what women have been experiencing for a very long time. Among male celebrities, cosmetic procedures are becoming an increasingly accepted and uninhibited subject. In 2021, Joe Jonas, singer and member of the Jonas Brothers, admitted to having had Xeomin injections, an injectable treatment similar to Botox commonly used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. He had also advertised it on the Instagram page of Xeomin Aesthetics. And that’s without taking into account the influence of Greta Gerwig’s ""Barbie"" movie, and the Ken character played by Ryan Gosling, who, against all odds, has become a new beauty icon that some men aspire to. In fact, with the Kencore trend, men now want to look just like Barbie’s longtime companion."
The worrying ’anti-sunscreen’ misinformation circulating on social networks,"Sunscreens are essential products to reduce the risk of sunburn and, by extension, skin cancer. While some people inadvertently forget to make this a habit, others are now announcing that they are voluntarily renouncing it. Over on TikTok, some internet users have declared themselves to be ""anti-sunscreen”. According to them, sunscreen is packed with harmful ingredients that prevent the sun’s healing rays from reaching the skin. Although some of the content linked to the #antisunscreen hashtag has been removed or delisted, it has still managed to rack up 1.7 million views on the favourite social network of younger generations. One user promoting the risky trend is Shannon Fairweatherr, who claims to have banned sunscreen from her cupboard. She declares in a video: ""I refuse to block my skin from the healing rays of the sun."" She goes on to talk about more natural alternatives to protect her skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet rays, and in particular claims to use coconut oil, which she says ""works about 30% as well as sunscreen does, except you’re not slathering yourself in chemicals."" It’s a similar story for user shesnatural0, who also claims to be ""anti-sunscreen"" in a video: ""Surprised at the amount of people absolutely appalled that I don’t apply sunscreen when it blocks all the nourishing benefits of the life giver of our planet that regulates our bodily processes..."" A British fitness coach by the name of James Middleton has tweeted montages, in which he touts the importance of vitamin D and suggests that sunscreen blocks it. The user, who is not a medical professional, asserts that ""high levels of vitamin D make it almost impossible to develop an autoimmune disease. This would put pharmaceutical companies & the healthcare industry out of business. Think about it for a moment. They need you to believe the sun is bad."" Quite close to anti-vaccine speeches, these false assertions, which are not supported by any scientific study, seem to circulate in the same circles. Faced with this phenomenon, specialists are voicing their concern. Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose, dermatologist at New York’s Laser and Skin Surgery Center, tells the publication Nylon that short periods of sun exposure (10-15 minutes a day) can be helpful for convert vitamin D to its active form in the body and improving one’s mood, but emphasizes that overexposure has negative effects on our skin health and cosmetic appearance. To which she adds: ""All skin types should wear sunscreen, and everyone should avoid jumping on these trends."" The expert also points out that certain skin types that are more sensitive to the sun — such as people with fairer skin or skin cancer in their family medical history, need to take extra precautions. Dr Paul Banwell, cosmetic surgeon and skin cancer expert, warns of all the dangers of not applying sunscreen: ""It’s not just the risk of melanoma ..., but all skin cancers that need to be protected against. The main types of which are melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). CC is the most common type of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide,"" he tells Glamour UK. Fortunately, there are other content creators who are encouraging people to protect their skin from the sun’s harmful effects. One example is Mary Odusami, known as GlowingWithMary on TikTok, who advocates the application of sun protection, especially among black people. In her video, she explains that skin cancer affects everyone, regardless of skin colour, so everyone should wear SPF, responding to a user’s message that black people don’t need to wear sunscreen. According to France’s Ligue contre le Cancer, the risk of developing skin cancer is 1 in 100. Among their recommendations: avoid exposure during the hottest hours of the day, use appropriate protection products and reapply every two hours."
’Tantouring’: Another sign of the return to bolder makeup trends?,"Popularized by several world-famous influencers, such as Kim Kardashian, contouring took a back seat to more natural makeup styles during the Covid-19 pandemic and its various periods of lockdown. But that hasn’t stopped it from racking up over 2 billion views on TikTok. Its new spinoff, ""tantouring,"" has a way to go to get to this level, but it has already generated almost 20 million views in just a few weeks. A figure that testifies to the popularity of this new makeup technique, which combines the two basic elements for success — it’s simple and effective. The method simply involves swapping usual contouring products for a self-tanner. The idea is to apply the product to the areas you wish to sculpt — the bridge of the nose, cheekbones, jawline or hairline — playing with light and shadow effects, as you would with classic contouring. But the result won’t be the same: not only will your complexion be slightly tanned, like after a tanning session on the beach, but it will also last for several days. In short, a kind of long-lasting makeup that guarantees a healthy glow both in the morning and at bedtime. Beware, however, that the amount of self-tanning products applied to the skin, to avoid having to deal with an unattractive orange complexion. The requires some delicacy and vigilance. Like ‘shower makeup’, the ‘espresso makeup’, or the ‘slept in smoky eye’ trend, ‘tantouring’ could be another sign of the come-back to more boldness in makeup."
‘Latte’ and ’espresso makeup’: the warm coffee-inspired summer beauty trends,"‘Latte makeup’, the inspiration that has been taking social networks by storm since the start of summer, with more than 203 million views to date, evokes the hot, creamy beverage, with its radiant, amber, almost caramelized shimmer. ’Espresso makeup’ (11 million views) is a more intense and bolder version of the latter. Two trends that show the interest of users for a subtly tanned, back-from-the-beach complexion, during the North hemisphere summer season. Also, like many beauty inspirations, ’latte makeup’ has been spreading like wildfire to other parts of the face and body, starting with eyes and nails. On social networks, there are therefore countless inspirations of this kind, from ’matcha latte manicures’ to ’cherry cola lips.’ On TikTok, the ‘latte makeup’ trend was brought into the limelight by Rachel Rigler, who described it as “warm, bronzy, milky and effortless.” Revealing her secrets for recreating the beauty look, makeup artist Tanielle Jai explains it’s important to choose products based on yellow shades, rather than those with red undertones, in order to get the warm, caramelized effect. ’Espresso makeup,’ the latest inspo to date, appears as a grungy take on the latte look. The new version seeks to create a more bronzed complexion and a much more intense eye makeup. While ’latte makeup’ appears to be the perfect beauty look for summer days, its relative is a more robust version that users consider as much more suited to evening. The trend has already spawned a host of videos and posts, but it’s undoubtedly content creator Danielle Marcan who has seen the greatest success with the looks. Her one-minute video has already been viewed over a million times. In it, she introduces the beauty look — which she herself describes as ""the grunge sister of the latte makeup"" — and then offers a tutorial on how to make it your own. As you can see, the complexion gets more attention, with more bronzing powder and contouring products, the idea being to get the look of tanned skin, but it’s above all the eyes that are the focus. For a perfect ’espresso makeup’ look, the caramel and bronze shades of the ’latte makeup’ look are swapped out for pencils and eyeshadows in deep brown, even cocoa, and there’s no skimping either on black eyeliner or mascara. It’s a detail that makes all the difference. All that’s left now is to wait for the next coffee-machine-influenced beauty inspiration to hit..."
Millennials and Generation Z are a driving force in the luxury goods market,"According to the True-Luxury Global Consumer Insight 2023 report from BCG and The Altagamma Foundation [1], Millennials and Generation Z are playing an increasingly important role in the luxury goods industry. By 2022, they already accounted for almost EUR 200 billion of the market, double the 2016 figure, and this is forecast to almost double again by 2026. What’s more, younger generations spend 15% more than other age groups, making a significant contribution to the sector’s growth. Millennials and Generation Z are also driving another emerging trend in the luxury market: the resale and rental of luxury goods. In 2022, a third of consumers surveyed had bought second-hand luxury goods, an increase of 7 points on 2020, and 22% opted to rent luxury goods, an increase of 4 points in two years. Both trends are particularly strong among younger consumers, with 35% of Millennials and Generation Z having purchased second-hand luxury goods and 26% having rented luxury goods over the past year. Despite their growing appetite for luxury goods, younger shoppers can be picky when it comes to the customer experience. Luxury brands have made considerable efforts to improve the in-store shopping experience. However, less than 50% of consumers surveyed said they were truly satisfied with their experience, and 11% even said they were underwhelmed. This is mainly due to low satisfaction levels regarding online ceremonies. According to the report, few luxury brands have succeeded in recreating online the emotional factors experienced during an in-store purchase. This ’digital disconnect’ is particularly noticeable among Generation Z and in Europe, where one in five young people consider their online shopping experience disappointing, compared with one in ten baby-boomers. These new demands are prompting luxury brands to rethink their approach to attracting and retaining young consumers. According to Joël Hazan, managing director at BCG and luxury sector expert, cutting-edge technologies such as generative AI and Web3 can enable brands to offer ultra-personalized, immersive customer experiences. These tools can play a crucial role in meeting the expectations of a diverse, digital-native audience. This approach has borne fruit in China, where technologies in this field are more advanced. In fact, only 13% of luxury buyers report being underwhelmed by their online purchasing experience, while around half (46%) of domestic purchases are made online. The international luxury goods market is showing solid growth worldwide and has recovered to pre-covid levels. It is expected to be worth some EUR 1,300 billion by 2026, with an annual growth rate of 6% between 2022 and 2026, according to the base scenario chosen by BCG and Altagamma. Despite a slowdown in the overall demand, China and th U.S should remain the main growth drivers of the global luxury market. Beside these two giant markets, Saudi Arabia appears as a key alternative market with an untapped potential. Luxury sales are expected to double in the Kingdom during the period from 2022 to 2030, growing from EUR 3 billion to 6 billion."
"Huge opportunities in Middle East and Africa, says Cosmoprof panel session","According to Euromonitor International, huge growth opportunities for beauty brands are hidden in emerging or still underexploited markets, which are characterized by a strong demographic push, growing urbanization and an average increase in purchasing power. The main driving categories are hair care (with a value of 7.9 billion dollars), fragrances (6.3 billion dollars) and skin care products (5.5 billion dollars). By 2027, the region will reach a revenue of 47 billion dollars, with an average annual growth of 12%. The Middle East is witnessing significant expansion due to the growing purchasing power of local consumers. Fuelled by digitalisation, the region, especially the Gulf countries, offer ample opportunities for growth, owing in large part to untapped per-capital potential. Rising disposable incomes and overall rising wealth, particularly among the younger urban middle class, also bring opportunities for value-added beauty products that emphasize health and well-being. “Beauty is not just about appearance but has a psychological component that is connected to being part of a community. Euromonitor has identified ‘wellness’ as a megatrend, which means it’s a trend that is here to stay,” said Mehr Shafiei, Senior Analyst at Euromonitor International, who spoke at the round table. “The theme of wellness has emerged predominantly during the pandemic as a result of greater attention to health, but also because of better communication via social media."" For Nazih Hamad, Founder of Nazih Group, digitization and social media are strategic tools. “It is not important what brands tell consumers, but what consumers share, and their satisfaction,"" he said. The talk highlighted the fundamental role of the Middle East for the cosmetics industry: it is a rapidly growing market, with a high per capita income and local authorities have enacted policies to prevent counterfeiting and illegal trade. Another key element is the young average age of the population: 50% are under the age of 35-40, meaning that young and well-educated consumers are playing a distinctive role. Tourism is also growing, and the area is a strategic market for purchases, as prices are lower in Dubai than in Europe. However, attention must be paid to the differences within the area. The Middle East is not a homogeneous market: Saudi Arabia is the region with the most demanding consumers, Lebanon is the country that pays the greatest attention to innovation, Dubai is the trendiest metropolis, and Bahrain registers the highest purchase power. “The region is a melting pot with huge differences: understanding its specific needs is essential,” said Della Pass, General Manager of AKI BinSina (UAE). “There are many local indie brands, which respond more effectively to local needs with their products. They are more flexible than international brands, which have more difficulty proposing customized products. The Middle East is the land of diversity: Western stereotypes are almost disappearing. New standards of beauty, new images and above all the use of Arabic instead of English are fundamental for a brand doing business in the region.” Abdul Majid Madi, Founder and CEO of District General Trading Company Kuwait, highlighted how the value of sustainability is growing in the region. “In the Middle East, consumers acquire information on ingredients, new technologies and sustainable innovations through social media or during their travels, and once in their country they expect new launches that respect the same values."" According to the latest analyses by statista.com, in 2023 the beauty market on the African continent reached a value of 7.89 billion USD, and an average annual growth rate of 8.79% is expected over the next 5 years. 87% of consumption is attributable to mass- market products distributed in retail channels. Growth is driven by the demography. By 2050 it is estimated that the African population will account for 25% of the world’s population, while this share will reach 40% by 2100. ""The cosmetics and beauty market is growing steadily in Africa, following demographic growth, urbanization, and the increase in incomes of the middle class. This type of consumer goods is highly appreciated, and the expense for these products is constantly growing. Among the most interesting markets, there are South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya, but the trend is generally increasing throughout the continent,"" explained Francesco Gastaldon, Partner and Country Manager Italy of Kili Partners, an advisory, business and project development firm that assists clients to access growth opportunities and markets across Africa. However, accessing the African cosmetic market is not easy. The needs of local consumers are very different from those of Western customers: different types of hair, skin and bodies and an extreme climate with heat picks are a challenge for many brands. Currently, the market particularly rewards local brands, however, new technologies and growing digitization offer new data and tools to multinationals, especially in sub-Saharan regions. The very low average age of the population, with three-quarters of the population under the age of 30, is a further factor that helps the growth of global products, together with growing urbanization and the development of the middle class. The most strategic markets today are South Africa and Nigeria, the most populous state on the continent with over 220 million people, but Cameroon, Tanzania, Ghana, Ethiopia and Kenya are also promising areas. However, as for the Middle East, it is important to keep in mind that the African continent is a multifaceted territory with cultural, religious, political, social and economic differences making it a real kaleidoscope. The e-commerce channel, which continues to grow in all regions, can help significantly boost sales. At the end of 2022, online sales reached a value of 859,300 USD, with an annual growth rate forecast to 12.39% over the next 5 years, leading to a total turnover of 1.3 million dollars in 2027."
The slept-in smoky eye takes the classic look to another level,"While the neat, colorful aesthetics of Barbie and the Clean Girl were big news in 2022, it seems that grunge is slowly but surely making its way into women’s closets — and their bathrooms. The ’succubus chic’ trend became all the rage at the start of the year, followed this spring by the ’rockstar girlfriend’ look, with hundreds of millions of views on social networks. Inspired by grunge, underground and gothic styles, this aesthetic is based around leather, fishnet, rock band T-shirts and combat boots as well as extreme smoky eyes — almost panda eyes. This is where the slept-in smoky eye comes in — the latest beauty craze for grunge fans, as well as those with a lazier approach to life. As you might have guessed, the idea is to apply eye makeup as if you hadn’t removed it the day before — something that beauty purists might not even want to think about. Wednesday Addams, heroine of the hit Netflix show which landed at the end of 2022, is an obvious poster girl for this new trend, but it also brings grunge icons from the 1990s and 2000s back into the spotlight, starting with Kate Moss. ""Slept-in smoky eyes are grungy and imperfect. That’s what makes it cool. It’s unapologetic and a little scary. It’s refreshing to try a different approach to your makeup. To think, ’How can I make this look weirder and less perfect?’,"" the head makeup artist for ""Euphoria"" and Half-Magic Beauty cofounder, Doniella Davy, told the beauty website Byrdie. The trend has already flooded social networks, and is gradually making inroads on catwalks and red carpets, led by the likes of Dua Lipa, Emma Chamberlain and Cara Delevingne. To create a slept-in smoky eye, simply intensify a smoky eye and take it to the extreme by replacing powdery textures with liquid or creamy products. And don’t restrict yourself to the upper eyelid. On the contrary, to get the look, it’s imperative to go all around the eye, applying product flush to the lashes. Despite what the name might suggest, the idea is not to end up with an actual panda eye effect."
MakeUp in Paris: The challenge of eco-designed high-performance innovations,"Packaging-wise, recycled, recyclable and refillable solutions abounded, and emerging trends were noted in each category. Brivaplast took up the challenge of creating a refillable mascara! Probably one of the most difficult products to deal with when it comes to packaging reduction, because refilling involves replacing the entire product, i.e. the formula / wand / wiper / brush combination. At MakeUp in Paris, the Italian company showcased a tube that can be moulded from recycled materials and is fitted with a removable, flexible inner refill. The formula is created by Ancorotti. In terms of weight and components, the final product more or less equals two standard mascaras, but it still saves 25% in CO2 emissions when it is refilled. The innovation also lies in the security of the refill opening mechanism, which needs to be inserted into the case to be able to remove the brush, so the refill cannot be used on its own. “There is a huge demand from brands for mascara refills. They expect solutions,” says Marco Roda, Business Development Manager at Brivaplast. Although it is still tricky to actually recycle mascara and most other makeup products due to their size, smaller than the requirements of sorting processes, the innovation approach focused on recyclable mono-material products anticipates future regulations. Other mascara innovations included Pibiplast’s DUE tube, which is made up of two parts instead of four. The neck of the bottle acts as a wiper, and the cap and wand are moulded in one part. The whole product is made of PP to make recycling easier. Libo Cosmetics created a Venus lipstick 100% made from aluminium, including the mechanism and refill, making it theoretically 100% recyclable. As for Aptar, they also banked on a mono-material product with a new refillable lipstick tube made exclusively from polypropylene (PP). The manufacturer also showcased a new version of its refillable lipstick Private Refill, now endowed with enhanced decoration. It is secured with a unique, customisable key, so the brand ensures the exclusive use of its refills. As for compact cases, Metapack aimed to refocus desirability on the object itself, with a premium, refillable, 100% Zamak version developed for Fara Homidi. The supplier is also behind the plastic-free cap developed for La Bouche Rouge perfumes, in partnership with Pujolasos for the cork insert. Among the many solutions presented by HCP was the refillable Dial Compact case, made exclusively from recyclable PET. The gesture of this patented solution makes it possible to insert the refill in a twist, from the bottom. Livcer has increased the performance of its 83% paper-based thermoforming solutions for a greater capacity. Moreover, the company now offers a range of samples for pressed powders. Alongside packaging suppliers and application solutions, formula manufacturers were largely represented at the show. They revealed an intensive quest for new textures and enhanced performance with high naturalness levels. MS BeautiLab won an IT Award in the formulation category for its Super Nova Green injection powders formulated with 99% of ingredients of natural origin and Cosmos Natural-certified raw materials. These creamy powders are free from microplastics, talc, silicones, and film-forming agents. MS BeautiLab’s Skin Fusion innovation is also worth noting: particular attention was paid to the formula/packaging combination. The right dose of an anhydrous formula made up of 99% of ingredients of natural origin is laid down on technical paper for one serum or eye contour application. Once delivered and applied, the transformation formula melts into the skin. Skin Fusion boasts a sustainable approach, both for its formula and fully recyclable paper packaging. The on-the-go solution enables to customize routines with a targeted choice of actives. Aircos, a company of the Anjac Health & Beauty group, received the jury’s “Coup de cœur” award for its Hypnotic Very Noir eyeshadow, which features a creamy powder texture and a metallic black-gold effect to shade or mix colours. Fiabila presented its Do Not Disturb odourless formulas. “To achieve this result, over 45% of the formula was modified,” explains CEO Pierre Miasnik. The entire solvent formula and the dispersion were reviewed to minimise the product’s smell on application, while maintaining ease of application, excellent coverage, shine, and long wear. Another advantage is that the varnish can be scented for an even better customer experience. This innovation obviously targets customers who do not like the smell of nail varnish, particularly in Asia. The nail specialist also highlighted reactive varnish which lasts for eight days thanks to polymerisation involving the addition of a reagent to varnish based on oligomers. The application gesture is exactly the same as for traditional varnish and top coats. IL Cosmetics developed the new Demi Matt Plumper, a lip gloss with natural pungent actives for a plumping effect, as well as the Lip Gloss Nails Manicure concept in line with the glow boom in nail care. New, deeper shades are given added shine with the application of two top coats which can be powered with skincare actives. Also among the manufacturer’s many new products was the Naturally Tubing mascara, which can be removed with lukewarm water and is made from over 80% of ingredients of natural origin. In the skincare category, Technature showcased travel-size, waterless freeze-dried make-up-removing beads containing a prebiotic, as well as a collection of skincare products in the form of sticks: a mask, an eye contour, a foaming cleanser, a two-phase emulsion stick and a non-oily oil-stick."
Indonesia entrepreneurs cash in on TikTok live selling spree,"Southeast Asia is a bright spot for TikTok, owned by Chinese tech firm ByteDance. The company’s CEO Shou Zi Chew announced plans last week to invest billions of dollars in the region, where it counts 325 million users, of whom 125 million are in Indonesia. Shopping on TikTok is booming in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, where consumers spent more on the app than any other country in the region last year. As TikTok Shop grows in popularity, with Indonesians buying more than a third of goods sold in Southeast Asia over the past year, entrepreneurs are flocking to the platform to promote a range of tech, fashion and homemade products. They are drawn to TikTok’s e-commerce features that allow them to sell through livestreams or open online stores. Monomolly, a 20-strong online retail employer, reported a 30 percent increase in revenue since kicking off a TikTok livestream drive last year, according to spokesperson Nadya Paramitha. The platform’s algorithm has jumpstarted the company’s business, according to employees. It has allowed sellers to ""reach new markets randomly"" instead of relying on interest-based search results on rival apps, said TikTok sales manager Chelvyana Onggo Winata. It isn’t just companies that are using the platform. DIY home streamers Panji Made Agung and his wife Astari Gita used to rely on their families to survive. But they now sell as many as 1,000 cookie jars a month through TikTok livestreams, making 25 million rupiah ($1,700). Their viewers and sales ramped up because of their personalities, said Gita, who often flirts with her husband and makes him feel uncomfortable on camera. ""We discovered selling products alone would not work. It has to touch people’s emotions. It has to be entertaining,"" Gita said. ""They like our real-life humour as a couple and Agung being awkward."" TikTok Shop has capitalised on the Indonesian market, amassing more than two million sellers since it launched in 2021. It takes one percent commission and a charge of 20,000 rupiah (USD 1.33) for every item sold, building a growing market share against more established and bigger rivals. Indonesia represented 42 percent of TikTok’s USD 4.4 billion regional gross merchandise value (GMV) last year, according to Singapore-based consultancy Momentum Works. Online shopper Aldi Alfarabi said he wasn’t looking to spend money while scrolling through TikTok livestreams, but he often stumbled on items that took his fancy, such as a dinosaur backpack he recently bought. ""There is an engaging interaction through the virtual conversation,"" said the 29-year-old from Jakarta. ""You can see exactly what you are buying."" Experts say TikTok’s Indonesia strategy is catching on with shifting shopping habits as younger customers demand more engaging experiences to open their wallets. ""Indonesia’s digital market is dominated by Generation Z,"" said Bhima Yudhistira, an analyst from Jakarta’s Center of Economic and Law Studies. ""As they are more adaptive to new things, the market patterns change swiftly."" So Southeast Asian online shopping — pulled along by Indonesia — is only going one way, he said, growing into what is predicted to become a $35 billion market next year."
K-Beauty: Four key trends spotted at CosmoBeauty Seoul 2023,"High tech anti-ageing beauty is always an important product category at any Asian trade show, and perhaps especially so at a K-beauty show. At CosmoBeauty Seoul 2023, Korean exhibitors presented a wide range of beauty tech and functional face care products designed to address the concerns of ageing skin. Korean mass market brand Banobagi’s newest face care launch is a serum and cream duo formulated with alpha-arbutin to help brighten skin tone and tackle hyperpigmentation and dark skin patches. Indie brand Soroci’s new Vita Tangerine Fit Mask is a two-step sheet mask set which consists of a vitamin C toner-soaked peeling pad that is used to gently exfoliate the skin and a hydrating and skin-brightening sheet mask to be applied afterwards. Eldeen, which brand name is “needle” spelled backwards, was launched in 2022 and offers self-dissolving microneedle patches in different shapes for specific skin areas. Salon brand Puraxel presented its new at-home fractional laser tool which gently perforates the skin for a microneedle-like effect so active ingredients can more easily penetrate the epidermal layer, while fellow salon brand Reclar’s best-selling face massager uses different vibration frequencies to help apply beauty products more effectively. There are different settings for watery/liquid and thicker/creamier products. On the other hand, Barulab’s big CosmoBeauty innovation is surprisingly low-tech but claims to deliver superior skin care results. SteamSheet Moisture Shield is a dual face mask which consists of a serum sheet mask that is placed on the face first, and a thin top mask made from vinyl. The brand says that the heat generated by the additional plastic layer opens the face’s pores and allows the active ingredients to better penetrate the skin. The international microbiome trend was also very visible at CosmoBeauty Seoul this year, with the newer Korean indie brands in particular focusing on barrier care and/or the demands of sensitive skin. For instance, Korean beauty brand Abiy, which was launched in 2022, offers a duo of microbiome-focused face care products formulated with peptides. K-beauty brand Herbloom‘s Kombucha Plant Biome face care range has been a bestseller since the brand was launched in 2021 whilst O’Clearien another newcomer brand from Korea, offers five face care products formulated with trehalose and centella asiatica extract for sensitive skin. Doctob, another K-beauty brand launched in 2022, offers ten vegan biome-focused face and body care items and so does Age Zero, a new microbiome beauty brand introduced by Korean manufacturer Fascy. The Age Zero line-up focuses on anti-ageing beauty for customers aged 40+. And indie brand Orgahue has just brought out the Mela Barrier Cream in its product range. The product is based on mountain yam, yuzu and centella asiatica extract to help protect the skin barrier’s natural function. “Vegan” was definitely one of the biggest product claims at CosmoBeauty Seoul 2023, closely followed by that other GenZ favourite: “clean beauty”. It was noticeable, however, that the vegan seal in particular was almost exclusively associated with the younger indie brands that exhibited at the show, and frequently combined with a gender-free and/or minimalistic angle. There were over a dozen beauty brands at the show that were launched during or since the pandemic, almost all of them aimed at the GenZ and Millennials market. Claps is a good example of this new generation of brands. The label was introduced a few months ago and offers gender-free and vegan beauty with a focus on skin barrier health. Young indie brand Hamel, that launched in 2022, offers a vegan makeup and skin care with gender-neutral packaging and trending product textures, including a dual-phase hydrating toner and an ampoule (serum) in stick form. Equlib is another stylish gender-neutral range that was launched this year. With French-inspired product names, the brand offers five face care items for skin aged 30+. Simplica, which was launched earlier this year, describes itself a conscious, clean and vegan beauty brand believing that less is more in skin care. For its part, Aroutine, launched in 2021, is yet another vegan, gender-neutral beauty range offering five face care products formulated with plant extracts. Aroutine’s newest product is a hydrating sheet mask which contains white rose extract. Herbal ingredients have always played an important role in Korean beauty, from the anti-ageing ginseng popular with luxury beauty brands over domestic citrus variants like the vitamin-rich yuja fruit which is a traditional mainstay of Korean beauty ranges. And with the increasing popularity of vegan products, it is not surprising that many exhibitors at CosmoBeauty Seoul 2023 focused on plant-based ingredients as their key active. A good example is Korean indie brand Marinavi’s new Marinabee Intense Vitamin C Cream which contains 25% citrus-derived vitamin C and nutritious kelp extract. Vegan newcomer brand Deardot uses the dangyuja fruit extract as a key ingredient to help protect this plant species. Salon brand Fau’s Shiny Pumpkin range, on the other hand, contains pumpkin extract as a lead botanical. For instance, the brand’s Shiny Pumpkin Amino Therapy is a hydrating toner which is based on 85% pumpkin fruit extract. Niche brand Midha’s products are based on a very high percentage of nutritious rice water and contain the brand’s Rice 8 Complex which is manufactured from a premium rice grown in Gochang prefecture. Newcomer brand Ginger6 uses concentrated ginger water as a base for its six face care products. Salon brand Awy’s most recent launch is a duo of serums, including the Vitamin Tree Brightening Serum is based on 78% sea buckthorn extract. Eventually, beauty brand A by B.O.M presented its single ingredient toner range The One. Each liquid toner in this line contains over 90% of a single plant extract, usually traditional medicinal herbs."

Why is spatula the latest must-have for applying foundation?,"In order to achieve a flawless complexion (which definitely seems to be the holy grail in beauty), several TikTok users have recently set their sights on metal spatulas that could soon oust brushes or beauty blenders. These cosmetic or beauty spatulas — also known as a makeup or foundation spatulas — are smaller and are said to be more suitable for applying the products that form a daily beauty routine. Straight out of Korea, this tool is not only a hit with users of the GenZ’s favourite social network, but also with many makeup experts, including the content creator and influencer @glowwithava, who has more than 1.7 million followers. On TikTok, the #spatula hashtag already has over 300 million views, although some are about the actual kitchen utensil, while the hashtag #koreanspatula (this time leaving little doubt) already has almost nine million views, reflecting a craze for this beauty technique. On the social network, it’s first and foremost the result obtained with the spatula that is a hit, the tool facilitating the application of foundation while offering a smooth, radiant complexion, without any visible imperfections, and a glassy, almost transparent appearance- a trend inspired by Korean skincare routines. But that’s not the only merit touted by TikTokers, who also see this as a way of embracing a more minimalist makeup routine. In fact, the spatula allows you to apply a smaller amount of foundation without worrying about the excess being absorbed by a sponge or the bristles of a brush. This saving is not without interest for followers of the trend. But it’s the question of hygiene that could definitively propel the spatula to the top of the list of must-have beauty tools. Unlike sponges and brushes — or even hands — which can be veritable breeding grounds for bacteria without regular, thorough cleaning, spatulas are more often than not made of stainless steel, a material renowned for its ease of maintenance and hygienic properties. A benefit that extends far beyond the application of foundation and also concerns skin care."
"""Beauty is on an upward trajectory across all categories,"" finds McKinsey","“Today, beauty is on an upward trajectory across all categories,” says McKinsey & Company in recently released report The State of Fashion: Beauty. In 2022, the beauty market — defined as skincare, fragrance, makeup, and haircare — generated approximately USD 430 billion in revenue, and is expected to reach approximately USD 580 billion by 2027, growing by a projected 6 percent a year. This is in line with or slightly higher than other consumer segments such as apparel, footwear, eyewear, pet care, and food and beverages. However, the consulting firm expects the premium beauty tier to grow at an annual rate of 8 percent (compared with 5 percent in mass beauty) between 2022 and 2027, as consumers trade up and increase their spending. The fragrance and make-up categories are forecast to be the most impacted by this trend toward premiumization. According to McKinsey, another growth opportunity across geographies will be products and services in the top tier of the pricing pyramid: the luxury and ultraluxury beauty market has the potential to double, from around USD 20 billion today to around USD 40 billion by 2027. Despite the dynamism of the beauty landscape, McKinsey identifies a series of market transformations likely to increase competition among industry players. In particular, the consulting firm mentions: the emergence of independent players seeking to gain market share, the growth of e-commerce, and the slowdown in Chinese growth. If China and the United States will remain mighty forces for the industry, with the beauty market expected to reach USD 96 billion in China and USD 114 billion in North America by 2027, McKinsey says geographic diversification will become more essential than ever, with regions — including the Middle East and India — that are ready to step into the limelight, offering distinct potential for specific categories and price tiers. Eventually, the consulting firm identifies five key dynamics that are likely to transform the beauty landscape: – The redrawing of the growth map, with a slowdown in China resulting in the growing importance of the US market, along with the Middle East over the same period, and India in the longer term.
– The rise of wellness, with consumers increasingly engaging with beauty products and services to not only look good but also feel good.
– The influence of Gen Zers, who scrutinize brands as part of their search for value.
– The imperative to scale for indie beauty brands.
– The recalibration of M&A, with dealmaking not being the same as when cost of capital was low. Download the full report here."
Anti-aging products remain highly popular among US women,"Eighty-two percent of female consumers polled in TBC’s latest consumer study [1] said that a woman should be proud to look her true age. What’s more, consumers are generally at peace with the natural aging process (53% don’t mind looking their age). Still, 67% admit to being self-conscious about how they look as they grow older, and 96% just adore it when people think they are younger than their real age! While the term ""anti-aging"" itself is aging, it’s still the top choice when communicating a product’s benefit, TBC explains. Indeed, 54% of the women surveyed prefer the terms “anti-aging” to alternatives such as “Aging gracefully” (46%), “Age-defying” (45%), “Your best you, at any age” (45%), “Timeless skin” (40%). Furthermore, 70% of women surveyed say they purchase and/or use anti-aging products; and  55% own at least three products labeled as anti-aging. And they are mostly seeking anti-aging benefits: reducing/eliminating fine lines and wrinkles (77%); firming (72%); deep hydration (61%); improving skin elasticity (57%); sun protection (51%). More surprisingly, the survey found that women are starting to purchase anti-aging products earlier than past generations: Millennials and older started purchasing these products around age 35, while Gen Z purchasers began buying at age 23. While women are looking for products providing efficient anti-aging benefits, they require brands to provide authentic communication. According to TBC: 81% US women want communication to show real, age-appropriate women for whom the product is intended; 78% want brands do not photoshop models; 73% want brands do not use spokespeople whose look cannot be achieved with a skincare product (but had surgery, tillers or Botox). Furthermore, women need proof from Independent research studies that a product works and that its claims are backed by science. Perhaps because they have already been disappointed by the alleged-effectiveness of the products. Indeed, if 75% of surveyed women would spend more money on products that deliver on promises, many say certain of their anti-aging expectations are not met by their current products: anti-aging facial skincare needs (58%), fine lines/wrinkle reduction (53%), firming (51%), improved elasticity (41%), lifting (40%), dark spots/age spots/lightening (37%). There are therefore many opportunities for skincare brands, provided they find a way to meet high expectations in terms of transparency and efficiency. Read the full TBC’s infographics here."
"Black is the most popular nail polish shade globally, finds new report","The popularity of nail colours has grown rapidly over the past few years, and the global nail beauty market is expected to grow at around 8% over the next decade, according to Transparency Market Research (TMR). As consumers embrace nail care and nail colour as a key aspect of their beauty routines, Perfect Corp. tried to identify the emerging trends in nail colours and textures using data sourced from their YouCam Nails app. [1] The app features thousands of AR-powered filters that allows users to virtually try-on nail colour and nail art effects in real time. According to Perfect Corp., the YouCam Nails app cumulates over 7 million virtual nail colour try-ons per year. According to Perfect Corp., globally and across many markets, neutral nail colours have emerged as the most popular and most-frequently tried-on shades. Furthermore, the company’s data revealed a trend towards edgier neutral tones, with black nail polish taking the top spot as the most frequently tried-on shade globally. This bold and versatile tone began to rise in popularity over the past year as celebrities stepped out at award shows and on red carpets wearing this striking nail colour in both high-shine and matte finishes. The trend toward neutrals observed in the big data continued with Pearl White and Sand also emerging as some of the most popular nail colour shades globally. Black nail polish and light neutral shades were also confirmed to be top trending nail colours in regional data observed for the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Brazil, France, Japan, China and Mexico. Red nails, such as Cherry, Crimson and Sparkle Red were also among the most popular nail colour shades globally. These tones emerged as top shades across all regions analysed, with a significant trending popularity toward red shades and bright tones across the Middle East regions including UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman. High shine, metallic and chrome tones such as Metallic Rose Gold, Foil Gold, and Foil Silver were also observed among the top 10 most tried-on nail colours globally. These tones trended in all key markets analysed, with a significant preference observed in China, Mexico, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. As far as textures are concerned, cream nail polish was the top tried-on texture across all global markets, followed by jelly, matte, and sheer nail colour formulas, confirming the recent dramatic transformations in this area, with new and innovative finishes taking the beauty world by storm.

"Trends: On TikTok, blush takes on bright colours","As one of the must-have beauty products of 2022, blush could reach new heights this year. And for good reason, since it is regularly the focus of trends, inspirations and even beauty hacks on social networks. This has been seen in recent months with “douyin blush”, which involves making a ’v’ shape on several parts of the face, “under-eye blush”, to hide dark circles, and even white blush to sculpt and brighten the face. The latest in the list, “purple blush” promises to be much more effective than classic blush shades for a good-looking effect. ""Bold"" is the adjective most used on TikTok to qualify this new makeup trick, which is clearly proving popular. The craze is such that the hashtag #purpleblush already has more than 60 million views, and that’s without counting its derivatives, which are multiplying at speed. On TikTok, many famous influencers have already experimented with this new trend, starting with American users Mikayla Nogueira, Sarah Wolak and Aidette Cancino, who have largely contributed to its success. The advantage of this trick lies in its simplicity, since it does not require any particular skill or technique, other than knowing how to apply blush. As you can see, only the shade of the product changes, and consumers will only need to invest in a new purple, lavender, lilac, mauve, eggplant or possibly plum blush, before getting to work. As for the effect, not surprisingly, it’s the striking boldness of purple blush that is the main advantage, but it’s not the only one, according to users of the social network. They claim that purple blush gives a healthy glow effect that’s even more effective than with classic blush shades. Another important boon is that it’s suitable for all skin tones. However, it is important to choose the right shade of purple for the desired effect — as a general rule, go lighter for lighter skin tones. The only downside, albeit marginal, is that while some TikTokers are happy to take credit for bringing to light this beauty trend, it’s not actually all that ground-breaking. Some celebrities, like Rihanna, have been using this trick for many years. At a time when Gen Z is reconnecting with makeup, it is above all a sign of a return to bright colours in the world of beauty."
India: a promised land for beauty and luxury brands?,"L’Oréal has been gaining market shares and reviving the Lancôme brand through the Sephora sales channel. Les Galeries Lafayette are planning to open two department stores, in New Delhi and Mumbai. And Estée Lauder is launching the Beauty & You India programme with Indian company Nykaa to support young Indian beauty brands: following the example of major fashion names, beauty luxury brands have been getting ready to conquer the Indian market, just like they did in China. Over the past decades, the country has actually experienced a significant demographic growth, with a population of 1.4 billion people that is about to become the largest in the world, along with an economic growth that has resulted in the wealthiest classes enjoying increased buying power. According to the 2023 Forbes richest people ranking, India counts 169 billionaires in dollars, compared to 140, in 2021, and the number of millionaires keeps increasing, mainly in the city of Mumbai, which counts 60,000. These dynamics have been fuelling the development of a luxury product offering, which reminds of the boom observed in China. “India is often cited as reference when it comes to numbers, because its population is about to become larger than China’s, but the comparison ends there,” tempers Florence Bernardin, founder and Director of Asia Cosme Lab, a marketing watch agency specializing in beauty products for Asia. “The number of millionaires is rising, but the truth is, 90% of the economy remains non-official, and the average income is still very low. Only 10% of Indian people earn more than 280 euros per month. Of course, out of 1.4 billion, it makes 140 million people – twice the French population – but it is not the same as China, where the GDP per capita reaches 12,000 dollars. In India, it peaks at 200. So, it IS a huge, developing market, but with a very low price level. Luxury will only reach a very small part of the population”, she adds. Wealth is unequally shared from one region to another, and it is mainly concentrated in cities, which shelter an increasing number of start-ups in the field of technological innovation. Meanwhile, distribution channels have been expanding, in particular online, driven by Indian giant Nykaa and direct selling. Makeup brand Sugar, founded by Vineeta Singh, has become one of the biggest players on the D2C segment (Direct to Consumer) in India, and it also counts 150 stores. The Body Shop has reached the threshold of 200 stores opened in 2023. The brand is present in more than 65 cities in India. “What is changing is that many indie brands have been emerging. The market is dynamic, now: it is driven by technologies, social media, online sales, lifestyle changes, the media, and influencers. All these brands are riding the current global trends, i.e. naturalness, men’s grooming, inclusivity, and Ayurveda, of course”, observes Florence Bernardin. For example, 82°E, actress Deepika Padukone’s minimalist skincare brand, uses plants from the traditional Indian pharmacopoeia. Launched online in November 2022, she received a flood of negative feedback from her fans due to the selling prices, from EUR 20 (USD 22) to EUR 30 (USD 33): much too high for the Indian market. The successful indie brands whose sales prices range between EUR 1.5 (USD 1.65) and EUR 18 (USD 19.75) include Juicy Chemistry, an Ecocert/Cosmos-certified nutricosmetics and skin, hair, and body care brand, Neemli Naturals, which combines science and naturalness with prices between EUR 1.6 and EUR 18, MamaEarth, of the Godrej group, and Dr Sheth’s for Indian Skin, for a dermatological and Ayurvedic approach. “These brands can definitely export to Europe, because they offer quality products, or they can enter markets that do not have the same revenues as we do. For example, they can compete with China on African markets, or with South Korea in South-East Asia”, adds Florence Bernardin. Even for brands with moderate prices, the future depends on macro-economic politics that support growth. “Contrary to China, the problem with India is that there is too little investment in health and education. Only 3% of young people have access to high positions. There are good universities, but not enough places. And it is actually for this population segment that luxury is developing. There is a huge potential, but at the current pace, it will take several generations to take advantage of it”, says the expert, adding that 40% of the population is under 25 in India. The median age is 28 years old – it is 39 in China. “I think the role of all these luxury players entering the Indian market consists in investing in education, by setting up schools or educating women. So they are not just a showcase”, suggests Florence Bernardin, to conclude."
Spain : The perfumery and cosmetics sector grew by 11.3% in 2022,"After an increase of 11.3% in 2022, the perfumes and cosmetics sector has reached a historic peak in Spain, with a sales volume of 9,250 million euros, well beyond the 8,460 million euros that previously marked the peak of the historical series. Per capita consumption of beauty and personal care products is approaching 185 euros per person per year, significantly above the 170 euros reached in 2019. [1] All beauty categories have been growing during 2022; in particular colour cosmetics (+29.4%), with the restart of iconic categories such as lipsticks, still slightly below the 2019 levels. The perfume category (+19.8%) also saw significant growth, while skin care (+9%) is approaching 3,000 million euros in sales. According to Stanpa, the various distribution channels have evolved just as dynamically, with double-digit growth in virtually all categories. For instance, the mass market channel posted a +13% growth, while the pharmacy channel grew by +6.3%, and the selective channel by +18.2%, to name only the three most dynamic ones. As far as international trade is concerned, the sector achieved 6,515 million euros in exports in 2022, i.e. 21% more than in 2021 and 25% more than in 2019. Perfumery (+27%) remains the first component of Spain’s beauty exports (40% of the total), even if all categories are rising compared to 2021: +22% for make-up, +20% skin care +21% for toiletries and almost +14% for hair care. Spain has posted a positive commercial balance since 2006, with a surplus of about 1,900 million euros in 2022, and is among the 10 main world exporters of perfumery and cosmetics products. It is also the world’s second largest exporter of perfumes, just behind France and ahead of Germany and the United States."
The latest olfactive trends in niche perfumery at Esxcence 2023,"Since the health crisis, floral notes are all the rage. Brands are banking on their cheerful tones to make us see life in pink. White flowers in particular, whose sunny glow is an antidote to moroseness. A trend that is still very much in vogue, with many launches highlighting jasmine at the show. Like Jasmin de Toscane, signed by Jean-Christophe Hérault for Jacques Fath, with rounded, sensual, almondy notes and a twist of hazelnut. Jasmine is also showcased at The Different Company, in a new perfume whose name has yet to be revealed, announced as a tribute to this tiny white flower, whose scent becomes more intoxicating as night falls. White flowers (ylang-ylang, jasmine) also outline the gardenia accord in Blanc de Chine, signed by Patrice Revillard for Parfumeurs du Monde, to be released in the coming months. With their comforting whiff, trails with musky, sandalwood and milky notes, that emerged after the health crisis, are still very popular. Like the delicate and airy Musc Pallas, the new Jovoy, which takes shape amidst the powdery softness of ambrette and iris and the roundness of tonka bean, on a background of vaporous musk. Creamy, milky nuances, which have become inevitable, can be found as a thread in many launches, texturing a coffee accord (Fanfarone Italiano, by Karine Dubreuil-Sereni for State of Mind), or outlining coconut facets (Un été, by Meabh McCurtin for the Obvious  brand). They also blend with matcha accords and other tea notes to conjure up chai latte effects. Tea accords seem to be an emerging trend, reflecting both a quest for well-being and the growth of the Asian market. The matcha accord is at the heart of Un été for Obvious. Isabelle Larignon’s Milky Dragon is infused with Oolong tea, combined with milky, fruity and spicy notes. At Olfactive Studio, Lapsang Souchong tea is featured in the Sepia collection with Smoky Soul. Signed by Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, the juice is enhanced by osmanthus, jasmine sambac, patchouli and seaweed absolute. Osmanthus also made its presence felt at the show. In addition to Smoky Soul, this tiny Chinese flower with apricot and leathery accents, inspired Osmanthe Liu Yuan, by Le Jardin Retrouvé. A delicate composition, where the flower’s fruity tones are enhanced by mandarin, softened by iris, on a base of suede and musk. Another ingredient that reflects the interest of niche perfumery towards China. In recent years, gourmand notes have evolved towards less overtly “sweet” tasty grounds. Still very much in vogue, coffee accords take on an unctuous appearance, textured with amber and liqueur-like notes at State Of Mind with Fanfarone Italiano. For Nicolaï, coffee embraces woody, ambery and dry tones in an equally dense, but darker tone, with Caravansérail Intense. Perfumers also continue to explore new tasty accords around cereals, rice, or peanuts. Like Frapin’s brand new Attendre et Espérer, where vetiver meets peanut notes, refreshed with ginger, to blow hot and cold. Another example is Zazen by Robert Piguet, a highly faceted creation based on a “rice steam” accord. Overall, the launches spotted since last year at Esxence tend to be less focused, and polarising, to adopt a more comfortable feel-good register. The brands’ origins are also diversifying with creations from Singapore, Ukraine, Romania, Croatia, Japan… Finally, it should be noted that while ecological issues are still very much present, new labels are trying to establish their identity with a sustainable approach. One example is Nissaba, created by Sébastien Tissot, who worked for a long time with Dominique Roques for the responsible sourcing of natural ingredients at Firmenich. The brand is very much involved in supporting young people from perfume-producing communities. It also promotes their know-how by giving pride of place in its juices, to the olfactory terroirs of the countries that produce perfume ingredients. Each of the brand’s perfumes is composed of the iconic ingredients of a region, to recreate its olfactory atmosphere. Indeed, an original brief for perfumers. Like the global perfume market, the world of niche perfumery continues to open up and diversify. See you next year at Esxence."
"After the pandemic skincare boom, Gen Z is getting back into makeup","The first Covid lockdown proved fatal for makeup. Once restrictions eased, venturing out involved a face mask — sometimes mandatory — once again disputing the beauty habits of people who did not seem to have the heart nor the time to get made up, only to end up hiding the result behind a face covering. Surveys and cosmetics sales reports were soon unanimous: women had abandoned makeup, especially lipstick, to embrace a more natural, authentic approach to beauty. A phenomenon also driven by the body positive movement and the drive for self-acceptance, with celebrities like Alicia Keys leading the way by shunning all things fake and focusing more intently on skincare. This desire to take care of our skin, to protect it from external factors and the damaging effects of aging has resulted in a skincare boom that’s been going on for months, even years, with much interest in new, more natural formulas, and the rise of holistic beauty. This was seen on social networks, with the multiplication of new techniques, like ’glass skin’, ’jello skin’ or ’status skin,’ intended to achieve a flawless, glowing finish. If this trend is far from being obsolete today, it seems that Gen Zers in particular want to reconnect with their pre-pandemic ways — in other words, with makeup. The latest Piper Sandler Companies semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens survey [1], conducted among 5,690 US teens, averaging 16.2 years of age, reveals that for the first time in three years, teens spent more on makeup products than on skincare. Makeup is once again the top beauty priority for teens, with an estimated annual spend of USD 123, compared to less than USD 120 on skincare. A figure that actually reflects a certain balance between the two segments, although spending on cosmetics products has increased considerably in one year, to the tune of +32%, compared to +11% for skincare. This renewed interest in cosmetics has also been seen on social networks, where members of Gen Z are constantly sharing tips and tricks of all kinds. From mascara cocktailing to hot glue gun makeup and diamond lips, the latest beauty inspirations going viral on TikTok have mostly been makeup techniques, often featuring eye-catching or eccentric beauty looks. This doesn’t take anything away from young people’s desire to aspire to a more natural kind of beauty, often with cleaner and more sustainable products. So while the #nomakeup hashtag has more than five billion views on the social network, there’s also a need for singularity, extravagance and fun. According to Piper Sandler Companies. Originating during the pandemic, the ’no makeup’ trend could be running out of steam.], almost half of teenagers (45%) say they wear makeup every day, which is more than double the number in 2021, a year still marked by the pandemic and then by the return to ’normal’ life. Evidently, each period has its own beauty habits, but it seems that in the spring of 2023, teenagers have decided to forget this long and gloomy era to well and truly get back to ’normal’ life."
’Mascara cocktailing’ is the latest makeup trend taking over TikTok,"’Mascara cocktailing,’ the latest beauty trend to come thick and fast on TikTok, has scored more than two million views in just a few weeks. However, this trend – which is inspired by traditional layering methods –does not seem to a breakthrough innovation. Yet, videos are multiplying at pace on social media, lauding the merits of this trick that promises long, full and voluminous lashes. This trend is rooted in the simple assumption that the perfect mascara does not exist. It is impossible, say TikTokers, to find a mascara that does a perfect job of making lashes both long and voluminous. Inevitably, they felt it necessary to develop a technique to overcome this. And the result is ’mascara cocktailing,’ promising a look worthy of false eyelashes in no time. The advantage of this method lies in its accessibility, but also in its affordability. As well as being very easy to recreate alone in front of the mirror, it does not require an unlimited budget. Before starting, however, you need to do a little shopping to find the perfect mascaras to optimize your beauty routine. The goal is to get a mascara formulated for volume, a mascara formulated for length, and maybe even a third one to serve as a primer. One in the bathroom, ’mascara cocktailing’ involves applying a primer, a lash care product, or even a clear mascara designed to naturally lengthen lashes, then switching to, say, a mascara that’s supposed to make them fuller and more voluminous. But that’s not all. ’Mascara cocktailing’ consists precisely in adding a third layer, a mascara formulated for XXL lashes, to get a look worthy of the most sophisticated red carpets. Just like many recent hits on TikTok –- ’coquette makeup’ or ’shower makeup’ trends, for example — ’mascara cocktailing’ seems to go against the trend for the more natural looks, which seemed ubiquitous since the Covid-19 pandemic."
Five key trends spotted at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2023,"Brands catering to younger consumers cover a whole range of trends such as vegan, clean or organic and gender-neutrality; and this year at Cosmoprof Woldwide Bologna, there were a number of recently launched beauty brands that were firmly aimed at customers in their 20s and 30s. Savaip from Lithuania, for example, was introduced in October 2022. The brand’s packaging has a strong 1970s vibe. Savaip is designed to appeal to GenZ consumer and younger Millennials by offering nine gender-free clean beauty face and body care with a seasonal slant for sensitive and post-acne skin. One Trick Ponies from Sweden was launched during the trade show with a very similar concept. The six gender-free face and body care products for customers in their late teens and early 20s are each built around a key active which is communicated clearly on the packaging in a 1970s style bubble lettering. Naples-based 2SQM was introduced a few months ago and features nine certified organic and gender-free face and body care products. The brand’s background is firmly rooted in the Italian seaside city’s thriving clubbing, art and design subculture. 2SQM was developed in collaboration with a collective of local performance artists, designers and creators. Certified organic Danish-Swiss brand Astalou also launched at Cosmoprof. The company’s stylishly packaged face and body care products focus on organic, high-end luxury and are designed to appeal to a discerning, urban (and well-off) Millennials clientele. The localism trend continues to exert a major influence on the beauty industry, as new beauty brands build on transparency in terms of ingredients, product development and packaging. And highlighting the geographical origins or heritage of key actives adds up to the story-telling. The founders of Italian newcomer Amarey, for example, are from the famous Illy coffee dynasty and the brand’s three face care products are formulated with coffee extract, caffeine and other ingredients that come from food waste. Upcycled coffee ingredients also play a major role in the brand’s packaging: 50% of Amarey’s outer (cardboard) packaging is made from coffee silver skin. The origin of the main ingredients in Japanese bath and body care brand Toyama Quality Water are indicated by the brand name: the Toyama prefecture on Honshu island is famous for the spectacular scenery of the Northern Japanese Alps as well as one of the deepest sea bays in Japan. The brand’s two sub-ranges, Altitude 3000 and Depth 1000, are based on glacier water and deep sea water respectively. Recently launched indie brand Lorj is from the Brittany region of France. The key ingredient in Lorj’s three products is organic barley extract manufactured by brand founder Pascal Drouet in the small town of Ploeuc L’Hermitage. Finnish beauty brand Nobe is slated to launch later this year. With packaging design and product formulations heavily inspired by the Polar landscape and traditional Finnish/Nordic ingredients, the portfolio comprises three skin care ranges that focus on protecting the skin’s microbiome. Sensitive skin care brand Skin Sapiens from the UK launched in 2020 and currently offers 12 face and body care products that are fragrance-free, certfied organic and vegan. The company is also taking transparency to the next level: Skin Sapiens is listing the precise percentages of the different packaging materials on the actual packaging to make recycling easier for consumers. The European nutritional supplements market has been thriving recently, driven by the increased consumer interest in health matters that were generated by the pandemic as well as a growing focus on gut health as the key to physical and emotional well-being. Unsurprisingly, inner beauty was very visible at Cosmoprof Bologna 2023, too. French nutritional supplements brand D-Lab Nutricosmetics has been manufacturing inner beauty capsules and tablets since 2010. Its latest launch is a 3-sku range of powder supplements with marine-based collagen and elastine oligopeptides that can be blended with liquid or creamy drinks and foods. Danish company Vild Nord was launched in 2019 and their speciality is marine collagen which is manufactured from wild-caught cod from sustainable fisheries. In the brand’s collagen powder blends, the fish collagen is combined with various plant ingredients, such as Scottish algae, acerola, wild blueberries, blackcurrant or wild mushrooms. The company’s newest launch are three probiotic supplements to boost immune health. German vitamin gummy brand Ivybears’s newest product launch are Protein Boost gummy bears which also mark the brand’s first foray into the fitness/sports supplements sector: Each fruit-flavoured gummy bear contains 5 gr of proteins, amino acids, creatine and caffeine. High-tech continue to be a major trend in the global beauty industry. Brands tapping into this trend develop innovative devices linked to an AI or base their formulas on innovative ingredients or formats. Swiss indie brand Lycaste was introduced in 2023, offering its customers AI-powered face analysis (through a smartphone or laptop camera) and product recommendations. The brand’s range comprises six face creams with different textures and formulations and six boosters (actives) which can be mixed and matched to create a personalised skin care solution. Lycaste also offers four nutritional supplements as part of its anti-ageing face care range for a holistic inner and outer beauty experience. Amongst new launches of Chinese TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) manufacturer Yunnan Baiyao was a customisable skin care range consisting of three components: lyophilised actives in powder form, a liquid serum and an essence booster. Clients select their favourite of each category (there are six different powders, six serums and four boosters to choose from) and then blend the three components prior to use. Korean high-tech beauty face care brand Franz‘ latest sun protection launch is a true innovation: The Naked SunShield Peptide Patch set contains two ultra-thin patches and a moisturising peptide solution. The peptide solution is applied to the patches and these are then placed on the face wherever additional sun protection is necessary, like the cheekbones or the forehead. The patches are barely visible on the skin and water-resistant (it is even possible to apply makeup on top of them) and the brand claims that they filter out 95.8% of UVA and 99.9% of UVB radiation. Also launched during Cosmoprof, Oxygen Revolution from Italy offers 11 face care products developed in collaboration with various Italian universities and research institutes and contain ozone which is said to help detoxify the skin and improve skin health. Aspects like functionality and gender-neutrality are also playing an increasing role in new fragrance launches. Simultaneously, fragrance layering, which allows customers to create new scent experiences, is becoming ubiquitous. Milan-based fragrance brand Essenza will launch in September 2023. The company’s 6-sku unisex and vegan fragrance range is divided into three fragrance pairs that are built around two key notes each. Although the scents can be worn individually, Essenza’s brand concept was designed to allow customers to freely combine them. French mass market fragrance brand Margot + Tita was launched in 2018 and named after the founder’s two grandmothers. There are around 40 fragrances which are divided into two sections, Margot and Tita, and each Margot fragrance can be combined with Tita or vice versa to create a third, new scent. French aromatherapy perfume brand Solinotes offers plant-inspired and mood-lifting fragrances built around a key scent accord. Amongst the brand’s newest launches are the fresh floral Zen Meadow and the green tea-inspired fragrance Thé Matcha. French natural perfumery brand 100Bon latest launches from 2022 are two functional fragrances: Lâcher prise, a blend of ten essential oils including bergamot, magnolia and santal amyris to help deal with stress; and Doux Rêves, which contains nine essential oils such as orange blossom and petitgrain to improve sleep quality and help when feeling overwhelmed."
India’s ’brown beauty’ make-up influencers go global,"Under the glow of a ring light in the spare bedroom of a Mumbai high-rise apartment, Indian make-up maven Debasree Banerjee has found fans across the world with a simple philosophy: ""brown is beautiful"". Banerjee’s audience includes women from as far afield as the Middle East and United States who also have a deeper complexion but have historically been overlooked by the cosmetics industry. ""I actually have a lot of followers who are outside India, and I feel like it’s probably because our skin tones match,"" Banerjee told AFP. ""They can see how the product looks like on my skin tone, how the lipstick applies on my skin tone, and just have that sense of belongingness."" Banerjee, 34, began experimenting with make-up videos in her spare time a decade ago, after graduating from university and moving to Mumbai to work in sales. She is now a full-time beauty and lifestyle influencer, teaching more than half a million followers how to beautify themselves on Instagram and YouTube. Early inspirations included British beauty content creators Tanya Burr and Fleur DeForce — both white and with millions of followers between them. But Banerjee said she had found no role models who resembled her. She credits Rihanna for the seismic shift towards greater inclusiveness in the cosmetics industry. In 2017, the pop superstar launched her make-up line Fenty Beauty, in partnership with the LVMH group, which offered 40 shades of foundation and turned her into a billionaire. ""Fenty Beauty really, really changed the game,"" Banerjee said. ""I think that’s when people knew that this is important."" While other international brands have tried to keep up, many still have ""miles and miles to go"" before they can be considered truly inclusive, she added. ""I still see products being launched in three shades, in four shades, calling them ’universal’. And it’s just ridiculous,"" Banerjee said. ""In India, everywhere you go... you see our features changing, our language changing, our skin colour changing. So it’s very, very important to have more inclusive make-up."" Cheap internet data, rising income levels and the world’s largest population of young people have fuelled an explosion in India’s beauty and personal care market. The industry is now worth USD 15 billion nationally each year, with Euromonitor projecting that figure will double by 2030. Homegrown e-commerce platform Nykaa — which helped make global cosmetic brands easily available to Indians for the first time — was one of India’s most-anticipated IPOs in 2021. ""People thought brown skin is not pretty,"" Faby, another beauty influencer living in Mumbai, told AFP. ""But now we’ve started learning to love ourselves."" Faby has nearly 900,000 Instagram followers and has established herself as one of India’s top cosmetic stylists, recently teaming up with top Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone to promote a skincare line. Almost her entire apartment has been refashioned into a studio with professional lights, camera equipment and retractable backdrops to stylise her regular online tutorials. The work can be taxing, with some daylong shoots lasting until well after midnight, but the money Faby makes from brand collaborations is enough to comfortably support both herself and her mother. ""It has been difficult, but now I can have my own Dior bag, I can have whatever I want,"" said Faby. ""It’s all because of the followers who are watching."" India’s government belatedly recognised the explosive growth of online content creation last year, announcing a 10 percent tax on promotional gifts worth over 20,000 rupees ($244). That move brought part of the country’s USD 120 million influencer market under the tax net — chiefly those advertising products beyond the purchasing power of the vast majority of Indians. Actually, a single lipstick by a prominent international brand can cost around 2,000 rupees (USD 24) locally — more than what half of India’s households pay for their weekly groceries, according to market research firm Kantar. But the gap between material desires and means has proven to be fertile ground for other Indian influencers showing their audiences how to keep on-trend without breaking the bank. ""There are many people who cannot afford expensive products, so my DIY shows them how to look more beautiful,"" Kavita Jadon, 34, told AFP. From her home a couple of hours’ drive from the capital New Delhi, the housewife and mother-of-two makes videos showing how to make ersatz concealers out of moisturiser and coffee grinds, at a fraction of the cost of name-brand products. Despite filming from a cheap phone, editing with free software, and lacking Banerjee and Faby’s elaborate studio setups, Jadon has amassed more than 169,000 followers on Facebook. Many of her homemade product ideas are the result of painstaking trial and error, with her audience eagerly sharing their own ideas or petitioning her with requests. ""Using products from big brands is not essential — it’s possible to use local products and create beauty products at home too,"" she said. ""That’s why my page has grown so significantly."""
Italy’s cosmetics industry driven by exports,"According to preliminary data unveiled by Cosmetica Italia at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2023, the cosmetics industry in Italy achieved a turnover of EUR 13.3 billion in 2022, an increase of 12.1% compared to the previous year. As expected, the cumulative growth of 2021 and 2022 brought the industry to levels exceeding (by 10.5%) the level reached in 2019, before the pandemic. Looking to 2023, Cosmetica Italia forecasts a growth of 7.7% that should bring the total turnover of the industry to EUR 14.4 billion. In 2022, the growth of the Italian cosmetics industry was driven mainly by exports, which reached 5.9 billion euros, representing a growth of 18.5% compared to 2021. Exports, which represent 40% of the total turnover of the Italian industry, should continue to drive the growth of the sector in 2023, with an expected increase of 10%. The top 3 destination countries for Italian cosmetics in 2022 were the United States, ahead of France and Germany. Non-European countries represent 38% of total exports. Note, within the top 10, the impressive growth of the United Arab Emirates: +60.7% in 2022 compared to 2021. “If questions persist about the availability and cost of raw materials or the increase in energy prices; the sector is solid, mature and competitive,” commented Benedetto Lavino, President of Cosmetica Italia. The trend was positive for the Italian market too, where sales exceeded 11.5 billion euros in 2022, an increase of 8.1% compared to 2021. Mass market remains the predominant circuit (approximately 42% market share), while perfumeries strengthen their second position (19.3%), followed by pharmacies (17%). E-commerce, thanks to the strong acceleration resulting from the lockdowns, has almost doubled in size since 2019, reaching 8.6% of the total Italian cosmetics consumption in 2022. Next come hairdressing (5.1%), herbal medicine (3.3%), direct sales (3%) and aesthetics (1.9%). “The data shows a full recovery and an overshoot of pre-pandemic numbers. At the same time, data are outlining new buying habits, increasingly multi-channel oriented,” analyses Gian Andrea Positano, head of the Centre for Studies at Cosmetica Italia. In the consumer basket, face care (16.4%) and body care (15.3%) products, as well as alcoholic perfumery (13.6%) remain the main categories of the Italian market. The changes in demand between 2022 and 2021 show strong demand for lip care products (+21.4%), face make-up (+18%), alcoholic perfumery (+16.3%) and eye make-up (+11.7%). Further confirmation, according to Cosmetica Italia, of a return to normal sociality after the restrictions imposed by the pandemic."
Toothpaste and shampoo on tap: refill shops are multiplying across the US,"At Mason & Greens in Washington, the lack of packaging is the point — the small shop selling household goods and groceries is among dozens of zero-waste refill stores sprouting up in US cities from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Customers bring their own containers — from used jars to Tupperware, to fill with bulk items. The store even has ""had people bring in the sleeves that their newspapers come in,"" owner Anna Marino, 34, told AFP. Such stores are emblematic of what experts say is a necessary culture shift in one of the world’s largest consumer economies, where the average person generates 4.9 pounds of waste per day, according to government statistics. Marino says the aim is to help anyone from novices to experts on their journey towards less waste, citing paper towels as a personal catalyst. ""Quitting paper towels was one of the first things that my family did and it was a significant reduction in the waste that we were creating on a weekly basis,"" said Marino, who co-founded the store with her husband. Reusable ""paper"" towels made of cloth are just one of the products she now sells at her store, where beans and oats fill wall-mounted dispensers, metal containers hold vinegar and olive oil, and shelves are stocked with package-free artisanal bread, veggies and vegan food. For bulk items, customers pay by weight, Marino’s aim being to avoid any ""obnoxiously outrageous price"" and to keep things ""accessible."" Reusable containers, such as mason jars, can be purchased if needed. Upstairs, shampoo bars and toothpaste tablets that are chewed until becoming paste are among the store’s many unpackaged hygiene products. Less than a third of US municipal solid waste was recovered for recycling or composting in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and only about nine percent of plastic material was recycled. Statistics such as these are why Marino asks suppliers to send shipments in compostable, or minimal packaging. ""We can’t recycle our way out of the plastics crisis,"" says Jenny Gitlitz of the advocacy group Beyond Plastics. She points to toxins in plastic that can be carcinogenic or cause genetic mutations, as well as to endocrine disruptors. On top of that, tiny particles called microplastics have been discovered in virtually every environment, from the Mariana Trench to Mount Everest, as well as in the human body including the lungs and blood. Unlike aluminum and glass, plastic can only be recycled a few times before its polymers break down. And many types are not widely recyclable in the first place. ""If all else fails, then recycle,"" sums up professor Shelie Miller at the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan. ""I think folks often skip straight to the recycle and forget to reduce, reuse,"" she told AFP. Miller cautions that the issue of plastic waste will not be solved simply by individuals changing the way they consume — as exemplified in places like Mason & Greens. Creating a sustainable future ""really is a complete shared responsibility model"" involving corporations, governments and waste handlers, she said. In the meantime, though, Rini Saha — the co-owner of the FullFillery, another Washington-area refill shop in the suburb of Takoma Park, Maryland — hopes to make a difference from the ground up. ""We want you to reuse as much as we can, because recycling is still a huge carbon footprint,"" the 46-year-old told AFP. Saha and colleagues make a number of body care and cleaning products on-site, for refill or purchase in a returnable container. On a recent Wednesday morning, fellow co-owner Emoke Gaidosch, a chemist by training, poured liquid soap she had made into a large receptacle. Aside from the lack of packaging, Miller says bulk sales could yield even bigger environmental benefits by helping consumers buy only what they need. That, ultimately, can help eliminate the impacts from a product’s entire lifecycle, from the energy and resources used to create it, to things like methane released when unused organic waste decays in landfalls. Over three years of existence, the FullFillery has morphed from a farmer’s market stall to a large store lined with environmentally friendly products and extremely limited packaging. Similarly, Mason & Greens’ Washington location, which only opened in September, was an expansion after the success of its first location in another suburb. The model is ""profitable,"" Saha told AFP. ""I don’t think it’s as profitable as a disposable business. But I think that inevitably, there’s no choice. This is the way that business has to go."""
Upcycling: How “waste” is getting a second life in the beauty sector,"From tomato skins and olive pomace to cacao pods, coffee grounds and clementine peelings, the beauty industry is reinventing as it seeks to make something new out of something previously unwanted. Many cosmetics brands are starting to delve into our garbage cans or, more specifically, those of the food industry (even if manufacturers would most likely mention ""by-products"" rather than waste), to concoct the cleansers, creams, serums and makeup removers of tomorrow. Actually, this new interest in waste is also linked to the need for beauty industry companies to reduce their environmental footprint, and to try to meet the new expectations of consumers, who are increasingly in search of ecological commitments. This is something that the My Skin Feels brand is tackling head on, to the point of making waste a core part of its DNA. Born on the beaches of Brighton, on England’s south coast, this beauty brand focuses primarily on organic ingredients from the food and drink industries that would otherwise have been thrown in the trash. And this helps makes each product — currently a moisturizer and a facial cleanser — unique, and sometimes even out of the ordinary. For its two flagship products, the brand used mandarin fruit juice waste, stating that eight kilos of waste give rise to one liter of ingredients, and specifying that it does not add water to its products. But that’s not all, as My Skin Feels also incorporated Italian tomato skins from ketchup waste, packed with antioxidants, as well as oat waste, known for its soothing properties, and waste from olive oil manufacturing, again hailed for its antioxidant properties. It looks like a bold move at first glance, but it’s one that should inspire many cosmetics companies, as the potential of waste seems to be virtually unlimited. The United Kingdom seems to be well ahead of the curve when it comes to turning waste into new resources, as another British brand, UpCircle Beauty, is embracing ingredients destined for the trash. Here, blueberry juice waste, date pits, chamomile stems, discarded spices, or even olive pits make up some or all of the ingredients in its signature products. The brand was founded well before the pandemic, in 2016, and now offers dozens of products. Meanwhile, in France, the Cultiv brand upcycles waste products from French and organic agriculture, particularly the famous ugly vegetables that nobody — or almost nobody — wants to buy. Rooted in French agricultural cooperatives, as the brand explains on its website, Cultiv develops cosmetics based on beets, spinach, wild chicory, flax or rye, in the aim of respecting human health and the planet. But facial and body care products aren’t the only cosmetics looking to the virtues of agri-food waste, since the perfume industry is taking a close interest in the concept. The family group TechnicoFlor, for example, specializes in the creation and manufacture of aromatic compositions, and has developed a collection of eight upcycled fragrances. White wine lees recovered from the deposits generated in wine barrels during the aging process, as well as woodworking waste, clementine peels, cocoa pods or even strawberry waste are all used in the composition of these fragrances, which are developed using leftovers from the food industry. Most recently, French luxury beauty label La Bouche Rouche launched its first line of perfumes: a range of five fragrances containing 30% upcycled ingredients. While Les Fleurs du Déchet, I Am Trash by État Libre d’Orange (2018) was an upcycling pioneer in perfumery."
Social media is elevating the shower to a spa-like anti-stress ritual,"On social media, the shower has become much more than a daily act of hygiene. TikTokers are aiming to make the shower into a ritual that helps liberate the mind. Between fruits, vegetables and detailed body-care practices, TikTokers are rivalling one another with ingenious ways to make a shower more than just a shower. One idea that recently went viral on TikTok, is the Shower Orange, which has accumulated over 4.5 million views. The concept is simple: it consists of eating an orange in the shower in order to benefit from the scent of the citrus fruit in a kind of natural aromatherapy rite. TikToker Makenzy Smith explains the process in a video: ""So when you get in the shower, and you peel an orange, essentially you’re getting all of that delicious aromatic orange citrusy peel. When you mix that in with hot steam, it makes your shower smell amazing."" According to its fans, this spa-like practice helps them release pressure and reduce stress, while as a bonus you don’t have any sticky fingers to deal with. Other TikTok users have shared videos of showering with plants. According to devotees of this practice, taking a shower with aromatic plants suspended in the shower, such as eucalyptus, not only allow you to enjoy the scent, but can also help you breathe better by clearing the airways thanks to the steam of the hot water and the decongestant properties of the plant. Proponents note the spa-like experience and stress relief, and even the sensation of peace. At the beginning of the year, many influencers were touting the benefits of the so-called Everything Shower. As its name suggests, it’s about making a shower an all-in-one experience: body scrub, hair mask, shaving, any and every self-care task is on the list. These intensive showers provide a feeling of being at the spa. The goal is to feel completely clean from head to toe. Although this kind of shower takes time and energy, it’s a very satisfying experience for many of those who undertake such a ritual. One TikToker, named Jenna.Grwm, shows her entire ritual in a video, from hair mask to facial exfoliation to nail care. Despite the lengthy process, she feels it’s valuable. ""The work is so worth it in the end because you feel so much better,"" she explains. These shower rituals may not be new to everyone, but their exposure on TikTok means more are trying them out in a desire to reduce anxiety and daily stress. In fact, a Canadian study published in 2022 established a link between cleaning oneself and stress reduction. To reach this conclusion, researchers from the University of Toronto showed an anxiety-provoking video to more than a thousand adults. After viewing the video, the panel was divided into three distinct groups. The first group watched another instructional video on hand-washing, the second group watched a video on how to draw a circle, and the third group watched a video on how to peel an egg. The group that watched the hand-washing video subsequently showed lower levels of anxiety than the others. ""Daily cleaning behaviour may facilitate coping with stressors like physical risks and psychological threats to the self,"" the researchers concluded."
Men and women would spend one sixth of their lives making themelves beautiful,"While some people may claim to spend only a few minutes primping each day, it appears that the amount of time spent caring for or improving one’s physical appearance is actually much greater. An international group of scientists set out to find out just how much time by analysing data from 93,158 people aged 18 to over 90, from 93 countries, focusing on specific behaviours such as body hygiene, use of makeup or other cosmetic products, hair care, clothing style, physical exercise, and diet. All actions undertaken with the main purpose of improving one’s physical appearance (i.e., not mainly for health reasons). And what they found may surprise you. Published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, this research reveals that 99% of participants spend at least ten minutes a day on all types of behaviours aimed at improving their physical appearance. But in actuality we spend much longer. According to the researchers, women spend an average of nearly four hours a day primping, while men spend 3.6 hours a day on average. Not only does the study demonstrate that these behaviors are universal, but it also shows that they are not necessarily exclusively the domain of women, although they spend some 40 more minutes on their physical appearance on a daily basis. However, the researchers did find disparities according to age, especially among women. Middle-aged women, including those in their 40s and 50s, spend the least time on their appearance. On average, women aged 18 spend 63 minutes more per day on their appearance than women aged 44, while women aged 60 spend 30 minutes more than women aged 44. But age is far from the only predictive factor to consider when looking at these behaviours. The fact of not being in a serious relationship, of having high self-esteem – or on the contrary of not having a positive self-image, or of having a higher socio-economic status, are associated with a higher amount of time spent on improving one’s physical appearance. According to the researchers, the two most revealing factors, however, are the time spent watching television, and even more, so the time spent on social media. ""Most researchers agree that the media often conveys unrealistic physical ideals, that are also often unattainable for the average person. Confronting one’s body with the photo-retouched silhouettes of models may trigger many negative feelings and behaviours, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, body dissatisfaction and eating disorders,"" the study authors explain. These findings corroborate the results of a previous study, published in February 2023 in the journal Psychology of Popular Media, revealing that young people feel better about themselves when they stay away from social networks. Conducted by scientists from the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute in Canada, this study showed that limiting social networking to 60 minutes per day among 17-25 year olds improved their perception of their weight and general appearance compared to unrestricted use."
Fillers and lip lift procedures are on the rise for selfie-oriented youngsters,"Every year the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS) pulls back the curtain on the latest trends in cosmetic medicine and surgery. With more than 2,200 members — facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons — the academy took the pulse on what might be driving patients to get particular procedures. After having embraced injections in order to be able to put forth more wrinkle-free faces during video-conferences, patients of all genders are now keen on touching up their faces with the goal of taking beautiful selfies. Similar to 2021, the number of cosmetic treatments and facial plastic surgery procedures carried out increased in 2022 across all age categories. According to the report, 58% of AAFPRS members reported a rise in bookings and treatments over the past year, with more than three-quarters reporting an increase of more than 10% in demand for these types of procedures. Practitioners surveyed reported that for 16 of the 18 procedures surveyed, with the exception of hair transplants and otoplasty (surgery to diminish ear prominence), most of their patients were women. Another finding is that patients are now increasingly turning to non-invasive procedures, in 82% of cases, and more specifically to neurotoxin injections, such as Botox, dermal fillers, and topical products, such as chemical peels. Preventing or fighting the signs of aging is a priority for patients. When it comes to surgical procedures, facelifts, blepharoplasties (which removes excess skin above the eyelid to avoid the hooded look) and rhinoplasties are the most popular. Rhinoplasty remains the most requested surgical procedure for patients under the age of 34. While the term ’Snapchat dysmorphia’ is often used to explain the boom in certain treatments among younger generations, it’s not backed up by the data. ""Gen Z’s influence in the aesthetic marketplace is not yet generating leaps in facial plastic surgery procedure numbers (and that’s probably a good thing),"" the report’s authors say. Still, nearly three-quarters of the plastic surgeons surveyed cite an increase in the number of patients under the age of 30 for cosmetic surgery procedures and injectables. However, these are essentially preventive procedures to avoid the need for more extensive procedures in the future. It’s for the age group of 35- 55 that ""surgical procedure activity sees significant increase,"" according to this year’s survey. ""In 2022, our members continued to see the impact of the ’Zoom Boom,’ with 79% of respondents naming the ’Zoom Effect’ as a major contributing factor in patients’ desire to seek treatment,"" says Theda Kontis, MD, president of AAFPRS. However, the increase in procedures is also due to an unexpected factor. Dr. Kontis points to the money saved during the pandemic, which is now being used to pay for cosmetic procedures. In addition to the ’Zoom Boom,’ selfie culture is also believed to be at the origin of the increase of certain treatments and procedures. More than three quarters of facial plastic surgeons say that looking better in selfies is clearly a growing trend. A finding that has benefited the upper lip lift, performed by at least 73% of AAFPRS members, up 3% from 2021. But also to blepharoplasty, designed to correct drooping eyelids, which is the second most requested procedure in 2022, just behind rhinoplasty. The fashion and beauty revival of the 1990s and 2000s is also having an impact on the choice of certain aesthetic procedures. The craze for refined and sculpted features, prominent cheekbones, and angular faces has boosted the demand for ’buccal fat removal,’ which consists in removing or reducing the Bichat’s fat pads, located in the center of the cheek. No less than 15% of the surgeons surveyed reported an increase in this procedure which is definitive. It’s a trend that is in contrast to what many surgeons are used to performing as they have long been injecting fat in this area to allow middle-aged women to have fuller cheeks. ""Buccal fat surgery is not reversible–so while you may love the look in your 20s and 30s, as you age, your face naturally loses fat, and therefore volume,"" warns Dr Kontis."
"Powders, a trendy galenic form building up a real ecosystem","After decades of disuse, hygiene and care products in the form of powder are making a comeback. Now that solid products are widespread, this galenic form is booming. Products can be used as such or, increasingly, and extemporaneously, in formulas to be reconstituted. Several young Clean Beauty brands have already seized on the concept, highlighting the naturalness of the formulas and the benefits of reduced packaging. Let’s take the example of Neo By Nature, which was launched last fall. The young brand has developed a shower gel to be reconstituted in a stainless steel pump bottle using compacted powder tablets. The organic-certified formula is composed of 99 % of ingredients of natural origin, and the sleek bottle is infinitely refillable. “For us, the customer benefit is not ecoresponsibility: that is our mission! The benefit should be to have the best possible shower gel. To this aim, we use high-quality natural actives, including a biosaccharide with moisturizing and anti-ageing properties. It’s not a mere shower gel, it is a super shower gel”, says Hector Sentilhes, co-founder of the brand. To achieve the level of efficacy and sensoriality required to compete with conventional liquid formulas, the two founders turned to the expertise of their partner, Fareva, an expert in cosmetics outsourcing. The collaboration resulted in 18 months of development and helped find the right balance in terms of formulas and manufacturing, despite specific constraints. Fareva has 42 production sites, including Le Laboratoire du Bain in France, a site originally dedicated to effervescent powders and bath pebbles. “This business was slowing down because people no longer have baths regularly, but we wanted to showcase our expertise in powder manufacturing and compacting, with formulas that have real functionality. We work with direct-use powders and powders for dilution”, explains Antoine Dubrana, Marketing and Communication Director of the Fareva group. For both solutions, the manufacturer uses his expertise to address identified issues specific to this type of product. “It’s a completely different approach. We use a dry process, so the actives, the surfactants, and everything that makes the formula efficient must be in powder form. It considerably reduces the range of ingredients, which must also generally be of natural, or even organic origin. The same goes for perfumes, oils and colouring agents, which need to be worked on differently, because they are liquid ingredients”, says the expert. “Compaction is complicated with formulas which are not completely dry: we had 1% of perfume added at the time of mixing”, adds Hector Sentilhes. Another important criterion is the powder’s sufficient castability, which helps obtain free flow in the different canals, without sticky effects. “This is one of the most complex and technical points in powder formulation”, says Antoine Dubrana. Powders compressed into tablets to be diluted by consumers involve additional challenges related to the use scenarios. “We need to find the right balance to ensure the powder is well compacted, and dissolution is not too slow for users, since the dilution time is generally of 6 to 8 hours for large sizes, and 3 to 4 hours for pill sizes”, explains Antoine Dubrana. The same remarks were made by Lessonia, an ingredient and cosmetics designer and manufacturer. Already specialized in powder masks to be reconstituted, the laboratory has equipped itself with an industrial tool adapted to powder production, packaging, and compression. It also offers a range of customized products to rehydrate, including shampoos, shower gels, micellar water, and shaving foam in the form of powder, granules and tablets. “We use technologies that take into account powders’ rheology, particle size distribution, behaviour, and flow. Our know-how is based on our ability to mix them, screen them, make them fluid, and package them”, says Charles Henri Morice, Director of Innovation. “Tablets to be rehydrated are getting increasingly popular, because the process is easier for consumers, but they need to dissolve easily, so it’s a real development challenge. Last year, we made an industrial investment to package powders in bottles. More recently, we purchased a tablet press machine, and we’ve been investing in a granulation machine”, adds Lessonia’s Innovation Director. Granules, i.e. powders with a larger grain size, have several advantages, according to the specialist. “With granules, we can solve the issue of fine and volatile powders that might be inhaled. The flow is more fluid, packaging is easier, and the granules are more easily soluble and easier to work with, because there are fewer problems of particle mixture or segregation, which can change the initial composition”, he says. Although the development of powders of any form is still mainly reserved for young independent brands, the approach has many advantages as regards ecodesign. According to a life cycle study conducted by Lessonia, powder shampoo saves half the water, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions of a liquid shampoo. Available in three fragrances – sweet almond, lavender-rosemary-lemon, and bamboo-hemp – the Neo By Nature shower gel is currently distributed on the brand’s website, in 90 Nature & Découverte outlets in France, in some 15 pharmacies, and in several independent stores. A recent fundraising of one million euros will help develop four new products. “They will be bathroom products to be diluted, with a strong focus on innovation. Two of them are concepts never seen before”, says Hector Sentilhes. Fareva has announced a powder deodorant to be rehydrated in a refillable roll-on container for spring. “Major brands have not really focused on this issue yet, because the ecosystem needs to develop, particularly in terms of ingredients providing naturalness and sensoriality. The concept also puts a lot of power in the hands of consumers: they are responsible for the dilution and proper cleaning of the container, and there can be a fear of misuse that backfires on the brand. The implementation of the French no-waste AGEC law, or of the cosmetic eco-score will most certainly accelerate the growth of this form”, concludes Antoine Dubrana."
Trends: Are new male beauty icons smashing skincare stereotypes?,"In order to determine which are the male celebrities that influence men’s beauty routines the most, Humanery’s experts screened a hundred of them, via Google data analysis [1]. As a result, according to the men’s skincare e-commerce platform, two different men with two different styles from two different generations, made the grade as world-class skinfluencers: Paul Rudd and Harry Styles. Paul Rudd clearly stands out, taking first place in the ranking, with no less than 8,400 annual searches associating the American actor born in 1969 with the term ’skincare’. The Humanery ranking suggests that it is a more multifaceted and inclusive form of masculinity — whether in terms of age, body type, or origin — that appeals to the public today. In second place comes Harry Styles (8,400 searches), who, for the past three years, has been breaking down many preconceived ideas in the fashion industry, and has even launched his own gender-neutral beauty brand. He is followed by the British-American actor Andrew Garfield (4,800 searches) and the British actor Idris Elba, who just turned 50. David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, John Legend and Brad Pitt complete the ranking, which is testament to a certain diversity when it comes to skinfluence. ""Our Google study shows that, apart from having great skin, there isn’t one preferred ‘type’ of male celebrity skinfluencer. There is a real mix of ages, skin colors and professions, all encouraging men to up their skincare game. This can only be a good thing, as for years now, more men have needed to take better care of their skin, and if it’s celebrities helping to make that happen, then we’re here for it,"" explains Thomas Watson, a skincare expert at Humanery. Otherwise, the study reveals that searches for ’men’s skin care’ have jumped by 124% in the last three months. In recent years, several personalities have tried to build on the evolution of masculinity codes of by launching their own beauty brands: Harry Styles, of course, with his a gender-neutral cosmetics brand called Pleasing, which includes skincare and makeup, Machine Gun Kelly with a nail polish brand called UN/DN LAQR, and Tyler, The Creator with his Golf Le Fleur line of nail polish and fragrances."
"In the US, menopause finally gets its due","Of course, some of those same celebrities have sought to cash in on an as yet untapped gold mine by offering a range of new products aimed at middle-aged women seeking relief. Naomi Watts, Gwyneth Paltrow and Oprah Winfrey have all recently gone on the record about the symptoms they have experienced. Michelle Obama tackled menopause on her podcast in 2020. ""Over the course of my career as an actor, I’ve outrun tsunamis and come face-to-face with ’King Kong.’ But nothing prepared me for early menopause,"" writes the 54-year-old Watts, explaining that she began noticing physiological changes at age 36. Winfrey, the 69-year-old talk show queen, said her heart palpitations in her late 40s were so severe that she thought she was ""going to die every single night."" ""I went to five different doctors — nobody ever once suggested that it could be menopause,"" Winfrey says, calling for more public discourse to warn women about what is to come, and also to make doctors more aware of the need for better care. Some doctors appear to be woefully unversed on the topic, or simply embrace the old-fashioned notion that it’s a phase to be dealt with and nothing more. Menopause, which marks the one-year point after a woman’s final menstrual period, is actually the end point of a much longer cycle. Perimenopause is the final phase of a woman’s reproductive cycle and is the time when many of the most troublesome symptoms are noticed — from night sweats and hot flashes to insomnia, hair loss, anxiety, heavy bleeding, skin dryness and low sex drive. For some women, this phase can last for up to a decade — hence the need for better awareness, care and consideration. Studies suggest a vast majority of women will experience at least one menopausal symptom in their lifetime. Wen Shen, an associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the co-director of its Women’s Wellness and Healthy Aging Program, says 20 percent of women with symptoms have ""really severe"" issues. Those experiences during perimenopause can ""basically ruin their lives, ruin their ability to focus at work, to concentrate, ruin their relationships,"" Shen told AFP. She is in favor of the movement by showbiz power players to destigmatize the condition especially as, in her view, ""unfortunately, many doctors are not well versed."" ""Traditionally it has been such a taboo. And women were afraid to admit they were in menopause, because it’s sometimes shameful. And it was associated with aging,"" Shen said. ""So I think having glamorous movie stars bringing it out and being honest about it is a good thing."" In 2012, Shen’s team did a survey of all OB GYN residents in the United States and found that the majority of graduating residents ""did not feel comfortable dealing with menopause."" Some respondents had one lecture about the condition, as opposed to months of training about infertility and gynecological cancers. Shen says textbooks have been improved in the last decade, but still says there is ""not enough emphasis"" on teaching the next generation of doctors about an essential phase of a woman’s life. Alongside the need for better medical treatment, investment firms are pouring oodles of cash into products aimed at middle aged women in the various phases of menopause. In October, Watts launched Stripes, which offers ""menopause solutions from scalp to vag."" On offer are lubricants for vaginal dryness, densifying hair masks and probiotic supplements. For years, Oscar winner Paltrow has sold ""Madame Ovary"" — a supplement cocktail of herbs, vitamins and phytonutrients to ""help smooth the menopausal transition."" A month’s supply goes for USD 90 on her Goop website. And retired tennis superstar Serena Williams, 41, recently invested in vegan menopause supplement brand Wile, saying it was ""changing the game for women over 40."" One of the standard treatments for menopause is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which replaces the estrogen that a woman’s body stops making as she ages, addressing key symptoms such as hot flashes and protecting against osteoporosis. Once prescribed regularly, the treatment all but dropped off the map in the United States 20 years ago — the result of a flawed scientific study that sparked panic by suggesting high health risks to women. Shen says better research over the past two decades and assessment of the risks has markedly improved understanding of HRT, leading to its increased use, but she worries about companies offering the drugs over the phone. ""Some of them do advise other forms of treatments that are not evidence-based, have not been researched adequately, that may actually be harmful,"" she warns. Shen suggests that women experiencing serious symptoms ask their doctor to be sent to someone specializing in menopause care, who would be able to prescribe the proper treatment, including HRT."
Is de-influencing the new trend in the fight against over-consumption?,"Are the days of influencers telling us what to buy, what to wear, what to watch and who to follow coming to an end? Since the beginning of the year, the TikTok community, and more particularly Generation Z, has been indicating that they’re fed up with influencers, a communal sentiment that has given rise to the hashtag #deinfluencing. This term currently totals more than 150 million views on the platform. It’s proving particularly popular in the beauty and lifestyle communities, where it reportedly got its start. According to a 2020 Kantar study relayed by Marketing Dive, more than a quarter of the general population has made a purchase based on a recommendation from an influencer. A rate that rises to 44% for Gen Z. However, followers are now more aware of influencers’ marketing strategies. Better informed, they are becoming increasingly vocal about taking steps to no longer be duped. A new wave of videos on TikTok criticize influencers. These videos urge users to carefully consider their purchases and even to refrain from buying and save their money. Their aim is to help other users not fall for a scam or even an over-hyped product that just doesn’t live up to the attention. These videos have given rise to the term ""de-influence."" In a series of videos, TikToker Michelleskildelsky, a self-described former compulsive shopper, lists some of the ""useless"" products that influencers recommend acquiring: Apple AirPods Max, 25 different perfumes, Ugg slippers, a multitude of beauty products... Her videos have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. In the comments, some users suggest cheaper alternatives, while others recognize that they have been guilty of falling for such unnecessary purchases. And there are many videos in this vein. Some people even make a project out of buying products recommended by influencers and setting out to critique them and deconstruct their lack of utility, no holding back. For Kahlea Nicole Wade, a brand collaboration coach and content creator, de-influencing is about trust and reclaiming their power, especially for Gen Z, she told Today. And indeed in certain recent well-publicized cases, some influencers have been called out for being untrustworthy. Such as the ""MascaraGate"" incident involving an influencer being accused of wearing false eyelashes while promoting the virtues of a mascara from L’Oréal. In response to such critiques, some influencers are calling for everyone to take responsibility for themselves and their purchases. France-based Coline, who counts nearly 400,000 followers on her Instagram page, is among them. In one of her recent videos, she argues that followers are all responsible for their own purchasing decisions, and that influencers are ""strangers"" who recommend products so people need to make up their own minds and take their own needs and tastes into account when buying something. Some detractors of this new trend on TikTok point out that not all the messages are not necessarily aimed at reducing users’ consumption generally. Some de-influencers criticize over-hyped products and encourage their followers to buy cheaper ones, as in this video from @alyssastephanie. One thing is certain, however, naivety and ingenuity in the face of social networks are declining a little more."
Record levels for French cosmetics exports,"After 2021, marked by the post-pandemic recovery, the French cosmetics industry maintained its momentum and confirmed the exceptional results recorded in the first months of 2022. With a growth of about 3 billion euros in 2022, exports of made-in-France cosmetics will exceed for the first time the EUR 19.2 billion mark [1] (against EUR 16.2 billion in 2021). According to the French trade association representing cosmetic manufacturers (FEBEA), this +18.8% jump over 2021 will enable France to consolidate its position as the world leader in the sector. In total, almost 2/3 of the French production of perfumes and cosmetics is exported. With a positive balance of EUR 15.6 billion (after deducting imports), the French cosmetics industry is the third largest contributor to foreign trade, after aeronautics (EUR 23 billion) and wines and spirits (EUR 16 billion). The US market was particularly dynamic in 2022, regaining first place on the podium of French cosmetics importing countries, which had been claimed by China last year. French exports to the United States increased by 28% in 2022, to reach EUR 2.3 billion, i.e. an increase of 48.2% over the 2019/2022 period! With a 37% share, EU countries remain however the first export destination for made-in-France cosmetics (+24.2% compared to 2021). In this area, Germany remains the main market: it imports 1.9 billion euros worth of French cosmetics, a figure that is up by 21% compared to 2021. Also worth noting is the very strong growth of the Middle East market (+33.8% compared to 2021). This performance is mainly due to the progression of exports to the United Arab Emirates (+41.8%) and Saudi Arabia (+20.4%). Conversely, China, which totals EUR 1.954 billion in French cosmetics imports, is experiencing a slowdown (+3.1%), due in particular to the health restrictions that struck the country in 2022. With an 8.8% increase compared to the previous year, French cosmetics exports to Asia reached EUR 5.179 billion in 2022, which nevertheless represents an increase of 32% over the 2019/2022 period. According to the FEBEA, perfume, make-up and skincare categories are the main drivers of French exports, accounting for more than 85% of total export sales, i.e. more than EUR 16.5 billion in 2022. The perfumery category posted a staggering growth of 30.2% in 2022. All the other categories also performed well: ""Personal care and hygiene"" products grew by 36.7%, even though they only represent 3.3% of French exports. Emmanuel Guichard, General Delegate of the FEBEA, believes that these good results can be explained by the ability of manufacturers to reinvent themselves to meet the new expectations of consumers, particularly by offering more natural and eco-friendly products. ""This ability to anticipate changes and to constantly innovate is the reason why the sector continues to improve its performance. This is something our federation is very proud of, as it should be for France where, paradoxically, our cosmetic companies, especially our SMEs and MSEs, have to face many difficulties, especially in the mass market channel,"" he concluded."
"Canadian prestige beauty sales rise 25% in 2022, according to NPD","In line with the U.S. sales trends, the prestige beauty industry in Canada ended 2022 as one of the country’s top-performing sectors, according to The NPD Group. Total sales reached CAD 3.4 billion for the year, growing 25%, compared to 2021. With overall market prices continuing to rise, the average price of beauty products rose by 1%, inclusive of promotions, according to NPD. “With a highly anticipated recovery, the Canadian beauty industry performed impressively last year,” said Alecsandra Hancas, Canadian beauty industry analyst at NPD. “Even in the face of higher prices and overall economic uncertainties, consumers were unfaltering. Consumer demand for prestige beauty products remained high. These results are a testament to the importance of beauty products and their important role in making consumers feel good.” With the end of restrictions and social life fully resuming, the makeup category made a strong and highly anticipated comeback, with sales revenue growing 38%, year over year, which is the highest growth of any prestige beauty category. Fragrance sales increased by 24%, and skincare was up 17%. The hair category continued to show strong growth of 27%. The fastest-growing segments were fragrance eau de parfums – marking yet another year of strong consecutive growth as consumers invested in more potent fragrance concentrations – as well as hair products and makeup foundation. Combined, these three segments contributed close to one-quarter of total beauty industry sales revenue gains in 2022. When it came to their makeup purchases, Canadian’s were skin-focused: luminous and natural foundation finishes were among the top share gainers in the makeup category. At the channel level, year-over-year online sales continued to grow in 2022, but brick-and-mortar store sales was the big story. Canadians’ return to in-store shopping was clear, as store sales grew by 34% and accounted for most of the industry’s gains last year. “Looking ahead, we anticipate another year of growth for the Canadian beauty market in 2023, led by increased demand, product innovation, and experiential retail,” said Hancas. “Canadians are excited to get back into stores to interact with brands and touch, feel, and test products. They are also getting out more again, which means putting their best face forward.”"
Three beauty trends spotted at Cosme Tokyo 2023,"The 2023 edition of Cosme Tokyo took place from 11th to 13th January and although the show was smaller than usual – as is the case with many international trade shows at the moment, in particular in Asia – the Tokyo Big Sight Expo Centre was very busy indeed, with 29,500 visitors attending the whole Cosme Week 2023. Here are the three key beauty trends spotted by Premium Beauty News at the event: Japanese consumers are discerning, sophisticated, and well-educated about ingredients and beauty tech, and Asian brands exhibiting at Cosme Tokyo presented the very latest in science-driven cosmetic products. Japanese salon brand Lady Bio introduced its new AI Mist, a water-based multipurpose spray developed in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, which can be used on dry or acne-afflicted skin or troublesome scalps. Jokari presented a face care range formulated with electrolysed reduced water (alkaline ionized water) which is claimed to have detoxifying and antioxidant properties. Korean brand Sam-u showcased its PH Sensitive face care range – each product in the line-up has been formulated with different pH values to most efficiently achieve the desired cosmetic result.  US-Japanese skin care brand Shunly‘s face care range offers products packed with active ingredients such as Q10, fruit acids, niacinamide, and vitamins. Japanese prestige skin care brand Seleia is leveraging microneedle tech in its up-coming Scalp Luxe ST launch. This is a treatment serum for itchy and sensitive scalps, packaged in a pen-shaped tube. The applicator top is covered with tiny, thin, sharp needles that very lightly pierce the top layer of the skin so that the serum can more easily penetrate into the scalp. Salon brand Spa Treatment has also been introducing microneedle cosmetic tech, such as the HAS Micro Patch, an under eye patch saturated with a serum containing self-dissolving microneedle spicules. The market for cannabidiol products (including both supplements and beauty products) is finally starting to take off in Japan. There were at least a dozen domestic CBD brands at the show, with many other Japanese beauty companies also offering CBD products in their portfolio. CBD beauty is still a small category at the moment, as cultural aversion to marijuana remains quite strong in Japan – cannabis has been a prohibited substance for many decades and is viewed as a dangerous drug by many Japanese, especially the older and more rural demographics. However, for younger Japanese living in urban areas, using CBD products has become popular in recent years, particularly amongst consumers in search of stress relief and relaxation. At the time of writing, cultivating hemp and distilling/manufacturing CBD is still heavily restricted in Japan, so domestic cannabis brands usually import their CBD from Europe or the US. However, this situation is set to change soon as it is expected that the Japanese Ministry of Health will review current cannabis legislation this year, making it easier for domestic companies to import and manufacture CBD products. Functional foods and beverages are highly popular in Japan, so many of the CBD products shown at the fair were supplements such as oils, drinks or gummies, positioned as aiding sleep and promoting relaxation. Sikame was launched in April 2022 and offers CBD gummies and various flavoured and unflavoured oils. CBD newcomer brand Pillow sells CBD-enhanced drinks and gummies that are positioned as helping to improve sleep and aid relaxation while Migoto’s Sugoy has just introduced a Botanical Roll-on scented with essential oils to relax and comfort, while Maritime’s portfolio includes five different CBD oil and CBD-infused water. However, there were also a number of CBD brands presenting face, body, and hair care. Chill Moon, for example, offers a CBD-enhanced hair oil, while Maritime’s sister brand Mariélan focuses on CBD face care. Ritto‘s recently launched CBD face and body range is packaged in bright, attractive colours. Another product trend that dominated new product launches at Cosme Tokyo was femtech and femcare, an emerging category with a big potential. At Cosme Tokyo 2023, around half a dozen indie and newcomer brands presented nutritional supplements and CBD products specifically formulated to enhance female well-being while others focused on female-positioned lubricants, intimate washes and lotions. The term femtech usually refers to products and services that focus on all aspects of women’s health, from menstruation products over reproductive healthcare and pregnancy care to menopausal products but also including female sex toys and other well-being products. In Japan, femtech only became a generally recognized concept a few years ago, when period product retailer Fermata  first launched its online store in 2019. Fermata’s period wear, sex toys and other female-positioned products became so popular that the company began selling offline in 2020, offering its curated product range in a new design and lifestyle retail space, New Stand Tokyo, which is located  in Tokyo’s upmarket Roppongi district. And in 2022, Cosme Tokyo’s organizers RX Japan launched the first-ever femtech-focused trade fair, Femtech Tokyo. While it is still highly unusual to find period wear, menstrual cups, vibrators and similar female-focused products in offline retailers, things are starting to change: Matsumoto Kiyoshi, one of the largest drugstore retailers in Japan, rolled out a new retail format in 2015. Matsukiyo Lab is a chain of health, wellness, and beauty focused drugstores that offer products and services aimed at single households. Currently, there are around 30 Matsukiyo Lab stores in Japan – mostly in high-footfall, urban areas – and in 2021, a number of Matsukiyo Labs began selling the female sex toys and intimate care products of Japanese femtech brand Iroha. Femcare brands at the trade show included newcomer brand FI ME KA which manufactures period wear, plant-based intimate hygiene washes and lotions as well as flavoured CBD supplements. One of the brand’s most recent products is a luxurious CBD-based body care cream scented with invigorating notes of bergamot and rosemary. Indie brand Micocochi specializes in CBD products for women, with a product range including a nutritional supplement and two CBD-infused body care products whilst Sex & Beauty’s product range features kegel balls and three intimate serums/lotions designed to make kegel ball exercises for effective and pleasurable. Women’s care manufacturer Hanamisui was at the trade fair with its entire product portfolio, including the recently launched Femiosis range of fermented herbal supplements specifically created to boost women’s health. Another striking Hanamisui launch was the company’s 7-sku colourfully packaged Rainbow23 line of female lubricants, which features different flavours and functional ingredients."
Cold remains one of beauty’s hottest trends,"Since at least 2021, the benefits of cold for the skin have been among the most discussed topics on social networks, with beauty influencers sharing their ice-cold tips that combine the effects of cold with those of well-known skincare ingredients like aloe vera or cucumber. Benefits of cold are well known in the beauty industry. Cold would help burn fat and eliminate toxins, and would also improve blood circulation. On top of that, cold could also act as a decongestant, making it an ideal ally in the fight against puffiness and dark circles. At first, it was a matter of putting creams, masks and other cosmetics in the refrigerator for a few minutes to boost their benefits, but this has now given way to the emergence of new beauty tips and tricks that have propelled ice cubes to the rank of must-have beauty essentials. There are now dozens and dozens of hashtags related to these beauty hacks, totalling several hundred million views on TikTok. Some tips are shared by dermatologists, who also highlight some of the limitations of using ice, especially in terms of skin sensitivity and dryness. On TikTok, skin-icing, which simply involves applying an ice cube to the face, is the most widespread practice, and the most popular (23 million views). But there are now many variations on this theme, such as frozen cucumber, which involves applying frozen cucumber to the face (39 million views), frozen lipstick, which is the same as skin-icing but using an empty lipstick tube (400,000 views), or the frozen beauty blender, which promises to facilitate the application of foundation (9.7 million views). A more recent viral craze is frozen aloe vera, consisting this time of making aloe vera ice cubes to combine the effects of cold with the moisturizing properties of the plant (3.2 million views). So many ideas that have become popular go-to tricks, and which have not escaped the attention of the beauty industry. While it’s always possible to put cosmetics – serums, creams, masks, make-up removers and other products – in the refrigerator to enhance their properties, brands have gone even further in the last few months by offering tools directly inspired by cryotherapy, to be used at home. This started with ice globes at the beginning of 2022, a tool that takes the form of water-filled spheres that are placed in the refrigerator or freezer and then applied to skin. The aim is to soothe the skin and reduce dark circles and inflammation. One year after first gaining popularity, these accessories seem to have a host of fans, with no less than 60 million views on TikTok. But, more simply, massage tools like a jade roller, a Gua Sha or a quartz roller can also be placed in the refrigerator to obtain the same results. And to combine the virtues of cold with other properties, brands now offer cooling masks, roll-ons and cooling-effect sticks, for an even more optimal result. Examples include Charlotte Tilbury’s Cryo Recovery Mask, the Dr. Jart+ Cryo Rubber mask, the Cryo-Freshening stick by Holidermie, the Cryo Anti-Puffiness roll-on from Sothys Paris, or the Akane Skincare Ice Therapy Kit. To combine beauty, pleasure and travel experience, there are now many wellness getaways that focus on the virtues of the cold, whether in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, or France. In Finland, ice swimming – or avanto (’hole in the ice’ in Finnish) – is a traditional ritual known for its benefits for the skin as well as for health, and even for busting stress and generally promoting well-being. On social networks, there are more and more daring influencers that simply get into their swimsuit and slip into one of the country’s countless lakes and rivers for a refreshing blast!"
"Sales of U.S. prestige beauty products grew by 15% in 2022, says NPD","Proving resistant to economic uncertainties, the U.S. prestige beauty market jumped by an impressive 15% in 2022, compared to last year. Beauty products overall experienced consistent revenue growth across both the mass and prestige markets, up 11% when combined; however, only prestige unit demand remained strong. The U.S. prestige beauty market also experienced a greater shift back to stores in 2022, with year-over-year brick-and-mortar retail share growing, while online sales share increased in the mass market. All prestige beauty categories grew by double digits but makeup products (+18%) contributed the most sales revenue gains of the overall prestige beauty market. Lip products was the fastest-growing segment in makeup, with sales surpassing pre-pandemic 2019 levels by double-digits. Lip gloss outperformed lipstick, compared to both 2021 and 2019. Fragrance (+11%) was a standout category in its own right. Building on stellar performance as the industry’s fastest-growing category in 2021, the fragrance market not only maintained this elevated level but continued to grow, led by both higher fragrance concentrations such as eau de parfums and parfums, and higher-end artisanal fragrance juices. In skincare (+12%), body products grew at more than three-times the rate of facial products. Hair (+22%) was the smallest, yet fastest-growing, prestige beauty category, led by masks and targeted treatments. Interestingly, hair care ranked among the fastest-growing segments in the prestige beauty market based on dollar sales growth, whereas hair products like shampoo, conditioner, and hair color landed among the top decliners in the mass channel, based on unit sales. According to NPD, the factors supporting prestige beauty growth — including increased spending from higher income consumers, the redefinition of wellness emphasizing mental health, and an increase in socialization — will continue to fuel positive performance this year. “Looking at the industry holistically, inclusive of the prestige and mass markets, the future outlook for overall beauty is a positive one,” said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. “In an industry steeped in emotion, consumers have demonstrated they are willing to continue to spend on beauty products. Beauty brings joy, which is a universal aspiration and will drive our industry’s resiliency in 2023.”"
Beauty tech gradually expands in the male grooming market,"The rise in online shopping since the first Covid lockdown has pushed many beauty brands to reinvent, and to multiply services available quickly and remotely. This has been seen, from back in 2020, with the rise in virtual makeup testing services and the emergence of virtual sales advisor, both enhanced by artificial intelligence, on a mission to improve the shopping experience online... and in store. Because brands have understood that, while digital technology is obviously essential online, it now appears to be becoming essential in store for a more seamless, and above all personalized experience. Simultaneously, innovations in beauty tech are now landing thick and fast, offering consumers customized experiences accessible in just a few clicks. While these innovations were initially focused on the female beauty market, they are now extending to men’s beauty. It’s a men’s skincare label, Bulldog, that is now innovating in the field of personalization. In the UK, the brand has just unveiled its Skin Advisor, an artificial intelligence-based tool that allows men to get bespoke skincare recommendations. Accessible on the brand’s website, this new tool is easy to use. All you have to do is register online and answer a series of questions about your needs, your skin type, and add a location to take environmental factors into account. Last but not least, a selfie allows the user to perform a complete skin diagnosis remotely. Once all the parameters have been taken into account, users not only get information about their skin, but also a customized skincare routine. This technology is not new, but for the first time, it stands out for its focus on addressing men’s needs, while reflecting the growing interest in skincare for men. For its part, Philips is continuing the global roll-out of GroomTribe, an application for beard care, which allows users to test different styles and obtain shaving advice. A Brazilian version of the app is now available. Finally, Biotherm announces the upcoming launch of a version adapted to men of their virtual skin diagnostic tool Skin Diag. According to a report by Persistence Market Research, demand for men’s skincare products grew by 5.7% between 2017 and 2022 worldwide, and is expected to continue to rise by 2033, with an annual growth rate of approximately 7.5%."
"South Korea make-up market to renew with growth, finds GlobalData","The South Korean make-up market is set to expand at a healthy pace in the coming years, spurred by increasing public outdoor mobility, high product innovation, and rising online sales. Moreover, a strong celebrity culture is contributing to the expansion of the consumer base, and encouraging South Korean men to embrace makeup in their beauty routines. Against this backdrop, the South Korean make-up market is projected to rise to KRW2,827.8 million (USD 2.5 billion) by 2026, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% over 2021-2026, says GlobalData. According to a recent report [2] by the a data and analytics company, the face make-up category will register the fastest growth over the forecast period, followed by the lip make-up category. “Spurred by Korean pop music, movie, and TV celebrity endorsements, and the availability of innovative Korean Beauty (K-Beauty) products, South Korean men are spending more on make-up products. With the authorities easing the COVID-19 restrictions in 2022, consumers began leaving their homes more often for work, studies, leisure, socializing, shopping, and other activities, thereby giving rise to more occasions for applying make-up. Moreover, the increased penetration of online beauty retailers bolstered sales of cosmetics,” said Suneera Joseph, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData, in a statement. The per capita expenditure (PCE) on make-up in South Korea increased from USD 9.6 in 2016 to USD 18.1 in 2021, surpassing the regional average of USD 2.4, and the global average of USD 3.9. GlobalData forecasts South Korea’s PCE on make-up to surge to USD 23.9 by 2026. Amorepacific Corporation, LG Corp, and The Estée Lauder Companies were the top three companies in the South Korean make-up market in value terms in 2021, while The Face Shop and Sulwhasoo were the leading brands. E-retail was the leading distribution channel, followed by health & beauty stores, and direct sellers. “Going forward, the rising consumer interest in clean beauty will bolster demand for make-up products containing natural and organic ingredients that are perceived to be gentle and more effective than harsh chemicals. As a result, domestic and multinational manufacturers are expected to roll out innovative products with natural and sustainable ingredients with the effectiveness of regular chemical formulations. However, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and rising inflation can derail the recovery of the South Korean make-up market in the immediate future,” concludes Suneera Joseph."
Euromonitor reveals top 10 global consumer trends in 2023,"The global market research company notes that consumers spending responsibly but emotionally, the role of digitization in purchasing processes, female equality demands, and a disruptive Gen Z, are some of the factors that will define global consumer trends in 2023. The rise of the cost-of-living and the environmental crisis appear as two key drivers of consumer behaviours. Budgeteers and Eco Economic – two of Euromonitor’s top 10 global consumer trends in 2023 – are a direct result of this double evolution. The 10 key trends that Euromonitor outlines in its Global Consumer Trends 2023 report are: – Authentic Automation : Humans and machines need to be in sync to deliver meaningful solutions. Emotional connections are not to be underestimated, and tech benefits should outweigh the need for personal interactions to create a seamless experience. – Budgeteers : Cost of living crisis is undermining purchasing power for consumers. Saving money is top of mind. In 2022, 75% of consumers did not plan to increase overall spending. – Control the Scroll : People are still wed to their devices, but screen time is more selective. Consumers want an efficient and curated digital experience. – Eco Economic : Consumption behaviours are less about acquisition and more about reduction, which positively impacts the planet. 43% of consumers reduced their energy consumption last year. – Game On : Gaming has become an entertainment leader and has transcended the generational divide. This once-niche segment is now a mass-market opportunity. – Here and Now : Flexible solutions are expanding purchasing power and relieving cost pressures to help consumers spend on happiness. In the short-term, ‘joy’ is a purchase motivator. In 2022, buy now pay later reached US$156 bn lending value. – Revived Routines : ‘Post-pandemic’ is here. Consumers are eager to rediscover the world, despite uncertainties ahead. 39% of consumers said more of their everyday activities will be in person over the next five years. – She Rises : Consumers refuse to remain silent on gender inequality. Fair representation, equity, and inclusivity are at the forefront of women’s purchase decisions. – The Thrivers : Fatigue is setting in as consumers navigate a chaotic world with exhaustion at an all-time high; they are putting personal needs above all else. 53% of consumers had a strict boundary between work or school and personal life in 2022. – Young and Disrupted : Gen Z stand up for their beliefs and put themselves out there. These consumers are immune to traditional advertising. Authenticity and social impact make a difference. “The past few years have been anything but ordinary, and 2023 will be no exception”, says Alison Angus, Head of Innovation Practice at Euromonitor International. “Companies should expect quite divergent behaviour as consumers cope with ongoing challenges while getting back in their stride.”"
Clean beauty: A nebulous concept in search of a definition,"Originating well before the Covid-19 pandemic, the “clean beauty” movement has boomed with the consumer craze for natural and organic cosmetics, that would be respectful of health and of the environment. Both brands and retailers stand for this reassuring notion, which is also a possible way to win the favour of increasingly committed and uncompromising younger generations. Actually, the concept is promising at a time when the public is particularly attentive to what they apply to their bodies, and what they throw (or don’t throw) in the trash, seeking out more natural ingredients, eco-responsible packaging, and transparency. The important fact remains that clean beauty is not yet defined. The notion appears to have come about in the 1990s, while the specific term emerged in the 2000s, at the same time as certain cosmetic brands became references in the field, such as Tata Harper, Drunk Elephant, and Goop, and specialised retailers such as Credo Beauty or The Detox Market. On the model of ""Clean Eating"", the concept tended to refer to cosmetics free from harmful or controversial ingredients, at a time when many American consumers – driven by public action groups such as the Environmental Working Group (EWG) – were wondering whether certain ingredients banned in Europe could be used in the United States. Indeed, the European regulation on cosmetic products [1] — usually presented as the strictest in the world – contains in its Annex 2 a list of prohibited ingredients and substances as long as your arm. Which is far from being the case in the United States. However, even in Europe, ingredients authorized by regulations are sometimes criticized. And to reassure consumers, some brands voluntarily blacklisting them from their formulas and those who claim to go the furthest in this direction then say they are “clean”. And as everyone is confused, digital solutions such as Beautylitic and Clear Formula are helping brands and retailers to see things more clearly! And as we’re still far from the total transparency much sought after, shoppers are also turning to digital apps. From Yuka to INCI Beauty to QuelCosmetic or Clean Beauty, there are countless solutions designed to analyse and evaluate the content of creams, scrubs, serums, makeup removers and the likes. But the apps themselves are struggling to keep up! Indeed, adding up complexity to the concept, Clean Beauty gradually took on a green hue… especially in Europe! As a result, more and more brands are now paying particular attention to the use of natural — sometimes organic — ingredients, and to the reduction of excess packaging. Solid cosmetics, refills and bulk buying, not to mention holistic beauty, are all trends that gravitate around the clean beauty concept. Despite this vagueness (or thanks to it), Clean Beauty has captivated people all over the world. It’s clear that the pandemic has reinforced the appeal of natural and organic cosmetics, with a boom in green skincare. On Instagram, the term ""clean beauty"" has already resulted in nearly 6 million posts to date, while it has generated no less than a billion views on TikTok — not counting the many associated hashtags. This interest has already sparked many beauty trends, like the ""Clean Girl"" aesthetic, celebrating a minimalist routine, but also ""clean"" makeup. Today, there are few new skincare brands that do not claim to be clean, and clean perfumery is also taking off. As for heritage brands, they are slowly but surely reinventing their formulations to adapt to this demand. If a few private seals try to emerge, it is unlikely that the notion of Clean Beauty will ever be truly clarified. Actually let’s not forget that “to be unambiguous can only be to one’s own detriment!”"
"Asia, the new promised land of alternative perfumery?","""Today, Asia is a bit like Russia in the 2000s, when By Kilian was a huge success. Similarly, this strong potential for niche brands can be found there, even if the market is not as accessible,"" explains David Frossard, the founder of Liquides and Différentes Latitudes. It is estimated that 2.5% of people wear perfume in China, a figure to be put in perspective with a population exceeding 1.4 billion people in 2022. ""It is a fast-growing market, with huge growth potential. Asia now accounts for 50% of global luxury sales. If China remains a key but still complex market, South Korea on the contrary is a captivating country, a trendsetter, with high purchasing power,"" explains Jean-Baptiste Roux, President, and co-founder of J.U.S, which opened its first corner store in the Lotte department store, in Seoul, last March. ""With a strong craze for beauty, Korea is a key market to access Asia,"" says Benoît Verdier, co-founder of Ex Nihilo. The brand is also present in Taiwan, with five POS and its own store. ""It’s a more mature country, where prestige perfumes are appreciated, with a sophisticated clientele that travels a lot and has a very good standard of living,"" says the founder. He believes that Korea and Taiwan are two strategic countries for expanding in Asia, because ""Chinese people pay a lot of attention to them."" The Chinese market, of course, remains more coveted. Far from stereotypes, China has a fresh look on niche perfumery, with ""enthusiastic consumers, curious and fond of novelties"", explains Florence Bernardin, founder and manager of Asia Cosme Lab. Less aware of brand hierarchies, Chinese consumers are less ""formatted"", an opportunity for designers who can enjoy real freedom of tone. Apart from novelty, Ex Nihilo is focusing on authenticity, service and personalization to appeal to Chinese consumers. ""Consumers are ready to pay the price to have a rare and exclusive product. It’s a younger consumer base, with more purchasing power than their elders, who want to assert themselves by breaking the codes,"" explains Sylvie Loday, co-founder and CEO of the brand. ""Even if China’s appeal for perfume were to remain a niche, it would still be four times greater than other markets,"" says Philippe Solas, co-founder of Une Nuit Nomade. ""At a time when Russian, American, and European markets are experiencing difficulties, and the Middle East is a bit saturated, the Asian continent is synonymous with power and stability,"" he continues. Less difficult to penetrate than China, South Korea also suffered from strict confinement measures for two years. ""In this country, duty-free sales used to be very strong, but this trend was stopped along with Covid, and the end of tourist stops, while this practice represented 70% of brands’ sales. The question is whether this ecosystem will return to normal or evolve into a new form,"" points out Sylvie Loday. ""But it is also one of the richest countries in the world, where there are no cultural barriers, and where a curious public enjoys consuming and exposing itself,"" explains David Frossard. A perfect setting for establishing the concept of Liquides in Seoul. Located in the golden triangle of Cheongdam, near the Dior and Vuitton boutiques, the ""perfume bar"" was created thanks to a partnership with the Hyundaï Group. It is also available in the form of seven shop-in-shop concepts in the Group’s department stores and distributes brands such as BDK, Frapin, Obvious, and Carine Roitfeld. Meanwhile, China is increasing the number of obstacles to accessing its market. ""One of the main barriers to setting up a business is the registration formalities, which are costly and tedious,"" notes Jean-Baptiste Roux. ""This prerequisite, which can take almost a year, and cost 1,500 to 2,000 euros per product, has fortunately become more flexible since tests on animals are no longer compulsory,"" he continues. Apart from the administrative burden, ""it is a highly prized market for large groups, who spend huge amounts of money on rent, animations, and events. As a matter of fact, everything is expensive,"" adds Sylvie Loday. Another major difficulty is understanding the Chinese market ecosystem and knowing how to adjust its communication. ""It is crucial to propose a targeted storytelling, thought out beforehand, before establishing. A brand cannot simply think it will be enough to enter this market by imposing its vision of French luxury,"" insists Philippe Solas. ""It is a customer base unlike no other, which is self-sufficient from a digital point of view, and whose social networks must be conquered locally,"" analyses Benoît Verdier. To deal with the time-consuming formalities specific to the Chinese market, some brands resort to cross-border methods, like J.U.S or the brands sold by Liquides. ""Chinese consumers buy a lot online (50%), so we ship our products from France or a free zone, which allows us to sell and promote the brand,"" explains Jean-Baptiste Roux. Others favour a longer-term strategy. ""You have to start from scratch to set up in China,"" analyses Sylvie Loday. ""Online sales are very popular, like on sites such as Tmall. It’s a tempting way in, but it’s also a dangerous one, as it relies on numerous promotions and discounts. In the end, this can weaken the brand, because this customer base is very volatile. The use of digital marketing is of course impossible to avoid, but it is essential to combine it with a physical presence. You have to take the time to develop the brand in this new market, even if it means favouring neighbouring countries,"" adds the CEO of Ex Nihilo. This is a long-winded task that, according to Philippe Solas, also requires working with the right partner to get to grips with the specifics of the Chinese market. After an upstream analysis of the codes of the Chinese community, the brand Une Nuit Nomade recently sealed a partnership with the Centdegrès Agency to support its development. The brand has adopted a Chinese name that reflects its philosophy to align its communication with the Chinese market. The storytelling of some references has also been reworked. ""The nationalistic component in Chinese business is very important, and the community could very well, in the long term, focus solely on local brands. Hence the importance of having discourse and visuals adapted to its culture, thanks in particular to the expertise of an agency like Centdegrès,"" analyses the head of Une Nuit Nomade. Diptyque has successfully established itself in China over the long term, after opening its first outlet in 2014. The brand has managed to make its mark by enhancing its know-how and enriching its offer with details adapted to the local culture, without abandoning its identity. Just like L’Artisan Parfumeur, which has based its success in China on limited editions for the Chinese New Year. While the complexity of a market such as China can be a hindrance, other Asian countries offer good prospects. This is the case of Japan, which is very attractive according to David Frossard, because its customers - who have long been considered as not very receptive to perfume - are fond of trendy and creative concepts, and therefore very open to alternative brands. To be continued."
How TikTok disrupts traditional perfume codes,"Far from the dreamy and fantasised universe often put forward by brands, on TikTok, content creators openly talk about perfumes, often with marked opinions, and make fun of the supposed seductive powers of juices. They describe with a great deal of spontaneity and authenticity the scent, the colour, they share childhood memories, and sometimes stories (hashtag #perfumehistory has nearly five million views), far from the codes of the category, disregarding traditional segmentations and traditional retailing channels. TikTok’s video format takes perfume into a new visual universe with bottles put forward by content creators who are in constant competition and completely disconnected from brand communication issues. Under the hashtags related to perfume, there are mostly videos of reviews of various fragrances, highlighting their key notes and the praises or successes they brought to the nose or the creator of the video. There are also a number of Top 5s and Top 10s along with every possible type of ranking. One of the recent trends is to display one’s perfume collection in a video: the hashtag #perfumecollection has now reached 373 million views! Hence, many users like to share their passion for perfume and present, bottle after bottle, their collection, or show their collections, with products sometimes classified according to the shade of the bottle or the juice. Colour plays a key role in this media where attention must be caught in a few seconds. It’s not surprising after all that TikTok likes red, which gives videos an immediate sparkle! Tom Ford’s ""Lost Cherry"" (18.3 million views), Givenchy’s ""L’Interdit Rouge"", Jo Malone’s ""Scarlet Poppy"" (11k views) and Baccarat’s ""Rouge 540"" (194.3 million views) are all widely promoted by the platform’s active perfume fans. This is also the reason for the success of perfumes with sculptural and spectacular bottles, such as those by Paco Rabanne or Carolina Herrera. TikTok is also bringing miniatures back into fashion, with 3.4 million views for the hashtag #MiniaturePerfumes. This is an opportunity for users to highlight their favourite miniature vials. The power of the social network can also help reshuffle the deck in a world where brand awareness is a major asset. As in other beauty categories, a video that goes viral with powerful emotional content can boost sales of an otherwise unknown fragrance. One of the most famous examples being the sudden success of Missing Person, from the US brand Phlur, created by influencer Christelle Lim. On TikTok, unlike most commercials, the focus is on the scents and - above all - the impact they produce. People talk about the emotions they trigger, the memories they bring to mind, the substances they recall. Perfume ingredients are more rarely mentioned, except when they clearly emerge from the fragrance. The social network has also become an important vector for the dissemination of new gestures. The most striking example is certainly that of layering. Common in the Middle East, this practice - which consists of applying layers of different perfumes - has long struggled to spread to other markets. On TikTok, the hashtag #layeringperfumes now has more than 363 million views, and is teeming with videos of users revealing their current combinations, like @rebeccazeidenberg94, who suggests, for example, combining for an evening, two drops of Shaghaf Oud, by Swiss Arabian, with a spray of L’Interdit Rouge by Givenchy. The same female tiktoker also proposes to combine one’s fragrances with vintage handbags... But TikTok is not only disrupting the category’s traditional communication and practices. On their favourite network, the Gen Z is also on the hunt for perfume ""dupes"" (i.e. duplicates, products with characteristics similar to those of other more expensive products). The hashtag #perfumedupes has crossed the 114 million views mark. For instance, a significant number of videos with tens of millions of views compare certain perfumes from Zara with the much more expensive products of selective perfumery brands. A trend that can only encourage the common - and often criticised - practice in the perfumery world of using best-selling juices as inspiration to launch similar fragrances. But on this subject, where there is a fine line between inspiration and imitation, comparison and parasitism, and where the industry has for years fought the practice of correlation tables, brands are both cautious and suspicious: delighted when they benefit from a flattering comparison, much less when their sales suffer from it. However, the craze for perfume dupes should not lead us to believe that investment in innovation, creativity and brand image has become futile. The perfume story on TikTok serves as a reminder of the extent to which emotion is a powerful sales vector, and that it must above all be based on values of sincerity and authenticity."
"Wrinkles, imperfections, firmness: Skincare leads the way in beauty trends","The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly changed beauty habits, but it’s not the only factor at play. Social networks — TikTok and Instagram in the lead — have quickly become major trendsetters, whether in skincare or makeup. However, while users are having a blast sharing increasingly elaborate beauty looks and techniques, it’s skincare that’s really appealing to people on a daily basis. The goal is to achieve a flawless complexion to avoid having to apply endless layers of makeup. On TikTok, the #skincare hashtag already has some 138 billion views, reflecting the public’s infatuation with skincare, especially among younger people. It is now a question of structuring beauty routines around prevention, whether to get rid of imperfections, or to protect skin from pollution or the harmful effects of UV rays. The focus is on tailor-made skincare products based on effective and natural ingredients, based on the concept of holistic beauty, which encompasses cosmetics and wellness. Wrinkles, blemishes and sagging skin seem to be of particular concern to consumers around the world, regardless of their age. According to the first ever Beauty Trends Report from the beauty platform LookFantastic [1], salicylic acid was the most popular beauty ingredient of 2022. The ingredient was the subject of an average of 60,500 searches per month, and its hashtag had no less than 370 million views on TikTok at the end of 2022. Consumers aim to camouflage wrinkles, fine lines and dark circles, but also to fight against sagging skin. As such, collagen was the second most popular ingredient, with more than 60,000 monthly searches on average, and nearly 2 billion views on TikTok in 2022. It was followed by retinol (49,500 searches, 2.4 billion views); hyaluronic acid (49,500 searches, 760 million views), which is popular as an anti-wrinkle ingredient; and vitamin C (49,500 searches, 2 billion views), which is a major ally for dull and acne-prone skin. Throughout the year, TikTok has become the new incubator of beauty trends, allowing users to express their creativity. Countless techniques have made their ’appearance’ on the social media site in 2022, starting with ’brow lamination,’ the most popular beauty trend of the year with no less than 49,500 monthly searches, on average, and a hashtag viewed 1.5 billion times. The focus of this technique is getting perfectly shaped and especially full, bushy eyebrows, so you don’t have to use makeup to fill them in. This beauty treatment comes ahead of other, such as microblading (49,500 searches, 2.9 billion views), eyelash serums (12,100 searches, 530 million views), and ’soap brows’ (12,100 searches, 350 million views). Generally speaking, it seems that the most popular beauty techniques are those that seek to reduce the time spent in the bathroom, as well as the layers of makeup used to compensate for what can be perceived as ’flaws.’ But TikTok is not only a trendsetter. The social network can also send the popularity of certain beauty brands soaring. This is the case of Charlotte Tilbury which, although already successful before the TikTok era, is now the most popular brand on the media. The brand saw no less than 450,000 monthly searches in 2022, while its hashtag has been viewed 1.7 billion times. The same goes for The Ordinary, the most popular skincare brand of the 2022, according to LookFantastic. According to the report from the British platform, the brand is the subject of an average 135,000 monthly searches, and its hashtag has no less than 2 billion views on TikTok."
The age of connection: 5 predictions for 2023 and beyond,"According to the beauty trends agency, consumers are discovering strengths that they never knew they had. They are more resilient, more adaptable and more connected than they ever realised. And if recent global events have proven anything, it is that health, freedom, and the future of the planet are all deeply interwoven.  The success of one relies on the success of another. “Our future is symbiotic. And yet, the desire for individual recognition and expression remains a prescient driver.  As we move forward, consumers will continue to explore the special tension that exists between collective responsibility and personal growth, and between the quest for the optimised self and for globalised empathy,” explains Leila Rochet, Chief Innovation Officer, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation. Armed with increased knowledge, consumers will drive brands even harder to alter their behaviours in order to support rigorous ethical practices. In 2023 brands must become empathetic ambassadors, and respond to a new generation of eco-socio intellectuals. Results from the 2022 UEBT Biodiversity Barometer demonstrate there is now a global consensus that while planetary health is a clear priority in the minds of consumers, so are issues surrounding workers’ rights and equality. Sustainability issues are now rightly being understood in the context of wider geo-political events. French brand Eclo, for instance, only works with ingredients that are local to its Brittany HQ and which also help regenerate the soil and the seabed. Taking a collective responsibility approach, Indigenous-owned brands often balance respect for nature with individual growth. Operating within this type of intrinsically holistic value system The Yukon Soaps Company thus uses native, wild botanicals hand-picked by elders and local young people. The brand teaches harvesting practices that foster an emotional connection to the land. Gen Z’s takeover of social media has created a space where niche is the norm, and micro-expressions are the new mainstream. This mindset shapes a new generation of beauty connoisseurs, who bring a fine art approach and an exacting attitude to the beauty sphere. As consumer confidence grows and their skills continue to develop thanks to the TikTok explosion, we see a growing desire to express individuality through exquisite artistry. Brands that speak to individuality and trigger creativity through wild innovation will gain traction. Harry Styles’s Pleasing inspires consumers to master micro-artistry, coupled with an approach that is embracive of every identity. Its ultra-inclusive storytelling paves the way for a “Flat Age Society” where traditional age segmentation has diminishing influence. Pleasing also encapsulates another key element - escapism. Younger generations are facing global challenges with a practical mindset, leaning into science and technology to forge world-changing solutions. STEM careers (science, technology, engineering and maths) are now the #1 attraction for Gen Z, according to a recent study, with particular popularity among females and people of colour. Brands must embrace this appetite for innovation. Combining their experiences at Tesla and the École Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne (ECAL), Aeir founders have created a new generation fragrance. More brands invest in bio-sciences to deliver smart, and green, solutions. In 2022 we saw Ulé (France) and Monday Musem (South Korea) lead the way with the adoption of vertical farming techniques. We are entering an era of intimately adaptive beauty that responds to the individual or is tailored specifically for individual needs. The continued fetishization of health and immunity will drive the creation of unexpected territories, ushering in new opportunities for beauty supplements, skin-optimising trackers, AI-aided personalization, and at-home beauty devices that deliver ultra-bespoke and professional results. In fact, consumer interest in beauty tech is set to continue to increase continuously over the next five years, reaching $8.93 billion by 2026. Beauty that delivers emotional benefits on top of functional benefits will gain traction, as consumers look to balance feelings of vulnerability with products and experiences that simultaneously provide care and protection. The role of functional fragrances will become heightened, as consumers and brands explore the idea that perfume can deliver benefits that go way beyond scent. This is an idea explored by American light artist James Turrell who has developed a collection of crystal light panels and perfumes for Lalique, which play on the abstract concept of the light we see in our dreams. Beauty imbued with cerebral and cognitive influence will play to the growing brain care category. Brain health supplements are forecast to grow at a CAGR of 8.3% from 2022 to 2030, as consumers explore new routes to optimise mind-care. Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation will explore these key trends in details at their Inspiration Bar and the Beauty Talks hosted by Leila Rochet during the next edition of MakeUp in Los Angeles, on February 16 & 17 2023.

PSYCARE: The emergence of a new beauty category,"“As mental health issues increasingly affect consumers worldwide, PSYCARE will eventually evolve into a beauty category of its own,” says Michael Nolte, SVP Creative Director at Beautystreams, adding: “In the beauty industry, we have the unique opportunity to bring moments of joy and a piece of mind to the lives of many individuals.” As one response to the “perma-crisis,” consumers seek out beauty and personal care that offer an experience which is more profound and which goes beyond the aesthetic, amplifying the effects of the time that they spend on themselves. They’re interested in beauty products and routines that can enhance their well-being, improve their psychological health, address stress, and quiet a racing mind. According to a survey released in January 2022, when asked “what areas will be important to you in the next 12 months?” the most common answer was “mental wellness,” chosen by 65% of respondents. Meanwhile, “stress management/relaxation/sleep” was the fourth most-popular response, highlighted by 59% of those surveyed. This prioritizing of mental health is translating into a holistic approach to beauty, as brands actively seek to lift consumers’ mood and spirit. Brands tap into treatments that draw on ancestral and holistic medicine – cue adaptogenic herbs or taking inspiration from the phases of the moon – to create a feeling of well-being and being grounded in one’s body. Loneliness, too, is transforming from a taboo topic into an issue that’s being directly addressed, whether through purposefully building a community around a brand or crafting scents that can positively impact one’s emotional state. Beauty routines are a powerful ally in helping perpetually distracted consumers to focus on themselves, via rituals and self-care treatments that create a moment of relaxation. In a bid to weave together the aesthetic, physical, and psychological spheres, beauty brands are emphasizing treatments and products that soothe both the body and mind. These concepts often draw on traditional remedies and ancient wisdom, thereby linking the consumer – and the brand – to something larger that transcends time, that has a resonance beyond the individual. Depending on the slant taken, this can bring an almost spiritual dimension to a treatment, creating a feeling of healing on every level. One potential source of that emotional support is psychedelics, which are creating a buzz in mental health for their potential in treating myriad psychological conditions. There’s also scope for them to make their way into beauty and wellness. From skin and personal care via color cosmetics, men’s grooming, and fragrance to hair care, all beauty categories will be driven by the PSYCARE movement in the upcoming years, confirming the beauty industry’s essential social function. More than just a superficial fix, make-up and hair color are important factors contributing to mental well-being. Color can directly affect our brains, and the concept of “dopamine color,” already trending in fashion and interior design, will increasingly find its way into the beauty color categories, as well. For many consumers putting on make-up or coloring their hair is turning into a mindful self-care routine. Skin and personal care will continue to evolve towards well-being rituals. While the categories are expected to remain functional and results-oriented for most of the time, consumers will also use them as a vehicle for momentary premium body and skin rituals on weekends and special occasion to celebrate mental well-being or to simply forget their stressful lives for just a moment. The role of fragrance also gradually evolves. While previously, comparable to fashion, the main functions of fine fragrance were self-expression and social status, over the last years the role of fragrance evolved towards feel-good moments and psychological well-being. This explains the rising demand for home fragrance and niche fragrance brands. Today, showing off a social status through fashion or perfume is considered indelicate. New essential functions of premium perfumes are to feel in harmony with oneself and to boost mental wellness and self-confidence. A special symposium dedicated to PSYCARE on January 31, 2023 Beautystreams will explore how PSYCARE will influence the skin care, color cosmetics, hair care, and fragrance categories for an entire afternoon.

Trends: ’Status skin’ is the minimalist beauty routine getting love on TikTok,"The pandemic put a stop to the use of contouring products and high-coverage foundations. And if some people thought that the return to normal life would mean the return of full makeup, it’s clear that skincare was the star of 2022, and it’s a trend that’s only just beginning. For proof, look no further than ’status skin,’ a beauty trend on the rise on social networks, characterized by a combination of makeup and skincare. The aim is to let skin breathes, and to highlight it, rather than camouflage what have been referred to as ’imperfections’ in the past. Many beauty micro-trends emphasized a natural approach over the last year, but this time it’s about reintroducing makeup into one’s routine without overdoing it. ’Status skin’ is still based on looking after one’s skin, and especially on prevention, in order to enjoy a healthy complexion without having to resort to a slew of various concealers, foundations, and contouring products. Moreover, it’s no longer a question of hiding dark circles, bags and other pimples with multiple layers of covering products… In terms of beauty routines, this translates into essential skincare products, including serums, to create a healthy glow, as well as tinted moisturizers or creams. Forget about mattifying and high-coverage foundations, and focus on light, sheer and airy textures that will provide a discreetly sunkissed look. The goal is to highlight the skin, not to camouflage it under layers of makeup. This is reminiscent of the BB and CC cream era, except that the level of skincare has gone up a notch with multifunctional products that will perform several roles — makeup, moisturizing and anti-aging, for example. This trend also puts an emphasis on facial massages of all kind, whether known for their anti-aging benefits like Kobido, or for boosting radiance in one’s complexion, as well as on tools that allow beauty fans to enjoy their benefits at home. Gua sha, jade roller, massage roller, and ice globes are progressively becoming bathroom essentials... But if there is one particular market that is growing at a rapid pace, it is that of facial massagers. These tools, which can combine massages, skin cleansing, light therapy treatments, and anti-aging treatments, are a hot commodity among appearance-conscious consumers. Not only do they provide the skin with the care it needs on a daily basis, but they have also been designed to offer users a moment of relaxation. This famous all-in-one product seems to be a favourite of those looking for a holistic approach. Complexions aren’t the only body part that will benefit from high attention in 2023, as hair is also set to be pampered with a complete routine modelled on that of skin. Scrubs, anti-blemish treatments, exfoliating brushes, nightly treatments, exfoliating shampoos, and micellar shampoos will be among the year’s beauty essentials. In 2023, prevention has grown more important than ever when it comes to beauty, as it is designed to allow for an increasingly minimalist and natural routine."
France: how solid cosmetics are gaining ground in beauty hygiene departments,"Before 2019, there were almost no references of solid cosmetics in supermarkets. Three years later, the situation has changed a lot, with a rise in value of +17%. This increase can be explained by the arrival of beauty giants on this segment, like Garnier, Dop (L’Oréal), Nature Box (Henkel), but also Nivea (Beiersdorf), Sanex (Colgate-Palmolive), or Corinne de Farme (Sarbec). “As a leading brand in our industry, it seemed essential to help democratize this new, more responsible beauty gesture and support our consumers in adopting it”, explains Stéphanie Borri, General Manager of Garnier France. “7.5% of French people purchased solid cosmetics at least once in 2021, compared to 1% in 2019,” adds Anaïs Dupuy, Expert Hygiene Beauty at Kantar. In France, the solid cosmetics turnover reaches 85.5 million euros now (from November 2021 to October 2022), and the market share amounts to about 1.5% and 0.2%, exclusive of soap (source: IRI for all supermarket channels - exclusive of toothpaste and roll-on deodorants). “Solid hair products represent slightly less than 13% in terms of market share. They are followed by face care products, with 2.1%, and preceded by soap, with 83.4%,” says Valérie Locci, Key Account Manager at IRI. “If soap is excluded, haircare is clearly a market driver, compared to other, niche categories in supermarkets, like shaving, bath/shower products, and deodorants”, she adds. Still, these figures should be qualified, since the institute excludes “green roll-on deodorants (cardboard, refillable)” from their calculations, so their weight is “probably under-represented”. This appetite for solid products is confirmed by Anaïs Dupuy: “Haircare products, in particular shampoo, were great recruiters in 2021, with +6.5 points, compared to +2.4 points in 2019. Consumers now dedicate 25% of their global shampoo budget to solid shampoo, which just shows how this new gesture is becoming a buying pattern”. And yet, solid cosmetics have not always had such a good reputation. “They are not convenient, they make no foam, they do not clean well, they make the hair feel like straw, etc.,” explains Laure Favre, co-founder [1] of the new brand beaudy. And yet, according to her, the demand for clean and responsible solid cosmetics is extremely high – hence the importance of innovative formulas. Is this the end of solid shampoos floating in their cups after use? Brands have rivalled with ingenuity to make the solid product gesture playful and accessible: suction cups to hold the products, nets to completely finish them, pretty waterproof travel kits… Everything should be well-thought-out to seduce consumers and make them feel like testing them. And it works! “50% of our turnover is now achieved with repurchase”, says Sarah Pouchet, co-founder of Unbottled, which released a solid waterproof makeup remover a few weeks ago, along with reusable wipes. “Brands’ enthusiasm for solid cosmetics confirms they have grown aware of the ecological urgency: this is conveyed by their reducing the use of plastic in packaging, but also of water, which can represent up to 80% in a cosmetic formula”, emphasizes Sophie Lauret, the founder of Comme Avant. “However, I am a bit less enthusiastic about the composition, although we have always been irreproachable. We based our brand on this essential value: a clean composition to preserve the whole family’s health,” she adds. “Many brands have been emerging on all channels, and solid cosmetics have found their own place in supermarkets. The general public is gradually seizing this opportunity, which makes the segment grow,” sums up Valérie Locci, IRI. The profile of solid shampoo buyers is actually far from the usual Parisians with a “Bobo style”. “It is close to that of liquid shampoo buyers, whether in terms of sociodemographics, age, or social class,” explains Anaïs Dupuy. The brands surveyed confirm rather broad a consumer profile: mainly women between 30 and 50 who purchase products for themselves and their own family, almost everywhere across France. “At Lamazuna, we have a fan base which accounts for about 20% of our turnover. However, we have noticed consumers have been fluctuating since before 2019, which can definitely be explained by the abundance of today’s offering. They feel like testing several brands, which is only logical,” explains Laëtitia Van De Walle, the founder of the solid cosmetics pioneer brand in France. In 2022, Garnier Ultradoux even launched a new solid reference, this time for children: an apricot and cotton flower shampoo. “Offering a solid range with no plastic waste was an additional step in our commitment for greener, more sustainable beauty. It is also an answer to our consumers’ expectations,” explains Stéphanie Borri. She revealed to us that there are ongoing projects for the Fructis brand. “The fact that this new galenic form is increasingly present in supermarkets, while until now, it had usually been available in organic stores, from the selective distribution, and online, reminds of the craze for organic products a few years ago,” foresees Anaïs Dupuy. Distribution is also diversifying in city centres. After joining the Sephora network in early 2022, Unbottled has just opened a first store in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris, 60 Rue Vieille du Temple. This choice was carefully thought out. According to Sarah Pouchet, it can be explained by two parameters: e-commerce hidden costs and consumers’ need for in-store experiences. “Today, to get traffic online, you need to spend a tremendous amount of money. To me, there is a reverse movement slowly growing in this sector, which consists in reviewing one’s vision of retail to get back to physical stores. In addition, contrary to what can often be heard, consumers do not feel like staying behind their screens. They do like visiting stores to get a unique experience, and that is what we provide them with this new shop: testing this new gesture related to solid cosmetics consumption, before buying it”, explains the creator. Of course, meanwhile, the brand takes care of its e-commerce customers. Next year, they will launch the website in several languages to virtually pass the French borders. This data seems pretty encouraging for a very young market which has only started to diversify!"
"Sales of refillable perfumes and cosmetics are booming in France, NPD finds","As brands strive to reduce their environmental footprint, bulk sales and refill solutions are mushrooming in the beauty market. And all retail channels are involved, including in premium and luxury ones. And the proposal seems to appeal to French consumers! Indeed, sales of refills and rechargeable products in the prestige channel increased by 50% between January and end of October 2022, compared to the same period in the previous year, found The NPD Group. This segment, estimated at 158 million euros during this 10-month period, thus achieved a performance dramatically higher than that of the whole prestige beauty market, which grew by 20% between January and the end of October 2022, compared to 2021. The market research company earlier noted a similar shift in the first seven months of 2022 in the United Kingdom. ""Consumers being more and more sensitive to sustainable development issues and aware of the influence they exert, we are logically seeing an increase in sales of rechargeable selective beauty products"", explains Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. It is in the perfume category that the refill option is the most developed, notes The NPD Group. In France, sales of refillable perfume bottles jumped 56% year-to-date to October 2022 compared to the previous year. ""The expansion of the refillable offer contributes to this good momentum: three perfumes, out of the five most successful launches of the period, are sold in a refillable format,"" emphasizes the The NPD Group. As far as refill is concern, France leads the way: refills and rechargeable products represent 8% of sales in the perfume category in France, compared to 6% in Europe, and 3% in North America. Actually refilling one’s perfume is not a new practice for French consumers. Several brands that are iconic of the French fragrance heritage - such as Caron, Guerlain or Goutal - offer a refilling service in their own shops, as was done historically. In multi-brand retail shops, the possibility to refill one’s fragrance was inaugurated with the launch of Angel by Thierry Mugler in 1992. “Today, several technical solutions are available to perfumery brands,” noted Gerald Martines, creator of the packaging development consulting agency In•Signes, during the Fragrance Innovation Summit. “Depending on the technological choice, and the level of service desired, refilling can be carried out in retail shops or at home, with or without dismantling the pump. Recently, Interparfums has introduced for Moncler a concept that allows to retain the exterior packaging while the glass bottle itself is replaced.” Refills and rechargeable options are also meeting huge success in the make-up category. According to The NPD Group, sales were up 122%, between January and the end of October 2022 compared to 2021 in the prestige channel. Although they represent only 2% of sales in the category, rechargeable makeup products open up new prospects for brands and distributors. When it comes to skincare, the market is still in its infancy. Only 1% of high-end skincare sales concern rechargeable products and their refills. But the potential is huge, according to The NPD Group, which notes that during the first ten months of the year, sales of refills jumped 46%, while those of rechargeable products increased by 30%. In this category, refills are potentially an important driver of consumer loyalty. Repurchase is indeed a key issue, since it is obvious that refillable cosmetics only have a positive environmental impact when they are actually refilled! From this point of view, “there is still road a long way to go”, emphasizes Mathilde Lion. Actually, refills currently represent only 2% of perfume sales, and grew by 21% compared to last year, a significant slower rate than that of refillable bottles. “New fragrances that were launched with a refillable version must be given time to grow a loyal customer base and this will take several months. On the other hand, we are now identifying growth opportunities on the launch of refillable versions for the market’s main flagship fragrances which have been able to demonstrate their ability to build loyalty for years,” she concludes. While the success of refills can logically be explained by consumers’ growing interest in products with a reduced environmental footprint, there are still many hurdles to overcome. According Gerald Martines, ""loyalty is a real paradigm shift in a market that has built its growth model on the multiplication of launches and the encouragement of experimentation"". Other difficulties, such as the proliferation of references linked to refills, and therefore a problem of space in points of sale, add up to make the shift even harder. Coming on the heels of the craze for solid and bulk cosmetics, the success of refills confirms consumer interest in products and practices that are more environmental-friendly!"
Who were the most powerful beauty influencers of 2022?,"According to the first Beauty Trends Report by online beauty retailer LookFantastic [1], American makeup artist and social media star Mikayla Jane Nogueira seems to have found the perfect formula to share her passion for beauty products, resulting in her becoming the most popular influencer of the year 2022. Both humorous and frank, her posts are winning over followers all over the world, to the point that the young woman is the subject of 2,400 monthly searches on average. Search interest for her name has jumped by 1275% in just one year. With more than 13.8 million followers on TikTok, Mikayla Nogueira is a little less popular on Instagram with ’only’ 490,000 followers. But it should be noted that this is an unauthenticated account through which the social networking star only shares personal posts. Her professional account, Beauty by Mikayla Jane, counts over 2.4 million followers. And that’s not all, since the makeup artist is regularly quoted in the media for her innovative techniques and tips and is at the origin of many beauty trends such as the ’sticky method,’ just to name one. This kind of media coverage contributes to elevating the makeup artist’s status to that of the most powerful beauty influencers in the world. In second place is London-based Nigerian social media star Uche Natori, who, although not as well-known as her counterpart, is one of the beauty influencers to follow very closely in the coming months. Famous for her perfect foundation — she refers to herself as ""the base queen"" — the young woman counts 300,000 followers on Instagram, nearly 160,000 on TikTok, is also present on YouTube, and has been the subject of 2,400 searches on average per month, as much as Mikayla. The top places in this ranking of the most popular female influencers of the year are rounded out by American Meredith Duxbury (1,900 monthly searches, 16.2 million followers on TikTok), Danielle Marcan (720 monthly searches, 3.4 million followers), and Tammi Clarke (480 monthly searches, 560,000 followers). When it comes to celebrity influencers (referring to those who were already famous before making a foray into the beauty scene) who dominate the world of makeup, this time, it’s Kylie Jenner, no surprises there, who has risen to the top rank in 2022. The former reality TV star is simply unstoppable on social media, with no fewer than 376 million followers on Instagram (and that’s not counting the people who follow her countless cosmetic and fashion brands). Meanwhile the hashtag #kyliejennermakeup alone has generated 255 million views on TikTok to date. Another star who launched her own skincare brand in 2022, Hailey Bieber is the second most popular makeup celebrity influencer in the world. Some 50 million people now follow her on Instagram, while the hashtag #haileybiebermakeup is responsible for 209 million views on TikTok. She is ahead of actress Alexa Demie, star of the series ""Euphoria,"" whose makeup inspirations have been seen more than 80 million times on TikTok, Madison Beer (65 million views), and, coming in last in this Top 5, Kim Kardashian, whose influence, it should be said, goes far beyond the field of makeup and beauty."
Trends: ’Skin flooding’ or the art of skincare layering,"’Skin flooding,’ as the name suggests, involves applying different layers of hydration to damp skin to maximize the effects of each product and to limit water loss, one of the causes of skin dehydration. The ’skin flooding’ technique has so far generated very few views on TikTok, for the simple reason that its name was coined by the magazine Refinery29, which regularly tests new beauty trends spotted on the social network. However, the tip can be seen in many videos under the hashtags #dryskintips and #dryskinremedies, among others. The method can vary from user to user, but in all cases, it involves applying two serums to the skin, one after the other, the first containing hyaluronic acid and the second containing niacinamide. The objective is to deeply moisturize the skin, reduce redness and tightness, and help protect against further external aggression. The final step is the application of a thicker layer of moisturizer to nourish the skin’s surface. Importantly, the first serum must be applied to damp skin, which should not be fully dried after cleansing, to help boost the absorption of the products to come. The many videos of this beauty trick feature several variations. For example, those who wish to can step up their ’skin flooding’ experience by spritzing their face with a moisturizing mist between each step, a trick that could ensure extra hydration, say some TikTokers. It’s also possible to add a moisturizer with sun protection to protect the skin from UV rays. This trend confirms the current global interest in skincare, which has been reflected throughout 2022 by the launch of new brands based on natural skincare. This trend is expected to grow even more in 2023 with the boom in holistic beauty, focused on prevention, well-being and skin health."
"Beauty Pie unveils top makeup, skincare, body and hair care trends for 2023","After having crunched numbers from Google [1], the British brand identified five haircare trends among the top 10 beauty trends, three skincare and two makeup trends. According to Beauty Pie, Butterfly haircuts have seen popularity spike by a +12,432% in the run up to 2023, suggesting it’ll be one trend that’s set to dominate next year. So what’s all the hype about? A haircut that combines short layers with long layers for added dimension, movement and body. The benefit of the short, wispy layers is that they directly hit the chin and jawline to frame face and contour the face. The octopus haircut is a heavily-textured look that uses shorter layers on top, while thinner, longer lengths of hair are styled from underneath - which (very subtly) resembles the shape of an octopus. The octopus haircut is said to be an evolution of the mullet. This trend is really a mixture of trends, like 2014’s soft pale grunge and balletcore. It’s all about embracing ’hyperfeminity’ and it takes us straight back to the early 2010s; think Lana Del Ray style eye-liner and girly pink blush. Popularity for this style of makeup has skyrocketed by 1,690% in the run up to 2023, according to Beauty Pie. The jellyfish haircut, a blunt bob with a mullet, takes fourth place, seeing a 1,185% increase in searches ahead of 2023. This style of haircut is inspired by the traditional Japanese princess cut – the top layer is cut shorter in a head-hugging layer, with longer lengths around the perimeter and Nicole Kidman has been reported to have been spotted with this new edgy look. Chebula is touted as one of the most powerful antioxidants in the world. It fights fine lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen production to serve up smoother, stronger skin. It also helps to regulate pigmentation and minimise inflammation. No wonder this skincare super ingredient has seen popularity rise by close to 1,000%. Peptide-powered lip treatments have seen popularity increase by over 400%, according to Beauty Pie, who spot themas one of the biggest beauty trends of 2023. Peptide lip treatments are a restorative method to create naturally plump and soft lips, whilst also minimising the appearance of fine lines. This skincare trend offers to smother the face in an occlusive moisturiser like petroleum jelly before bed to wake up to glowing skin. The trend has long been a practice that’s featured in K-Beauty routines, and with searches increasing by 392% ahead of 2023, it looks like is set to be a massive trend to try. Driven by a love for 90s and 00s nostalgia, the spiky bun is back. This is a high bun with an ultra sleek finish. Spotted on Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner, the spiky bun has officially kicked the messy bun off its pedestal. It’s easy to create, looks effortlessly chic and tonnes of tutorial videos are already available on social media. Another animal-inspired hair trend that Beauty Pie predicts to spike in 2023 is the wolf cut, which has been searched for globally 135% more than last year thanks to stars like Miley Cyrus rocking the do at one of her gigs. A rounded, wide eye look that’s increased in popularity by 122% in the run up to 2023. It’s a more innocent than sultry look - doe eyes are doll-like and they make eyes look larger and brighter. The trend’s soft nature also offers some flexibility when attempting to recreate the style, with mascara being the key tool."
"Hygiene: Will climate concern fuel the ""unwashed"" trend?","According to a recent study by Ifop, three-quarters of French people (76%) say they wash thoroughly every day, as do their German neighbours (77%), but more that Brits (68%) and much more than Italians (53%). However, this daily shower weighs on energy bills and has a real environmental impact. According to the French Water Information Centre (Centre d’information sur l’eau - Cieau) laboratory, each shower requires about 57 litres of water, or almost 40% of a French person’s total daily consumption. In addition, this water needs to be heated, which requires a significant amount of energy. As Europe faces soaring energy costs, some are questioning: Is it really necessary to shower every day? A question that echoes the unwashed trend, which recommends washing less in order to preserve the balance of the skin and scalp, and take care of their respective microbiomes. “We don’t have to wash our head to toe every day,” states Marie Jourdan, a dermatologist in Paris. The skin is a living organ that renews itself: “It cleans itself,” explains a member of the French Society of Dermatology (SFD). The surface of the skin is covered with an emulsion of water and oil that forms a hydrolipidic film, and the first line of defence against infectious agents and pollution. This film is also essential in preventing dehydration. “The skin is an ecosystem like any other and its balance must be preserved,” stresses Dr. Marie Jourdan. If the skin is “overloaded external stresses” such as pollution or sweat, it needs to be cleaned. But as a general rule, “using soap on a daily to wash the areas where perspiration is the most greasy, which are prone to bacterial colonization, such as underarms, toes, or private parts, with heavy, oily sweat is enough,” she explains. Conversely, “too frequent washing can create dryness and eczema,” she adds. Since the 19th century and the work of Louis Pasteur, we have known that washing kills most of the bacteria that cause infections. But today, “in our medical practices, we see many people who wash themselves too much, several times a day, often out of fear of viruses,” reports Laurence Netter, a dermatologist and venereologist in Paris. “The risk is to alter the surface hydrolipidic film that allows the skin to stay naturally healthy,” she continues. Dermatologists therefore recommend focusing on areas where germs and sweat nest, using minimal detergents or foaming agents that attack the skin. “If we practice this hygiene and shower every two or three days, it’s not a problem, unless we sweat a lot or play sports,” Lawrence Netter says. “It’s also great for adjusting to good hygiene, healthy skin and low energy consumption,” she said. As far as bathing is concerned, just forget it. It can swallow 150 to 200 litres of water. And if it is associated with a moment of relaxation, it is often too hot or too long, which dries out the skin without balancing the composition of the epidermis. Born in the United States ten years ago, the ""unwashed"" trend once made the headlines after the lockdowns that marked the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Through the pandemic period, women chose to wash their hair less frequently, down almost 10% over five years to 2.8 times per week on average, highlighted Kantar in April. A shift in consumer behaviour which has resulted, for the hair care market, in a reduction in volumes in favour of a premiumisation of the market. And despite falling usage, sales of hair conditioners and treatments grew in value, generating 5% growth in 2020 (compared to 2019), and 7% growth in 2021 (compared to 2020). However, the evolution of hygiene practices depends on many factors and ecological motivations can take very different forms. A recent Opinionway survey thus showed a generational divide in France, with young people preferring to adopt new purchasing practices towards products deemed to be more eco-friendly, rather than changing their habits."
Three key skincare trends spotted at Cosmoprof Asia Singapore 2022,"Minimally invasive beauty was one of the most visible trends at the trade fair - and a key trend highlighted by trend forecaster Beautystreams in its Cosmoprof Asia 2022 Trends report. The trend encompasses highly sophisticated cosmeceuticals that promise to keep face and skin looking younger for longer, delaying the need for actual invasive beauty treatments such as plastic surgery. This new generation of functional face care is based on the latest biotechnological advances featuring innovations like freeze-dryed actives (to improve stability), cutting-edge delivery systems to allow ingredients to penetrate more deeply into the skin than ever, skin boosters that have a filler-like effect or self-dissolving micro-needle patches. Singapore brand Invity‘s SuperNAD Youth Activating Sheet Mask, for example, is described as the world’s first sheet mask to contain the cell-energising molecule NAD (Nicotinamide Adenosine Dinucleotide). And Korean brand Coscoco new Medipair Collagen Veil Ampoule treatment kit contains five ampoules with a bioactive collagen booster said to improve skin health. Cellicon Lab‘s latest face care launches are based on the cell-to-cell DermiShuttle delivery system said to increase the efficacy of its cosmetic actives. The brand’s new PermeaCell Lifting Kit combines freeze-dried powdered ingredients that are ""activated"" with a liquid ampoule. And Dermafirm’s RX Melavita-C Exosome Cream is a brightening cream formulated with seven skin-boosting ingredients and a liposome-based delivery technology. Dissolving micro-needle patches are another interesting ingredient delivery system. In this face care technology, the active ingredients are manufactured into ultra-thin spikes which are attached to patches. The micro-needle patch is then applied to the skin with a light pressure, causing the ingredients spikes to slightly pierce the top layer of the skin and dissolve, allowing the actives to penetrate the skin more effectively than a topically applied serum. Several Korean exhibitors presented this kind of beauty tech, like Endoderma which showcased its most recent launch, comma-shaped undereye patches containing AHP-8 and caffeine to improve skin firmness and elasticity. While functional beauty is not a new trend, of course, beauty products and face care in particular are becoming more high-tech and effective every year. Certain ingredients stood out in particular at Cosmoprof Asia 2022, like EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) which made an appearance at quite a few exhibitors‘ booths. Korean brand Reblocell, for example, presented its new Flossom Regenerating Sheet mask which the brand says has been saturated with the equivalent of four EGF ampoules. Fellow Korean brand EGFology also introduced an EGF face mask kit which comprises a bio-cellulose mask and an EGF ampoule. And Belgian brand Celestetic newest EGF launch is a Hydra Mist facial spray in which the EGF amino acids are combined with other functional actives, like niacinamide and panthenol. Bakuchiol - often described as a “plant-based retinol” - has been trending in Western European and US beauty for a while. Now this ingredient seems to be taking off amongst Asian brands, too, with at least half a dozen K-beauty brands presenting bakuchiol serums and creams, usually combined with a vegan claim. Tinazana launched a new vegan bakuchiol serum and a bakuchiol cream. The serum is a dual-phase product formulated with bakuchiol, trehalose, panthenol and almond oil, tocopherol and lithospermum erythrorhizon extract. Fellow Korean brand Celestyn recently introduced a 3-sku bakuchiol-based range formulated with 1% plant-based retinol, retinol and multipeptides. Bunio has also just brought out a bakuchiol serum, as did Eleven Huesday with its new V-Renewal Bakuchiol cream which contains 1% bakuchiol as well as three types of collagen, peptides and retinol. Cosmetic products that focus on boosting and protecting the skin’s microbiome have been a massively growing global trend for the last few years. Probiotic, prebiotics and ferments played the leading role in beauty launches at the Cosmoprof Asia show this year, often with the word “biome” strategically used as part of the product or brand name. Russian beauty brand Natura Siberica, for example, presented its new Lab Biome range. The brand‘s Lab Biome Rejuvenating Face Serum is formulated with 1% postbiotic actives derived from fermented Northern cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) and wild raspberry extracts while the Happy Age Anti-Ageing Serum, French indie brand Demain’s most recent launch contains natural prebiotics and postbiotics. However, microbiome-centred launches were also highly visible amongst the Asian exhibitors at the show, like Korean brands Farmstay with its new Tea Tree Biome Calming Serum and IsnTree (http://www.isntree.com/) with the recently launched Yam Root Vegan Milk Toner which is said to help repair and protect the skin’s barrier. Malaysian brand Sky Resources has also launched a microbiome-focused face care range this year. The brand’s Rebiome Sunscreen, for instance, is formulated with polylysine said to actively boost beneficial skin bacteria. Next year Cosmoprof Asia is due to return to Hong Kong, taking place from 14th to 17th November 2023."
"Viva Magenta, the colour that signals strength and optimism for 2023","Spotted as the colour of 2023, Viva Magenta is, according to Pantone: ""An unconventional shade for an unconventional time,"" and a ""new narrative."" The next year could see some positive changes or, if the colour specialists are right, it could bring glimpses of new prospects.. Especially since the experts at Pantone associate this new colour with joy, optimistic celebration, strength, dynamism, and even vigour. After Very Peri, Pantone’s colour of 2022, associated with inventiveness and creativity, Viva Magenta — code name Pantone 18-1750 — aims to establish a new dynamic, writing ""a new narrative,"" between power and exuberance. That’s right, all that! In regards to the description provided by Pantone, this hybrid colour between crimson, purple and pink is only defined with ultra-positive superlatives. It’s enough to make us want to plunge headlong into the future, and embrace this new vision that at the moment seems far off — very far off — from the ambient gloom of recent months, or even years. ""Brave and fearless, a pulsating color whose exuberance promotes a joyous and optimistic celebration... It is an animated red that revels in pure joy, encouraging experimentation and self-expression without restraint, an electrifying, and a boundless shade,"" outlines Pantone on its website. And not to spoil anything, it is also ""a colour that is audacious, full of wit and inclusive of all…"" A symbol of a great year ahead, then. But Viva Magenta also reflects another part of our evolving narrative, navigating between the physical and virtual. A hybrid shade in short, which incarnates the changes to come in our daily lives. ""Tapping into the experimental spirit of Viva Magenta, Pantone explores the dynamic between Artificial Intelligence and human creativity to create ’The Magentaverse’ available to the public for the first time,"" Pantone outlines. But be aware that it’s not about forgetting what’s essential: nature. ""In this age of technology, we look to draw inspiration from nature and what is real. ""Rooted in the primordial, Pantone 18-1750 Viva Magenta reconnects us original matter. Invoking the forces of nature, [it] galvanizes our spirit, helping us to build our inner strength,"" says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. The designers of major fashion labels have not yet unveiled their collections for fall-winter 2023, but last fall we did get a preview of the inspirations for the next spring-summer ... And looking back on them, it’s clear that Viva Magenta, or any other colour close to this shade, wasn’t really in the spotlight. With regard to the trends defined by fashion search engine Tagwalk, which works to screen the shows of the various Fashion Weeks, the main shades making news for that season are cobalt blue, pastels, lilac, silver, fluorescent, gold, orange, and possibly transparent, which will be part of the game. Still, many celebrities didn’t wait for the announcement of the color of the year 2023 to appropriate Viva Magenta, such as Chiara Ferragni who has worn it in accents; Selena Gomez who sported a satin version during the premiere of her documentary ""My Mind & Me"" at the AFI Film Festival in Los Angeles, and Kate Middleton who, according to the Instagram accounts her fans have dedicated to her looks, quite regularly sports the color of the year to come."
"Beauty consumers strive for efficient and potent products, says Mintel","Looking ahead, Mintel has identified three upcoming trends in consumer behaviour, product innovation and marketing tactics that will impact the future of the beauty industry in 2023 and beyond. Beauty Rx. The medicalisation of beauty is leading to more demand for proof behind claims, creating value through ingredient-led products and driving the market for synthetic natural ingredients. “As the hunger for more efficient and potent products and treatments grows, consumers will look further to find proof that their money is being well-spent,” says Andrew McDougal, Director, Mintel Beauty & Personal Care. Potential developments from beauty brands could come from the emergence of genetic sequencing and advances in diagnostics and electronic wearable devices. In this context, the beauty industry should tap into emerging technologies to develop new products and processes, improve existing ones and reduce costs to remain competitive in the future. Evolved Self-Care. Beauty is intended to be uplifting and can contribute to a post-pandemic sense of self-care that includes sexual wellness, the hormone journey and wellness for every life stage. “It’s critical to ensure that all consumers feel seen and spoken to. No longer will a singular approach to wellness be acceptable,” highlights Andrew McDougal. Thus, global beauty companies are likely to focus on holistic habits and products that support everything from sleep to blood circulation and their connection to beauty. New Rules of Engagement. Brands should embrace disruption in the category to create new rules for engagement and building communities, allowing for more playfulness, experimentation and DIY. “Experimentation drives engagement and technology will usher in the next generation of experience, whether in the store or the home. As online and offline formats continue to merge, technology will allow for the replication of experiences across channels with simple approaches, from RFID to digital avatars and the metaverse. Looking ahead, the development of VR (virtual reality) technology, hardware and content will become convenient and practical enough for consumers to use every day. This will enable brands to use these technologies strategically to create ‘phygital’ (physical and digital) experiences that will dominate the way consumers discover, shop and connect with brands,” says McDougal.

Advent calendars: Properly meeting expectations to avoid a reputation crash,"Beauty, fashion, gardening, gastronomy, automotive, jewellery, crafts, culture, toys, design... The advent calendar craze has spread to every market sector — or just about. Instead of running out of steam, the phenomenon seems to grow from year to year, inspiring extravagant projects and versions, as well as some exorbitant prices. The time of children receiving an Advent calendar with religious images to help them await Christmas seems to be part of a long-gone past. Early in the 20th century, the Germanic tradition gave way to the first retail versions, still in the form of pictures but more playful than pious, inviting children to express their creativity with colourful drawings. Then the pictures gave way to chocolates and, gradually, to many other things, including: toys, jewellery, cosmetics, perfumes, beers, wine, tea, coffee, festive foods, miniature cars, candles, books, sex toys, etc. A wide range of variations is available to meet the tastes and desires of customers, including personalized or customizable versions, or even DIY kits. There is also a wide variety on the budget side: from ultra-accessible to ultra-luxurious, when it comes to advent calendars, anything goes. In fact these small-sized gifts packed into a countdown format inspire such enthusiasm that Britain’s Beauty Pie recently created a contest wherein one lucky Advent calendar fan could get paid in exchange for reviewing several of them. Brands often see these colourful boxes as a profitable pre-Christmas operation. They help “deseasonalize” the end-of-year period. Since they are marketed in October, they represent for consumers a Christmas purchase before Christmas comes, and an additional source of revenue for both brands and retailers. From a marketing point of view, they also give the brand a privileged moment to introduce itself to consumers, inviting them to explore and try several of its products. A privileged opportunity to potentially spark curiosity, desire, and even passion for one or more products. However, as competition increases, appealing to today’s consumers involves more and more creative efforts and margin compression: samples or special edition goodies thus tend to be replaced by true retail products. As a result, prices can easily soar — US$300 euros, US$500, even up to several thousand dollars for the extreme luxury versions — making the disappointment even greater when the contents don’t meet expectations. Something that a major luxury house experienced fallout from last year, when it became the subject of a controversy on social networks. The cause? Its Advent calendar, retailing for US$825, was criticized by an influencer who did not appreciate the contents. If it contained miniature versions of collector perfumes, lipsticks, and creams, the luxury-priced box also contained, according to the young woman, pins, stickers, pouches, and decorative tree baubles that the label would generally offer free of charge to its customers upon the purchase of a product. A bit disappointing considering the amount of money spent. Fortunately, it’s always possible to know the contents of an advent calendar before going to the checkout, allowing consumers to make perfectly informed choices. It remains to answer the big question of the moment! From the packaging to the content of the products, can Advent calendars be environmentally friendly? A part of the answer inevitably lies in the commitments made by the brand. A company that claims to be ethical, sustainably-oriented must offer products in line with its commitments, as a latter of logic and consistency. Packaging is increasingly made from sustainable or recycled materials, and tend to avoid plastics."
Makeup trends: Grey hits the heights on social networks,"At the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards — which each year crowns fashion’s finest — the star stepped out in a Thom Browne ensemble that didn’t fail to wow the photographers and guests in attendance. But it was her lipstick that set social networks on fire. And that’s because the American celebrity made a bold move in choosing an unmissable matte grey lipstick, which has clearly gone down a storm. And that’s all it took. On TikTok, the favorite social network of young people in search of new beauty inspirations, the hashtag #greylipstick has already scored nearly three million views. This reflects growing interest in this trend. The result is a host of videos featuring the supermodel’s beauty look, but also in even more extravagant and futuristic variations. This trend has emerged in a context where beauty seemed above all to be embracing more vibrant colours, as if reflecting a need to rise up against the prevailing mood of gloom. Grey — a neutral colour symbolizing elegance and futurism, but also monotony, melancholy, even sadness — is ultimately part of a broader trend marked by a certain nostalgia. Actually, it’s becoming clear — as evidenced by social networks — that grey is gradually becoming the flagship colour of the season, and for all types of beauty looks. Notching up no less than 2 million and 1 million views, respectively, the hashtags #greymakeup and #greyeyeshadow show just how much European and North-American social media users are starting to see themselves in grey this winter."
"“The Chinese culture influences perfumers”, David Huang, Robertet China","L’Oréal chose Documents, but other young companies like To Summer (观夏) or Beast (野兽派) are also very active on the Chinese perfume market. “These two companies have been growing very fast, in particular To Summer, whose growth is phenomenal! Their investors have enough funds to finance their development, so for now, they are not considering selling their shares”, explains David Huang (黄赣军), nose and Technical Director of a creative team of 12 people at Robertet China, the subsidiary of the French company specialized in natural aromatic products that opened a plant in 2007 in Huairou, in the suburbs of Beijing, for 65 million yuans. The company has kept investing since then, almost twice more, says David Huang, who was born in the Henan province and formed the ISIPCA School in Versailles, France. To him, the communication between China and the other countries in the field of scents boosts the rebirth of the perfume culture. Indeed, if it was flourishing until the 13th century, it disappeared during the turmoil that buried part of the Chinese heritage. The first traces date back to more than two thousand years ago, when rose and jasmine fragrances were introduced by the Arabs. Then, China developed local scents, like osmanthus incense, whose olfactory signature has kept changing over the centuries. According to David Huang, the Chinese uniqueness is gaining ground again in the world of perfumes. The Chinese culture has a tremendous influence on perfumers, who choose plants like tea, osmanthus, and bamboo as a source of inspiration. For example, he has just created the fragrance Hangzhou Sweet for To Summer, using osmanthus, mung bean, and longjing green tea. Recently, on the dynamic segment of home perfumes, Beast collaborated with luxury hotel Capella Shanghai to launch a line called Santal Trouble, with a sandalwood trail. Compared to European and American consumers, Chinese people prefer smart, light, subtle, but not too sweet notes, David Huang says. In addition to that, he insists they expect other functions than a smell. Other than the originality of a niche product, for example, perfumes need to have a positive influence on the daily mood and to improve our condition at work by diffusing refreshing aromas. Although they are still bestsellers in China, a few global brands have integrated the local culture into their perfume design, such as Armani Privé with Pivoine Suzhou and Atelier Cologne with Oolang. David Huang hails these “genuine efforts for the domestic market, which convey a unique thinking strategy on local Chinese assets. The Chinese perfume market is opening via global brands, and we think it is only the beginning”. The local competition is restless: the Qichacha institute counts about 2,000 Chinese scent brands. Other than those mentioned above, David Huang evokes a few more in this profusion of companies: Re Classified (调香室), Aynoir, Plustwo (普拉斯兔), Barrio (巴莉奥), SIT.E, Atypic Edition (返常), Reflower (花点时间), Meet House (香遇沙龙香水), Futchi, etc. They are entering a market which, according to the latest Euromonitor data, should achieve a 22.5% growth rate over the next five years (compared to 7% for the global market). By 2025, retail sales on the Chinese perfume market should reach 30 billion yuans. Right now, according to iResearch Consulting Group, women with medium to high incomes account for more than 80% of Chinese perfume consumers, with a purchase price per unit from 500 to 800 yuans (EUR 68 to EUR 108). As a consequence, a few analysts assert that China went from a pre-Covid economy focused on lipstick to a perfume-centred one. New trends in the Chinese fragrance market will be presented by Asia Cosme Lab at the Fragrance Innovation Summit, on December 1st in Paris: www.fragranceinnovation.com/en/"
"Sales of prestige hair care products boom in the UK, according to The NPD Group","According to The NPD Group, sales of prestige hair products increased 67% from January to the end of September 2022, compared to the same period in 2019. The market for prestige hair products in the UK was valued at £29.8 million in 2022, an increase of 18% compared to the same period in 2021. The market research firm says British consumers have shifted their behaviour during the pandemic and the closure of hair salons. During the various lockdowns, they turned to specialised treatments, shampoo and conditioning products from the prestige hair category for their home hair routine. This shift in consumer behaviour shows no sign of decreasing as sales across this category continue to grow, especially online. The study finds that 67% of all prestige hair products sales in the UK are made via online channels. “Many people are loyal to the products within their hair routine and the online channel lends itself to replenishment purchasing. Online also allows the consumer to be savvier when searching for products to see where they are most competitively priced,” explains Emma Fishwick, Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. Daily rinse shampoo and conditioner products perform well in this sector. Sales of dry shampoo increased 68% in the nine-month period compared to 2021, suggesting that consumers, who are commuting again and socialising more, maybe opting for an on-the-go quick fix. Sales of hair styling products including hair spray reported double-digit growth in this period compared to last year. As consumers are becoming more educated about ingredients in beauty and hair care, brands have responded with a multi-layered approach to hair care offering multi-step routines, akin to skincare regimes, for home hair care. Targeted products can address particular issues and deficiencies. As a consequence, sales of hair oil increased 34% and hair serum increased 33% during the first nine months of 2022 compared to last year. “The prestige hair category has performed incredibly well since the beginning of the pandemic. Consumers are upgrading their hair care routines with everyday use prestige products such as daily rinse shampoo and conditioner that by their very nature address specific concerns from dry and damaged hair, to split ends and fizziness. This is a major shift, and we believe that the ‘skinification’ of haircare is here to stay,” concludes Emma Fishwick."
"Ethics and mental wellbeing remain key consumers concerns in 2023, Mintel","Mintel’s global consumer trends report for 2023 reveals that ethics and mental wellbeing remain the two main concerns of consumers. Indeed, in a context of global uncertainty and a series of crisis, consumers tend to refocus on what really matters to them. Centred around seven core drivers of consumer behaviour - identity, rights, surroundings, experiences, technology, wellbeing and value - the five key trends identified by Mintel are: Me Mentality. According to Mintel, in 2023, consumers will be eager to re-focus on themselves. For instance, Mintel highlights that 44% of US Gen Zs agree that finding ways to celebrate themselves has become more important to them now than before the COVID-19 pandemic. “In recent years, consumers have had a community mindset, putting their own needs on the back burner to prioritise public health and safety. People are now emerging from the pandemic eager to re-focus on themselves,” highlights Simon Moriarty, Director of Mintel Trends, EMEA. Power to the People. According to Mintel, brands need to adapt to a new model of consumer as co-creator. Consumers are investing, co-creating and voting for change. Popular social platforms like TikTok prioritise self-expression, driving consumers to develop and showcase their creativity across beauty, home and food. Responding to this demand requires brands to listen and react while keeping market innovation a priority. Hyper Fatigue. The pandemic, rising cost of living, energy crisis, geopolitical unrest and the climate crisis have all taken their toll on consumers and will continue to do so, causing fatigue and a sense of being overwhelmed. As a consequence, according to Mintel, consumers will try to cut through the noise and connect with what matters to them. “Consumers will find meaning and solace in reconnecting with their surroundings, their communities and themselves,” says Simon Moriarty. International Localism. Buying local will be a way consumers can protect themselves financially, environmentally and psychologically, and feel that they are giving back. “With so much global uncertainty there will be a greater movement to protect local resources and boost local business. This is a hangover from the pandemic, but also a reflection of consumers’ changing attitudes towards what’s important to them,” explains Simon Moriarty. Intentional Spending. In a tough economic environment, consumers want to make smart financial choices without sacrificing their quality of life. Mintel highlights that 45% of US consumers who buy select personal care products say they have chosen an alternative product/brand due to price increases in the last year. According to the market research firm, factors like flexibility, durability and sustainability will play increasingly important roles in consumers’ value equation. “Expect a stronger focus on durability, flexibility and timelessness as consumers seek to buy less and own products that last longer and serve multiple purposes. As the market becomes further saturated with added-value claims, consumers will grow more sceptical and discerning. In the next five years, expect to see purpose-driven brands emerge with innovations that address long-term challenges faced by the industries, nations, and communities in which they are a part,” concluded Simon Moriarty. Mintel’s 2023 Global Consumer Trends are available for free download here."
"As inflation soars, price comes before sustainability for U.S. consumers","As prices continue to rise and economic uncertainty looms, financial concerns are widespread among US consumers but all hope is not lost. According to a recent Mintel research, more than half (51%) of Americans say they are currently concerned about the future of the economy, however, a similar share (48%) feel confident their financial situation will improve in the next 12 months. In addition to the future of the economy, inflation is top of mind across the population. Nine in 10 consumers (94%) say they are currently worried about inflation, and 67% believe the majority of Americans share in these concerns, while a third (34%) believe it’s other Americans - rather than themselves - who are financially struggling right now. Meanwhile, 22% of Americans overall - and 31% of parents - say they are struggling to cover day-to-day expenses. Mintel research shows that the most common consumer response to dealing with inflation is cutting back on nonessential purchases (40%), followed by dining out less often (37%). “Americans’ heightened concern about the country’s economic future - which greatly exceeds all other surveyed financial concerns - is likely due to the current laser-sharp focus on this topic across news media, the political arena, and among business leaders. While not all consumers consider themselves financially struggling at this time, many are already adjusting their shopping behaviors regardless of their level of financial comfort,” said Lisa Dubina, Associate Director of Culture & Identity, at Mintel. Age and current life stage affect where consumers’ greatest financial concerns lie. Consumers aged 55-64 - who are more likely to be financially established - are more focused on big-picture concerns including the overall well-being of the economy (61%) and their personal retirement savings (46%). On the other hand, Gen Z consumers (18-24), who are earning less in general, are more concerned with their own short-term financial well-being: maintaining their current standard of living (38%), ability to pay their bills (41%), and ability to afford day-to-day necessities (38%). These shorter-term concerns align with younger consumers’ tendency to prioritize living in the moment and could help brands identify where and when they are more likely to splurge. Despite consumers’ willingness to pay more for higher quality (59%), there’s little else they prioritize before lower prices. According to Mintel, more than six in 10 consumers (62%) prefer lower prices over a convenient shopping experience, and 57% say they prioritize lower pricing over sustainable brand options. More than six in 10 (63%) consumers say that brand name is not important to them when shopping most categories, yet 59% of people agree they’d rather pay more for a higher quality product than pay less to receive average quality. This shows that durability and long-term use are more important than the premium halo of a brand name. Although consumers prioritize price over convenience and exclusivity, these can still be attractive add-ons that can make a brand more appealing compared to similar price competitors. “Consumers are likely to continue choosing the best price over the more sustainable and more expensive option. Understanding that now is a difficult time for retailers to offer more discounts due to challenges like supply chain issues and the rising price of labor cutting into profit margins, offering creative perks and benefits to customers can increase the value of purchases and help build long-term customer loyalty. Now more than ever, it’s important for brands to not only communicate the value of their products and services but also prove it to consumers who are increasingly looking to avoid financial risk or waste,” concluded Dubina."
Prestige refillable beauty products see strong sales growth in the UK,"According to The NPD Group, sales of refillable prestige beauty products in the UK increased 47% from January to the end of July 2022. Sales of these products (which are valued at £34 million in this seven-month period) performed far better than the total prestige beauty market, which increased 22% between January and the end of July 2022, compared to last year. Within the total refillable beauty market, the sub-category “Product Refill Only”, where the consumer buys the product refill for use with the refillable exterior packaging, grew the fastest, with sales increasing 79% in the period from January to the end of July 2022. While refillable fragrances only account for a small proportion of the market, 5% of fragrance sales weight can be attributed to refillable packaging, said The NPD Group. To date brands have only offered a limited choice of refillable products, focusing on larger sizes. However, in the period from January to the end of July 2022 sales of 45-74ml fragrance juices (in all formats including EDT, EDP, Perfume and Cologne) have experienced strong increases, compared to the same period last year, marking a shift in retail as refillable becomes more mainstream. Refillable beauty is a key theme of launches this year. Some of the new launches with refillable options that The NPD Group has observed include Good Fortune by Viktor & Rolf, D by Diesel and Prada Paradoxe. The strongest category growth was reported in makeup where sales of refillable products increased 364% in the period from January to the end of July 2022, compared to the same period last year. This contrasts with sales growth in the total makeup market which reported a 30% increase year-on-year. Just over half of makeup refill sales can be attributed to lip colour. Other sub-segments that dominate the refill space include bronzer and blush. “As consumers become more conscious of the importance of sustainability and their role in promoting it, we have seen a corresponding rise in sales of refillable prestige beauty products. These latest figures demonstrate that as far as beauty consumers are concerned, buying refillable products is becoming more mainstream. But there is a long way to go. What we are seeing here really marks the beginning of the refillable beauty story as only a small percentage of sales weight of makeup products are currently refillable. This is similar for skincare and hair products,” said Emma Fishwick, Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty."
Beyond hairstyles: How hair has been a symbol of women’s struggles,"From the Black Panthers’ afrocentric hairstyles to the Rastafari dreadlocks or the ’natural hair movement’, hair has long been considered a symbol of protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the “flapper style”, with an androgynous silhouette and short hair, was already linked with women’s desire for emancipation and gender equality. And now, hairstyle is being used this way once more in Iran, as demonstrated by a proliferation of videos showing women renouncing their long hair, like Iranian singer Donya Dadrasan, to show solidarity with Masha Amini, who died three days after being arrested by morality police for wearing an ill-fitting veil. ""I cut my hair... I hope for a day when women in my country can laugh, dance, cry, breathe and live freely,"" Donya Dadrasan wrote on TikTok. Women in Iran have already taken to shaving their heads in the past to show support for different movements, as well as to protest against the wearing of the veil. In 2016, the page ’My Stealthy Freedom’, created by a journalist of Iranian origin living in London, published a photo of a young woman who chose to shave her head to stop wearing the veil. ""I sold my hair to those adorable angels who suffer from cancer. When I came to the street, I told myself ’no hair, no morality police! ’There is no reason for those who always tell me to cover my hair’ or arrest me now,"" she wrote to accompany a picture on which she appeared shaved and unveiled. Last year, at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, South Korean archer An San unwittingly found herself at the center of a salvo of protest. The Olympic champion was subjected to insults and threats on social networks because of her short haircut, which some considered ""not feminine enough."" As they always do with social media, reactions came swiftly with one user initiating a counter movement, giving rise to a slew of videos showing women cutting their hair live under the hashtag ""#women_shortcut_campaign."" In Saudi Arabia, short haircuts - known locally by the English word ""boy"" - have become strikingly visible on the streets, conjointly with the rise of women in the country’s economy. Sometimes it’s not necessary to cut one’s hair to make it a symbol of the fight against discrimination and inequality. Since the 1960s and ’70s, the Afro hairstyle has been popularized by many activists, including Angela Davis and Nina Simone, imbuing it with both cultural and political symbolism. At the time it was about establishing Black women and men’s natural hair as a symbol of resistance and celebration of African-American culture. It’s a movement that continues today, under various names including the ""natural hair movement,"" because of persistent discrimination and prejudice related to the hair of Black women, men and children. Don’t forget that the CROWN Act, a law aimed at prohibiting hair discrimination in the United States, was only adopted at a federal level by the House of Representatives last March, in the wake of earlier votes in California and New York. The legislation would aim at prohibiting discriminations based on hair texture, or certain hairstyles such as braids, dreadlocks or twists in access to employment, education, or even sports. Whether we cut it, show it in its natural state, or shave it, the symbolism of hair has much more than an aesthetic dimension, playing a role in fighting against various forms of inequality for decades. And it probably will continue to do so."
Skin whitening products remain popular in Cameroon despite risks,"Wearing a large hat protecting her face from the sun’s rays in Cameroon, 63-year-old Jeanne now bitterly regrets using skin whitening products after being diagnosed with skin cancer. She is one of many women in Cameroon who use the controversial products that have been banned after social media outrage. ""I am embarrassed when people look at me,"" the trader in the capital of Yaounde said, wishing to only use her first name. After a lesion grew on her face over five months, she went to a doctor who diagnosed her with one of the most common skin cancers. Doctors told her the cancer is linked to her use of skin lightening products for 40 years. Jeanne, like millions in Africa and around the world, used the products for more lighter skin. According to the Cameroon Dermatology Society (Socaderm), nearly 30 percent of residents in the economic capital Douala and a quarter of schoolgirls used skin lighthening products in 2019. For some like 20-year-old student Annette, the effects can be harsh. She said she suffers from red patches on her face, peeling skin and also burns. ""Under a strong sun, my face became hot and I had to stop,"" she explained. The products with names like ""White now"" and ""Super white"", are instantly recognisable on shop shelves by the fair-skinned women on the packaging. Many of the products contain dangerous levels of chemicals that inhibit the production of melanin, a substance produced in the body by exposure to the sun. One of the chemicals is hydroquinone, banned in the European Union since 2001 because of the risk of cancer and genetic mutations. Hydroquinone is in fact one of the most used in whitening products in Cameroon, according to a 2019 study by Yaounde I University. But other dangerous ingredients, like mercury, are also common in these products, which are now seen as real public health problem. ""We encounter patients complaining of symptoms linked to skin depigmentation every day,"" Alain Patrice Meledie Ndjong, a dermatologist at a hospital in Douala, said. Other skin whitening products include potions, tablets and even injections. Some of the substances, when ingested, can cause diabetes, obesity, hypertension or kidney or liver failure, warned Ndjong, adding there was also a psychological impact on individuals like ""anxiety and depression."" Why risk such suffering? Despite the horror stories, some persons believe they will become more beautiful after using the products. ""Beauty standards promoted by media, advertising and marketing reinforce the bias that lighter skin tone is more desirable than darker skin tone,"" said WHO. Sociologist Achille Pinghane Yonta of Yaounde University offers blunter analysis of why the creams remain popular. ""There is a desire rooted in our consciences to want to look like Western populations,” he said. ""It’s a very old practice. It’s even said, in some parts of the country, that a light-skinned woman’s dowry is higher than that of a darker woman."" Cameroon’s health ministry on August 19 banned the import, production and distribution of cosmetic and personal hygiene products containing dangerous substances such as hydroquinone and mercury. The decree was published after a controversy began in the summer when social media users criticised opposition MP Nourane Fotsing over her company that sells the products, angry that an elected official would profit from them. According to her party, the highly publicized furore was not devoid of political motives. Since the ban, police have launched raids, much to the chagrin of the sector’s players who claim some seizures don’t distinguish between the products that are banned by the government and those that are not. However, despite the ban, there is already a black market for the products. The cosmetic and personal hygiene market grew in Cameroon by seven percent in 2020 and was worth 380 billion CFA (around 580 million euros)."
"Sales of prestige fragrances overtake pre-pandemic levels in France, NPD","According to the market research company, sales of perfumes, eau de parfum, eau de toilette and colognes increased by 20% between January and August 2022 in France. A rate well above that of the whole of 2021 when sales had increased by 11%, cramped by successive lockdowns during the first half of the year. The increase is even more spectacular when compared to the same period in 2021. According to The NPD Group, these figures confirm the importance of perfumes in the prestige beauty market in France, of which they are a keystone. It is also the first flagship category of the whole beauty sector to return to pre-pandemic levels, with sales up 4% in value compared to the period from January to August 2019. While all segments contribute to these good results, consumers show a preference for more concentrated juices. Indeed, sales of eau de parfum jumped 23% compared to the same period last year and are up 12% compared to 2019. Even more concentrated, extracts and perfumes increased by 60% compared to 2021 and by 168% if we compare sales over the same eight-month period in 2019. These results confirm the growing interest of consumers for these type of fragrances, that are more expensive but have the reputation to last longer. According to The NPD Group, consumer preferences are also shifting towards increased preferences for high-end scents and collections. For the period from January to August, retail perfume sales with a value of 100 euros and more grew by 74% compared to 2021 and by 177% compared to 2019. These so-called ""premium"" fragrances accounted for 19% of total sales of fragrances in the selective channel in 2022, compared to 11% in 2019. This taste for more concentrated products and ultra-premium ranges has resulted in an increase in 5% of the average price of selective perfumes - at 68.30 euros - during the first eight months of the year, compared to the same period in 2021. “The good results of perfumes in the selective beauty market are very positive news, for brands and retailers alike. They are supported by the ever-increasing appeal of fragrances, with consumers turning to higher-quality products. Despite an uncertain economic situation and its consequences on purchasing power, perfume is part of a holistic approach to well-being in which consumers continue to invest,” said Mathilde Lion, European Beauty Expert at The NPD Group."
France: Organic cosmetics are innovating despite a difficult market environment,"Figures speak for themselves; the decrease in volume sales of organic cosmetics is ever present, in a French beauty and hygiene market which is also declining. In June 2022, the hygiene and care sector fell by 25.2% in the specialised organic channel (BioAnalytics 2022 data), while the other distribution channels, pharmacies and supermarkets, fared slightly better. Despite this difficult context, companies are continuing to invest to offer products that are more in line with the demand for simplicity of use and zero waste. Solid or powder formulas, therefore, were found in large numbers on the stands of exhibitors. The search for a fair price is also becoming a decisive factor in the purchasing act, knowing that on average organic products are 15 to 30% more expensive. Another new use is given to the container with the solid cosmetics proposed by the Anaé brand. Thanks to a partnership with the Duralex glass factory, the glass jars with different sizes of balms are reusable; the same goes for the lids made of cork from Portugal. The products consist of relaxing massage balms with hemp oil, nourishing balms with camelina oil or mentholated oil for the sport version, in 60ml format, as well as deodorant balms in 80ml format. At Perlucine, a discovery offering of mini formats, at a small price (6.45 €), allows testing the products, all of which are composed of oyster shell powder from Brittany. The hygiene kit includes a shampoo, a face cleanser, toothpaste, a shower powder and a deodorant, in 3g sachets. The well-thought salt shaker-shaped packaging delivers the right amount of powder in a very practical way. Mention should be made of Savons du Léman, a Nature et Progrès labelled brand, and of its founder Sandra Rembert, a soap maker who offers a specific range of organic soaps for short- and long-haired dogs, cats and equines as an addition to hygiene soaps. Particular attention has been given to the visual aspect of the soaps thanks to added natural pigments. New at Lamazuna is a baby range, with three solid products: a balm to protect babies from diaper rash, a perfume-free and surgras massage butter. Also, a solid shampoo with Lavandin oil to prevent head lice, as well as solid conditioners. For DIY enthusiasts, steam face masks from the Mas du Roseau brand. Packaged in canvas bags, the user simply takes the amount he needs and infuses it with hot water. At Beauty Garden, the Sothys Group’s institute brand, everything originates from an organic permaculture garden in Corrèze, for a ""seed to cream"" concept. All the products on offer are made from crops grown in situ. Institute treatments such as ""Lâcher Prise"" or ""Détox"" follow the same four-phase ritual: first contact, nature in the skin, immersion and a gentle return with a seasonal organic herbal tea. Peppermint, birch, meadowsweet, Calendula, Camomile... plants that are key components of this skincare ritual. Superfruits are always in the spotlight; alongside cranberries, blueberries and pomegranates, mulberries come from a tree in the mulberry family, not to be confused with wild blackberry. It is a powerful, resveratrol-rich antioxidant. Thanks to both, the local food movement and the (hyper-)short circuit trend, French and even regional raw materials are in high demand. With a strong identity, these raw materials enhance the notion of proximity: lavender from Provence, Breton seaweed, mountain gentian, Alpine aster... The Elixens company has made them its spearhead, in its organic range: lemon savoury from Provence, oily macerate of meadowsweet, calendula... This trend was also noticed this summer at the Vivaness trade show in Nuremberg. Finally, let’s note the Gold Trophy won at the show by Laboratoires de Biarritz, for their self-tanning face and body drops, (launched in February 2022). The plus of this product: it can be mixed with any type of skin care formula (emulsion, gel, lotion, etc.). Depending on the phototype and the number of drops added to the usual skincare product, it allows obtaining a tailor-made tan. Made up of a self-tanning complex (DHA from rapeseed and corn erythrulose), of a patented red algae antioxidant extract, Alga-Gorria®, of moisturising organic glycerine (rapeseed) and of soothing and moisturising organic Aloe Vera, this very comprehensive formula, presented in a recyclable glass dropper bottle, is handy, portable and economical. Radiant skin and a healthy glow are guaranteed all year round!"
YSL Beauty smashes virility codes with new campaign featuring Lil Nas X,"Clearly, Generation Z does not want to be pigeonholed and is shattering many of the constraints, stereotypes and preconceptions that have loomed large in the lives of previous generations. And the 23-year-old American rapper Lil Nas X is no exception — far from it, in fact — using his voice to make beauty more inclusive, and freer from stereotypes. And this seems to be welcomed by the sector’s major names, which no longer hesitate to shake up the codes to help bring their cosmetics to a wider audience. Rouge Pur Couture The Bold high pigment lipstick, the latest addition to the YSL Beauty make-up range, is currently the subject of several campaigns, featuring both Kaia Gerber and Lil Nas X. The American rapper, who constantly breaks with convention, both in fashion and in beauty, proves once again that cosmetics are not — or are no longer — tied to gender, while simultaneously challenging many preconceived notions of virility and masculinity. Dressed in a black leather look, jacket open on his bare torso, or sporting a transparent shirt, the American artist presents some of the luxury brand’s new makeup products, including Lash Clash mascara and Rouge Pur Couture The Bold lipstick. The two products have probably not been chosen at random, since they have previously been considered as being entirely dedicated to female customers. But that was then! The campaign shows Lil Nas X in the middle of the desert, posing in front of a mirror and applying the brand’s products to gain voluminous lashes and vibrant pink lips — once again turning gender stereotypes on their head. This is not the first — and probably not the last — time that the rapper has been intent on shaking up long-established norms. Whether about town or on the red carpets, the ""Montero"" singer refuses to bow to convention, always showing off his unique style, wearing dresses, crop tops and skin-tight jumpsuits. These outfits have the merit of getting people talking, questioning, while also reaching a large audience, irrespective of whether they’re open to embracing change. One of his most emblematic and evocative looks was no doubt a lilac half-dress half-suit creation by Atelier Versace, effectively embodying this desire to not (or no longer) be defined according to a gender. Like Harry Styles, David Banda, A$AP Rocky, Bad Bunny, Pete Davidson, Timothée Chalamet and Jaden Smith — to name but a few — Lil Nas X is part of a generation that is out to blur the boundaries, to push things forward, while deconstructing as much as possible the famous myth of virility."
"Kidcore, the trend that’s taking Gen Z back in the 1990s and 2000s","Although only aged between 12 and 25 years old, Generation Z already seems to be nostalgic for childhood, to the point of embracing the outfits, cosmetics, and colorful or childish accessories that nurtured them since their earliest days. As such, the “kidcore” trend sets the tone for fall, and with it, there’s no way you can take yourself seriously. Faced with the many crises that now loom large in our daily lives, the young generation is in search of extravagance and carefree vibes. And the ""kidcore"" trend isn’t just about fashion, but is also being played out in the beauty and accessories sectors, and even in the food industry. Gaudy colours, prints and ultra-kitsch accessories have taken over TikTok, which is busy reviving the key trends of the 1990s and 2000s, such as skateboarding, vintage consoles and even disposable cameras. The #kidcore hashtag has already scored more than 1.3 billion views on Gen Z’s favourite social network, not to mention its derivatives, #kidcoreaesthetic, #kidcorestyle, and #kidcoremakeup, which count several million. The aesthetic has also been reinterpreted by some designers for the spring-summer 2023 men’s fashion week shows, for instance at Thom Browne and JW Anderson. The accumulation of accessories, and the mixture of bright colors and/or prints, are among the strong trends linked to the ""kidcore"" aesthetic. Scrunchies, barrettes, colored tights, jewelry of all kinds — or in throwback childhood designs — are legion, but that’s not all. There’s also an influx of garments and styles inherent to the 1990s and 2000s that have, for some, already made a comeback in recent months with the rise of the Y2K aesthetic. Think overalls, crop tops, bucket hats, low-rise pants and vintage sneakers, for example. On the beauty side, this translates into looks and hairstyles that are often inspired by manga and video games, such as pigtails, ultra-high ponytails, bright eye shadow colours, or even mini braids. All of this, of course, is embellished with beads, and other accessories straight out of this era. A trend that, in many ways, echoes the barbiecore aesthetic that brought gender extremes back took to the forefront of fashion this summer."
The influence of technology and new uses on the future of beauty ,"The need to connect brands and consumers through a more responsible lifestyle is more and more imperative, according to a 2022 report by Mintel highlighting the necessity for brands to have ethical progress reports. Many web3 projects have been thought around sustainable engagements, like the one by Guerlain, When Material Becomes Art that merges futuristic, ecological, and artistic approaches, through 4 digital artworks. The project The Reaverse perpetuates the brand’s sustainable values – the digital world comes to rescue the real world, through a collection of 1828 cryptobees sold to protect real bees and to finance the development of a natural reserve. These endeavors are greatly appreciated by the consumers and widely shared on social media. Furthermore, the interest has shifted towards green makeup or a form of naturality, as we can see through beauty social media trends, with concepts like the No make-up Look, the Dewy Look or the Glow Up (the expression reminds us of the Netflix show which celebrates diversity). The beauty sector is often associated to others, like spirituality and well-being: lately Kate Moss has launched her beauty and wellness brand, bringing to light a healthy lifestyle, beauty products, and well-being ones, like tea, to be accompanied by a daily ritual. More than ever, the bond between reality and the digital universe allows consumers to express themselves in plural ways. Besides cyborg-like filters (poreless skin, high cheekbones, catlike eyes, big eyelashes – a look coined “Instagram Face“), the digital world allows people to be different and free. Shopping is easier and encouraged by virtual try-on, widely developed in the beauty sector to visualize a product on oneself. The use of technology also enriches customer experience, personalization, and brand engagement. A recent study informs that 92% of Gen Z consumers are interested in augmented reality during a shopping experience. Yves Saint Laurent offers three tools to try augmented reality within the comfort of one’s home – Dress your lips for lipstick makeup, Master your gaze for the eye, and Face your style for the skin. Today, many brands multiply the touchpoints during product launches, with virtual popups, immersive screens, augmented reality filters… It is a way to expand the brand’s notoriety and universe and to create a link with the consumers. The latest example by Prada Paradoxe shows how the barriers between reality and the digital field have erased – the brand asked its followers whether a fragrance could exist in a digital space, and they are invited to explore a multi-dimensional self and identity evolving constantly. What is beauty? On social media, the concept is more inclusive and universal, advocating “happy beauty”. The launch of Clinique’s first NFT, named Metaoptimist, is inscribed within this positive attitude. Another campaign by the brand aims at including more diversity in the metaverse, with NFP (non-fungible people), and looks for people with various skin colors, face shapes, hair styles and makeup. A TikTok report insists on the increase of beauty videos globally and of content that celebrates beauty and flaws, inclusivity and difference. Only communities contribute to redefining what is beauty and what are their expectations. Some brands are inspired by the virtual world in the creation of their products, offering a new space to consumers similar to the gaming industry. MAC Cosmetics has thus created 12 makeup looks within the game The Sims 4 and has launched a collection inspired by the game Honor of Kings. The gaming market paves the way for more freedom in the aesthetic world, allowing users to express their identity through their personalized avatars. Bridges, experiences, and emotions are created. In an ever-changing world, links between the digital and real worlds, eccentricity and naturality, self-identity and others, are countless. The future of beauty is shaped by the consumers themselves and by the increase of digital experiences that are more authentic and community focused. In this context, it is necessary to reconsider customer experience to produce engagement and bring together communities around shared values. These evolutions leave room for creative evolutions for both brands and consumers. WANDS, global communication agency, tells stories & brings to light in a strategic & innovative way brands that are sensitive to excellence, luxury & premium. The agency adapts itself with agility & sources the best experts/technology. At the service of emotion, it is all about impactful & engaging ideas, a custom-made service."
Focus on color: A snapshot of French and American beauty trends,"Spate’s latest report reveals the behavioral specificities emerging from each market. Based on their latest: Hair & Makeup Trends Report for France & the USA (July 2022), Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation has identified three major takeaways: In both countries, warm red tones dominate search volume changes. In France, searches for ginger hair are up +2.0K. The rise of searches for burgundy immediately follows with +1.3K, then come auburn (+1K) and copper (+0.7k). While red is the warmest color for French consumers, rising interest in babylights (+1.1K) also suggests a desire for subtlety. Likewise, in the US, red hair is the most searched color for hair with a volume increase of +213.4K. Red is followed by copper (+36.2K), auburn (+35.8K), ginger (+32.3K) and red highlights (+29.0K), all of them featuring in the top ten. Across both countries consumers are using more nuanced search descriptors to find their desired hair shade, often searching for various colors alongside red hair, demonstrating a growing desire for tonal color with dimension and depth - as well as suggesting a desire for individuality. As Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation noted from the previous report on the US/France skincare market, French consumers lean into the classics - and the hair color category is no exception, with L’Oréal holding out as the most searched-for brand. On the other hand, US consumers appear to be more open to challenger brands, such as oVertone Haircare (+1.4K), Adore Hair Color (+350) and Creme of Nature (+260), which top out as the brands with the greatest search volume increase YoY. Lipsticks score high by search volume increase in both countries (+14% in France, +37,5% in the US). It is therefore not surprising that lipstick sales have seen a +28% rise in Q2 -2022 in the US according to NPD. Long-wear and glossy are at the top of the list for French consumers (+1.7K and +1.1K respectively), while shine (+35.2K) and lasting (+16.1K) score highest for the US, according to Spate. Interestingly for a country so defined by its love of the classics, magic/colour-changing lipstick is a rising category for French consumers, breaking into the top three most-searched-for benefits with an increase of +770 YoY. Searches for eyeliner are up by +8.9% in France and +11% in the USA. While white and brown eyeliners are owning overall search volume in both territories, blue eyeliner is also increasingly growing on the consumer radar (+230 in France and +19.1K in the US). Green is also breaking through in the US at +12.5K, with classic black dropping into third place for both countries. French consumers are slowly shifting away from the classics, and are exhibiting growing interest in on-trend, contemporary colors and formulations. The uptick in searches for more niche lipstick benefits (such as ‘color-changing’, ‘waterproof’ and ‘sheer’) present opportunities for brands to inspire with innovative new concepts. What is emerging is a shift towards greater expressions of individuality, which is apparent in growing searches for nuanced hair colors and bolder eyeliners. Download the full report here. Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation will explore these trends in detail at the upcoming MakeUp in New York event, where Leila Rochet, Chief Inspiration Officer of the agency will be joined by Olivier Zimmer and Addison Cain of Spate to discuss the major global drivers fuelling the appetite for pleasure and individual expression.

Fall make-up trends: From glazed donut nails to siren eyes and slugging,"Life seems to be getting back to normal this fall, bringing with it some of the habits that were shelved during the past two years. In the bathroom, this means a return to makeup essentials neglected in recent months due to the mandatory wearing of face masks and successive lockdowns. Now, however, people — especially social network users — seem keen to make up for lost time with fun and eccentric beauty inspirations. Glazed donut nail art is one of the biggest makeup trends of the fall, with no less than 80 million views on TikTok. Popularized by Hailey Bieber during the summer, this look — which is expected to last through fall — involves lacquering nails in a way that resembles the glaze of a donut. It’s a trend that puts eccentricity back on the agenda, and one that’s incidentally boosting demand for pearlescent nail polish. According to the global fashion search engine Stylight [1], searches for this type of nail polish have jumped 203% in just one year. Actually, boosted by the pandemic, the global demand for nail polish promises to be particularly dynamic for the next ten years! ’Siren eyes’ are another trend that has became a staple of the back-to-school season. The trick, which enlarges the eyes and gives them an almond shape using eyeliner and brown eyeshadow, is proving a hit on TikTok, with nearly 600 million views for the associated hashtag. Stylight reports a 99% increase in search interest for the keyword ""siren eye"" on Google, but also a substantial 232% increase in clicks for brown eyeshadow on its international platforms. But if there is one beauty trend that continues to appeal around the world, then that’s slugging. Inspired by the slimy appearance of slugs and snails, this new beauty routine involves covering the face with a thick layer of petroleum jelly before going to bed to boost hydration and enjoy plump, radiant skin in the morning. Although criticized, this method is already scoring hundreds of millions of views on social networks, and is now spurring spin-off techniques like nail slugging and hair slugging. Lipstick is also making a comeback this fall, but not in any form. It’s anti-smudge liquid lipstick, delivering long-lasting wear and no transfer, that has been all the rage for several weeks, with a significant 300% increase in clicks for this category on Stylight. If one thing’s for sure, it’s that people seem ready to add a little colour — and fun — to their lives this season."
Natural and organic beauty: Three key trends spotted at Vivaness 2022,"Unsurprisingly for an organic beauty event, the quest for sustainability was the key market driver at Vivaness 2022. Indeed, sustainability concerns continue to grow among European consumers who had to cope with record temperatures and unprecedented droughts during this summer. Within this general framework, plastic-free and zero waste, the rise of natural and sustainable oral care, and local sourcing, turned out to be the main trends that emerged from the show floor. Solid cosmetics and zero waste concepts continued to be popular, with slew of new and indie brands introducing water-free/water-conscious products. French solid beauty pioneer Lamazuna presented its new solid perfumes while fellow French brand Balade en Provence introduced a solid eye cream based on borage oil. Similarly, Italy’s Everyday for Future, a recently launched vegan brand, showcased a quartet of twist-up face and eye serums. As far as German companies are concerned, zero waste brand Niyok introduced a solid hand cream; 4 People Who Care showcased a solid SPF50 sun cream called Naseweiss; and CMD Naturkosmetik joined the powder products trend with a foaming powder cleanser for hair. Let’s also not the makeup remover glove based on natural plant fibres developed by emerging beauty brand Nakt. Crowd-funded start-up Fabel‘s multipurpose makeup sticks are hand-made in Berlin, based on fair trade shea butter and clad in locally-produced paper packaging. Eventually, DIY zero waste beauty brand Hello Simple, which started out with deo creams in 2016, has also recently brought out a lip-and-cheek colour stick. Some Asian exhibitors were able to participate in the show. Among them was Taiwanese beauty brand Naveen, which presented a sachet-free undereye mask. The cardboard-packaged mask set contains dry undereye masks with the serum packaged separately in a glass flacon. The zero-waste and water-free/water-conscious trend has also been driving product development in the oral care market. This product category was very prominent at Vivaness 2022, with a lot of water-free toothpaste alternatives such as tooth cleaning powders and tablets. Teethlovers, for example, introduced its range of four differently flavoured tooth cleansing powders in late 2020 while fellow German start-up Zahnheld and its stylishly packaged vegan toothpastes and toothpaste tabs were launched in 2021. German brand Apeiron presented a new mint-flavoured tooth cleaning powder with cardamom, neem and cloves, while Italian manufacturer Gala Cosmetici, formulated their new Bio Happy Whitening Tooth Powder with charcoal powder, eucalyptus and ginger essential oils. Plastic-free alternatives for manual tooth brushes and heads of electric/sonic toothbrushes were also a big trend at Vivaness 2022. There were also several exhibitors showing plastic-free and/or vegan interdental brushes or dental floss. Sweden’s The Humble, one of the first European brands to launch bamboo handled manual toothbrushes back in in 2013, presented its recently launched replacement heads for electric toothbrushes which are made completely from renewable materials including cornstarch, bamboo and castor oil. German brand Truemorrow which was launched a couple of years ago also introduced replacement heads made from renewable raw materials as well as plastic-free and vegan dental floss (which comes packaged in glass or stainless steel according to preference). Localism was the third big trend visible on the show floor, with brands highlighting locally produced hand-made small batches or focusing on locally sourced actives and botanicals. Bavarian start-up brand Rose and Ann, for instance, manufactures rosehip kernel oil from food-waste rosehip kernels sourced from a local jam company. The upcycled, cold-pressed oils are then blended with plant stem cells. Fellow local start-up Raw Naturkosmetik produces its cold-pressed plant oil-based beauty products by hand. Based in Baden-Württemberg, the company says each product is based on a key oil, like poppy seed, pumpkin seed, black cumin or hemp. Spirit of Rügen is another recently launched German indie brand. Its products are hand-made on the small island of Rügen which is famous for its white chalk cliffs, and several of its beauty products feature the famous healing Rügen chalk. Dutch brand Van Toen Remedies showcased classic European apothecary style healing balms and lotions in a modern organic interpretation. The range includes a self-warming soothing balm, cooling lotions for sore muscles, a healing arnica lotion and plant-based vaseline. With their new range, Naked, German mass market beauty brand Hej Organic, showed that organic beauty can be just as functional as conventional cosmetic products. The new line offers a micellar water, serum, enzyme peeling and face cream formulated without fragrance components and with high percentages of targeted actives, like vitamin C, azelaic acid, bakuchiol and zinc PCA. The next Vivaness will take place at its usual winter dates, from 14th to 17th February 2023."
"Moss, McCartney...: holistic beauty is the new holy grail of celebrities","British model Kate Moss recently made a much noticed entry into the world of skincare with her brand ""Cosmoss by Kate Moss,"" and a short video revealing without any artifice, in fact without any clothing. The line, which aims to combine ""beauty & wellness,"" offers no mascara, no foundation, no lipstick, but rather skincare products, oils and drinks such as special tea blends, all designed as components of rituals to elevate body and mind. In short: raw holistic beauty. Holistic beauty in and of itself is not a new concept; Susanne Kaufmann, founder of the cosmetics brand of the same name, launched her approach to this idea nearly two decades ago. But it has made a comeback with the Covid-19 pandemic, as makeup sales collapsed with lockdowns, and the public turned to more natural and authentic products, ingredients, and lifestyle practices. Gone were the days of contouring, layering, and piling on cosmetics and makeup, replaced by a new approach to beauty based on caring for body and mind. These days it’s all about approaching beauty in its entirety, under the spectrum of food, fitness, well-being, sleep, and of course cosmetics. All this with the help of natural ingredients, if possible, as well as science and new technologies. The objective is no longer to treat or cover, but to prevent, by strengthening the skin’s natural powers. LED light, prebiotics, facial gymnastics and other types of facial massage are all techniques and ingredients that are very popular today for reinventing our beauty routines. Despite makeup sales bouncing back in the course of 2021, many celebrities - usually backed by beauty majors - intend to build on this concept with new launches in the skincare and body categories. Millie Bobby Brown was among the first to have tried to mine this niche with Florence by Mills, combining clean and vegan makeup and skincare, but without the well-being facet. Since then, other celebrities have followed suit. Hailey Bieber with Rhode Skin, Kim Kardashian with SKKN By Kim, which is ""at the intersection of elevated simplicity and innovative science"" via ""clean ingredients and technical formulas."" The whole thing is based on ethics and sustainability, two key words that can be found in most of these cosmetic lines. Other common points: a limited choice - with a focus on essentials - and a beauty routine that emphasizes time with long-lasting results. Whether fastidiously elaborated and explained or not, the concept of holistic beauty is indeed at the center of these new brands’ communication strategy. It’s the same thing with JLo Beauty, the brand by Jennifer Lopez, and even more so with The Outset, the label developed by Scarlett Johansson. But with Cosmoss, Kate Moss seems to want to go even further, with a line including tea to rid the body of its toxins, creams, a ’sacred’ mist and an oil with CBD. ""Each product has been meticulously crafted with wellbeing in mind; each ritual opens a door to balance, restoration, and love,"" reads the brand’s Instagram account. Last comer in the race, Stella McCartney has teamed up with the beauty division of the LVMH group to develop the skincare line, STELLA by Stella McCartney, with the aim to combine nature, efficiency and responsibility. The short range consists of three essential products: Reset Cleanser, Alter-Care Serum and Restore Cream. According to Éric Briones, co-founder of the Paris School of Luxury, and author of the book author of Luxe et digital, which will be released in October by French publisher Dunod, in Paris (not translated), “beauty and well-being will be the new growth drivers for luxury.” This would explain, according to him, the mushrooming of celebrity-owned or endorsed beauty lines. Especially since ""investing with a celebrity is much safer than with a young unknown brand, because you start with a fan base"" which can reach millions of people."
‘Clean’ beauty trend to drive growth of the Philippines’ skincare market,"The skincare market in the Philippines will be primarily driven by the make-up remover category, with the overall fastest value CAGR of 7.8% during the 2021-2026 period, followed by facial care with a projected CAGR of 7.7%, found GlobalData in a recent report[‘[Philippines Skincare Market Size by Categories, Distribution Channel, Market Share and Forecast, 2021-2026’, March 15, 2022]]. As COVID-19 restrictions ease and people begin venturing out for work and social activities, consumers are naturally paying more attention to their personal appearance with ‘clean’ beauty products trending on social media and proving popular. These products are usually formulated with a simpler ingredients list, are quick and easy to use, and serve a multipurpose. “Consumers are seeking effective and convenient methods to rejuvenate their skin without using multistep skincare regimens, which is why multipurpose products with high quality and more natural ingredients are growing in popularity,” said Likitha Nalluri, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData. Per capita expenditure (PCE) of skincare in the Philippines increased from USD 4 in 2016 to USD 4.6 in 2021, which was lower than the global average of USD 9.8, and the regional average of USD 9.2 in 2021 due to the lower consumer spending power of the developing economy. By 2026, the PCE on skincare in the Philippines is expected to increase by a third to reach USD 6.1, according to GlobalData. Convenience stores were the leading distribution channel in the Philippines’ skincare market in 2021, followed by hypermarkets and supermarkets, direct sellers, health & beauty stores, chemists and pharmacies, para pharmacies and drugstores. Unilever, Procter & Gamble, and Natura & Co were the top three companies in the Philippines’ skincare market by value in 2021, and Pond’s and Olay were the leading brands. “The resurgence of household disposable incomes, consumer confidence, and the return to offices will boost demand for skincare products in the Philippines. The ‘clean’ beauty trend will continue gaining momentum, thereby spurring the launch of more natural and sustainable skincare products,” concluded Likitha Nalluri."
The global nail care market is expected to grow rapidly for the next ten years,"The global nail care market - which was valued at USD 10.9 billion in 2021 - is estimated to reach USD 23.1 billion by the end of 2031, according to a study by Transparency Market Research (TMR). According to the market research firm, the global sales of nail care products (nail colours, nail care products, accessories) are likely to develop at a CAGR of 8.0% during the forecast period, from 2022 to 2031. In terms of products, the nail colour segment represents the most significant part of the nail care market. In this segment, the liquid nail colour sub-segment holds the largest market share and is followed by gel nail colour. This trend is projected to continue throughout the forecast period. Nevertheless, the nail treatment segment is likely to grow at a faster pace than the overall market. Sales are expected to grow in all geographic zones as women around the globe are becoming more independent and are investing a significant portion of their disposable income in grooming and beauty products. In 2021, Asia Pacific accounted for the major share of the global nail care market, followed by North America. The region is prognosticated to maintain its leading position in the nail care market throughout the forecast period, owing to many factors including a surge in the adoption of advanced technologies in different nail care products such as nail varnishes with special effects and bold colours, or long-lasting traditional manicures. Similarly, the increase in the use of latest finishes including glitter polishes, matte top coats, and magnetic nail polish in several developing nations including China and India is bolstering the Asia Pacific nail care market, note analysts at TMR. In addition to the surge in the interest about the nail care among the global population, TMR also points out the growing importance of social media exposure across the globe as a key growth driver in the nail care market. Indeed, according to TMR, women’s increased exposure to beauty enthusiasts and influencers through social media is boosting the interest for nail care across all demographics. While younger nail care consumers are more likely to wear nail paint to express their personality and keep up with current trends, older consumers are increasingly interested in products with nail care benefits. Companies in the nail care market are therefore increasing R&D efforts in order to provide next-gen products that can moisturize, strengthen, and make nails smoother. Some key players are also investing heavily in order to develop products that are specifically intended for the older population, add the authors of the report. However, rising concerns regarding the components in certain nail products is the main impediment to the category growth, note TMR analysts. Camphor, toluene, formaldehyde, and di-butyl phthalate, for instance, are pointed out as possible sources of side-effects or health problems. As a consequence, consumers are increasingly looking for more natural solutions but are not ready to make compromise on product functionality."
Export: Towards a record year 2022 for French cosmetics?,"The year 2022 should confirm the strong momentum observed last year for French beauty exports. Indeed, the French cosmetics industry’s exports rose by 19% during the first five months, compared to the same period in 2021, according to the French Federation of Beauty Companies (FEBEA). The first months of the year were marked by a very strong demand in the US. With an almost 32% increase, for a total of 2 billion euros of exports over this period, the US is ahead of China again, as the first export destination of made-in-France cosmetics. In Europe, Germany remains the main destination for French exports, with an equally impressive 32% sales increase. However, the Chinese market, the main growth driver over the past few years, has been less dynamic due to the sanitary restrictions implemented in the second quarter 2022. French cosmetics exports to this country still rose by 9% from January to May 2022, compared to the same period last year. Makeup and perfumes were the two most dynamic export categories during the first semester 2022. The products most exported to China are still lipsticks. As a reminder, in 2021, France exported more than one lipstick out of three to China. Perfumes are right behind. Perfumes are the top-selling products in the US and Germany. Then, there is eye makeup, in the US, and lipsticks, in Germany. If things keep going at this pace, the French cosmetics industry, which already exports 60% of its production, could beat new records. “This strong increase confirms that French cosmetics still make people dream all around the world! We can definitely hope to reach 20 billion euros of exports in 2022,” says Emmanuel Guichard, General-Delegate of the FEBEA, although he explains that these good results are also due to the increased value of the dollar, compared to the euro. “With a value chain firmly anchored in the French industrial network, the cosmetics sector manages to keep producing and exporting despite supply shortages,” concludes Emmanuel Guichard. In 2021, total French exports of cosmetic products had reached 16.2 billion euros."

United Kingdom: Prestige beauty sales benefit from the premiumisation trend,"Sales of super-sized and potent formula prestige beauty products report double digit growth in the six months of 2022 in the United Kingdom, according to The NPD Group. The prestige beauty market was valued at GBP 926 million in the first half of 2022, an increase of 23% on the same period in 2021. According to the market research firm, this dynamism is linked to the trend of premiumisation where consumers upgrade their beauty purchases to include larger sizes and more potent formulas. Consumers also appear to be upgrading their purchases to items with a higher price point, a trend observed in the foundation market. The average sales price of prestige beauty products in the first half of 2022 increased by 8%, compared to the same period last year. The premiumisation trend is most evident in the prestige fragrance market. Both men’s and women’s Eau de Parfum and Perfume formats have increased in importance and are growing faster than the rest of the market. In the first half of 2022 sales of women’s perfume formats rose 137% compared to the same period in 2021 and sales of men’s perfume formats doubled at 100% in the same period. Total sales of women’s fragrance juices (including formats like Eau de Toilette, Eau de Parfum and Perfume) increased 34% and sales of fragrance juices over 100ml in size rose 50% in the first half of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. Sales of fragrance juices in the first half of 2022 with a retail price over GBP 125 now equate to 11% of the mix of total fragrance sales compared to 7% of the mix of total fragrance sales in the first half of 2021. Sales of these products with a retail price of GBP 125 and above increased 91% in the first half of 2022, compared to the sales for the total fragrance market where the uptick was 33%. The average sales price of prestige foundations was GBP 30 in the first half of 2022, an increase of 10% compared to the same period last year. This is driven by innovation and newly launched products. The top five new foundation products launched in the first half of 2022 have an average sales price between GBP 32.45 and GBP 37.69, demonstrating the impact of premiumization in this sub-segment. The average sales price for women’s skincare products increased 7% in the first half of 2022, compared to the same period last year. Women’s prestige skincare sales were up 8% year-on-year whilst mid-range skincare sales increased just 4%, indicating that women are opting for more premium products with a higher price point. “Consumers are increasingly choosing to buy more premium products with a higher average sales price in the prestige beauty market. While we recognize that there is pressure on people’s expenditure now, and people are seeking better value for money, and larger sizes and more potent formulas are more cost effective to buy,” explains Emma Fishwick, Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. “We believe that people are buying less and upgrading their purchases to those with more innovative formulations (as in make-up and skincare) and in fragrance they are opting for more expensive bottles and the most potent fragrance formulas. There is also the lure of premium brands where people can ‘buy into’ designer brands in an affordable way.”"
"Cosmoprof North America completes its 2022 edition with 32,000 visitors","Cosmoprof North America successfully concluded its 19th edition from July 12-14, 2022, at the Las Vegas Convention Center, a shift from the Mandalay Bay Convention Center previously. The trade show welcomed attendees from across the globe at its new location across a new two-hall format which saw Cosmopack North America, the event dedicated to the entire beauty supply chain, with its dedicated hall for the first time. Throughout the three-day event, 32,000 retailers, distributors, investors, beauty brands, suppliers, and the press connected with over 1,100 exhibiting brands to discover new product launches and facilitate business. In addition to the new location and two-hall format, the 19th edition also unveiled a new categorization of finished products into four macro categories: hair care, skin care & makeup, nails, and natural products. Alongside these macro-categories were the return of special areas Discover Beauty, Discover Beauty Spotlights, Discover Green, and The Beauty Vanities, in addition to the Country Pavilions, featuring brands organized by international delegations from Argentina, Chile, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Italy, Korea, Morocco, and Spain. New special areas Discover Black-Owned Beauty, highlighting Black-owned and founded beauty brands that was curated in collaboration with The Beauty International Group, and Beauty Tech, highlighting companies providing the latest technological and digital solutions, made their debuts in the West Hall and North Hall respectively. The show also saw the return of the Buyer Program, connecting exhibitors with leading retailers, e-commerce platforms, international buyers, distributors, and brands including Aminco, Bloomingdale’s, Cos Bar, The Detox Market, Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, Revlon, Shiseido, and Space NK along with first-time participants Target and Coupang, South Korea’s largest online marketplace.

Entrepreneur Academy, a unique one-day intensive workshop for up-and-coming beauty entrepreneurs, was sold-out, as was the newly offered Cosmopack Education, with each of its nine beauty supply chain-centered sessions standing room only. Also returning was the CosmoTrends report, featuring trends showcased among exhibitors, including FILL IT UP (refillable beauty), LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX, SUPERCHARGED SERUMS, TEXTURED TRESSES, ETHICALLY SOURCED, and WFH SPA, and the Cosmoprof and Cosmopack North America Awards, which honored the best in beauty among exhibitors across seven categories live at the event. Both initiatives were conducted in strategic partnership with Beautystreams. Other notable highlights of the show included Boutique, the onsite sampling bar featuring deluxe-sized samples from 20 brands with proceeds donated to Strength In Beauty (A CUT IT OUT® grant for industry professionals), and the Press Zone, which connected exhibitors with influencers and press from leading publications like Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, Refinery29, NewBeauty Seventeen, and Women’s Wear Daily for one-on-one meetings. Also, the newly launched Innovation Studio at Cosmopack, showcasing innovation in the beauty supply chain across two installations on the show floor: LIFESCAPES, also in collaboration with BEAUTYSTREAMS, and Packaging Power!, presented by the FIT’s Packaging Design BFA Program. Cosmoprof North America will celebrate its 20th edition at the Las Vegas Convention Center on July 11-13, 2023."
Dopamine beauty: When colour and makeup make a powerful comeback!,"What if makeup would have a positive effect on mood? This is one of the explanations given for the famous “lipstick index”, which means that lip makeup sales skyrocket during or after crises. After the profusion of natural and authentic beauty looks seen since the beginning of the pandemic, colour appears to make a powerful comeback, precisely to give a much-needed lift in morale! Researchers at France’s National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) have described dopamine as a chemical substance used as a neurotransmitter that produces a state of satisfaction. While a lack of dopamine can lead to a drop in motivation, mood swings or significant fatigue, it is possible to naturally boost its production through certain foods rich in tyrosine, such as avocado, banana, and of course chocolate, as well as through exercise, exposure to sunlight, or enjoying certain activities like listening to music or simply stroking an animal. But chromatherapy - or colour therapy - could also promote happiness, hence the rise of #dopaminebeauty - also known as #dopaminemakeup - which has taken over social networks in recent weeks. Just type the hashtags #dopaminebeauty and #dopaminemakeup into TikTok, and you’ll soon see a joyous riot of colours. Rainbow or two-tone eyeshadows, in bold, vibrant shades, multicoloured eyeliner, and glitter galore, all seem to have invaded the social network, and for good cause. The idea is to indulge all imaginable fantasies — within reason — with vivid, zesty colours, temporary tattoos, stickers and more. In short, it’s about having fun. And for the less daring, this can simply be a matter of stepping up their makeup doses, whether it’s blush, lipstick or lip gloss, or showing some flights of fancy in small touches. Those who don’t have to go as far as fluorescent eyeshadow, can still try adding a line of coloured eyeliner, a mouth-watering lip colour, or even flashy nail polish to draw attention to their hands. On TikTok, there’s even a #dopaminenails hashtag, which is all about using bold shades on the nails to feel better…"
Lipsticks regain colour and bank on customization,"After two years of slowdown, the makeup category is growing again, both in the US and Europe. “There is a sort of catch-up phenomenon,” explains Mathilde Lion, Expert Beauty Europe at The NPD Group. “Today, makeup is the most dynamic category of Prestige sales, compared to 2021, with a +42% growth rate between January and May 2022 in European countries including the Big 5 [1],” she explains. “However, it is still -23% compared to 2019, so there is still a long way to go.” According to NPD, lipsticks represent one of the most dynamic segments since the beginning of the year, with a +74% growth, compared to 2021 in Europe. “But it is still 48% lower than 2019, whereas the nail segment has completely recovered: it has even achieved a 5% growth, compared to 2019. As such, it is a reversal in trends, because the pre-Covid years had been marked by a sharp decline of this segment,” says Mathilde Lion. This growth is mainly due to the share of ‘long-lasting’ products, which are doing well with 60% of lipstick sales, compared to 56% in 2019. “Today, long-lasting lipsticks are a must-have, but natural ingredients, symbiosis with skincare, and refills are also very strong trends. We will see whether the refill concept lasts when refill sales statistics get significant,” explains Mathilde Lion. At the peak of the crisis, eco-design and customization innovations helped boost these products. At the CES 2021 show, YSL Beauté, a brand of the L’Oréal Group, showcased Rouge Sur Mesure Powered by Perso, the first connected device to create your own customized lipstick at home. This device makes a lipstick in just a few minutes… Maison M Paris developed a similar technology: the brand devised a customization concept of a new kind soon to be marketed. Consumers will choose three shades among the 60,000 colours available, on their own or according to an AI recommendation based on a photo diagnosis. The three shades will then be inserted in a ‘stick’, so users can simply switch from one colour to another, depending on their moods or on the occasion. The liquid shades are produced in single units based on a technology patented by the brand. “Brands offer plenty of colours and 80% of women have more than three shades at home. So, we imagined a system to unite them in only one lipstick. It is more convenient, greener, and completely customized,” says Marie Rocchisani, the concept creator. The long-wear, no transfer liquid formulas of this 3-in-1 product are composed of ingredients of natural origin. Each capsule can be refilled independently of the others. The Maison M lipstick will be available online for about 49 euros, and the refill will cost about 29 euros. In the long run, the brand founder plans to install her patented system in stores, where the product will be made upon request with the help of a beauty advisor. Following the same principle, since December 2021, the young, independent French brand Bâton Rouge has offered customers to make their own tailor-made lipstick in a store. After four years of technical and regulatory developments, the brand opened its first point of sale in the Marais neighbourhood in Paris. With the help of a professional makeup artist, customers can create their own shade among infinite possibilities and choose the perfume and texture they want to get a unique lipstick. “All colour shades, all tones and undertones are possible. Customers can also pick up a perfume among a choice of five – they are all 100% natural and free from allergens – and one texture: liquid, solid, satin, matte, or one with natural ingredients. The market, in particular the French market, lacked such a concept,” says Christelle Percheron, the creator of Bâton Rouge. The customized colour is created with the makeup artist during the sampling phase, based on pigments pre-dispersed in castor oil. Customers test the sample on their lips and modulate it until they are satisfied with the result. “We can play with all shades – red, pinky red, orange, or blue – like a painter playing with pigments to lighten, darken, or fade a colour,” describes the founder. Once the choice has been validated, the stick is made straight away, in just a few minutes. Bâton Rouge boasts an eco-responsible, transparent approach, with products made upon request in their laboratory-store. Solid formula packs can be refilled and the products are presented in pouches made from organic cotton as secondary packaging. “We make products upon request, so there is no stock, no waste. Our customers mainly come for the experience: for the tailor-made colour, the experience with the makeup artist. It is definitely a moment of pleasure for them. And the eco-responsible approach is a real plus,” says Christelle Percheron. These new consumption patterns can definitely put a smile (back) on people’s faces!"
Fragrances: The main driving trends of the 12th edition of Esxence,"This 2022 edition was marked by the presence of floral notes. After two gloomy years, brands are encouraging us to see ""life infused with roses"". The queen of flowers dominated the launches of the first half of the year (Diptyque’s L’Eau Rose, L’Artisan Parfumeur’s Mémoire de Roses, Tom Ford’s three new roses, Guerlain’s La Petite Robe Noire Rose Rose Rose, Chanel’s Paris-Paris...). A trend confirmed at Esxence, where roses were ever-present, like Rose Ardoise by Atelier Materi, a blend of Centifolia and Damascena roses, with spicy notes on a mineral base, or Jardin des Avelines by Pont des Arts, a balmy, woody rose by Bertrand Duchaufour. White flowers are not outdone, prized for their luminous and positive character, like Isabey’s Avant et Après, a lovely sunny composition refreshed by a salty breeze. Long shunned as ""outdated"", lily of the valley, a symbol of happiness, is making its comeback (Eau Guillerette, by Anatole Lebreton). Brands are continuing to explore the ""feel good"", sweet and reassuring side of orange blossom, which is very much in vogue. But confinements have also revived the desire to reconnect with nature, a phenomenon that also applies to niche perfumery. Green notes are reinvented with a vegetal approach, to express a need for a breath of fresh air, a return to green areas. This thirst for exoticism also draws on the freshness of marine notes. For a few years now, aquatic notes have been making a comeback, in a play of contrasts with amber, woody and gourmand accords... This trend is enhanced by a strong presence of mineral and iodine facets reminiscent of summer days, from ocean spray to sun-kissed skins. Uermi’s Il Solo Dentra, by Pierre Guéros (Symrise), is a good example of this trend, combining sunny and salty notes with the green breath of geranium on a gourmand base. The time has come for olfactory nomadism. Brands have understood this and are focusing on lightness, offering 30, 20 or 10 ml bottles. Smaller sizes are more suitable for consumers who regularly switch from one fragrance to another. A trend that is also in line with the layering trend, which is very much in vogue at the moment. Indeed, ""traditional"" niche brands, such as L’Artisan Parfumeur or Parfums de Rosine, encourage their customers to combine fragrances within their range. This is part of the DNA of Olibanum, the new brand of Gérald Ghislain, founder of Histoire de Parfums, who presents incense notes combined with duos of ingredients, presented in 12 and 50 ml bottles, to layer according to one’s desires. In perfumery too, the trend of naturalness is gaining momentum. Many brands claim to have 95% natural ingredients in their formulas, like Bastille Parfums. A bias that can be found in a growing number of brands, even if it is not their primary concept (Obvious, Cherigan...). Others are making the 100% natural their identity, like Floratropia, Parfumeurs du Monde or Hiram Green, an artisanal brand whose fragrances are surprisingly complex for this type of product. Alongside the natural trend, there is a real appetite for technological innovations. Headspace, the new brand founded by Nicolas Chabot (Le Galion, Aether) made quite a splash in Milan. An original project, based on the headspace technique, a new extraction method that allows capturing the scent of a plant when it is impossible with classic extraction techniques. An opportunity to discover compositions that enhance skin headspaces, champagne, or nature after a storm... Finally, there is a growing number of brands with an ecological stance, in terms of packaging (recyclable materials, refillable bottles) and sourcing of ingredients (upcycling, biodegradable materials). This is the concept of the Obvious brand created by David Frossard, based on eco-responsible perfumery: organic alcohol, recycled and recyclable glass bottles, agglomerated cork caps from wine cork production waste, recyclable cellophane-free paper cases. Many brands are taking on this environmental issue (Cherigan, The Different Company, Stéphanie de Bruijn...). A trend that is as commendable as it is unavoidable, although the frantic number of launches may call into question the paradox of this ""sustainability"". A pace that is not likely to slow down, considering the new products and labels that have marked this 12th edition of Esxence."
How #Barbiecore is bringing gender extremes back to the forefront of fashion,"The post-pandemic period is ultimately quite surprising! Not only many women have decided to move on from the comfort of sweatpants to embrace more extravagant clothing styles, bright colours and mismatched patterns, but some of them are choosing to dress like Barbie... Dubbed ""Barbiecore"", the trend imposes all things pink, ultra-short, ultra-tight and ultra-kitsch, the exact opposite to non-gendered fashion. The #Barbiecore wardrobe is stereotypical in the extreme - channeling fun, glamour and ramped up femininity - close to the aesthetic of the video of late-1990s Barbie Girl song, by Danish band Aqua, that was an ode — albeit an ironic one — to the dream life of the popular plastic doll. This aesthetic, inspired by Barbie’s world, above all translates into an explosion of pink, a colour already adopted by a host of stars across the Atlantic. Megan Fox didn’t miss the opportunity to step out in the shade when attending the premiere of the documentary about her dear and beloved Machine Gun Kelly, aptly titled  ""Life in Pink."" She took to the red carpet in a Barbie-esque outfit. An experience that she repeated the following days on the streets of New York. But the American actress is far from the only one taking style cues from Barbie. Hailey Bieber posted a picture on Instagram showing her wearing an outfit directly inspired by the world of the famous doll — a pink skin-tight mini-dress and XXL platform boots. Similarly, the now blonde Kim Kardashian went as far as accessorizing her metallic pink outfit with a matching handbag adorned with multiple glittering embellishments. Meanwhile her sister Khloe posted pictures of herself looking like Barbie in a pink latex minidress with pink shoes and blonde locks. After two particularly gloomy years, the idea is to show off and have fun, summer being the ideal season to do both. This is precisely what could make this trend last!  life of this born! Born with the first images of the filming of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie movie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the #Barbiecore wave could survive the summer. The fall-winter 2022 shows proved a real ode to pink, starting with Valentino, which splashed the shade on dozens of looks, both in women’s and men’s styles. But the fashion house isn’t alone in bringing pink to its collections. Michael Kors, Versace, Act No. 1 and Dolce & Gabbana are among the brands that hope to keep pink-tinted fashion on the agenda for a few more months."
Natural personal care products market reached USD 12.5 billion in 2021,"Global sales of natural and organic personal care products have reached USD 12.5 billion last year, according to a new research by Ecovia Intelligence [1]. The global market revenues increased by 5.4 percent in 2021. However, the market research firm expects slower growth in 2022 as rising raw material prices, inflation and economic uncertainty are having a negative impact on sales. Most natural and organic personal care product sales are from North America and Europe, but Asia is the market showing the highest growth, with revenues increasing exponentially over the last decade. “High investment is coming into the Asian natural and organic products market, with large cosmetic firms launching their own lines whilst the financial community is investing in established brands”, said Ecovia Intelligence. Furthermore, new players continue to enter the natural and organic personal care products market. L’Oréal and Unilever are the leading multinationals acquiring natural and organic brands. Another strategy consists in launching natural or organic versions of best-selling products. Colgate-Palmolive, for instance, launched their first COSMOS certified natural toothpaste in mainstream retailers in Europe. Product innovations are also stimulating market growth; Carrefour, one of Europe’s largest retailers, launched the Soft Green brand last year. The Carrefour Soft Green range has certified organic soaps and solid shampoos in plastic-free packaging. O’Right and Upcircle Beauty are two brands using upcycled ingredients in their natural personal care ranges. Widening distribution is another major driver of market growth. Natural food shops and organic food shops are the traditional sales channels; they still comprise most sales in Europe and North America. Distribution of natural and organic personal care products is increasing in department stores, beauty retailers, pharmacies and drugstores. Online retailing and digital marketing have become more important since the pandemic. Eventually, Ecovia Intelligence finds the number of natural & organic standards is growing. There are now over 30 standards worldwide; COSMOS and NATRUE are the frontrunners. Initially adopted in Europe, both standards now have an international following. Almost 40,000 personal care products are now certified according to these standards."
"U.S. consumers are back to their former makeup habits, NPD finds","“As women get dressed up again, makeup is a natural accompaniment,” said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. “The recovery and creativity of the makeup category is leading sales gains for the prestige beauty industry in 2022. After a gloomy period shrouded by the pandemic, we are seeing a renaissance in makeup artistry, as consumers experiment with color again.” In fact, about 70% of makeup wearers in the U.S. have returned to previous routines or are wearing more makeup than they did last year, according to The NPD Group, and the use of several makeup products is on the rise. Findings from the 2022 “Makeup Attitudes and Usage Report” from NPD show that mascara is the most used makeup product overall, followed by foundation, eye shadow, eye liner, and lipstick. In the U.S., sales revenue of the prestige makeup category grew by 22%, from January through May 2022, versus last year. That’s more than twice the rate of skincare, and faster than fragrance, according to Retail Tracking Service data from NPD. Women report that they primarily wear makeup to enhance their appearance; however, Gen Z and Millennial women wear makeup mainly to boost their confidence. Across generations, almost 30% of women wear makeup because they say it brings them joy. “The pandemic shifted our definition of wellness, moving it beyond the physical to be more about mental health and well-being,” Jensen said. “Makeup products are satisfying an emotional need to look good and feel better about ourselves.” NPD’s data are comforted by figures recently released by Global Data, which found that 46% of US women have used more makeup in 2022 than during the pandemic: A similar trend was observed in France where prestige makeup sales were up 8% during the week starting March 14, 2022 when the obligation to wear a mask in all public venues was lifted. While broader figures have not been released to date, there are reasons to be optimistic as most European countries have returned to growth and to an almost normal social life, and as tourists are flocking back to usual European summer destinations. In China, however, the COVID-19 outbreak during the second half of March, led to regional lockdowns and an increase in mask use that caused prestige e-commerce beauty sales to decline 1% for the month. According to NPD, makeup and fragrance categories experienced respective declines of 6% and 4% in March 2022, compared to last year. While restrictions were maintained in April and part of May in some major cities, including Shanghai, the situation has improved at then end of May, just in time for the kick off of China’s 618 Shopping Festival."
"Short hair, don’t care: Saudi working women embrace cropped locks","The haircut — known locally by the English word ""boy"" — has become strikingly visible on the streets of the capital, and not just because women are no longer required to wear hijab headscarves under social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler. As more women join the workforce, a central plank of government efforts to remake the Saudi economy, many describe the ""boy"" cut as a practical, professional alternative to the longer styles they might have preferred in their pre-working days. For Safi, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym to preserve her anonymity, the look also serves as a form of protection from unwanted male attention, allowing her to focus on her patients. ""People like to see femininity in a woman’s appearance,"" she said. ""This style is like a shield that protects me from people and gives me strength."" At one salon in central Riyadh, demand for the ""boy"" cut has spiked — with seven or eight customers out of 30 requesting it on any given day, said Lamis, a hairdresser. ""This look has become very popular now,"" she said. ""The demand for it has increased, especially after women entered the labour market. The fact that many women do not wear the hijab has highlighted its spread"" while spurring even more customers to try it out, especially women in their late teens and twenties,” she said. The lifting of the headscarf requirement is just one of many changes that have reordered daily life for Saudi women under Prince Mohammed, who was named as the heir to his 86-year-old father, King Salman, five years ago. Saudi women are no longer banned from concerts and sports events, and in 2018 they gained the right to drive. The kingdom has also eased so-called guardianship rules, meaning women can now obtain passports and travel abroad without a male relative’s permission. Such reforms, however, have been accompanied by a crackdown on women’s rights activists, part of a broader campaign against dissent. Getting more women to work is a major component of Prince Mohammed’s Vision 2030 reform plan to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on oil. The plan initially called for women to account for 30 percent of the workforce by the end of the decade, but already that figure has reached 36 percent, assistant tourism minister Princess Haifa Al-Saud told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. ""We see women today in every single job type,"" Princess Haifa said, noting that 42 percent of small and medium-sized enterprises are women-owned. Many working women interviewed by AFP praised the ""boy"" cut as a tool for navigating their new professional lives. ""I am a practical woman and I don’t have time to take care of my hair,"" said Abeer Mohammed, a 41-year-old mother of two who runs a men’s clothing store. ""My hair is curly, and if my hair grows long, I will have to spend time that is not available to me taking care of it in the morning."" Saudi Arabia has traditionally outlawed men who ""imitate women"" or wear women’s clothing, and vice versa. But Rose, a 29-year-old shoe saleswoman at a Riyadh mall, sees her close-cropped hair as a means of asserting her independence from men, not imitating them. It ""gives me strength and self-confidence... I feel different, and able to do what I want without anyone’s guardianship"", said Rose, who did not want to give her full name. ""At first my family rejected the look, but over time they got used to it,"" she added. Such acceptance partly reflects the influence of Arab stars like actress Yasmin Raeis or singer Shirene who have adopted the style, said Egyptian stylist Mai Galal to AFP. Nouf, who works in a cosmetics store and preferred not to give her family name, described the message of the ""boy"" cut this way: ""We want to say that we exist, and our role in society does not differ much from that of men."" Short hair, she added, is ""a show of women’s strength""."

"A staple of the 1990s, permanent makeup is on the rise as a beauty go-to","The pandemic, through its lockdowns and mask wearing, disrupted the beauty routine of many women around the world. Gone are lipsticks, contouring and other techniques to achieve a perfect complexion. The focus has now shifted to skincare, which has replaced cosmetics intended to camouflage all sorts of imperfections rather than actually improving skin texture. And it’s a trend that appears to be persisting beyond the pandemic, even if mask wearing is no longer mandatory in many countries around the world. These changes have helped bring back one trend that was thought to have fallen by the wayside: permanent makeup. Very popular in the 1990s, permanent makeup techniques are once again winning over those in search of a more natural beauty look. That might sound paradoxical, but it actually makes sense. Beauty is no longer about spending hours in the bathroom plastering on layers of foundation, concealer and other correctors, but about enhancing the eyes and mouth through perfectly shaped — and subtly tinted — eyebrows and lips. Actually, permanent makeup is, in fact, closer to the art of tattooing than to makeup, but with one key difference: it most often relies on dermopigmentation. In other words, it involves introducing a coloured substance — a pigment — via micro-needles into the superficial layer of the dermis (or skin) — much less deep than a tattoo, and therefore less permanent since the pigments decompose over the years. It is most often used to add colour to a specific area, whether to fill out sparse eyebrows, to redraw the contour of the lips, to add colour to pale lips, or even to enhance the eyes. If permanent makeup may have traumatized many people in the 1990s, techniques have evolved in recent years to offer a more natural — and discreet — result. Gone are the days of leaving a beauty parlour with frozen-in-place eyebrows, or worse, with an ultra-contrasting lip outline. The goal today is to save time with a natural but enhanced look focusing on pale shades, allowing yourself the luxury of skipping a few steps in your daily routine, but without going overboard. This is a concept that’s well understood by today’s professionals, who now offer all these services. Permanent makeup techniques are many and varied, but a lot of the options involve eyebrows. Microblading (1.8 billion views on TikTok) is undoubtedly one of the most common techniques, since it can reproduce a hair-like effect using pigments, and can therefore effectively reshape brows and thicken them according to the desired result. Microshading, on the other hand, uses pin-like dots to offer a more powdery finish, as if you’d used a simple eyebrow pencil. The more recent micrograyling technique works on the same principle, except that it is aimed at those with a more complex natural brow shape, and who simply want to reduce the sparse appearance. But permanent makeup is also a great ally for women whose lip contour has faded over time. Candy lips is one of the most popular techniques, which can redraw the outline of the lips through a process of micropigmentation, while also adding colour, thus creating a more voluminous effect. Some also use it to correct any potential asymmetry. And if you want to go even further, it is now possible to get an eyeliner line, or even an eyeshadow effect, applied permanently, in just a few sessions, or even to add a few freckles here and there, in line with a major trend of the moment. However, the main disadvantage of permanent makeup is that it sometimes lasts longer than trends. While permanent makeup fades with time — the duration depends on many factors such as age or sun exposure – one’s should still think carefully before taking the plunge. For example, while thick eyebrows have been all the rage for several years, there have been several attempts to bring skinny brows back into fashion in recent months."
The top three beauty trends spotted at Cosmoprof Bologna 2022,"Most of the key trends spotted amongst the finished beauty products at Cosmoprof Bologna this year are related to sustainable, eco-friendly and climate-conscious lifestyles. This mega-trend has been gathering pace during the pandemic and is growing stronger and more inclusive every year. As a result plastic-free and zero waste brand concepts were visible everywhere on the show floor, as were water-conscious products in various iterations. Let’s also note that vegan has become the norm for newcomer brands, especially those from the clean beauty and organic space. Solid hair and body care formats have been dominating beauty launches in recent years. However, many of the new bath and body care solids presented at the show had little to do with the classic square shampoo or shower bars, as newcomer and indie brands are coming up with ever more sophisticated product formulae and designs. Organic Korean beauty brand Urang Natural’s new Moringa Healthy Scalp Shampoo Bar, for example, has been formulated with soap noodles which help generate an extra creamy foam, and with moringa extract for scalp-conditioning. The ovoid shape of the solid shampoo is comfortable to grip with wet hands and its rough surface lathers up quickly. Similarly, the Lithuanian solid beauty brand Solidu Cosmetics uses processed plant oils as a base in its Thyme Body Butter (rather than the more commonly used shea butter or cocoa butter) so the easy-grip hexagonally-shaped body moisturizer melts quickly into the skin without leaving it sticky. There was also a wave of solid face care launches at the show. Depending on their positioning, brands are marketing solid face care sticks as plastic-free/reduced packaging alternatives or as more convenient, fun and travel-friendly products. Korean beauty brand Cetena introduced several twist-up facial moisturizers including a Multi Balm formulated with avocado oil and macadamia oil. Fellow K-beauty brand Lovbod presented its new Dark Spots brightening stick formulated with soothing bisabolol and sweet almond oil to hydrate and lighten discoloured skin patches, while Canada’s Attitude launched several solid face and body care ranges, including an entire line of cardboard-packaged sun care sticks with mineral filters. As dry products are much lighter, need less packaging and generate a lower CO2 footprint in terms of manufacturing and shipping, anhydrous beauty products - in the shape of tablets, powders or flakes - were also highly popular at the show. They also supply a fun DIY touch as they are designed to be reconstituted with water by the consumer at home. Lebanese brand Beesline received one of the show’s Awards for its new Deodorizing Roll-On, a vegan deodorant tablet that turns into a liquid deodorant formula once dissolved in water. Organic beauty brand Ben & Anna from Germany, who originally started out with baking soda deodorants, has launched a compressed soap tablet available in two fragrance variants which can be used to create liquid hand soaps. Zero-waste also continued to be a popular concept in both product packaging and ingredients/formulations, with more and more brands using upcycled or rescued food waste ingredients. Vegan UK brand Upcircle Beauty was one of the first European body care brands to utilize food industry waste ingredients in its products - the company started out with bath and body care formulated with upcycled coffee grounds. Today Upcircle Beauty also uses other food waste by-products: the brand’s recent hand wash and body lotion duo launch contains upcycled bergamot and kiwi fruit waters. And fellow British indie brand Fruu Cosmetics formulates its 40-sku range of solid hair, skin and body care products with food industry wastes such as fruit skins, pulp, juices and extracts. Brands also continued to highlight key ingredients in their products especially when sourced locally, combining transparency in terms of ingredients sourcing  with localism and a pride in regional/national heritage. Swiss newcomer brand Chiara Zurich’s 6-sku face care range is based on glacier water which is sourced from the Titlis mountain near Lucerne where the brand’s founder comes from. Korean indie brand Sioris’ recently launched The Only One gel-textured facial essence, which is based on Korean bellflower extract. Similarly, Danish organic company Unique’s latest brand launch — vegan, gender-free face, body and hair care line Beauhe:it — contains a whole range of typically Scandinavian plant ingredients. Eventually, let’s mention Irish brand Green Angel’s new Hyaluronic Spheres Serum, which has been formulated with locally collected seaweed and algae extracts. This sharpened focus on ingredients can be traced back to the functional beauty trend which was also playing a major role at the show. Many brands presented active ingredients in the shape of intensive serums and ampoules. Classic actives like hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, retinol or niacinamide were especially visible in the ranges of brands such as Turkey’s The Purest Solutions or UK’s Nature Spell. However, there were also a number of brands highlighting pro-biotics and ferments as their key functional active, like South African brand Esse’s Probiotic Serum. Personalisation continues to be a key source of innovation in beauty, in particular in categories such as face care. Cosmoprof Bologna 2022 featured a number of exhibitors showcasing different angles on product personalization. DIY concepts like active ingredients in serum/booster form to tweak beauty products or brands offering a neutral base cream plus suitable actives to customize a face cream are still popular. However, the advent of smart tech, digitalisation and DNA beauty is opening entirely new possibilities for consumers and brands alike. Spanish brand Lesielle’s Adaptive Skin Care concept includes a small machine that mixes individual portions of skin care by combining actives with a base cream. Swiss beauty tech manufacturer Réduit received one of the Cosmoprof Awards for its new Booster, an AI-driven hand-held applicator for creams and lotions that promises more efficient ingredients delivery. Eventually, Genetica 23 from Italy offers personalized cosmetics based on DNA analysis, a detailed face scan analysis and comprehensive questionnaire."
"Wheat, oats, corn: grains are on the menu of new beauty routines","The pandemic has helped boost the success of many natural ingredients in cosmetics. As a result, grandma’s own recipes are now all the rage on social media, riding the wave of DIY, with an emphasis on plants, seeds, and flowers that are perceived as safe for the skin and for the planet. Nettle, aloe vera, and tea are among the must-haves that have come back into fashion in recent months, as have broccoli, onions, and even mustard, which are more unusual. And if we were already betting on rice and flax as 2022 must-haves at the beginning of the year, it’s finally all the grains — or almost all of them — that are getting ready to make their entry into bathrooms. Although we know the health benefits of consuming grains, which are rich in fibre and minerals, their benefits for the skin remain a mystery to many. In this respect, generalizations should be avoided because corn does not have the same properties as rice, oats or rye, thus affecting each type of skin and answering each need differently. Some of the most well-known are the moisturizing and anti-aging properties of wheat; the purifying, soothing, and regenerating qualities of oats; the nourishing power of sesame; and the multiple properties of rice, which combine all these benefits. A growing number of cosmetic brands are harnessing the power of grains, gradually integrating them into their formulas. Some have even made it their trademark. One such example is La Belle Meunière, which claims to be the first line of cosmetic products made with grains from French organic farming. From masks to scrubs, moisturizers, radiance serums and makeup remover oils, the brand offers everything you need for a complete routine, with the possibility of making some products yourself in DIY style. All guaranteed natural, vegan, made in France, and transparent. The beauty industry now uses grains in a wide range of products from vegetable oil to shampoo, and even more specific treatments such as eye creams. Aroma-Zone, for instance, offers vegetable oils made from rice bran, oats, sesame and wheat germ. All of which meet the many needs of skin, whether or not they are combined with other ingredients. Other brands choose to offer cosmetics in which the powers of grains are boosted by other ingredients. This is the case of Centifolia and its Sublime Jeunesse eye cream, which combines buckwheat [1] oil extracts and green micro-algae to reduce dark circles and puffiness while improving skin tone, and Body Nature’s Soothing Shampoo, formulated with oat milk, barley water and sage infusion to cleanse and soothe the scalp. At The Body Shop, you’ll find the Almond Milk with Oats Instant Soothing Mask to exfoliate the most sensitive skin, while Qiriness offers the Exfolys Rice Wrap to unclog and tighten pores. A growing number of all kinds of cosmetics that show a definite taste for the previously unsuspected powers of grains for the skin - and you may want to ask for more."
Ecocert believes in fair trade development in the cosmetics industry,"The pandemic has considerably impacted consumer habits. For more than 72% of French people, consuming less and better has become a requirement [1]. Inevitably, this consumption trend has impacted the cosmetics sector and brands have had to reinvent themselves. In 2021, the number of products certified organic or natural by Ecocert has increased by 30%. The French market for natural and organic cosmetics is also booming, with a growth of 12% in 2021, while sales of mainstream cosmetics are down by 6.1% [2]. Today, 74% of French people surveyed would like to have more information on the environmental and societal impact of the products they buy [3]. This is the whole point of certification, emphasises Ecocert, as it guarantees compliance with a stringent set of specifications. For instance, more than 29,000 products and 18,000 ingredients in some fifty countries are currently certified under the COSMOS Organic or Natural label by Ecocert. To go even further, the Ecocert Group is committed to labelling so-called ethical cosmetic products and ingredients with the Fair For Life (FFL) label. Created in 2006, Fair for Life is an international fair trade label for food products, cosmetics, textiles and handicraft products. It applies throughout the supply chain, from production to distribution, to secure supply chains and establish long-term fair contractual partnerships. This translates into long-term contractual commitments: a fair purchase price, a minimum guaranteed price, the financing of collective projects, a commitment to expected volumes, pre-financing, technical support... In 2021, the number of Fair For Life labelled beauty brands amounted to 33, with nearly 350 products. These figures are in fact quite low, considering the size of the global beauty market, but they could increase in the coming years with the redefinition of certain criteria as of 1 June 2022. The new version of the Fair For Life labelling standard seeks to adjust to the reality of the cosmetics market and to some products with complex formulas. Before this update, all ingredients were screened except for water, salt and minerals. From 1 June 2022, petrochemical preservatives and so-called complex ingredients of natural origin, which in practice cannot be labelled ethical and fair trade, will also be excluded. For Ecocert, the aim is to make the scheme available to more companies to help them structure themselves and commit to an increasingly ethical approach focused on people, their working conditions and fair remuneration. Over the past 15 years, Ecocert teams have seen the list of Fair For Life labelled cosmetic ingredients grow. The cosmetics industry’s Fair Trade sectors offer some 80 increasingly diversified ingredients such as shea butter, argan oil, aloe vera, moringa, coconut oil, sesame oil, or illipe butter, recently labelled by Expanscience... ""Being Fair For Life labelled will enable brands to enhance the value of the raw materials they use in their cosmetic products,"" explains Pauline Raffaitin, Head of the Ecocert Home & Personal Care Business Unit. It is also an opportunity for some brands to consolidate their historical commitments. Hence, for Justine Humbert, Biodiversity & Sustainable Ingredients Manager at the L’Occitane Group, ethical cosmetics involve products which, ""through their manufacturing, distribution and use, respect both women and men (be they the company’s employees, suppliers, partners or consumers) and the environment."" For L’Occitane, which boasts the double label - COSMOS and Fair For Life - for some of its ingredients and products, fair trade certification is both a proof of commitment in terms of trade practices and support to our partners, but also, specifies Justine Humbert, ""a highly structuring approach for securing our supplies.""  A concern that could not be more topical!"
"""Jello Skin"": Korea’s beauty routine that promotes firm and plump skin","K-beauty - or Korean beauty - remains one of the major drivers of the beauty trends that land thick and fast on TikTok. The latest in line is a new viral skincare trend called ""Jello Skin."" ""Jello Skin"" evidently refers to Jell-O, the brightly coloured gelatine dessert well known in the US and Canada. The account of TikTok influencer @glowwithava, who regularly shares tips and tricks with her 1.4 million followers, has become somewhat emblematic of this viral skincare trend - so much so that she even labels her various accounts with the #jelloskin hashtag - a hashtag that counts no less than 14.2 million views on TikTok. However, before being a beauty routine, ""Jello Skin"" is a way to describe firm, plump skin - bouncy like gelatin - and the many tips and tricks straight from Korea to achieve it. And, according to @glowwithava, it’s all about one thing: collagen. In other words, if you want to have ""Jello Skin,"" you need to boost your production of collagen, a protein that slows down the effects of skin aging, but which gradually diminishes after the age of 30. According to the TikToker, diet, exercise, massage and skincare need to be mixed to get this firm and plump, almost bouncy-looking skin. A trends that eventually refers to the underlaying holistic beauty movement, which can be defined as taking an all-encompassing approach to beauty, from the inside out. Some of the things that @glowwithava advocates are adding collagen powder to one’s yogurt at breakfast, applying sunscreen daily, exercising, or even applying masks with specific ingredients. But that’s not all. To boost collagen production, again according to the influencer, it is also necessary to eat foods rich in vitamin C (red fruits, citrus fruits, certain green vegetables, or even certain cereals), to perform facial massages — with or without specific tools — and, of course, to use cosmetics enriched with anti-aging ingredients. A trend that seems to be gaining more and more followers around the world."
"Men are increasingly interested in manicures, and not on social media only","Men’s interest in manicures seems to be steadily growing. And if rappers, singers and other famous actors have set the trend, it’s now a whole generation of men who are stepping up to show that coloured and manicured nails are no longer (only) a thing for women. Beauty, like fashion, is progressively becoming a new form of self-expression, which interests women as much as men. Despite the best efforts of pioneering artists and celebrities, from David Bowie to Johnny Depp, who dabbled with more androgynous looks, the 2020 decade might appear to be a true turning point, with a real blurring of the boundaries between genders, especially in the cosmetics industry. Last March, European online beauty booking platform Treatwell unveiled a survey that reflected these changes. The survey showed that three in 10 French men, for instance, were willing to get a manicure and pedicure, and that manicures were one of the most popular services for men. The specialist site also noted a 23% increase in nail care before the holiday season. All in all, these figures suggest that such services are indeed meeting men’s new demands. From the catwalks to the red carpets, via the music industry, or even street styles, men’s manicures have recently become part of the routine for some celebrities, helping to make male nail care more popular worldwide. And we’re not talking about black nails — often the standard of the punk or grunge look — but colored nails or nails decorated with patterns of all kinds. As often, Harry Styles appears as one of the leaders in this field, often posing or stepping out with perfectly groomed and painted nails. But he is not alone. ASAP Rocky, Lil Nas X, J. Balvin, Bad Bunny, Pete Davidson, Jared Leto, Marc Jacobs and Machine Gun Kelly are among the many men who have taken the plunge, making numerous appearances with nails painted in various colours. Une publication partagée par the Blonde Don (@machinegunkelly) The latter has even launched his own brand of unisex nail polish, UN/DN LAQR, reflecting the popularity of this trend, which seems on its way to become a standard beyond social networks."
"Quality over quantity: The pandemic has shifted beauty habits, found Kantar","In their report, ‘On Trend: The evolving beauty consumer’, Kantar analysed the purchase habits of more than 300,000 individual and households in 20 countries [1] and women’s daily usage habits across seven major economies [2] to understand the impact of two years of coronavirus lockdowns, shifting priorities, and the continuation of the work from home culture. The data collected by Kantar shows a striking decrease in the weekly use of cosmetics in every market, with weekly usage down an average of 28% compared with pre-pandemic levels and down 31% compared with five years ago, as women choose simpler routines. The trend is particularly apparent amongst European beauty consumers who have significantly decrease their use of face and lip make-up, year-on-year. The study also identifies that more shoppers are opting for fewer, higher quality usage occasions. The focus is now on fewer, long-lasting beauty products that can be applied quickly. Actually, according to Kantar, the increase in premium beauty product usage along with a surge in demand for natural beauty products, which moved from, on average, 18% of sales in 2017 to 24% of sales in 2021, helped the market recover to pre-pandemic levels of revenue. Through the pandemic period, the percentage of women choosing to wear their hair longer grew from, on average, 58% of women in 2017 to 62% in 2021. Simultaneously, women chose to wash their hair less frequently, down almost 10% over five years to 2.8 times per week on average. Illustrating the premiumisation trend, despite falling usage, hair conditioners and treatments grew in sales value, generating 5% growth in 2020 (compared to 2019), and 7% growth in 2021 (compared to 2020). The premiumisation trend has been spearheaded by requirements for specific haircare solutions to help promote growth. For instance, products targeting specific hair conditions including hair loss and dandruff have grown 5 times faster than the overall shampoo market rate. Another underlying trend noted by Kantar is the growing awareness of consumers of beauty products regarding sustainability and safety issues. Hence, face and body products made from naturally produced ingredients represented 24% of sales in 2021, compared to 18% of sales in 2017. The largest increase is in France, where the shift was from 23% of consumers in 2019 to 32% in 2021. Environmentally conscious consumers are also willing to pay extra for sustainable and natural products, also highlighted Kantar. Eco-active households spend more than the average household on beauty products, with French Eco-Active households spending 5% more on beauty products per shopping trip. “Though consumers are seeking simpler routines and a ‘natural’ look, this does not mean they will suddenly move away from beauty products. Consumers will binge on various products that respond to their changing demands,” said Ashley Kang, Global Beauty Director of Kantar. In the skin care category, consumers will continue to focus on ‘sustainable’, ‘natural’ and ‘derma’ products. Furthermore, with growing number of females wearing hair long, hair and scalp treatments represent a growth major opportunity."

Social media trends: TikTok celebrates natural beauty,"Each week brings something new on TikTok. Users of the social network, which is usually bursting with beauty and makeup tips of all kinds, and sometimes totally wacky, now seem to aspire to a more natural, authentic approach. For several weeks, posts on the social media site favoured by the younger generations have been celebrating naturalness, self-assurance and diversity.  Will the trend last? Nothing is less sure. But that doesn’t stop users from expressing a growing interest in videos without filters, makeup, or other embellishments, striving to meet beauty criteria that aspire to a certain idea of perfection. If there is not (yet) any particular hashtag to spearhead this trend, it is mainly expressed through terms like ’no makeup’, ’no makeup challenge’ or ’no makeup trend.’ American actress and singer Ashley Tisdale is one of the site’s users who has decided to show themselves naturally, soundtracked by the song ""Tear in My Heart"" by Twenty One Pilots, which quickly became the official anthem of this new beauty trend. In a video posted at the end of March, the ""It’s Alright, It’s OK"" singer was first filmed with a filter giving her a glowing complexion and an ultra glamorous look. Then, in the blink of an eye, the filter disappears to reveal her au naturel, without the slightest hint of makeup, with the words ""I love a no makeup trend."" A post welcomed by many users of the social network, who did not fail to share their enthusiasm. ""I Love seeing celebs looking normal,"" one follower commented. Another user even said: ""This trend is so wholesome."" And it seems that this natural, makeup-free trend has spread like wildfire on the social network, with videos of the kind multiplying at great speed. For the first time in a long time, self-esteem is being celebrated on the social network, much to the delight of its users, who most often describe the trend as ""healthy"" or ""refreshing."""
Curls bounce back in Cairo as natural hair styles become trendy,"For Rola Amer and Sara Safwat, their curls were once a career-hindering nuisance. Now part of an aesthetic liberation movement sweeping Egypt in recent years, they own a curly hair salon that caters to women and men like them. Amer used to spend hours straightening her bouncy curls, she told AFP as she began her day at the Curly Studio, which became Egypt’s first natural hair salon in 2018. ""Curly hair takes a lot longer to cut than straight hair,"" Amer said, meticulously snipping her way through a client’s curly mane in an affluent suburb of Cairo. Three hours later, she can finally show the result to her client, and both are delighted as the salon buzzes around them. It’s a far cry from Amer’s own experience a few years ago. ""If I ever left my hair curly, I’d feel shaggy, like I wasn’t taking care of myself,"" she said. In this rare type of salon in Cairo, the final product fits each client’s curl pattern, and rollers have replaced straightening irons to prevent heat damage. Safwat, 38, thinks hair straightening, can be dangerous. The obsession with straight hair, rooted in what Safwat calls ""completely false beauty ideals,"" compelled generations of women to burn their hair to a crisp using chemical treatments and excessive heat damage. With her curls considered ""unprofessional"" Safwat says that, before she became a hairdresser, she would often be asked in job interviews: ""Will you be coming in to work like this?"" In the early 2000s, Lebanese singer Myriam Fares was one of the first curly-haired icons in the Middle East. Halfway across the world, Black women in the United States were increasingly embracing their curls in a natural hair care movement. Many of the biggest brands built by Black women at the time would eventually find their way onto the shelves of curly salons in Cairo. In 2012, Egyptian actress Dina el-Sherbiny became one of the first to break the taboo on screen, flaunting her chestnut curls in hit TV series ""Hekayat Banat"" (Girls’ Stories). Ten years later, curly heads feature in TV shows, movies and the billboards that line Cairo’s highways, a marked change in pop culture. In Hollywood, Egyptian-Palestinian actress May Calamawy even shows off her curls in Marvel’s latest series, ""Moon Knight,"" helmed by Egyptian director Mohamed Diab. ""There has been a real social movement,"" Doaa Gawish told AFP. In 2016, Gawish launched a Facebook group called The Hair Addict to help women give their hair a break from harsh chemicals and blow dryers. Within months, the online forum had grown from 5,000 to more than 80,000 members, as the local cosmetics market grew by 18 percent, according to Euromonitor International. Two years later, Gawish launched her eponymous haircare company. ""A lot of big cosmetics companies started releasing products for curly hair, because they could see it was an essential customer base,"" she told told AFP. This base is steadily growing in Egypt’s sizable cosmetics market. With a population of 103 million, the country has about 500,000 salons and more than three million employees, as estimated in 2020 by Mahmoud el-Degwy, head of the hairdressers’ division at the Cairo Chamber of Commerce. Teacher and natural hair influencer Mariam Ashraf (photo) has seen the market’s potential first-hand. Only a hobby at first, her Instagram videos quickly became ""a real source of income"", she told AFP before filming a new clip for her 90,000-plus followers. “Brands are contacting me more and more to showcase curly hair products,” the 26-year-old explained. ""And now modelling agencies are contacting me for advertisements."" But the world of natural hair care is not accessible to everyone. While the average monthly income in Egypt is 6,000 pounds (US$325), a haircut at the Curly Studio can cost up to one-tenth of that. Some men also give free rein to their curls. Since he inadvertently discovered his curls during Covid-19 lockdown, cybersecurity expert Omar Rahim has been gladly paying to maintain his style. Today, he maintains an intricate regimen, despite jeers from his friends in a conservative and patriarchal society. ""We have a problem with fragile masculinity; people think a man shouldn’t take care of his hair or buy products,"" he told AFP. ""I want people to understand that this is normal, but I’m not ready to fight this fight just yet."""
#innerbeauty : New generation food supplements,"Holistic beauty, role of the microbiome, benefits of natural ingredients, need for targeted vitamins and trace elements, general atmosphere favourable to self-focus… all these factors have played a role in the boom of nutricosmetics. Just like English-speaking and Asian countries, the pioneers of this trend already familiar with the gesture, the French market has gradually gained importance, from pharmacies to new distribution channels. It has also developed new galenic forms, new categories, and new combinations to provide this product of pharmaceutical origin with its cosmetic dimension. If beauty from the inside is a notion already fixed in the minds of consumers fond of nutricosmetics, few brands clearly highlight topical cream + food supplement combinations in their offerings. Launched in 2017 by Sandra Gasmi, the natural and organic-certified brand Demain Beauty already does. “In 1958, an apple contained 400 mg of vitamin C. Now it only has 4! There is nothing left. So, if we want to stay healthy and have a beautiful skin, we do need supplements. As soon as I launched the brand, I started developing food supplements that acted in synergy with our cosmetic products for maximum efficacy. That’s why our products go in pairs,” she explains. The glowing exfoliating cleansing gel Go for Glow is used with the Go for Detox supplement which cleans the body and plays on our glow, digestion and blemishes. The Go for Protection moisturizer and antioxidant + immunity supplement act hand in hand. And the Inside supplements will be added to the three anti-ageing skincare products recently launched. To combine the benefits of nutraceutics with the effects of cosmetics, the Anjac Health & Beauty group, whose 14 integrated companies contribute to creating and manufacturing cosmetic and health solutions and products, launched an original premium range of health complements last June. The Liver, Immunity, Stress, Sleep, Joint, and Energy solutions come in liquid products to be assimilated by the body four times better than solid forms. “We created a core formula to protect the actives and prevent them from being destroyed in the stomach. Their quantity is four times higher when they arrive in the gut, where nutrients are absorbed, than that of solid food supplements,” explains Matthieu Erre, PhD in Pharmacy at the Anjac group. In addition, the laboratory worked on the notion of compliance, because the regularity with which the product is taken over time is key for its efficacy. They also put their innovation know-how in the service of brands, influencers, and distributors with a B2B offering based on efficacy and taste in the form of nutraceutics (liquid solution, gummies…) and nutritional products (functional drinks and food). Coming soon: a resorbing physio gel and natural energy drinks to provide energy and beauty with a low glycemic index. A very well-adapted answer to the issue of compliance, gummies are currently the most trendy food supplements. In between a gelatine sweet and a health gesture, this new galenic form from the United States has appealed to a broader, younger panel of users. The global market should generate a turnover of 7.15 billion dollars by 2025, according to a Market Research Future study. Both sweet and fruity, this small tasty gum boasts a sensorial asset that capsules lacked, being more drug-like. “It is much more pleasant to take two small gummies a day for two to three months than swallowing capsules. There is pleasure, and pleasure is the key to compliance. It is the main difference with standard food supplements,” explains David Gueunoun, founder and CEO of the brand Les Miraculeux. Launched in 2019, the brand exclusively dedicated to this product category soon imposed itself as a forerunner and market leader, alongside competitor Lashilé. The two young French brands have since shared the market with the main pharmaceutical laboratories who have also adopted this new popular galenic form. “The assets are compliance with the treatments and bioavailability, because sugar is a good carrier; the effects are quick to come. It is also easier, because you do not need a glass of water, you can take it anytime,” confirms Fanny Adida, the co-founder of Lashilé. The brand puts forward the efficacy associated with the sweetness of its products. Every gummy contains 2.5 g of sugar, which makes 5 g a day for the recommended dose of two gummies. “It represents the equivalent of a spoonful of jam. It is very little and it has never been an objection for our customers,” says Lashilé’s co-director. Still, next spring, the brand will launch a “sugar-free” version of its slimming formulas. This issue can actually make a difference. Les Miraculeux range already contains very little sugar, and there is a sugar-free version. “We are the only ones to offer this choice. It was the last obstacle that prevented some brands from going for this product form. Sugar can be considered contradictory with the health proposal,” says the Director. This health proposal has a larger dimension. To historical claims focused on sun care or hair and nail strengthening were added new, rather unexpected categories: women’s libido for Lashilé, vegan supplementation, or supplements for the menopause with Les Miraculeux, who have also just launched a range dedicated to menstrual comfort. “As a laboratory, with this form, we aim to target all family health needs from childhood to the menopause, from digestion to stress. We aim to keep exploring grounds that others do not,” says David Gueunoun. The latest innovation in the food supplement industry is attributable to the Evielab brand. They have just added CBD – the star molecule of wellness and cosmetics – to their concept. This new generation of products in the form of dry microbeads to melt under the tongue, just like homeopathy, contains 5 mg of cannabinoids associated with the actives of each reference. Packed in a mini-travel size case, these microbeads can be carried everywhere for relaxation, concentration, sleep, sports recovery, immunity benefits… This new approach will be available for testing next spring."
Lips shine again in France with the end of compulsory mask wearing,"The end of the obligation to wear a mask in all public venues - with the exception of indoor transport and health facilities - led to an immediate surge in sales of prestige lipsticks in France, found The NPD Group. According to the market research firm, sales of prestige makeup products for the lips increased by 30% during the week starting March 14, 2022, the day the restrictions were lifted. Such a significant increase is to be compared with sales beauty products in the selective channel, which rose by about 3% at the same moment. Such a surge illustrate clearly the renewed interest in a part of the face that had been concealed for more than two years. “The lifting of face cover rules has literally boosted lip makeup sales. Indeed, many consumers have celebrated this newfound freedom by buying a new lipstick. This is excellent news for make-up brands that were dramatically challenged by the pandemic,” said Mathilde Lion, Europe beauty expert at The NPD Group. In the selective channel, overall makeup sales were up 8% in just one week, driven by the lips segment, which was the main contributor to the category sales growth during this period. As far as lipsticks are concerned, sales surged by +35% compared to the previous week. Beyond figures, the growing interest in lip glosses and lipsticks is clearly visible on online platforms, and even more on social networks. It is likely that new trends will emerge from this renewed enthusiasm, which expected to strengthen as summer approaches. In any case, the #lipstick hashtag has accumulated more than 11 billion views on TikTok, demonstrating that lip makeup has - probably - still a bright future ahead of it."
L’Oréal UK partners with TikTok for a new online shopping experience,"It’s may be impressive to see success certain products meet on social networks, especially on TikTok, in just a few days. Promoted by influencers and content creators, some cosmetics become real star products, selling like hotcakes in record time. This is something that has not escaped the attention of the biggest cosmetics companies, and L’Oréal UK & Ireland is the first to get onboard with these new online buying behaviours. The Anglo-Irish branch of the cosmetics giant has just enriched its partnership with TikTok by joining the platform’s #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt e-commerce campaign. Viewed more than 10 billion times, to date, on the social network, the hashtag is most often used by influencers to highlight their favourite products through content — whether via partnerships or otherwise. And it has already allowed many beauty products of all kinds to go viral. The phenomenon has also shined the spotlight on many cosmetics launched by the L’Oreal Group. Thanks to this collaboration, shoppers in the UK will be able to get their hands on beauty boxes filled with products endorsed by creators themselves. Garnier, L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline, NYX Professional Make-Up and Essie are among the brands involved. Only available to users in the UK — for now — this new experience reflects brands’ growing interest in social networks, which seem to be transforming themselves into go-to places for next-gen shopping with sales expected to reach USD 1.2 trillion by 2025."
Gamification in marketing - a passing trend or a real strategic tool?,"The use of playful characteristics is common to drive engagement and motivation – learning methods, commercial challenges, contests, retail animations. A recent study highlights that the global gaming industry is worth $150 billion with over two billion gamers. The rise has contributed to the adoption of gamification in other contexts reserved for pure gamers, as a powerful marketing tool that is bound to stay. Gamification may be used in the choice of format for brand content and the selection of platforms (Instagram or Snapchat filters for instance), or in the mechanisms (TikTok contest, Web App, transforming a customer journey on an e-shop, use of motion design to bring interaction on a landing page). Within the core of an efficient marketing strategy implementing gamification, we may find the notions of rewards, fidelity, ranking and challenges. Gamification is based on a vital social aspect where the user seeks interaction, recognition, competition. Hence, the user is active at the heart of the experience, an actor, and a growth driver. It is then possible to unite a community around common interests and values. Furthermore, data collection makes gamification a useful device to develop commercial campaigns, as long as they are accompanied by a recurrent reporting. A brand should adopt gamification for various reasons: – It brings an immersive experience that prolongs the brand’s storytelling;
– It allows the construction of innovative and customized customer journeys that maintain attention;
– The engagement rate is high, just like conversion and transformation rates
– Customer loyalty is retained and higher. The art of creating emotions, of surprising and of engaging is inscribed in the cosmetic universe in which it is essential to embark the customers in a world that combines visualization and usage. The brand NYX is a paragon in the use of new technologies and gamification, from augmented and virtual reality to the metaverse. After using filters on social media for virtual try-on, an efficient means for cosmetics, the brand has developed a virtual makeup artist named MYAIA who offers personalized makeup consultations by an artificial intelligence. Virtual shopping was also developed by the brand, with a shop designed in augmented reality on Snapchat and Thriller, offering an immersive shopping experience with virtual try-on and games. In 2021, NYX launched an NFT skin during the Meta Gala at the first Crypto Fashion Week. Gamification is a way to get a foothold in Web3 defining the trajectory of a playful universe in which the community is involved. The synergy between gaming and the luxury industry is obvious: the need for a personalized, engaging, and immersive experience to seduce the audience before and after the buying process, is constant. As an agency specialized in visual innovations for luxury Houses, WANDS Paris accompanies brands from the strategy to the deployment, in adopting gamification for their brand platform and versions – filters, augmented reality, 3D, Wep App, immersive universes…A way to guide brands in defining their objectives, taking into account the question of adaptability, fluidity and brand content to unleash the full potential of creativity in the realization of gamified experiences."
"As virus cases surge and economy slows, can China’s zero-Covid strategy hold?","Originally scheduled to be held on 14-15 April 2022, MakeUp in Shanghai and Luxe Pack Shanghai have been rescheduled to June 7-8, 2022. The two trade shows have been postponed while millions in the country are currently under lockdown in an attempt to halt the march of the Omicron variant. Similarly, considering the “zero-Covid” strategy means that inbound travel to Hong Kong is likely to remain subject to quarantine restrictions, the organizers of Cosmoprof Asia have decided to relocate the show to Singapore next November. China essentially closed itself off from the world in March 2020 to follow a formula it calls ""dynamic zero"" for curbing outbreaks: strict lockdowns and immediate mass testing. Unlike during softer lockdowns elsewhere, people in China can be banned from leaving their building or forced to remain inside a hotel room if they are considered high-risk contacts. Mandatory track-and-trace apps mean close contacts are usually detected and quarantined quickly. Shops, schools, tourist sites, office blocks and malls have been summarily locked down with people inside after the detection of a single close contact. Officials are routinely dismissed or castigated in state media for outbreaks in their areas. That puts the onus on local authorities to move fast and hard on any clusters. Residents are forced to stay at home at a moment’s notice, including the 17 million people of Shenzhen who were locked down on Sunday. International flight volumes have also collapsed, with the limited arrivals undergoing strict weeks-long quarantine. The government has said it will not renew expiring Chinese passports unless the holder has a good reason for travel — shredding outbound demand for travel. China’s caseload since the start of the pandemic — just over 115,000 — is a fraction of those recorded elsewhere. The official death toll has stayed under 5,000. Although cases from the chaotic initial outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020 are widely believed to have been under-reported, life since then has largely returned to normal. Beijing’s communist leadership has made its handling of the pandemic a matter of political capital, saying the low death rate demonstrates the strength of its governance model. It has highlighted chaotic Covid responses in the US as an example of the wider failures of liberal democracies. Analysts warn any change in strategy will also need to shift perceptions of the virus among the masses in China. Loosening virus restrictions could also prove risky for President Xi Jinping as he seeks a third term in October after billing himself as the leader who keeps China safe. However, China’s zero-Covid strategy comes at a cost, both human and economic. It has caused repeated disruption, particularly in port cities and border areas that endure almost constant lockdowns. Analysts say repeated shutdowns of factories and businesses have contributed to the slowing economy. And there has been a grinding impact on ordinary lives. Locked-down communities have complained of poor access to food, supplies and medical treatment. The distressing case of a pregnant Chinese woman miscarrying after a strict lockdown delayed her access to medical treatment reignited debate over the limits of China’s zero-tolerance approach. Meanwhile, migrant workers have been left stranded from families for months due to onerous travel rules and restrictions. Examples of extreme enforcement have sparked outrage, such as when health workers beat a corgi to death after the owners were sent to quarantine. A top Chinese scientist said this month that the country should aim to coexist with the virus. Meanwhile, the government announced it was introducing rapid antigen tests for the first time, which would allow at-home testing — a potential loosening of the state’s hold on the health crisis. However, there are concerns over the capacity of the country’s healthcare system and the efficacy of domestic vaccines. Peking University researchers have warned China could suffer a ""colossal outbreak"" that would overwhelm its medical system if it relaxed restrictions to a similar level as in Europe and the US. And officials are anxiously watching the experience of Hong Kong, where hospitals have struggled in a recent outbreak. The city currently has one of the world’s highest death rates from the virus, as the Omicron variant cuts through its elderly population, among whom vaccine hesitancy is common."
"“Shopping is the logical next step in the story” - Charles Levecque, TikTok","TikTok used the occasion of Paris Fashion Week to organize some exclusive events with certain labels, such as Off-White. Can you tell us more about these operations? Charles Levecque - Regarding Off-White, that was a very nice project for us, allowing us to demonstrate new experiential tools for the community and how we can offer the TikTok community an even more immersive experience of fashion shows. There were several cameras that were positioned on the runway; it really offered the impression of total immersion. We’d already done many shows in the past, in 2020, with many labels. Here, we feel like we’re taking the experience to the next level. Of course, other fashion shows also are taking place on the platform. We’ve already had the Dior and Balenciaga shows, for which the community could register beforehand to be able to view it on the platform on the big day. In the area of luxury and fashion what types of content are most appreciated by users? Charles Levecque - There is one trend that stood out for me during the Men’s shows in January. It’s all the vlogging done around the backstage or pre-show. I’ve seen a lot of content on that coming out. In the last few years, we had a lot of intra-show content. And now, we can see, for example with AMI Paris or Dior, content on TikTok that was created before the shows, on the celebrities attending, but also on all the excitement surrounding the event. This content is watched quite a bit. Which fashion and luxury deals have had the most success on TikTok? What is the most popular fashion label on TikTok? Charles Levecque - Now that’s a tough question. There are a couple of shows that surprised me for many reasons and which were very popular on the platform. Gucci, during Milan Fashion Week, did a pre-show to prepare users for the shows beforehand featuring rather exclusive content with a creator named Francis Bourgeois. It’s totally offbeat content that uses the codes of the platform 200% and, in particular, which uses all the codes of this creator. He’s a fan of trains who had a resounding success with several million views on the platform during an earlier collaboration with North Face. So they take him, a few days before the show, to bring him to Milan. We see him arrive at the station. We see him get the invitation card. He goes to change before the show, all in Gucci of course, in a shop where he enjoys a little private shopping session, etc.. And then, he arrives at the show, he gets to check out the set. Viewers see him explaining that aspect a little bit. During the fashion show, everyone, all the TikTokers were asking ""Where is Francis?"" We saw a kind of excitement build up around him. Another example is Balmain, with the music. It was last September. They were doing the Balmain festival. They did a concert with Doja Cat for the occasion, live via TikTok. Users could watch the mini concert, and right after the fashion show. The community loves this kind of content. It’s clear that people are quite interested in fashion shows. As we saw with TikTok star content creator Khaby Lame, who became a face of Hugo Boss, content creators are valued by brands. Can they have an influence on the fashion of tomorrow? Charles Levecque - I was quite blown away by the whole Hugo Boss operation. It signals a transformation, dramatically different from the brand of two or three years ago. They are very modern. It’s quite powerful what they did because the Khaby Lame community represents millions of people, but they didn’t come for the fashion at all. They came for humorous content. They come looking for an audience, which is also quite new for this environment. That’s what I find interesting, to see if these communities can mix and, in doing so, make brands that are more global and inclusive. Will they shape the fashion of tomorrow? I think they are mostly amplifiers. Fashion and luxury brands are increasingly present on TikTok. What do you think is attracting them to this platform compared to other social networks? Charles Levecque - There are several reasons. The first for me is that we are the easiest gateway to reach a new generation of users, new consumers, new codes, new means of expression. TikTok is this gateway that allows them to go and understand them. We know that Millennials, and even Generation Z, will be the massive consumers of luxury in the near future. I think that they will represent more than 70% of luxury consumers in a few years. TikTok can be a good way to ""meet"" them and more specifically to enter into discussion and engage with them. We are also in the process of becoming a platform that offers a rather perfect showcase for creativity because it’s a platform that is full screen. There is no other content around it. It’s creators who are making a lot of content on the platform, who are ultra-dynamic, ultra-original and ultra-creative. I think that brands have a lot of stories to tell. They often have beautiful messages, and also a lot of content that is very well done. I think it’s a great place for them to express their creativity. Most TikTok users are quite young — an audience that is not necessarily able to buy luxury products. So what interest do these brands have in establishing a presence on TikTok? Charles Levecque - The platform is experiencing tremendous growth. Our user base has grown very quickly. Today we can say that 67% of our audience is over 25 years old, a telling figure. I want to make that clear because it’s part of an image we’re trying to change. Perhaps two years ago, the platform didn’t look the same as it does today. It’s well known that one thing that works well on TikTok is a kind of naturalness, which does not necessarily always work with the highly coded images of fashion and luxury brands. How far are they willing to go in this regard? Charles Levecque - Should brands, since they do have these very powerful codes, adapt to TikTok? I think that’s a discussion we’ll see evolve. Our application is quite young. We’ve already seen significant change since the beginning, a year and a half ago, almost two years ago, when content was a bit of copy and paste from other platforms or experiments. Now, it’s clear to see that there’s a higher level. Shopping via social networks is a key trend this year. How does TikTok plan to get involved in this new market? Charles Levecque - Shopping is the logical next step in the story. Today, we have users who consume content on a largely entertainment-oriented platform. The next logical step is to know how we can help them generate actions, discover — maybe on a website or elsewhere — products and potentially purchase luxury goods. We have done different operations with brands, like Make Up For Ever and the LVMH group with Dior. TikTok creators presented beauty ""moments"" with the possibility to promote the collection shown for purchase. This doesn’t necessarily mean ""buy now."" It’s more, ""watch some content on TikTok, watch this video and look at the products we’ve focused on and now are concretely presenting for you."" We still need to think about how we can create more integrated experiences on the platform to build simpler pathways. That’s because taking the user out of the platform, creating too many avenues can be complicated for them."
Brazil: Sales of the beauty and personal care sector dropped 2.8% in 2021,"After an atypical increase (compared to the rest of the world) of 5.8% in 2020, sales of the Brazilian industry of personal hygiene, perfumes and cosmetics recorded a 2.8% drop (ex-factory prices) between January and December 2021, compared to the same period of the previous year. According to ABIHPEC, the sector faced multiple challenges throughout the year. Personal hygiene products were the best performers of the sector last year. The good results of this category limited the overall decline. With sales growing by 4.7% (ex-factory prices) compared to 2020, the category benefited from the intensification of hygiene habits as a protection against Covid-19 contamination. On the other hand, cosmetics (-15.4%) and perfumes (-2%) recorded significant drops compared to 2020. While the consumer price index (IPCA) rose by more than 10% in 2021 in Brazil, the sector limited the increase in the price of its products during the year, ending the period with an average inflation of +3.1%, i.e. 7 percentage points below the general national index. “Although it is essential for society today, hygiene and beauty products is the third most taxed sector in the country. The heavy tax burden it bears demands enormous efforts from companies to absorb constant cost increases and avoid an even greater contraction in demand,” highlights ABIHPEC. Generally speaking, hygiene and grooming products were the industry winners in 2021. Among the best performing products is soap, with a growth of 9.7% compared to 2020. Bar soap continues to be the main segment of the market, with 80% of sales, while liquid soap, one of the symbols of the fight against Covid-19, has gained popularity. Shampoo sales remained stable, rising less than 1%, while the haircare category saw sales growing 5.8% in 2021. The skin care category, which had grown by 21.9% in 2020, indicating greater interest from Brazilian consumers in well-being products, especially during times of greatest social isolation, fell by 12.4% in 2021. According to ABIHPEC, this result is linked to the reduction in the time available for skin and body care rituals, due to the gradual resumption of outdoor activities. It also shows the opportunity to educate Brazilians on the long-term benefits of taking care of their skin. Finally, with regard to perfumes, ABIHPEC data show sales down 2%, despite the investments made by companies in the sector. Despite this overall drop in sales, it should be noted that the Brazilian trade balance of the health and beauty sector remained in surplus in 2021, for the second consecutive year."
Biotulin meets success with a botanical-based “natural botox” face gel,"Most of the botox-like face care products come in the form of a simple anti-aging serum, — a gel to be precise — which is simply applied to the face. The Ordinary’s ""Argireline Solution 10%"" — which sells for less than $10 — has long been promoted on social networks for its ability to smooth out wrinkles almost as botox would do. Its main active ingredient, Argireline, a proprietary peptide complex (a solution of Acetyl Hexapeptide-3) from Lipotec (Lubrizol Life Science). The Ordinary says that “studies have shown that Argireline improves the appearance of facial areas prone to developing dynamic folds, including around the eyes and in the forehead area.” But it is now the ""Supreme Skin Gel"" from the German brand Biotulin that is in the spotlight and makes much ado on social networks. Its main component, spilanthol, is a fatty acid amide extracted from Acmella Oleracea, a plant native to South America — hence it being dubbed ’natural’ botox. This local anesthetic is said to relax the muscles around the eyes and lips, reducing wrinkles in just one hour. This natural ingredient, which gained popularity in 2021 thanks to German-based organic skincare brand Spilanthox Therapy can b in se foundeveral products such as Patyka’s Age Specific Intensive Instant Wrinkle Filler, or L’Occitane en Provence’s Immortelle Reset Overnight Reset Oil-In-Serum. According to INCI Beauty website, it is present in 0.09% of cosmetic products. To stand out, Biotulin’s flagship product had the support of Jennifer Lopez who officially thanked the brand on Twitter earlier this year after the Golden Globes awards ceremony."
France: Sales of prestige beauty products increased by 9% in 2021,"After a sharp fall in 2020 (-20% compared to 2019), sales of the selective channel in France returned to growth in 2021, with an increase of 9%, compared to the previous year, to reach EUR 2,689 billion in 2021, according to The NPD Group. However, the persistence of the pandemic and the successive lockdowns in the first half of 2021 (with store closures) have slowed the recovery. The prestige beauty market has yet to return to pre-Covid levels, with sales down 12% in 2021 compared to 2019. The pace of growth nevertheless accelerated during the second half of 2021, with fourth quarter sales reaching a level similar to that of the same period in 2019. Eventually, the year ended with record sales during the two weeks before Christmas. Physical stores were the main contributors to growth in the prestige beauty market in 2021. After the reopening of brick-and-mortar stores after the last lockdown in France, online sales began to slow down, and even strongly decreased in the fourth quarter , with a double-digit drop. Sales in traditional stores accounted for 84% of the pretige beauty market in 2021, compared to 16% for online sales, these results confirm the importance of the in-store shopping experience. Fragrances were a key driver of the prestige beauty market growth (accounting for 82% of the progression), with sales up 11% in 2021 compared to 2020. The most dynamic segment in the category was home fragrances. In addition, high-end fragrances and more concentrated scents, such as eaux de parfum and extracts, were preferred by buyers, resulting in a 3% increase in the average price. The same behaviour has been observed in the United States. While skincare sales increased by 5% in 2021 (vs 2020), unit sales increased by 17%. For this category, consumers favoured less expensive products and more affordable brands. Driven by the home-spa trend, sales of body care products confirmed their success, exceeding their 2019 level. As far as face products are concerned, skin care products, sprays/mists, oils, exfoliants and make-up removers returned to growth and recorded double-digit growth in 2021 compared to 2020. Sales of prestige makeup were up 5% compared to 2020 in France. As wearing face covers was mandatory in most places, consumers focused their purchases on the eye and nail segments, which recorded a double digit growth. However, the consumption of the category’s emblematic products, such as foundations and lipsticks, resumed at the end of the year. “This is a very positive signal, announcing a good year 2022 for make-up,” highlighted The NPD Group. Still emerging in the selective channel, the haircare category continues to establish itself, rising by 43% in 2021 compared to 2020, a year which was already considered to be flourishing for this segment. This growth is based on promotional sets and hair care. “There are increasingly visible signs that the recovery is accelerating since restrictions were lifted. Once again, consumers have demonstrated that the health of the sector depends mainly on in-store experience, even if online shopping has transformed their habits,” concludes Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group."
The Italian cosmetics industry expects to recover from the crisis this year,"""Recovery was strong in 2021, both in the domestic and overseas markets,"" stressed Renato Ancorotti, President of Cosmetica Italia. According to the association’s estimates, the Italian industry closed the year 2021 with total sales of EUR 11.7 billion, up +10.2% compared to 2020 when sales in value had fallen to EUR 10.6 billion. A significant but partial recovery, since the Italian industry only recovered EUR 1.1 billion out of the EUR 1.5 billion lost in 2020. In 2021, recovery was first driven by external demand (+13.0% for exports, which reached EUR 4.7 billion), while the domestic market (+6.5%) remained disrupted by the restrictions linked to the pandemic. Cosmetica Italia expects to return to - and even exceed - the pre-crisis level (EUR 12.1 billion in 2019) later this year. The trade association anticipates closing 2022 with a business volume of EUR 12.5 billion (which would represent a +6.5% increase compared to 2021). Contract manufacturing, one of the strong points of the Italian industry, should even see its activity grow significantly with a growth forecast of +15% in 2022 (compared to an estimated +8% increase between 2020 and 2021). A survey conducted among the association’s member companies, however, shows several concerns among manufacturers, in particular, due to supply chain disruptions  (more than 80% of the companies surveyed believe that difficulties will persist in 2022) and rising production costs. ""Despite the significant growth at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, several indicators are worrying players in the sector,"" Cosmetica Italia underlines. Nevertheless, the association considers that the Italian cosmetics industry has proven its resilience and that investments in innovation will continue to pay off, in particular by strengthening the competitiveness of Made in Italy products on global markets."
French women are massively opting for organic and natural beauty products,"French women are increasingly reliant in organic and natural cosmetics, which seem to reassure them. The Slow Cosmétique Label, in partnership with market research firm Harris Interactive [1], takes stock of the situation and the result clearly shows the success of natural formulations with female consumers aged 18 to 50. Thus, more than nine out of ten French women (92%) buy natural or organic cosmetics at least once a year, and nearly six out of ten opt for these products at least once every 3 months. The study also shows that environmental concerns are not what motivates French women to buy organic or natural cosmetics, at least in the first place. Indeed, nearly half of respondents (47%) say their personal health is the main reason for purchasing these cosmetics, protecting the environment comes second but is mentioned by 17% of women only. Furthermore, if the pandemic has boosted sales in local retail and boosted the interest in locally made products, it seems that this is not (yet) the case in the beauty sector. Only 8% of respondents say that local production and/or made in France labels are a source of motivation for purchasing cosmetic products. This might be explained by the strong position of the French industry in this business. French made products brands are therefore widely available on shelves, a notable difference compared to many other market segments. The study also reveals that French women prefer supermarkets rather than specialized shops to purchase organic or natural cosmetics. When asked where they buy organic and natural products, 76% of French women mention large and medium-sized retails, then pharmacies and para-pharmacies (41%), e-commerce (25%), and finally specialized organic stores (17%). Beyond organic and natural, the Slow Cosmetique seal also seems to interest French women. Created by French-based Slow Cosmétique Association, the seal is awarded to brands that promote responsible natural skincare, with formulas that are free from controversial ingredients in terms of health or environmental impact, and which are also committed to developing equally healthy marketing, without greenwashing or outlandish promises. Eight out of ten French women said such a seal is interesting and 92% believe it helps the beauty industry to move in the right direction. For nearly nine out of ten women (88%), it increases their confidence in the product. To date, 313 brands have been awarded the Slow Cosmétique seal."
From lip pencil to concealer: How are TikTokers hacking cosmetic uses,"Looking for fun and also for saving money and resources, TikTok users have quickly understood that cosmetics can have several lives, and just as many uses. For a few months now, the social network has been an inexhaustible source of tips and tricks, each more original than the next, and all aimed at hijacking cosmetics from their initial functions to transform them into more or less successful beauty innovations. If these hacks may seem crazy at first glance, they are no less effective — or so says the TikTok community — and they also come with a sustainable slant, as they help to reduce waste or multiple purchases. In the space of just a few weeks, TikTokers switched around the original functions of their lip and brow pencils. Some now use the former to achieve the perfect smoky eye, while others turn to the latter to get the perfect shade of lipstick. It’s hard to follow, we agree, but these tips have already been seen — and maybe adopted — by thousands of users. Not content with hijacking the eyebrow pencil, TikTokers went the extra mile to get the perfect lip color, by adding a touch of blush — which, of course, is intended for cheeks — before finishing things off with a small dose of gloss. According to its advocates, the whole process helps achieve ultra glamorous and luscious lips. More so, in any case, than with a mere lipstick. You may not know it, but concealer isn’t just for dark circles and blemishes. In 2022, it gets mixed with other products to brighten your eyes, or achieve perfect contouring. A few weeks ago, a TikToker revived a beauty hack straight from the 2000s, involving spreading on some white concealer to structure her face and brighten her eyes. The video has gone viral and scored several million views. It followed another ingenuous hit video about the ’Rainbow Contour,’ a method for achieving a perfect, natural glow without a single touch of foundation. Concealer, blush, cream bronzers and the likes applied in a rainbow of stripes supposedly deliver the result in just a few minutes, as shown by many contouring aficionados. Other TikTokers have had fun hijacking the uses of the jade roller, initially intended to firm up the face and reduce dark circles and wrinkles, by transforming it into a beauty blender. A trick that proved a hit, since it allows you to enjoy the benefits of the jade roller while applying your foundation with precision. But the craze was short-lived, as this hack requires time and patience. On a different note, one user went so far as to use intimate lubricant as a foundation base, turning it into a very surprising primer. From this initiative came a host of videos in which users raved about the results, showing off their radiant complexions. However, for obvious safety reasons, some products should probably not be diverted from their primary functions… And these practices can be a real headache for manufacturers who are legally required to anticipate the ""reasonably"" foreseeable use of their products. But they are also a source of inspiration and innovation..."
Brazil: Exports of personal care products record double digit growth in 2021,"International trade flows (exports and imports) of the Brazilian personal hygiene, perfumery and cosmetics industry reached USD 1.4 billion in 2021, compared to USD 1.2 billion in 2020, a year-on-year increase of 16.2%. Exports reached $700 million in 2021, an increase of 14.9%  over the previous year (USD 609.3 million). The Brazilian industry exports its products to 173 countries, mainly to its neighbours in Latin America, with Argentina being the first buyer. However, the Brazilian Association of Personal Hygiene, Perfumery and Cosmetics Industries (ABIHPEC) highlights the fast-pace growth of exports to Chile and Mexico. Over the period January to December 2021, imports of the hygiene-cosmetics sector reached 688.4 million US dollars, an increase of 17.5% compared to the same period of the previous year (585.9 million US dollars). dollars). France and China topped the list of the 75 countries supplying for the Brazilian personal hygiene and cosmetics market. In the end, the sector’s trade balance recorded a surplus for the second consecutive year, after ten years of deficit. Indeed, December was a decisive month for the sector, thanks to a surplus of 11.6 million US dollars. ""The end of the year was a good surprise: indeed, the trade balance benefited from the increase in exports from August and the month of December was decisive to reach a final trade surplus in the sector,"" commented João Carlos Basilio, Executive President of ABIHPEC. Hair products have been the leading category of Brazilian cosmetics exports for several years. Next, soaps and oral hygiene products. However, among the most imported products in Brazil are high value-added items, such as skin care, sun protection products and tanning products, followed by perfumes, as well as oral hygiene products. According to ABIHPEC, the presence of the oral hygiene category at the top of both exports and imports can be explained by significant imports of toothbrushes, and by exports of other items in the category, in particular toothpaste."
Exports: France consolidates its position as the world leader in cosmetics,"After a 2020 year marked by an 11.8% drop, the first since 2009, exports of made in France perfumes, cosmetics and toiletries were on the rise again in 2021 to reach EUR 16.2 billion, according to French customs figures. With an increase of 22.5% compared to 2020, the French cosmetics industry posted the best performance across all sectors. Not only has the pre-pandemic level been regained, but exports have increased by a further 2.5% compared to 2019. Although imports also increased in 2021 (+24%), the trade balance, however, exceeds the outstanding level reached in 2019 and the cosmetics industry ranks in the top 3 contributors to France’s positive foreign trade balance, with a balance of EUR12.9 bn, behind aeronautics (EUR30.8 bn) and wines and spirits, (EUR14.6 bn). The EU and Asia together account for almost 2/3 of French cosmetics exports. With EUR 1.9 bn or 11.7% of exported goods, China is the leading country of destination for French exports. After a 2020 year already marked by a sharp increase (+20.4%), due in particular to the substitution of purchases previously made during trips to France, the acceleration in exports (+28.9%) in 2021 attests to the attractiveness of French cosmetics, particularly make-up, for Chinese consumers. For instance, France currently exports more than one in three lipsticks to China. The United States follows in second place, with EUR1.8 bn or 11.2% of total exports. Growth was again robust in 2021, particularly in the perfume category, which grew by 66% compared to 2020. In third place comes Germany with €1.5 bn or 9.5% of total exports. In contrast, in Russia and Brazil, two countries where sales have fallen by around 22% since 2019, partly because of their economic situation, exports are down. The Middle East is also experiencing a drop (-5.7% compared to 2019), mainly due to the standstill in air traffic and consequently travel retail because of the pandemic. The make-up, skincare and perfume categories are the most dynamic in terms of exports. Together they represent 86.2% of total sales of French cosmetics abroad. Perfumery alone, with 30.6% of French cosmetic exports, posted the highest growth in 2021: +35.4% compared to the previous year. Make-up and skincare together account for €9 bn or 55.6% of exports. Skincare products rank first (€7.5 bn), followed by lipsticks and eye make-up products. According to the French trade association representing cosmetic manufacturers (FEBEA), these figures confirm France’s position as the world leader in cosmetics, a country whose know-how is recognised throughout the world. ""The cosmetics industry is proving its impressive ability to bounce back from the health crisis,"" says Emmanuel Guichard, Delegate-General of the FEBEA. ""It took advantage of course, of the market upturn, but also innovated to meet new consumer expectations. Companies of all sizes play a part in these good export figures, large groups but also many small companies which, thanks to their dynamism, are also champions of the Made in France label. Since the onset of the crisis, demand for more natural and environmentally friendly products has increased. It is because the sector meets these expectations and invests heavily in R&D that it can perform so well throughout the world."" According to the FEBEA, the cosmetics industry employs more than 160,000 people in France."
The age of fluidity: Five beauty predictions for 2022 and beyond,"In 2022, purposeful beauty merges with sustainability to create a new beauty eco-system - one that is built upon uncompromising standards and principles. Consumers are pushing beyond ‘clean’ to a place of uncompromised wellbeing - where pleasure and personal beauty are achieved without detriment to people or the planet. The expectation is for nothing less than net-zero. The rising climate anxiety is propelling consumers into taking affirmative action - over half (51%) now factor in whether a product was produced with a traceable and transparent origin. And, attuned to the tropes of greenwashing rhetoric and marketing messages, consumers will drive brands to adopt proactive climate-positive strategies. When it comes to production, radical transparency is key. 61% of consumers say they struggle to tell whether a beauty product is ethically produced by looking at its packaging, while half of would like brands to make it easier for them to spot how a product was produced [1]. Going forward, consumers will ask to be told to The Who, The Where and The How behind each product. With this clear shift from sustainability to beauty uncompromised, brands will need to reinforce their transparency credentials. Beauty brands can deliver assurances by putting transparency at the center of the product experience, freeing the consumer to enjoy and experiment without guilt or compromise. Joyspotting reveals a new facet of beauty, one where makeup is cumulatively self-care, a tool of transformation and a manifestation of self-fluidity. This is a trend borne from the Tiktokization of the Beauty industry - where creators and influencers encourage followers to escape from the rules and embrace the fluidity of experimentation. On TikTok, there’s no room for perfection or judgement, just joy - a third of users (31%) report turning to the app in order to lift their spirits. Fuelled by these influences, beauty in 2022 will be rich with aesthetic rebellion and fluid creativity. The face and body will become canvases for celebratory makeup looks. And consumer sentiment is firmly behind experimentation - Pinterest reports a spike in searches for mullet hairstyles (+190%); tooth gems (+85%); bejewelled eye looks (+110%) and rhinestone pedicures (+150%). In the US, rising brand Danessa Myrick is connecting with next-gen Joyspotters through a strategy built on inclusion and artistry. The brand’s ethos that, ”everyone should be able to have the freedom to enjoy makeup,” speaks to the new fluidity.  The color-changing pigments of the brand’s signature Chrome Flakes are representative of the new wave of ephemeral and transformative products that are only just beginning to emerge. Creative ephemerality also comes to the fore, with new products and devices allowing users to easily switch up their beauty looks. In South Korea, nails become a vehicle for self-expression as the pandemic continues to stifle opportunities to showcase creative flair beyond the home. In response, nails are getting bigger and bolder, popping with 3D accents of glitter, crystals and jewelry. In the future, brands will approach the art of beauty as an act of pleasure, and those that can deliver an instant shot of happiness will connect with consumers, who are looking for products to lift them out of the pandemic slump. As we move towards a post-inclusive society the beauty industry will seek to further individualise its approach. The industry will need to push beyond skin-tone matching to encircle all aspects of inclusivity, including the Gen Z vs Mature skin silos. As we move forward, fluidity will be treated with the same value and respect as accessibility and adaptability. And as we evolve our understanding of what true inclusivity means, today’s diverse and multifaceted consumers will expect to be met with products that fit their exacting needs. Beauty products that radically adapt to individuality, moving from social specificities seen at the surface (skin tone, hair type, etc.) to a profound understanding of the ""underskin"" mechanism, will continue to emerge.  And we are only just beginning to see what is possible, as brands start to come through with tailored products that more insightfully address biological or physical nuances. In the Future, the Beauty industry will take action to ensure that no consumer is left out of the conversation - regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, size or ability. Currently, 15% of the world’s population are living with some form of disability, and as the population ages, this number will only increase. Designing products, tools and packaging with this demographic in mind should be imperative for the industry. The pandemic has stirred the ultra-fetishization of wellness and the healthification of the beauty industry. With a preventive mindset becoming the new normality, consumers are focused on care and safety, and they crave potent, power-dosing ingredients across all of their beauty products. In response, brands are engineering products using the latest technological advances, while at the same time introducing new, biological semantics into the beauty narrative. Stories around skin barrier empowerment, microbiome and psychobiological enhancers, hormonal regulators and circadian champions will continue to break through, as brands add another level of science-proofing to the consumer experience. And in the years ahead, consumers will be alerted to a new discourse around the underskin. More and more brands come with sophisticated formula with “skin health” related ingredients. Be Radiance now infuse their makeup powders with probiotics, which activate with water to positively “colonize the microbiota” explains the brand. A global beauty approach of the skin, where makeup goes beyond color as it rebalances the skin while protecting it against external aggressions. In the future, products that adapt to the rise of skin sensitivity will become critical for consumers who want to preserve their skin health, without sacrificing performance. In this context, the boundaries between makeup and skincare, food and beauty will blur. A new generation of hybrid products will explode the frontiers between traditional segments to levitate beauty to new horizons. Tech is tapping the mood for fluidity, as innovation keeps pace with consumer demand for products that allow them to seamlessly switch-up their beauty looks, from home. And science-backed products, temporary treatments and formulations engineered to cheat surgical procedures, appeal to those looking for sophisticated out-of-the-jar beauty solutions. Since the pandemic ushered in new ways of working and living, consumers quickly learned how to adapt and realized that joy can be found in impermanence. Now, the desire to eschew long-term commitments for temporary thrills is taking hold in beauty. Innovations at CES 2022 captured this creative ephemerality - from L’Oréal’s AI-integrated hair coloring device, the Colorsonic, to the handheld temporary tattoo-printing machine from start-up, Prinker. In the future, scientific legitimacy coupled with technological precision will allow consumers to achieve - and measure - next-level results, without the commitment of permanent procedures.

"U.S. prestige beauty sales grew by 30% in 2021, surpassing 2019 levels","Beauty addicts snapped up prestige cosmetics in the United States las year, according to figures published by The NPD Group. After a 19% decline in 2020, in the wake of the pandemic, the market strongly rebounded and surpassed 2019 levels (USD 18.8 billion). According to the market research firm, the industry generated USD 22 billion in 2021, up 30% from 2020 when sales only reached USD 16.1 billion. According to The NPD Group, with sales up 23%, the makeup category benefited from a return to consumer interest in makeup artistry. Sales of face makeup products, including foundation, primer, and tinted moisturizer, grew double digits, as did makeup-setting sprays and removers. Growth was also observed for cream and stick blushes and other products prevalently used in YouTube videos and other social media. To top that off, NPD notes that brands born from makeup artists and social influencers had the highest revenue gains among all the makeup brand types. Within the hair category (+47%), hairsprays, gels, mousses, and other styling products returned to growth in 2021, with hair-styling product sales up 45%, versus 2020. According to The NPD Group, the hair-styling segment is expected to rise another 15% in 2022. More broadly, NPD expects growth in this category to continue through 2024, as people continue to return to more social activities in the months and years ahead. Core skincare product sales, including facial cleansers, creams, and serums, grew between 15% and 24%, versus 2020, while the whole category grew by 18% in 2021. Sales of targeted products, like eye and lip treatments, also increased. Clinical skincare brands (cosmeceuticals) contributed the highest revenue gains to the category. In 2021, clinical surpassed natural as the largest brand type in skincare, based on revenue. The fragrance category registered double-digit growth against both 2020 and 2019, as consumers looked to treat themselves. Sales of perfumes, colognes, and other fragrance juices increased by 61%, year over year, as sales of candles, reed diffusers, and other home scents grew by more than 20%. The fourth quarter accounted for 45% of fragrance category sales revenue in 2021, growing by 35% during the critical holiday selling season, found NPD. “As we move through 2022, the beauty companies that will thrive are those that harness the industry’s unique ability to spread joy, while also recognizing the opportunities of a changed consumer and retail environment,” said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. “We can expect more change to unfold in 2022, but, along with these changes, new opportunities for the beauty industry will present themselves.”"
Is the metaverse set to shake up fashion and beauty purchasing habits?,"Marketing in the metaverse is still in its infancy: fashion and beauty players are just beginning to explore the endless possibilities this virtual world can offer. However, as soon as 2022, physical and digital collections should be available simultaneously. In real life, many people lack the opportunity and/or the means for buying a Gucci, Balenciaga, or Ralph Lauren wardrobe, or Louboutin stilettos. But those who can’t fill their closet with luxury clothes, could outfit their avatar in them, and go to a virtual restaurant suited up like never before. It’s a great way to indulge oneself at a lower cost... This is just one of the many possibilities offered by the metaverse, and brands, for whom this universe is proving to be a lucrative new playground, are already starting to present collections aimed at users of the most popular platforms such as Roblox, Zepeto, and ""Fortnite."" The foray into the metaverse getting the most attention in recent months is none other than that of Balenciaga in the world of ""Fortnite."" For the first time, high fashion has entered the virtual world of one of the most popular games in the world, in the form of a collection signed Balenciaga x Fortnite. Demna Gvasalia, creative director of the luxury brand, has managed to blur the lines between the virtual and real worlds even further. Not only did players have the opportunity to buy outfits and accessories for their avatars, but they were also able to buy Fortnite x Balenciaga clothes in stores, real ones. A twofold hit for the label that continues to expand and build its community. And the example has since been followed by the brands Moncler and Jordan, which have both, through diverse and varied experiences, collaborated with Epic Games, the parent company of ""Fortnite."" Vans, Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger are among the brands that have already teamed up with Roblox, proposing new collections and objects for users’ avatars. Zepeto is not to be outdone as it has already collaborated with MCM, Louboutin, Ralph Lauren, Gucci, and even fast fashion giant Zara for fashion, and brands such as Dior Beauté and Nars for cosmetics. The South Korean metaverse has even gone further by offering clothes associated with artists and key figures from the worlds of animation and sports, such as Miraculous, Selena Gomez, Major League Baseball, Blackpink, The Little Mermaid, and One Piece. And this is just the beginning... These virtual worlds could very soon look like life-size (digital) shopping malls. In the same vein, it is not surprising to learn that Nike and adidas have already moved to the next level by creating their own virtual realm. The brand with the swoosh has teamed up with Roblox on Nikeland, while Adidas has teamed up with Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gmoney, and PUNKS Comic to create its own metaverse, which invites users into ""a wild world where possibilities are truly limitless."" Actually, the metaverse is not ’just’ a universe where brands can sell virtual collections. Fashion shows, advertising campaigns, conferences, games, experiences, lectures, shopping... the possibilities are indeed endless, and there’s something for everyone, the ultimate luxury consisting in hunting not small, colorful monsters, but NFTs. For its entry into the metaverse, adidas has launched its very first digital tokens, providing access to virtual clothes for the game as well as physical products. The sale of NFTs, these non-fungible tokens that allow you to buy rare or exclusive digital works of art and other products, is indeed a significant source of income for brands in the metaverse. They’re even becoming an obsession, because not only can luxury brands use them to strengthen their links with their community, but they can also use them to highlight their artistic inspirations, as well as their involvement in various causes. L’Oreal Paris USA recently enlisted five female artists to create NFTs and make a case for gender equity in the realm of cryptocurrency, while Givenchy teamed up with graphic artist Chito to auction off several NFTs, the sale of which benefited a Dutch organization committed to ocean cleanup. Gucci, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana, and Karl Lagerfeld, to name but a few, are among the many brands that have already embraced NFTs, an area which is proving to be particularly fruitful, and which should thrive, if not go massive, with the advent of the metaverse and Web 3.0. It remains to be seen how brands will combine their CSR commitments with this virtual development whose environmental impact could quickly seem unrelated to its social utility and whose impact on human health remains to be assessed..."
Indonesia and Malaysia: At the forefront of halal beauty innovation,"The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is accounting for the largest slice of this thriving market, with Malaysia and Indonesia leading the pack. Although Malaysia is a comparatively small country, with 32.7 million nationals in 2021 (over 60% of which identify as Muslim), its economy is well-developed and the Malaysian halal beauty market is one of the biggest markets in the ASEAN region. Indonesia, on the other hand, is the largest Muslim-majority country in the world with a population of 275+ million and 87% Muslims. In both countries the size of the halal beauty market has been growing strongly in recent years. According to Sancoyo Antarikso, Chairman of Indonesian Cosmetics Association Perkosmi: “Indonesia is the largest halal consumer market in the world. Consumer spend reached USD 184 billion USD in 2020, of which USD 4.19 billion were cosmetics and toiletries (C&T).” In comparison, the overall Indonesian C&T market is worth around USD 6.34 billion and over the next five years, halal-certified cosmetics are expected to outpace the non-halal beauty market. “While halal certifications in cosmetics are still lagging behind halal-certified food products in Indonesia, they have been increasing steadily over the last few years. In 2017 there were only 64 cosmetics companies that had a halal certification. This number grew to 129 companies in 2018, 162 companies in 2019 and 214 companies in 2020, including both Indonesian and foreign players,” adds Muti Arintawati, President Director of Indonesia’s Assessment Institute for Food, Drugs & Cosmetics Majelis Ulama Indonesia LPPOM MUI. One of the reasons for this development is the Indonesia’s halal product law, which applies to cosmetics, foods and non-food products & services and went into effect in 2019. Under this set of regulations all foreign beauty products distributed or retailed in Indonesia will be treated as non-halal unless they’ve been certified in Indonesia or by an accredited foreign certification body. While cosmetics brands have until 2026 to fully implement this law domestic and regional halal beauty brands have long since begun this process. Indonesia’s established halal brands, like pioneer Wardah, which was founded in 1995 and has a strong distribution across the entire ASEAN region, have been instrumental in driving the domestic halal beauty market. When Wardah was first launched, there were few halal certified brands and even less consumer understanding of what halal was. Over the past 20 years, however, awareness of the “hijab lifestyle” has been growing strongly in Indonesia. And today’s young halal consumers aren’t just looking for a religious certification any more. Prita Anindya Laksmita, Beauty Sector Manager at Kantar Worldpanel Division explains: “Looking at the growth drivers today, the market isn’t driven by the halal logo per se. Consumers are now also looking for more sophisticated benefits such as brightening or anti-ageing so modern halal beauty brands are dialling up the key ingredients of a product rather than focusing exclusively on the halal seal.” And indeed, in recent years a crop of trendy, young domestic beauty brands has been brightening up the Indonesian halal cosmetics and toiletries market place. While 15 years ago, halal brands tended to look staid and a bit conservative, the new generation of female-founded beauty brands is in a different league altogether, wowing its digitally native demographic with exciting products and ultra-stylish packaging. Many of these new launches are makeup brands which are actually boosting the entire Indonesian colour cosmetics market: According to GlobalData, the domestic makeup sector is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2020 to 2025 [3], driven by the certified halal makeup market. Amongst the biggest beauty labels is BLP Beauty which was launched by prominent beauty blogger Lizzie Parra in 2016 and offers a range of inclusive shades for the many different skin tones of Indonesian women. The products are also light-weight and comfortable to wear in the country’s hot and humid climate. Luxcrime is another beauty brand with a strong GenZ vibe and stylish packaging, as is Rosé All Day launched in 2017, which offers skin care and makeup. Colour cosmetics brand Esqa was launched in 2016 and is both halal and vegan while Mad also caters to the GenZ and Millennials demographic. Face care brand Base, on the other hand, offers personalized skin care: users fill in an online questionnaire and the brand then selects suitable products from the range and ships it directly to the customer. As far as halal beauty is concerned, Malaysia isn’t trailing far behind its neighbour. Despite Malaysia’s comparatively small population size, the country is the fourth largest economy in South-East Asia. It is also amongst the top 5 international Muslim consumer markets. The country’s halal authority JAKIM is one of the biggest certifying bodies in the region and over the past decade the Malaysian government has implemented various initiatives expanding and promoting the country’s halal manufacturing eco system, making Malaysia one of the key countries for halal OEM/ODM manufacturing. According to Alvin Yim from the Malaysian Cosmetics & Toiletries Industry Group, the local trade organization, Malaysia’s halal exports came to USD 7.25 billion in 2020, with C&T products accounting for turnover worth USD 0.64 billion (8.7%). The major exports market for Malaysian halal cosmetics are Singapore (by a very large margin) followed by Turkey, UAE, the Philippines and Japan. The 2020 result was affected by the pandemic, Yim says, as cosmetics export turnover had been growing strongly from USD 0.52 billion in 2016 to USD 0.71 billion in 2019. However, Yim expects the Malaysian halal beauty exports to rebound and expand further in the post-pandemic period. And the demand is definitely there! Like Indonesia, Malaysia’s contemporary halal beauty market is driven by the many new and trendy makeup and skin care brands that have appeared on the market over the past five years. These labels are primarily female-owned, proudly manufactured domestically and aimed squarely at the demands of young urban women. Launched in 2016, So.Lek is a good example of this new kind of beauty brand. Founders Dahlia Nadirah and Luqman Hakim wanted to create an affordable makeup brand celebrating Malaysian culture and traditions rather than giving it the more usual international or anglicized brand vibe. The products and shades of So.Lek’s makeup range are named in Bahasa Malaysia rather than English and even the brand name is based on the Malaysian word for makeup. Also launched in 2016, Nita Cosmetica has a similar brand ethos. Founder Aznita Azman wanted her makeup brand to represent Malaysian culture and values through packaging and product names. Her brand offers accessible and affordable colours for different skin tones. dUCk Cosmetics is the sister brand of hijab label dUCk, which was launched by local fashion entrepreneur Valet Vivy Yusof in 2014. After expanding into bags, accessories and other home and lifestyle products, Yusof introduced a halal cosmetics range in 2017 which was the first Malaysian beauty brand to be retailed in Kuala Lumpur’s ultra-prestigious Pavilion Shopping mall. Millennial beauty brand Oh Most Wanted Cosmeceuticals, launched in 2018 by Malaysian actress Nora Danish, manufactures makeup with functional skin care benefits while Irisa Cosmetics, founded that same year by siblings Iman and Irisa, is offering stylishly packaged lip, eye and brow colour cosmetics. Velvet Vanity, whose brand founder was 24 when she introduced her brand in 2016, sells a range of fully vegan and halal makeup. Other notable domestic makeup brands include lip colour labels Marcella & Co, Orkid Cosmetics and Pretty Suci. In 2017, Pretty Suci’s two founders launched Malaysia’s first halal beauty online store. The outlook for the halal beauty market in the APAC region is very bright. According to Mulyorini R. Hilwan, Advisor of Halal Audit Services at LPPOM-MUI, the region is set to have 1.5 billion Muslims by 2050 and Alvin Yim estimates that by 2027, APAC will register the highest percentage of the double-digit halal cosmetics market growth which is expected to reach USD 104 billion by 2027. And with so many exciting new regional beauty brands the ASEAN halal beauty market is more attractive than ever. Interestingly enough turnover of halal beauty has also been growing amongst non-Muslims in APAC as domestic consumers are increasingly turning to halal-certified cosmetics in their search for safe, clean, cruelty-free products. “Halal has become a popular product quality seal,” confirms Kantar Worldpanel’s Prita Anindya Laksmita. With ingredient safety a major consideration for many ASEAN consumers, this development will further continue to boost the halal beauty market. What is halal beauty? Manufactured according to the Islamic Sharia law, halal cosmetics must not contain ingredients that are haram (forbidden) by Islam, such as alcohol or GMO ingredients, components sourced from the human body, from animals that are forbidden by Sharia (such as pigs) or from animals that have been slaughtered in a non-halal way. The cosmetics cannot be manufactured in a facility that also handles non-halal products (this also applies to product storage, packaging, display and shipping) or processed with non-halal machinery and equipment. While this might seem straightforward enough at first, it becomes more complex with beauty and personal care. Face creams often have 20+ ingredients including actives and compounds which are sourced from different companies and regions. To certify a product halal the source of each cosmetic ingredient must be demonstrably free of non-halal components. For example, cosmetic actives cannot contain placenta, albumin or keratin components derived from humans or from incorrectly slaughtered animals, whilst the culture, media and additives used in the manufacturing of other typical beauty ingredients such as enzymes, proteins, ferments or even AHAs must also be certifiably halal, i.e. containing neither non-halal components nor having been produced in a non-halal facility. Products such as colour cosmetics, sun screens or body lotions also need to be water-permeable to allow for the ritual wudhu washings, so “water-proof” and “water-resistant” claims can also be tricky. Since there is no global halal authority or certifying body and each Muslim (or Muslim-majority) country has its own halal regulations (and domestic certifiers), a halal certification gained for a particular regional market might not be recognised in another Muslim country. However, the certifying authorities in the bigger halal markets, such as Malaysia or Indonesia, usually acknowledge certain foreign halal certifiers although products will still need to be officially registered in the target country."
Powder cosmetics: industry adapts to market boom,"The craze for a “zero waste” bathroom free from liquid hygiene products with bulky packaging, most of which made of plastic, is now conveyed by an increasingly substantial powder offering. Various solutions have been emerging: loose or compact powders to be rehydrated in a bottle (900.care, Juliette) in order to reconstitute a liquid product and keep it, or loose powders to be directly used with water, like the Perlucine range, the Yodi shampoos and cleansers, or the Laboté face care masks in single-dose plant-derived capsules. All these solutions go with a new, simple and convenient gesture appealing to consumers willing to reduce their carbon footprints, while preserving the quality and sensoriality of the products they use daily. In this context, the latest launches seem to highlight a preference for the loose version of powders. “Loose powder has the advantage of avoiding a shaping phase, compared to compact forms, and of dissolving more easily and quickly in water, a priori, when the product is reconstituted. But because it is designed to be diluted so it becomes a liquid hygiene product that can be kept, preservatives are needed,” explains Stéphanie Reymond, founder and Director of Squarexpert, a technical and marketing consulting agency specialized in cosmetics. However, this constraint can be avoided with the loose version to be diluted every time it is used. The latest launches include the brand new JU shower gels. Perfumed with cotton flower, orange blossom, vanilla, or almond, they get in the bathroom in the form of packs of powder to be diluted. A secured glass-based pump-bottle is supplied with the first order, along with three 25-gramme powder packs with various perfumes which, once diluted in tap water, are used to reconstitute a liquid shower gel to be kept. The very fluid powder can be easily mixed to formulate a product suited to the whole family. The doses packed in paper and partly in a light recyclable plastic film are shipped in a plain envelope and can be kept up to three years. “We wanted to make things happen by first offering a shower gel, a product which usually contains 90% of water. JU only keeps the 10% of actives remaining in the form of powder composed of 99% of ingredients of natural origin,” explains Karline Hamain, founder of the Juliette brand. Going forward, the brand has planned to develop a comprehensive hygiene range for adults & kids, including, next February, toothpaste designed with the same concept and presented in the form of an 8-gramme pack of powder to hydrate in an adapted pump-bottle. To support its strategy, the brand has partnered with the Normandy-based, health & beauty specialists Laboratoires Gilbert to make the products. “There are still few specialized players on the market. Formulation and packaging are quite technical,” explains the brand founder. As Stéphanie Reymond confirms, powder product manufacturing still presents a few constraints. “In terms of formulation, the choice of solid surfactants is still quite limited, especially when you want to satisfy naturalness, Cosmos, and skin tolerance criteria,” she says. “In terms of production, packaging is tricky. Due to the volatile nature of powder, there can be risks when handling this type of ingredients: some mixtures are explosive, there are risks of inhalation and contact with the skin… All this should be avoided,” she adds. The brand Step One, launched in 2019 in Aurillac, in central France, actually developed based on their technical skills: as soon as 2017, they registered a first patent about their production method. Now, they boast a broad range of 21 references: shower gels/cleansing gels for body & hair, face & hands, and shampoos, always in the form of powders to dilute in a bottle, and refills in compostable PLA paper packs. The brand exports a lot, in particular to Nordic countries, and in January 2022, they launched the first powder deodorant to be reconstituted (6 g) in a 50-ml roll-on bottle with a glass ball recyclable over and over. “We were the first to define a formulation + production complex. Today, there is a strong demand for tailor-made products based on our technology,” explains Héloïse Fontaine, founder of the startup. To meet this demand, the laboratory is considering stepping up their game with a more important industrialization phase, in particular with the support of ADEME, the French Agency for Ecological Transition – the company won the EETE request for proposals as part of the France Relance state recovery programme, which shows their commitment for sustainability. “The idea is to be able to supply key accounts, because they are increasingly interested in our approach,” highlights the entrepreneur. As for Lessonia, the ingredient & cosmetics manufacturer and powder specialist since the company was found, they also chose to strengthen their industrial tool by purchasing a packaging machine for powder cosmetics. “Powder products require industrial equipment and know-how that not all cosmetics companies can boast. The issues are not the same, there are problems with mixtures, grain size, density, long wear… As for packaging, a powder injector is definitely not the same thing as an injector designed for liquids,” says Innovation Director Charles-Henri Morice. In addition, the Director points at regulatory constraints, which, for now, are not adapted to this new market and its very specific characteristics. “What can be considered as the finished product, the powder or the reconstituted product?” he asks. “The fact that the product is transformed makes it all more complex, and we are struggling with this regulatory vacuum. Let’s take the example of preservatives: they need to be in sufficient quantity in the finished reconstituted product, but on the other hand, under the European Cosmetics Regulation, there is a limit not to be exceeded in the dry product. So we need to find the right percentage in the powder so it is enough for the reconstituted product,” explains Charles-Henri Morice. Despite being very young, the powder cosmetic/hygiene product category requires adjustments due to a high demand. This transitional phase promises a bright future."
"2022 beauty will be bold in the UK, according to John Lewis","Having experienced with beauty during lockdowns, consumers will continue to do so with a renewed interest for bite-sized beauty. Advents calendars, gift boxes and discovery sets will continue to be key to trial luxury brands and new products before committing to full size. The concept of ‘fragrance wardrobe’ is also building momentum, with consumers exploring new fragrances based on their mood, or layering them to create a bespoke scent. Long-lasting EDPs are preferred over EDTs, luxe scented body sprays and hand care elevate hygiene routines, and fragranced shower oils, shampoos and mists are taking over personal care. Going back IRL, people are boasting bolder makeup looks. In tribute to the 1990s, lips will be the focus of makeup, with highly pigmented, matte lipsticks meant to withstand mask-wearing, and lipliners making a dramatic comeback. With light-catching complexions and fluffy-yet-defined eyebrows to complete the tableau. To picture it, think Emily in Paris! Multi-use beauty is taking a new form. Maximising efficacy and cutting down on packaging, it ticks all the right trend boxes. Biggest seller for beauty, skincare drives this, with amped-up active-based products that target, in one go, multiple post-pandemic lifestyle-related skin concerns. In this hygienic era, consumer look to bridge the gap between cosmetic and pharmaceutical skincare, seeking well-known staples in the likes of retinol, vitamin C, AHAs, BHAs and hyaluronic acid to achieve salon-level results. Buzz word of the year, microbiome should get yet more adepts, while makeup and haircare will also boost their formulas to offer multiple benefits. And while beauty routines are potentially shrinking around multi-use products, the at-home salon experience is still high in demand. Which should profit the soaring sales of LED light masks, facial toning devices and clever cleansers. Daily beauty routines seem also to be blending into 24-hour wellness routines. The raise in mental health awareness led many consumers to educate themselves and seek calming essential oils and self-mixed aromatherapeutic blends for the day. As an example, at John Lewis, the sales of Aveda Chakra™ 4 Balancing Mist have increased by 350% year on year. And it seems the night is no longer a no-beauty zone, with sales of sleepscape elements going out the roof: apart from the scented pillow mists, the British department store recorded +533% in sales of silk pillowcases. This holistic beauty movement is seeing collagen supplements becoming customer favourites on our shores too. A well-identified post-pandemic trend, beauty with meaning is seen by John Lewis as a new essential. They foresee waste-reducing refillable products becoming the norm, with the likes of Ouai, Rituals, Charlotte Tilbury, Hourglass, Evolve, Voltary already well into the movement. Not just preferable anymore, sustainably sourced ingredients, responsible formulas and planet-first packaging will be core benefits for beauty products."
Focus on microbiome creates new skincare generation,"A pioneer of the microbiome-friendly skincare wave, the brand Gallinée has become a reference. Launched on the British and French markets six years ago, it is now significantly growing: its turnover doubles every year and it is present in over 30 countries. “Gallinée is fast developing. We stand out from other brands on the market in that they are mostly focused on skincare, while we develop different product categories at the request of our customers. For example, we are the first to offer ‘microbiome-friendly’ oral care products. It should be known that the mouth microbiome is protective. 95% of these bacteria are good, while 5% are possibly deleterious, and yet, twice a day, we try to kill them with antibacterial products,” explains the brand’s founder, Marie Drago. Indeed, the brand has developed toothpaste with prebiotics whose microbiome-friendly action was confirmed by an independent laboratory, just like for all the brand’s products, and a solid mouthwash with pre- and probiotics to nourish the mouth microbiome – the brand’s current bestseller. The hair care line focused on scalp issues is also successful, and, more recently, Gallinée launched the first face oil with prebiotics on the market. “There has been fast-growing interest in these products due to the Covid pandemic. People really tried to understand how prebiotics and probiotics could protect the skin. On Google, searches with the ‘microbiome skincare’ keywords rose by 5,000% in 12 months. Major brands like Sanex also took the plunge. There is real growing interest, with congresses getting organized and articles published. To me, in the future, the impact on the microbiome will be essential to launch a cosmetic product,” she adds. American brand Dr Elsa Jungman’s experience confirms this growing interest. With its minimalist, holistic approach to skincare, the Dr Elsa Jungman range is composed of a gentle cleanser and moisturizing serums with a maximum of five ingredients. “Our philosophy is based on the ‘less is more’ concept for the benefit of the skin microbiome. We organize a lot of masterclasses and online events with our community to educate and help consumers reconnect with their skins. Adding a product cannot solve a skin problem,” explains Elsa Jungman, founder of the brand, the first to be “microbiome-friendly”-certified in the US. Faced with an increasing number of customers asking for more knowledge about their own skin flora, the scientist developed Meet My Microbiome, a chargeable kit to analyze your skin microbiome, in partnership with a laboratory. “Last spring, we tested a pilot for 50 USD. Despite the price, the experience was much successful and I realized what people actually wanted in the first place was discover their own microbiome. It confirms the market is much more mature in the US. A year ago, I would never have thought I could launch this product,” she explains. The participants received a report which described the diversity of their microbiome, the number of bacteria and fungi species detected, and the corresponding definitions. “We did the scientific literature search needed to find out what was the potential impact of each of the species detected, and we defined a score indicating their positive or negative impacts on the skin,” adds Elsa Jungman. In addition to the report, there are recommendations regarding rituals or product profiles. “But no brands, not even ours. Consumers should remain free to make their own choices”. The final version of Meet My Microbiome has been available since last October on the brand’s website, as well as at clean beauty distributor Credo Beauty for 149 USD. Given the increasing demand for products that preserve the skin’s bacterial flora, manufacturers have started developing ranges with clearer claims, like MS Beautilab, who highlight the postbiotic concept with their new anti-ageing natural line, Fermented Line, the first of the laboratory claimed to be microbiome friendly. “We use probiotic ferments like a plant that produces synthetic ingredients in order to collect metabolites derived from their work. Then, these metabolites become postbiotics: our active. Here, we used an active developed by Silab, Lactobiotyl,” explains Frédéric Boucly, R&D Manager – MS Advanced Skincare Solutions of MS Beautilab. This active acts on cell renewal and skin radiance. It is a postbiotic designed to target radiance and the skin barrier’s integrity. It is used in all the emulsions in the range. “We also used fermented camellia oil with a better affinity with the skin and squalane derived from sugar cane fermentation,” adds Frédéric Boucly. With this new anti-ageing line, MS Beautilab associated naturalness with actives derived from fermentation, as they viewed their natural properties as an additional advantage. “The notion of fermentation is very common throughout Asia. Consumers are familiar with these claims, since they are related to naturalness and provide an added value in that they offer a skin benefit,” concludes the scientist. After prebiotics and probiotics, postbiotics derived from fermentation could represent a new phase in microbiome-focused cosmetics."
Shopping on social networks could reach $1.2 trillion by 2025,"According to an Accenture study titled Why Shopping’s Set for a Social Revolution, so-called social commerce is expected to be worth USD 1.2 trillion by 2025, while the current global market generates $492 billion [1]. According to Accenture, shopping on social networks will grow ""three times as fast as traditional ecommerce."" In other words, it’s a market with high potential for influencers on networks like TikTok or Instagram. At the forefront, Generations Z and Y could be at the origin of 62% of the spending done via social networks. Millennials are forecast to account for the majority of social commerce spending, to the tune of $401 billion, compared to $359 billion for Generation Z. Boomers are likely to be less fond of this way of shopping, with a spend of some $128 billion expected for 2025. As for Generation X, they will be responsible for 28% of the market, with $344 billion worth of shopping on social media. Some 64% of social network users report making a purchase on a platform in the past year, which already accounts for almost two billion online shoppers worldwide, Accenture notes. ""The pandemic showed how much people use social platforms as the entry point for everything they do online — news, entertainment and communication,"" said Robin Murdoch, global Software & Platforms industry lead at Accenture. ""The steady rise in time spent on social media reflects how essential these platforms are in our daily life. They’re reshaping how people buy and sell, which provides platforms and brands with new opportunities for user experiences and revenue streams,"" he added. Among online shoppers, 63% say they are more likely to buy from the same merchant, highlighting the importance of loyalty even on social networks. According to the study, consumers are most afraid of not being refunded properly and not being protected enough. This was a negative point also raised in the early days of e-commerce, points out Accenture. Oliver Wright, the firm’s global Consumer Goods and Services lead, said: ""Trust is an issue that will take time to overcome, but the sellers who focus on these areas will be better positioned to grow market share."" The Accenture report also determines which purchases are likely to be the most popular on social media by 2025. Fashion will be the primary driver of growth, with 18% of all social commerce by 2025. This will be followed by electronics at 13% and home decoration at 7%. Accenture also points out that the sale of fresh food products and snacks could well reach 13%, almost exclusively for the Chinese market, and that the beauty sector should rapidly gain ground in the coming years. L’Oréal’s Professional Products Division, for instance, recently announced a partnership with the start-up Replika Software to implement its turnkey social selling software in the brand’s network of partner hair salons."
“Ice globes” - Is the power of cold creating a new skincare trend?,"Throughout 2021, TikTok and the other social networks were invaded by new beauty techniques dedicated specifically to skincare. If there’s one thing that really stood out, it’s ice, and using the powers of cold, notching up millions of views. Indeed, skin-icing, frozen cucumber, iced rice water and frozen beauty blenders were some of the top beauty hacks of 2021, while cryolipolysis — or fat freezing — has become one of the most popular cosmetic treatments (even if side effects suffered by the ex-model Linda Evangeslista came to underline the risks). Inevitably, this icy wave has paved the way for new beauty tools and tricks. This is undoubtedly the case of ice globes, the new skincare trend to monitor in early 2022. Such is the hype that the global search platform Stylight [1] has seen a 97% increase in clicks for the Skin Gym brand — known for its many facial tools — between November and December 2021. The search engine also reports a 194% jump in search interest for ice globes during December 2021, according to Google Trends data. An ice globe is a very simple tool which — as its name suggests — takes the form of two globes that you fill with water then place in the refrigerator or freezer, before applying them to the face for a massage on dry skin or after applying a cream or serum. They supposedly help soothe the skin, reduce inflammation and imperfections, and even reduce dark circles and bags. Their virtues are therefore similar to those of skin-icing, which only requires an ice cube, but without the discomfort of applying ice directly to the skin. On TikTok, at the beginning of the months, the #iceglobe hashtag counted more than a million views, and #iceglobes counted more than nine million views. Overall, ice globes form part of a larger phenomenon that involves drawing on the riches of nature — sometimes among the simplest — to get healthy and flawless skin."
Co-creation: Towards a novel innovation strategy?,"Launched two years ago by Simon Ménard, the Nidéco platform relies exclusively on its female consumers to develop its product range. ""Our 10-years’ experience in the cosmetic sector showed us that things were not necessarily done by our values. Most of the time, the product had to appeal to the retailer first and foremost, leaving the final consumer aside. Hence, we felt that we needed a more straightforward brand, we wanted to create THE brand for female consumers. In this case, they provide the project, select it and support it. The idea is also to redistribute differently the value created,"" he explains. The idea behind Nidéco is based entirely on this interaction. A call for projects is launched on the site. Consumers respond and submit their ideas for products, often based on a specific issue for which they found no answer on the market. One to two projects are selected per month and put to the vote. The idea validated by at least 2000 voters will directly trigger the formulation process with constant consultation of the community. ""At this point, we start co-developing the project via Instagram with people who might be interested (4000 to 5000 people). Since the beginning, with nearly 80,000 people, 20 projects have been co-created, of which 16 became sales products to date,"" adds Simon Ménard. The community is involved in the marketing mix, the choice of packaging, texture, volume... A partner laboratory develops the formula with the approval of the co-creator who came up with the idea. In this collaborative spirit, the concept leaves a lot of room for the sharing of the value generated. The co-creator receives an envelope of 500 euros when her idea is selected, then a 1500 euro cheque once 2000 votes have been reached. Finally, she receives 10% of the profits from the sale of her product. An unprecedented value creation process. ""We would also like to set up a system of ambassadresses, a sort of direct digital sales concept,"" adds the founder. For the time being, the Nidéco range, which is currently only sold online, and consists to date of 16 references, will make its debut in January at Le Printemps in Paris (Nation and Grands Boulevards). The director also confirms the launch of the brand in the Middle East with the Chalhoub Group at the beginning of 2022, as well as an expansion in Europe via Amazon. ""We will also make our debut on the Chinese market next spring via the social selling model, which is very popular in the country,"" he continues. More recently, the Crème de Toi initiative is aimed at brands by offering them decision-making tools during the design and development phases. ""For brands, it is difficult to access a panel of consumers for regular exchanges. Crème de Toi is a platform for the co-creation of cosmetics, which positions the consumer as a decision-making aid for brands. He becomes a consumer-actor,"" explains Ranesha Goorochurn, cosmetology expert and founding partner with Pierre Guérineau, in charge of artistic direction, and Yazid Saïdi, the technical director, also founding partners. ""The idea is to put the consumer back at the centre of the cosmetic creation process, with confidence and transparency. It also allows showing the consumer the different steps to create a finished product. On the other hand, the brand will be able to test its ideas and its product and therefore correct its development if necessary,"" he specifies. On social networks, the brand invites its community to be closely involved in the creative process, like ""accomplices"" by registering on a dedicated platform. Participants will then be able to interact on different successive product development stages: Analysis, conception, design, development, manufacturing and marketing. ""The brand will submit its product idea to consumers who in turn, will give the thumbs up or down for it, in the form of votes or comments. The first three stages are really about determining the expectations of consumers, on the ingredients, the texture, the pack, or any other matter that can be customised by the brand depending on its product, for example, the choice of a lipstick shade... This further improves the attractiveness of the project,"" adds the co-founder. The 400 ""accomplices"" registered on the platform to date, have filled their profile in (skin type, hair type, age, needs, expectations, etc.). This data will allow the brand to evaluate and take into consideration those who best match its target. Once the specifications have been determined, a targeted panel will test and give feedback on a sample of the product which was sent to them. Free since its launch last March, the platform will offer brands a monthly subscription system or à la carte packages from 2022. The Crème de Toi team is now working on the next version, which will include a gamification system. Each interaction will result in points being earned, and ultimately products."
Beauty snacking: A moment to break up the boredom of the homeworking lifestyle,"""Beauty snacking"", this short beauty moment that combines relaxation and pleasure, to break the routine of homeworking, is one of the major trends of the moment, according to WGSN. This phenomenon was born from the boredom of the first lockdowns during which consumers learned to intersperse their tiring and endless days of online work, with cocooning moments in their bathroom: a moment in the bathtub, a charcoal mask applied to the face, a scrub or a home hair treatment… Between two contracts, reports, or videoconferences, these micro sessions of self-care aimed to take an invigorating, energizing break, that helped to avoid the monotony of this period of social distancing. Contrary to what one might have imagined, heading back to the office didn’t really alter these new habits adopted by women and men during lockdowns. The trend is not about applying a quick face mask in the middle of the open space, it is about using certain — more discreet — products at any time of the day to give one’s morale, as well as one’s skin, a boost. WGSN describes it as ""micro beauty moments"" to ""break up the homeworking lifestyle or create moments of pleasure."" There are a multitude of products that are perfectly suited to this new practice, and more are expected to arrive in 2022: lip balm and scrub, rapid face masks, eye masks and patches, etc. Among the cosmetics best suited to this trending routine are none other than moisturizing mists and sprays that do not affect one’s makeup. Dry shampoos can be used between two meetings, while a multitude of tools for the face such as the famous jade or rose quartz stone rollers, and tools used for gua sha massage can be used for a quick, relaxing swipe. According to WGSN, ‘beauty snacking’ will also take on a more literal definition with edible skincare in the shape of sweets and health bars that will continue to grow at fast pace in 2022."
Fermented beauty: The rising trend of 2022?,"Beauty habits have changed considerably since the beginning of the pandemic, with many consumers trading their multiple layers of cosmetics for a more minimalist and holistic beauty, with the aim to safeguard the skin from environmental factors — like pollution, tobacco, the sun, etc. — while giving it the opportunity to restore and strengthen. To this end, the boom in prebiotics and probiotics is expanding, giving rise to a new, very similar trend, in fermented beauty. An age-old process used in many countries around the world, particularly in Asia, biological fermentation describes the transformation that certain organic materials undergo under the action of enzymes secreted by micro-organisms. In other words, these micro-organisms — which can be enzymes, bacteria or yeasts — induce the decomposition of basic materials or ingredients to transform them into components that may be much more powerful. As with prebiotics, the objective is to multiply the “good” bacteria at the expense of “bad” ones in order to ramp up the power of each active ingredient and boost its benefits for the skin. Fermentation has long been practiced for the processing of a large variety of foods. And the process is essentially the same for fermented beauty. According to the supporters of the technique, not only does fermentation act as an active ingredient booster, but it also makes for a higher concentration of nutrients and antioxidants — goodbye signs of aging — while optimizing the penetration of active ingredients into the skin. Furthermore, the natural substances developed during the fermentation process supposedly extend the shelf life of these formulations. Some niche brands already offer — and in some cases have long offered — cosmetics based on fermented ingredients, but the giants of the sector are also starting to gradually adapt to meet new customer demands. Indeed, fermented beauty is one of the beauty trends that’s predicted to boom in 2022, as revealed by projections from trend forecaster WGSN. It’s a phenomenon that could send kombucha, a fermented tea-based drink, racing to the top of the most popular cosmetic ingredients. In the meantime, it’s already possible to try out this new generation of cosmetics thanks to the Gallinée brand, a specialist in prebiotics, whose hair cleansing cream is enriched with fermented rice water. Otherwise, look for Innisfree and its fermented soy masks, or Whamisa, a true specialist in the field."
"Trends: Generation Z sets the tone for cosmetics, said Quadpack","Quadpack’s Market Insights team analysed the rising trends that will affect the beauty industry in 2022. All sum up the mindset of a principled, yet playful generation. Joy and playfulness are the new keywords for colour cosmetics. Young consumers want a fun routine with products that stimulate their creativity. Limited editions and collaborations with bold colours, glitter and unique textures invite the consumer to have fun. Consumers are less willing to compromise their beliefs over an attractive product or brand. The beauty industry must truly commit to social and environmental causes, being transparent every step of the way. As young people are increasingly informed and educated, they spot greenwashing in a heartbeat. As an evolution of the ‘natural beauty’ trend, consumers are more open to lab-made solutions that help protect the environment. From an ingredient that replaces animal origin elements to a mineral sunscreen that is not harmful to coral reefs, tech for good is always welcome. The era of ‘hiding imperfections’ is about to die – at least for now. Freckles, spots, wrinkles, folds, are personal marks and should be enhanced by make-up. Brands must be inclusive and bring diverse solutions or risk being boycotted. Products that make people look and smell good are desirable, but not enough to conquer their hearts. Besides having beautifying and healthy effects, cosmetics should tackle wellbeing and bring holistic benefits, for the body and the mind. Gen Z established TikTok and their virtual lives are more important than ever. While some brands are launching try-on filters and apps, others are focusing on products that help the consumer look good on camera."
Skinskool lists lower-cost alternatives to expensive luxury skincare,"The algorithm developed by the Skinskool platform allows to find copies — or dupes — of skincare products considered as too expensive by some consumers. A score shows how well the original product matches the cheaper one. And in this little game — which can last for hours — one might soon notice that certain skincare products selling for nearly EUR 150 are 100% similar to products selling for less than EUR 20, as far as the list of ingredients is concerned. ""Dupe Finder"" is the name of the algorithm developed for the Skinskool platform, with the help of a biochemist and a software engineer. It is not based on a keyword search but on the ingredients contained in the formula of each product. The ""Dupe Finder"" groups all similar ingredients and prioritizes them ""based on relevance and functionality."" All of this is done automatically, making it easier to include all the new skincare products that regularly come to the market. With this technology, any internet user can simply search for a specific skincare product to see a list of similar  — or almost similar — products, rated with a match score. The platform claims to be able to identify ""comparable dupes for over 90% of skincare products on the market."" The ETX Studio team tested the algorithm with La Prairie’s ""Skin Caviar Crystalline Concentrate"" firming serum, priced at EUR 440 per 30 ml on the brand’s official website. The result was hardly convincing, since the product that came closest to this choice only ’matches’ by 51% and is priced at a minimum of USD 165. All the products that ETX Studio looked for had matches below 75%. However, by making the test with a product put forward by a TikToker fond of this new platform: the antioxidant serum ""C E Ferulic"" by SkinCeuticals, selling for more than EUR 155 in its original version, the ETX Studio team found more impressive match scores: 100% for one product, and 99% for seven other products, and with a price under EUR 10 for some of them. However, are consumers interested in such a platform really aware of the limits of making a comparison of ingredients in a formula? Of course, the platform can detect products based on catalogue formulas and which differ only in marketing. Or, the cases where a multinational sells the same formula under different brands and at different prices. These cases exist, but are not very numerous. But what do 60% or 70% match scores mean? Indeed, it’s hard to know if the missing ingredients are or aren’t the ones that (ultimately) make all the difference: active ingredients for instance. Moreover, for SkinCeuticals’ ""C E Ferulic"" serum, for example, a comparison of the full list of ingredients shows that the original product and its dupe are very similar in the substances they contain. But what about the concentrations? This information is not disclosed by manufacturers and therefore not available to those who designed the algorithm. Hence, SkinCeuticals’ ""C E Ferulic"" serum claims to contain ""15% pure vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid), 1% vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and 0.5% ferulic acid."" All these ingredients can also be found in the closest dupe, but without any information on their concentrations. It’s a detail that isn’t insignificant! To date, the ingredients of more than 32,000 skincare and haircare products have been scanned  by Skinskool. It remains to be seen whether consumers will be convinced."
"Beauty, wellness, fashion, home: What trends will Gen Z be driving in 2022?","Looking ahead to 2022, Instagram has unveiled a comprehensive report on the trends to watch out for on the web in its Trend Report 2022. After interviewing 1,200 social network users, aged 13 and 24 in the United States in October 2021, Instagram has identified ten points shaping up to be hot topics in 2022. About one in three people who participated in the survey say they’re more interested in buying and learning about ""clean"" makeup and beauty products in 2022: ""This includes plant-based skincare, vegan makeup, using less products on their skin and products with ’clean’ ingredients,"" Instagram explains in its report. Clean beauty that balance glowing skin with minimal products and safer ingredients will only grow in 2022. In the same time, fashion looks set to come in various flavours next year. 50% of the teens and young adults surveyed are set to try bold fashion aesthetics like ""Dark Academia,"" ""Goblincore"" and more nostalgic looks in 2022, confirming the return of retro. However, one the main issue will be about protecting the planet. Almost one in four people, or 23%, are expected to shop on second-hand fashion sites in 2022. About 24% of teens and young adults intend to help make fashion more eco-friendly by selling their stuff on sites or social networks next year. Thrift store fashion will still be relevant in 2022 as the issue of eco-responsibility in the fashion world is still a top concern for Generation Z. While online shopping has become a real trend on social networks, about 27% of teens and young adults, or more than one in four, plan to use social networks to make purchases. While TikTok can boast of being a springboard for new artists, Instagram also confirms the importance of music on its platform. 24% of users say they are more excited about visual music experiences in 2022, while one in four teens expect to follow live concerts on social networks. 70% of teens even rely on social networks to discover new songs and artists. And when it comes to music, it’s all about dancing. Dance challenges will always be a hit online. More than one in three teens are looking forward to new dance challenges in 2022, including more elaborate routines. For four in five young people, influencers and other well-known content creators on social networks have more impact on culture than traditional celebrities such as actors, Instagram reveals in its report, ""Today, young people are impacted by a wide spectrum of creators and their relationship is more tightly aligned around shared interests and less so on how popular they’ve gotten."" The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken up the relationship with work. 63% of Gen Zers agree that they have re-evaluated their career goals because of the pandemic. For this so-called sacrificed generation, a large salary is no longer seen as a goal in life. 71% now prefer to have a meaningful job, even if it pays less. The younger generation has totally redefined what success looks like. 90% of Gen Zers believe that the best education comes from real-life experiences. 66% of them are even beginning to re-assess the true value of a college education. The #Food hashtag has a bright future ahead of it. Cooking on social media will still be trending in 2022. According to Instagram, young users will still be looking for new and increasingly complex recipes to further improve their cooking skills. Indeed, one in six teens or young millennials are showing increased interest in at-home molecular gastronomy. Meanwhile, one in five young adults want to learn more about mixology techniques to try at home, or are ready to go out of their way to learn about new ways to source ingredients. Wellness is one of the trends that works on Instagram. Indeed, at-home workouts are more popular among the social network’s users, at 48%, compared to 34% for those not on Instagram. To feel good, users will continue to talk about mental health. About one in three will partake in activities such as meditation sessions and exercise events. Creative hobbies will also be sought after, with one in four young people trying their hand at drawing, painting or any other artistic activity. The new generation wants to feel good, both physically and mentally, and this also involves creating a more environmentally friendly home. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the world of video games has boomed. This trend was already present and will continue to attract new followers. With the creation of avatars and the arrival of fashion and beauty in the metaverse, ""non-gamer"" gamers are accessing video games through fashion. Now, one in five young people expect to see more branded clothing for their digital avatars. Plus, 40% of teenagers and young adults expect more trends around video games in 2022. Live-streaming of video games will continue to appeal to young people, with about three in ten watching livestreams of gamers. To better cope with the often gloomy news, internet users will increasingly rely on the use of memes, these humorous viral montages often shared on social networks. More than one in five young people paid more attention to memes about the stock market and astrology in the past year. Instagram users are more engaged citizens, it seems. They are more likely to have voted in local, state and national elections, at 18% compared to 6% for young people not using Instagram, the social network said. Plus, 52% of Instagrammers followed a social justice account in 2021. They are also increasingly willing to donate to causes, at 37% for 2022 against 32% in 2021. A generosity from which charities will be able to benefit by making appeals for donations directly on Instagram."
Influencers have a significant impact on sales but not on the long term,"Nine out of ten products analysed in select Amazon subcategories showed a relationship between TikTok viral exposure and a rise by more than 85.3%, on average, of their Amazon revenue, from one month to the next, found a recent study, conducted by Ines Durand, eCommerce Specialist at Similarweb. But while this beneficial effect is visible, it’s not necessarily sustainable. According to the study findings, sales of these products return to normal two months after their TikTok success. Many products have become viral hits on TikTok, from CeraVe SA Cleanser to The Ordinary’s AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution and Revlon’s One Step hair-drying styling brush. Such products have brought increased revenue to brands. Analyzing revenue from these products, which are widely reviewed on TikTok, between September 2020 and August 2021, the study showed an average growth of 112% for Revlon, 61% for The Ordinary and 37% for CeraVe. L’Oreal Paris, for its part, managed to achieve more than 400% growth on average with its Infallible Fresh Wear Powder foundation, released in December 2020. According to Similarweb analytics, the original video was viewed by seven million users in February 2021, launching a chain reaction of videos. Dates that coincide with revenue growth of over 1,238% between January and February 2021. While revenue for the foundation reached $20,300 last January, it jumped to $272,200 the following month, far exceeding the +2.6% month-on-month category growth rate for the period. More generally, the #Beauty hashtag has almost 71 billion views on TikTok. The hashtag #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, bringing together products promoted by users, has more than seven billion views. The #BestAmazonFinds hashtag has been used more than 45.7 million times. Furthermore, Similarweb’s study highlights TikTok’s significant power of influence compared to Instagram. TikTok achieves a better engagement rate, four times higher than Meta’s social network, at 17.5% compared to just 4.2%. Brands have every interest in developing their presence on TikTok. With a particularly high engagement rate, and a growth in the number of active users on the social network, TikTok is a hive of marketing opportunity for brands. That’s something that the shaving cream brand EOS has clearly understood. After a video of the user Carly Joy went viral on TikTok, the brand chose to surf on this free publicity. After around 10 million views, the brand launched a limited-edition version of the product presented by Carly Joy, using her own technique. The study reports month-on-month revenue growth of over 171% for EOS shaving cream in March 2021, from $54,100 to $146,800. The expected growth in this product category was, however, estimated at +30%. It is clearly a reality and not a myth that TikTok influencers have the power to boost product sales. Some are already capitalizing on their popularity by adding links to mentioned products in their biography — a way to earn commission on sales. Conversely, it is likely that a bad buzz, like the one recently experienced by the Chanel Advent calendar, can also have disastrous consequences."
From waterless washing to wild bathing: the key beauty trends for 2022,"The focus of beauty products for 2022 will be on usability and sustainability. “The top beauty trends for 2022 reflect wider societal changes, as consumers continue to look to sustainably minded practises and products including waterless elements and longer shelf lives,” says Clare Varga, WGSN’s Head of Beauty. According to WGSN’s international team of expert, next year’s trends will feature hygiene procedures that save water, fermented beauty, faster makeup routines and beauty snacking: – Waterless Washing: Waterless washing products conserve water, accommodating the one in 10 individuals globally who lack access to safe drinking water. This trend is an evolution of waterless beauty, and bring your own water (BYOW) products, with early innovators offering Showerless Shampoo and no-water-needed shaving products. – Fermented Beauty: The desire for potent ingredients that last longer is driving interest in kombucha for the skin. Driven by the K- and J-Beauty markets, fermentation releases enzymes that break down molecules so they can better penetrate the skin, delivering powerful ingredients into the very structure of the skin or hair. The process of fermentation also cultivates the growth of beneficial bacteria such as lactic, organic and acetic acids, which act as natural preservatives. These naturally occurring bacterias prolong the shelf life of formulas, appealing to both the sustainably minded and value-focused consumer. – The two-minute make up bag: The two-minute makeup bag appeals to consumers who want a healthy ‘no make-up look’ quickly. Aligning with the convenience of fast, low-maintenance looks and techniques adopted during the pandemic, the two-minute make up bag offers flexible and low-key beauty lifestyles as consumers adjust to a hybrid post-pandemic existence. Products will concentrate on new and smarter beauty hacks that deliver better results with less effort, money, and commitment. – Beauty Snacking: A new beauty trend emerged during lockdown: the beauty snack. Set to become a staple in 2022, micro beauty moments were incorporated into consumers’ lives during the pandemic, to break up the homeworking lifestyle or create moments of pleasure. Beauty snacking includes flash treatments and easy, no-mess formulas. It will also take on a more literal definition with edible skincare in the shape of sweets and health bars emerging in 2022. – Wild Bathing: The urge to reconnect with nature will drive customers to seek the natural benefits of open water and outdoor spas. With roots in many cultures, indigenous populations, and traditional therapies across the world, such as Japanese onsen and Victorian bathing machines, this practise is steeped in heritage. Bath and body products that replicate outdoor bathing will bring nature inside. Soaps, substances, and materials derived from nature will increase in popularity, as will products based on seaweed or seawater. – Coastal-Foraged Ingredients: Skincare and personal care products that include seaweed extracts, kelp, sea fennel and algae will become mainstream must-haves. Coastal ingredients will be valued for their soothing, hydrating, detoxifying, therapeutic, and transportive ability. Consumers will gravitate towards local, seasonal, and wild-harvested items that are beneficial for their skin and the environment."
Top beauty trends spotted at Cosmoprof Asia Digital Week 2021,"With rigid beauty stereotypes still the norm in many Asian societies, anti-ageing cosmetics are traditionally a large and important market in the APAC region. In countries such as China, for example, anti-ageing buyers are getting increasingly younger and even women in their early 20s are starting to purchase beauty products that promise to guard against signs of early ageing. At CADW, many of the face care products had a distinct high-tech or medical vibe. Japanese manufacturer Alen International introduced Skin Scientist AI, described as an anti-ageing serum formulated with “smart” capsules of ingredients that recognise damaged areas in the skin barrier and deliver the specific actives that are needed. Malaysia’s Sky Resources presented the Age Halt Needle-Free Serum which contains Neodermyl complex and hyaluronic acid. And Changzhou Weibo Hi-Tech Biotechnology from China specialises in freeze-dried functional cosmetics. The brand’s Centella Repairing Freeze-Dried Mask is a sheet mask “activated” with water which turns the active ingredient into a rich, thick essence. The global microbiome skin care trend was also visible at the show, especially amongst Korean exhibitors. Product launches highlighted calming and microbiome-strengthening ingredients like ferments and probiotics. K-beauty brand Reinplatz’s Calming Sensitive Serum contains centella asiatica and saccharomyces ferment to strengthen the skin’s barrier while Aqua Derma Cream in Korean microbiome researcher Bifido’s Bifidolab face care range combines probiotics with hyaluronic acid to strengthen the microbiome. And fellow Korean Biomeek’s Sensimetic Soothing Toner contains a special barrier complex and hyaluronic acid to deeply hydrate sensitive skin. While international skin and body care labels are, of course, still popular in APAC there has been a distinct rise in domestically-manufactured cosmetics brands across many of the major regional markets. Local pride is ruling supreme in a number of Asian countries. In China, the recent popularity of local beauty products rose on the back of the guochao trend [Chinese retro trendy] which, in turn, has been fuelled by the current surge in patriotism amongst the younger generation. Hanbang beauty [based on traditional Korean medicine] has been popular in Korea for decades whilst Japanese consumers are traditionally deeply appreciative of regionally specific beauty or food ingredients. However, the price-performance ratio also plays a crucial role in some APAC markets. In the developing economy of Indonesia, for example, domestic beauty has also grown since the pandemic began but here the cheaper price tag (when compared to imported brands) is playing an important role. At CADW many of the Asian exhibitors presented products with specific regional ingredients. Japanese beauty brand Edobio, for example, recently launched the Saketernal Hydration Serum which contains lactobacillic fermented sake lees and sweet potato root extract. Korean manufacturer Roots Base face care line-up is formulated with ingredients traditionally used in Korean medicine. The Roots Base Hydrating Essence Toner includes poria cocos, a medicinal mushroom that grows amongst the roots of pine trees. Fellow K-beauty label Accoje’s products are based on ingredients sourced from Korea’s famed Jeju island. The brand’s Dust Block Finisher is an anti-pollution moisturizer formulated with Jeju pine leaf extract and Jeju green tea. Another product category that made a strong appearance at CADW was personal fragrance. Traditionally perfumes are not a big market in APAC and up until a few years ago, the Asian fragrance sector was dominated by the classic international mainstream fragrances. Then niche fragrances appeared on the scene – in China, for example, demand for indie fragrances went quickly through the roof – and now a clutch of new Asian fragrance houses is shaping the domestic fragrance markets, especially amongst GenZ consumers. Subtler fragrance options like solid and cream fragrances are a popular format in Asia judging by the number of domestic fragrance houses presenting these types of products at the show. Korean newcomer brand Come Inside Me, for example, offers several cream perfumes packaged in tubes, while Japanese fragrance house Sholayered top sellers include their Crème de Parfum and Crème de Cologne. The brand has also just launched a Non-Alcoholic Perfume Spray said to be particularly suitable for customers who want to avoid alcohol or don’t usually wear strong perfumes. Fragrance is also increasingly associated with well-being and mental health in Asia, with aromatherapy-influenced fragrance products very visible at Cosmoprof Asia Digital Week. This trend is, of course, directly related to the effects of the on-going pandemic, correlating to the global surge in popularity of personal care products promising relaxing, calming or sleep-enhancing benefits. Korean fragrance brand I Gentleman for Homme showed its two new scented sprays for fabrics based on the brand’s iconic men fragrances. Scented aromatherapy mask sprays are also popular pandemic launches – Sholayered recently brought out a mint-scented fabric mask spray. Japanese exhibitor Edobio launched Aroma Floreeze Spray, which is formulated with lactic acid, green tea extract and lavender. Korean fragrance start-up Deepscent presented its Arom Official “aroma styler”, a smart fragrance device that is filled with scent capsules and can then be programmed with the user’s favourite fragrance blends. The latest Arom Official launch is a range of curated scent travel sets which take customers on an olfactory journey to nine international destinations, including the Korean island of Jeju, the French city of Grasse, Sapporo in Japan, the Maldives, Los Angeles and Seattle. The next Cosmoprof/Cosmopack Asia trade fair is set to take place in Hong Kong from 17th to 19th November 2022 (hopefully), celebrating the 25th anniversary of Asia’s leading trade show."
Sales of unisex fragrances expected to grow in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates,"The fragrance market in the U.A.E. is expanding rapidly owing to the rising disposable income. Moreover, the rising investments in advertising and marketing campaigns, increasing volume of digital marketing activities, and growing relevance of personal grooming are also contributing to the growth of the market. From USD 720.2 million in 2020, the U.A.E. fragrance market is set to witness an 8.3% growth rate (Compound Annual Growth Rate – CAGR) between 2020 and 2030, according to market research firm P&S Intelligence [1]. In Saudi Arabia, the fragrance market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% to reach USD 3,810.5 million in 2030, from a USD 1,738.5 million base in 2020 [2]. In both countries, the fragrance market was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a sharp reduction in sales in 2020. In the very next years, unisex fragrances are expected to play a key role in both markets. Younger generations, in particular, seem less interested in the traditional segmentation between women’s and men’s fragrances. Fragrance companies are recognizing this by designing perfumes that aren’t gender specific. While natural fragrances are expected to experience the higher CAGR, of 8.5%, in Saudi Arabia, consumers in the U.A.E. seem to prefer long lasting synthetic fragrances. The demand for luxury fragrances is also expected to grow in both markets. The growing brand consciousness and increasing expenditure on luxury goods by millennials are the main growth drivers for the prestige and luxury segments. Both markets are benefiting from a favourable development in average disposable income. According to P&S Intelligence, currently, almost 60% of the population of the U.A.E. falls in the age group of 14–40 and this population has a significantly higher purchasing power than that in other age groups. According to the Census and Economic Information Center (CEIC) data, in Saudi Arabia, the gross national disposable income reached USD 658,493.5 in 2017 from USD 617,848.7 in 2016. Moreover, as per the data provided by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, consumer spending in the country increased to USD 83,916.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 from $80,067.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Increased participation of people in social events and the need to make a good impression on one’s peers also contribute to the rise of fragrance usage."
From originality to retro inspirations: Pinterest’s incoming trends for 2022,"With 400 million users worldwide, Pinterest has identified 175 emerging trends that may well shape 2022. [1] When it comes to beauty, watch out for eyelids, teeth and even skin being adorned with jewels in 2022.

"Black lips, face gems and scalp skincare: Beauty is going bold in 2022!","After the no-makeup days of lockdown, then dealing with a more normal but still face-mask-wearing life, next year should bring a touch more eccentricity to the makeup department. While it’s hard to know if face masks will still be a must-have accessory of everyday life, it seems that women are opting for more bold and daring beauty choices. So, after being somewhat neglected in recent months, lipstick is now poised to return, albeit in an unexpected colour — black. We knew that the pop-punk aesthetic was making a comeback on the fashion scene, but it was not 100% sure that it would also take over the world of makeup. But that just goes to show how much people are raring to liven up their lives with a touch of audacity. Gone are slippers, dull complexions and sweatsuits, giving way to more extravagance, self-expression and freedom. New data shared by the global fashion research platform Stylight [1] points to a strong craze for black lipstick, as from November. In fact, the platform reports a jump in clicks of more than 1,000% for Clinique’s Almost Lipstick in the Black Honey shade. And it’s a trend that’s confirmed on social networks, with several tens of millions of views for the hashtag #blacklipstick on TikTok, and more than 500,000 publications on Instagram, including a host of recent posts and videos. But that won’t be the only extravagant beauty trend coming next year. Even more surprisingly, self-adhesive face jewels also seem to have been gaining popularity for several weeks. Stylight reports that search interest for ""face gems"" tripled in the month of November on Google, and sharply increased on its own international platforms. In particular, ColourPop’s face crystals set saw a 100% increase in clicks over the previous month. Not only have brands increased the number of scalp care products, such as brushes and exfoliating scrubs, in recent months, but beauty fans are going crazy for these items. It became a trend, dubbed “scalp skincare”, a focus on caring for the scalp. Search interest for the terms ""scalp products"" increased by 70% on Google in November, while the favorite product among internet users seems to be the NatureLab Tokyo clarifying scalp scrub, with clicks up 350% on Stylight in October-November compared to the previous two months. As in 2020 and 2021, organic and vegan skincare products will also be in demand, as well as tinted suncare and blue-light protection products, reflecting a desire to prevent environmental damage and combat the signs of skin aging."
German prestige beauty market bounces back thanks to fragrance sales,"Sales of beauty products in the selective channel [1] in Germany increased by 3% in the in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2020, reported market research firm NPD Group and the trade association VKE-Kosmetikverbrand. However, sales over the period January-September 2021 remained down 7% compared to 2020 [2]. The fragrance category clearly appears as the main growth driver, with sales up 7% compared to 2020 and an increase of more than 4% compared to 2019. Skin care, on the other hand, has not yet regained its 2019 level and even remains below the 2020 level. Eventually, the make-up category, which was negatively impacted in 2020, stabilized in 2021 but sales remain down by nearly 20% compared to the 2019 mark. “The fragrance category is experiencing a faster recovery in the nine countries that we follow at The NPD Group, while social life is gradually getting back to normal. We believe fragrance could even become the new ‘lipstick index’, ” said Samantha Grand, Executive Director, Germany Beauty at The NPD Group. Actually, perfumes are less impacted than makeup by requirements to wear face masks. Moreover, according to The NPD Group, local demands may also have been stimulated by the dramatic decline in the number of international travel, with a shift in sales previously made in travel retail. Online sales continue to play a major role. The e-commerce now accounts for 40% of the selective beauty market in Germany, compared to 20% two years ago, reported The NPD Group and VKE-Kosmetikverbrand. However, e-commerce sales did not make up the decline of sales in brick and mortar stores that had to close during lockdown periods. However, while restrictions ended in May 2021, the number of shoppers in physical stores remained below expectations, according to The NPD Group, partly due to the absence of international tourists and the continued home working for many employees. “The pandemic has definitely been a driver and accelerator of omnichannel strategies. But brands also took advantage of this opportunity to improve the customer experience,” emphasized Martin Ruppmann, Managing Director of VKE-Kosmetikverbrand. In such a context, the last quarter will therefore play a key role for the German prestige beauty market, with high expectations from the various players, whether for Black Friday or for Christmas sales. However, “purchasing behaviours could be very different compared to recent years,” pointed Samantha Grand. “A study by The NPD Group in the United States already confirms this possibility for the American beauty market. The results show, among other things, that we can assume consumers will be shopping earlier this year as they anticipate supply chain shortages and resultant price increases."""
Beauty sales in physical stores rise as UK consumers return to the high street,"Prestige beauty sales in brick-and-mortar stores increased 9% in the 13 weeks to the end of October 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, according to The NPD Group. Online sales for prestige beauty in this period declined 6% when compared to the same 13 weeks in 2020. Based on the 13 week period to the end of October 2021, brick-and-mortar sales accounted for 62% of total sales weight, which increases to 68% if total sales weight when looking at the fragrance category in isolation. According to The NPD Group, this is positive news heading into the Christmas retail period as historically, November and December account for approximately half of a full year’s worth of fragrance sales. Fragrance is one of the most dynamic categories in prestige beauty, growing 14% in the period from January 2021 to the end of October 2021, compared to the same period in 2021. This reflects a similar trend across the prestige beauty market where all categories (skincare, make-up and fragrance) are all performing positively compared to the same period in 2020. “It’s great news to see consumers returning to the high street and visiting beauty counters. It demonstrates the continued importance of beauty consultants, and there are other benefits including no delivery costs, you can touch, feel and smell products while also embracing the social aspect of retail therapy. In brick-and-mortar stores you can purchase the tangible product and take it away there and then,” explains Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty. However, the prestige beauty market has changed dramatically since last autumn when stores were periodically closed due to lockdown. A number of high street retailers have also closed due to the pandemic and e-commerce rapidly developed to become the second largest channel for beauty and grooming purchases after hypermarkets and supermarkets according to GlobalData. The fact that customers return to physical stores for a more hands-on shopping experience represents positive news for prestige beauty retailers and confirms the adoption of e-retailers for beauty and grooming is set to slow. However, e-commerce will continue to grow in the country and retailers definitively have to provide beauty consumers with a tailored omni-channel shopping experience."
Brazil’s B-Beauty is winning over its home market and expanding internationally,"Brazilian consumers are convinced their (often) mixed skins, which are highly exposed to sun rays, have their own specificities and require specific rituals. “We have spent years and years receiving and using products that came from abroad, that were hardly taking into account the peculiarities of Brazilian skins, cultures and routines,” explains Patrícia Lima, CEO and founder of Simple Organic. “The Korean routine, for example, has so many steps that it doesn’t fit in with our everyday life. Heavy formulations, which require a long absorption time, were not designed for our combination and oily skins and very hot days,” she adds. Simple Organic is one of the pioneers of the B-Beauty (Brazilian Beauty) movement, which emerged in response to the globalization of cosmetics. “B-Beauty defends a minimalist and effective routine with products targeting the characteristics of Brazilian skins,” explains dermatologist Luiz Romancini, founder of Creamy. “The movement stands out by enhancing the diversity of Brazilian skins. This cultural identification in beauty and personal care rituals is important in finding more assertive formulas and treatments.” The movement has amplified with the outcome of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Skin care has grown in importance during the pandemic and Brazilian brands have focused on bringing the best of Brazil and its raw materials, strengthening themselves in the domestic market and becoming a benchmark in the international market,” says Patrícia Lima. Patrícia Camargo, co-founder of CARE Natural Beauty, underlines another driver supporting the diffusion of the B-Beauty movement outside Brazil. “Five years ago, we didn’t have as many technologies available for developing high performance products. We think it’s a nice surprise for the international market to see so many quality products, originating from Brazil, and focusing on national assets,” she explains. According to Patrícia Camargo, B-Beauty brands are also very attractive because of their concern for sustainability. “People are more concerned about everything ending in the environment and the impact of rampant consumption on the planet and health. Purchasing behaviours are changing and consumers’ eyes are now attentive to substances harmful to the health and to what packaging is becoming after use.” Another characteristic of companies in the B-Beauty movement is their digital culture: online sales, proximity to customers, partnerships with influencers who respect the diversity of their audience. “Like other young cosmetics companies, Creamy is completely digital. We were born in the midst of a pandemic and that did not prevent us from conquering our audience. Influencers have played an important role in this process, not only for the sale of products, but also for disseminating useful information on skin care,” says Luiz Romancini. According to him, B-Beauty is here to stay. “People are looking to optimize their time, so a simpler and more precise treatment proposal is the best option”. The founder of Simple Organic also believes in the future of the movement. “What happens abroad will continue to be incorporated into Brazilian routines, but B-Beauty complements that process and is unlikely to evaporate. After all, it makes a lot more sense to adopt what was first thought out for me,” concludes Patrícia Lima."
Fragrance or face cream: What are the most popular beauty gifts in the USA?,"Because cosmetics are among the most popular gifts at this time of year in the USA, Yves Rocher set out to find out which beauty gifts were most popular in each of country’s state at this time of year. The company used data from a Google Trends search of ""beauty gift"" for the period of November 27, 2020 to December 24, 2020 in the USA [1]. According to the study, fragrance gift sets top the list of beauty products heading under the tree December 25, on par with face creams. Sometimes allowing you to test several fragrances, or combine them with other types of cosmetics, fragrance gift sets lead the way as the most popular holiday beauty gift in 11 states, including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. Face creams, in  particular moisturizers, seem to make the perfect gift for many Americans, as they also top the list of popular beauty gifts in 11 states, including Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. Makeup is also very popular for holiday giving. And if eye and lip palettes are often the season’s star products, these two must-haves seem to be outshone by nail polishes at this time of year. Nail varnish ranks number one in no less than ten states, including Montana, North Dakota, New Hampshire, Indiana, Alaska, and Hawaii. Among the other states surveyed, lipstick is all the rage in New York, eyeshadow palettes are popular in Arizona, Oklahoma and South Dakota, and bath sets seem to be a hit in Arkansas and Kentucky. On the whole, Utah and Oregon appear to be the two states most interested in beauty gifts during the frenzied shopping season that runs from Black Friday to Christmas Eve."
"Harry Styles, icon of a stereotype-free generation, launches beauty line","For several years now, Harry Styles has been cultivating an androgynous look, a style that he has fun with at  red-carpet noutings, gala social events, and concerts. But it was just a year ago, at the end of 2020, that the global star definitively defied fashion conventions that emphasized the duality of men and women. However, on the cover of the fashion bible Vogue, the former member of boy band One Direction posed in a Gucci dress. It marked the first time that a man was featured on the cover of the American edition of the legendary magazine, and moreover in an outfit that had heretofore been associated with the female gender. It was a statement-making move that would shake up gender conventions. As with any (r)evolution, this cover met with a mixed reception from the public, generating some criticism and insults and, inevitably, sparking debate. But Harry Styles has received a significant boost from Gen Z, a generation not shy about exerting its powerful influence, and who are more supportive in this regard than previous generations. It’s a generation that is also highly determined when it comes to shattering anything remotely resembling a stereotype. ""In terms of marketing targets, Generation Z doesn’t fit neatly into the boxes, if only because it can’t stand the stereotypes that are the legacy of older generations. For example, they are totally averse to the notion of gender,"" explained Éric Briones, editorial director of the Journal du Luxe, last March. There is no doubt that the British singer has not only understood the messages this generation wants to send — messages that brands are struggling to decipher — but that he has above all chosen to embrace it. A prominent muse for the house of Gucci, Harry Styles has not stopped working this gender fluid fashion style throughout the year, all done without intention of being shocking or provocative, rather just with the desire to express his unique vision and his personality, through those most visible vectors of fashion and beauty. And, as proof that the British star isn’t mistaken in his stance, his desire to let his true fashion colours show, his fame has continued to grow over the last few months, making him one of the most influential celebrities in the fashion world. Last March, Harry Styles chose a boa to jazz up his on-stage outfit for the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, creating an unprecedented — or nearly unprecedented — buzz for an accessory previously considered primarily feminine. Global fashion search platform Lyst observed a 1,500% jump in searches for feather boas no less than two days after the British singer’s appearance at the music event. His highly personal style, essentially based on a concept that has taken centre stage in 2021, that of self-expression, also earned him a place at the top of The Year in Fashion ranking, also put together by the Lyst platform, a few months earlier. The ranking gave him the title of best-dressed celebrity of the year, a reward for the numerous search spikes generated by the outfits worn in his videos, or during his public outings. And this week, the singer has once again caused a sensation, this time on the cover of DAZED, where he appears posing in lilac-coloured flared pants and a cut-out top, in an exaggerated way, on a motorcycle. Inside the magazine, in the feature article dedicated to him, he also appears in a green sweater dress and polka dot tights, a semi-transparent jumpsuit, and oversize quilted coat. A photo shoot that confirms the star’s desire to push back against stereotypes and diktats that have been bending to the point of breaking for months under the weight of a generation that is freer than any one that came before. “It’s funny because I don’t think of myself that way (as a style icon)... but bringing people together is the thing I’m most proud of,"" Harry Styles told the fashion magazine. Cheers to that! Harry Styles doesn’t intend to slow down any time soon, on the contrary, as he moves seamlessly between the roles of influencer to musical artist and beauty line creator. The star this week presented Pleasing, his first line, which takes the form of a brand of clean, vegan cosmetics for everyone. From the colours chosen for the website to the campaign shots to the product themselves, everything has been thought out with inclusiveness top of mind. Nail polish, serum, eye gel and lip oil, the first cosmetics proposed by the brand, are aimed at consumers of all genders, the goal being for everyone to find... their pleasure. It marks one more step towards a desire to help make society more inclusive, one which brings people together more than it divides, and of which beauty and fashion are reflective symbols. Beyond the notion of gender, it’s about putting an end to a single representation of femininity or masculinity and offering all individuals the space they deserve to express themselves."
"Alibaba, JD enjoy record Singles Day despite tech crackdown","The firm said 540.3 billion yuan (US$84.5 billion) was spent as China’s army of consumers went on a splurge. Sales rose by 8.5%, compared to the previous year, despite a much lower-key sales campaign following pressure from the government to tone down the aggressive promotions and rampant consumerism. Combined sales with industry rival JD.com came in at 889 billion yuan (US$139.4 billion) — equivalent to the GDP of many countries — which was also a record and up about a fifth from last year. Both Alibaba and JD.com reported strong sales of items such as electric appliances, electronics, pet supplies, and cosmetics and other personal-care goods. ""Single’s Day"" — so-called for the 11.11 date — began more than a decade ago and for years was a one-day, 24-hour event on November 11. But industry players expanded it recently into an extended promotion from November 1-11, with many retailers and platforms offering discounts and pre-sales even earlier. The shopping fest now dwarfs the US ""Black Friday"" spree and has become a barometer of consumer sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy. However, concerned that Alibaba was becoming too powerful and abusing its market dominance, the government has this year dramatically tightened regulation. In e-commerce, the government has taken specific aim at alleged abuse of user data and monopolistic business practices by platforms, such as banning merchants from selling their products on rival sites. But the steadily rising consumer sales are also likely to be quietly welcomed by the government, which is moving to create a more modern consumer-driven economy, lessening the traditional reliance on manufacturing, exports and government investment."
"E-commerce is the second largest channel for beauty in the UK, says GlobalData","“The COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for the changes in the personal care retail landscape in the UK. New circumstances have forced hesitant consumers to start shopping online for products they would previously purchase in a brick-and-mortar store. Even with restrictions being lifted, many of those shoppers have been converted by the frictionless omnichannel shopping experience,” explained Nina Nowak, Senior Researcher at GlobalData. According to GlobalData’s 2021 Q1 consumer survey, 80% of UK consumers stated that how well the product or service aligns with their time and money constraints either always, often, or somewhat influences their product choice. “The advanced digital tools and apps that allow personalized product choice based on a ‘selfie’ image provided by a consumer are efficiently replacing an in-store experience. The growing variety of delivery methods help accommodate busy consumers, saving them time and minimizing social contact,” continued Nowak. Indeed, when asked about the main advantages of purchasing items online compared to visiting a store, UK consumers listed convenience (64%), timesaving (48%), minimal social contact (43%), variety and choice available (36%), and lower prices (32%) as the main benefits. Although the adoption of e-retailers for beauty and grooming is set to slow, the data and analytics company forecasts it will retain positive growth - posting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.1% over 2021-2025 to reach a forecast value of £2.1bn in 2025 - owing to these perceived benefits. “E-commerce allows nearly unlimited personalization, which is an especially important element of effective personal care sales strategies. Modern e-commerce tools allow retailers to track the consumer journey from initial interactions on the website to the final purchase. This enables businesses to create customized ads, recommendations, and price promotions to further solidify the relationship with the consumer,” added Nowak. “Consumers’ shopping habits may have changed for good with traditional ways of purchasing becoming a thing of the past. Extended lockdowns and social distancing restrictions have triggered a permanent shift towards e-commerce across various categories, including beauty and grooming. This change should be an impulse for personal care brands to focus their strategy toward enhancing their online presence, with brand and retailer deals at the centre, as well as providing a tailored shopping experience for consumers,” she concluded."
The cult series of the ’90s are making a comeback... in cosmetics,"Ah the power of nostalgia! Cosmetics brands are turning to TV series from the 1990s and 2000s to attract the attention of millennials. That’s the finding of a new study from GlobalData, which is based on the recent launches of several industry players in the run-up to Halloween, a time of year when consumers often like to buy new makeup products. The data analytics platform tells us that younger consumers are the most likely to experiment with new skincare and makeup products, with millennials leading the way (76%) ahead of Zers and those in generation X. Millennials are likely the preferred target of cosmetic brands for these new fall launches. This is reinforced by the themes of the new collections, namely some of the most emblematic series of the 1990s and 2000s, thus accessing the nostalgia of an entire generation. Some examples include the ""Saved by the Bell"" collection from the brand Wet n Wild Beauty, ""Gilmore Girls"" makeup from Ulta Beauty, and a tribute to ""The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror,"" the chilling Halloween episodes of the animated series, by the brand Makeup Revolution. According to GlobalData, this marketing strategy is linked with ""retrophilia”, and it corresponds to the current expectations of consumers. It can also be seen in the fashion industry, the 1990s and 2000s have also made a remarkable comeback on the catwalks since the end of lockdowns, with bootcut jeans, visible underwear, platform shoes, and more testifying to the consumers’ enthusiasm for these two decades. The return of the 1990s supermodels — in particular Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss — on the catwalks of the four fashion capitals during the latest ready-to-wear shows is also noteworthy. ""In a society that highly values individuality, film and TV-themed makeup taps into that deeply rooted emotion: nostalgia. We feel connected to characters - especially ones that we grew up watching - and having an opportunity to in some way be connected to those shows can be enjoyable. The makeup market is pretty oversaturated, so using such pop culture-inspired themes could help a brand deliver a unique edge and help reach consumers that would not otherwise purchase,"" explains Nina Nowak, Senior Consumer Researcher at GlobalData. If cosmetic brands are currently tapping into the nostalgia chord, it’s probably because TV shows are more than ever considered powerful fashion and beauty influencers. This was already the case in the 2000s with series like ""Sex and the City"" and ""Gossip Girl,"" strongly inspired by the world of fashion, but the phenomenon has been growing in recent years. ""Emily in Paris,"" ""The Queen’s Gambit,"" and ""Bridgerton"" are among the television series that have helped to bring certain pieces back to the forefront. Not to mention the success of ""Squid Game"" which has even managed to boost the search for vintage tracksuits. ""We are witnessing a grand return of the ’90s and early 2000s styles in fashion. As fashion and beauty coexist, and influence each other, retrophilia in the makeup category is a natural consequence. The key resonating point of such themed lines is allowing consumers to project a certain image — which is in line with the self-branding trend,"" outlines Nina Nowak. It remains to be seen whether this trend will continue after Halloween, which is a good time to slip into the shoes of fictional characters who have left their mark not only in the form of a personal story but on a whole generation."
L’Oréal Paris is the world’s most searched beauty brand online,"L’Oréal Paris is the most searched cosmetics brand in the world, according to a study conducted by cosmetic surgery education site Tajmeeli [1], which curated a list of popular beauty brands and used Google Trends to determine search interest in 108 countries. The French cosmetics giant’s brand is preferred by people in nearly a quarter of the nations studied, showing clear interest in its products among beauty fans. The French brand is particularly popular in the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Ukraine, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, India, Thailand and Turkey. It’s also the most popular brand on three continents: Asia, Europe and South America. But, against all odds, L’Oréal Paris is not the favourite brand of the French, who, it seems, prefer luxury beauty brand Guerlain. The ranking shows that, with a few exceptions, people around the world prefer accessible brands, such as L’Oréal Paris. The French brand is followed in second place by American brand CoverGirl, leading in 10 countries around the world and on two continents — North America and Australia & Oceania. Maybelline, NYX Professional Makeup, and Avon follow, with products that are also sold at affordable prices. Ultra-influential on social networks, celebrity-founded brands are also making waves. Kim Kardashian’s KKW Beauty is the ranking’s number one brand in the US, while Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Cosmetics is number nine worldwide — on par with Dior — featuring as the most popular brand in four countries worldwide. But it’s Rihanna who dominates the world of celebrity beauty brands, with Fenty Beauty taking fifth place in the global ranking, notably thanks to popularity in certain African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria). According to the study, Hong Kong is the world capital of (prestige) beauty, with no less than six cosmetic brands all taking first place, including Chanel, Shiseido, Estée Lauder, Clarins and Bobbi Brown."
Spain: exports of cosmetics and fragrances return to pre-pandemic level,"The data collected by the Spanish Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (Stanpa), which gathers the main manufacturers and distributors of perfumes and cosmetics in the country, show a strong increase of the sector’s exports in all categories during the first half of 2021, with categories such as colour cosmetics and perfumes, which had been the most impacted by the crisis, recording very high growth rates, +49% and +40% respectively. In total, the sector’s exports passed the 2.25 billion euro threshold during the first six months of 2021, growing by 21% compared to 2020. From this basis, Stanpa projects Spain’s exports to reach 4.5 billion euros at the end of the year, a level equivalent to that before the pandemic. The trend is positive for all geographic areas, with particularly strong increases in some countries outside the European Union, including South Korea (+80%), the United States (+60%), Mexico and Russia (+54%), Chile (+58%) and Morocco (+14%). As far as the European Union, the main destination for Spanish exports, is concerned, all markets are on the rise including major destinations such as France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Germany. In the Middle East, exports to the United Arab Emirates, which ranks among the top ten markets for Spanish exports of perfumes and cosmetics, rose by +39% during the first half of 2021, driven by the strong growth of the perfumes category. Regarding China, after a significant growth during the previous year (+41%), exports from Spain remained stable during the first half of 2021, at 170 million euros."
K-Beauty: How did Korea make its mark in the world of cosmetics?,"With a double-digit growth of its cosmetic exports in 2020 compared to the previous year (+15% according to data from the Korean Customs Service and the Korean Cosmetics Association [1]), South Korea is now one of the world’s leading exporters of cosmetics. In absolute value, Korean exports amounted, according to the same sources, to US$6.12 billion in 2020, while imports dropped by 0.7% to US$1.07 billion. With a different basis of calculation, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety estimates the increase in exported beauty products at +16.1% in 2020 vs. 2019, or US$7.57 billion in value. These figures have enabled the Korean authorities to claim 3rd place among the world’s cosmetics exporting countries in 2020, after France and the United States, two countries which over the same period have seen their exports impaired by the Covid-19 pandemic. If Korean exports were able to maintain their dynamics in 2020, it is because they are still mostly intended for the Chinese market (50.3% of total exports), despite the country’s efforts to diversify its markets. However, the country has not been completely spared by the crisis, since according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the production of cosmetics decreased by 6.8% in 2020 to about US$13.4 billion. After China, the United States is the biggest importer of South Korean cosmetics. In Europe, ""France is the first importer of Korean cosmetics with 35%, followed by the UK (16%) and Germany (9%),"" explains Zoé Maillet, Marketing Specialist at KOTRA (Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency). The craze for K-Beauty actually took shape in the wake of what the Chinese media called, in the 1990s, the Hallyu, literally the ""Korean wave"": i.e., the growing popularity of the South Korean entertainment industry (mainly TV series and Korean Pop, but also movies and literature). Korean beauty first came to the fore through the worldwide success of some of its emblematic products, in particular, BB creams and cushion compacts, which were also adopted by European and US brands, eager to win over Asian consumers. At the same time, major Korean brands have capitalized on the success of these products to make a name for themselves, while skilfully relying on the development of travel retail to gain notoriety with the foreign public. But above all, Korean brands draw their strength from a particularly dynamic local market, where fierce competition calls for a capacity for innovation and a speed to market to which Western brands are not used. In this country, where skincare is a real concern for both women and men, large conglomerates such as AmorePacific or LG rub shoulders with ultra-dynamic indie brands such as Look at Me, When, Let Me Skin. Brands that have also built a reputation for naturalness, in line with consumer demand, particularly thanks to botanical ingredients such as green tea, ginseng or Centella Asiatica. On the industrial side, a rich network of suppliers and subcontractors first made its mark in serving Japanese brands, before becoming a world reference for its outstanding manufacturing methods and speed of production: significant assets in cosmetics where products and trends change rapidly. The Korean beauty routine is particularly attractive to Asian consumers because of its coherence. On the other hand, it is often considered too complicated in Europe and North America. ""It’s all about the layering method, which starts with a double skin cleansing with oil, then foam, an exfoliant, an essence, a serum, a mask, an eye cream, a face cream and then a sun cream,"" details Zoé Maillet. Will this very extensive beauty routine suffer from the desire of consumers to reduce their consumption and streamline their routines? Nothing is less certain! In Asia, consumers are much less concerned by the search for a minimalist routine and by the naked beauty trend. Moreover, the search for more natural products and healthy skin should be favourable to face cleansers, a strong asset of Korean brands. According to Zoé Maillet, ""the demand for cleansing products, such as facial oils, cleansing balms or cleansing foam, will soar in the coming years."" The recent success of Cyca, a plant-based ingredient found in many Korean skincare products, including those of Dr Jart+, demonstrates the ability of brands from the land of the morning calm to constantly innovate and gain global recognition, probably for many years to come!"
France: Selective beauty up 6% between January and August 2021,"After more than a year of lockdowns, restrictions on social interaction and massive teleworking, French people seem to be gradually returning to their pre-health crisis consumption habits, particularly when it comes to premium beauty products, according to The NPD Group’s latest report. Between January and the end of August 2021, the French high-end beauty market recorded a 6% increase, both in value and volume, compared to the same period in 2020. With total sales amounting to EUR 1.327 bn in value, this market is clearly showing positive signs of recovery. However, the market research institute points out that 2020 losses have not been compensated. Indeed, in the first eight months of 2021, sales of selective beauty products remain 20% below their 2019 level. In practice, sales of selective products are driven by perfumes with sales up 10% in value in the first eight months of the year. Compared to 2020, sales of gift sets, eaux de parfum, extracts and home fragrances achieved double-digit growth. To a lesser extent, sales of skincare products are also on the rise, with a 2% increase in value and 16% in unit sales in the first eight months of 2021. This is due in particular to a 5 euro drop in the average price of skincare products, with consumers preferring less expensive products. It is worth noting the good performance of body care in this category, which recorded double-digit growth between January and the end of August 2021, compared to 2020. It should also be noted that the recovery does not yet concern selective make-up, which remains on a downward trend (-2%) between January and the end of August 2021. Some segments are however emerging. This is the case for instance with eye make-up which, according to The NPD Group, recorded ""double-digit growth"" during the period. Tinted creams and concealers are also on the rise again, reflecting the renewed interest of French consumers. The return of people to the office was also accompanied by their return to bricks and mortar shops, with sales up 1% in value compared to the same time a year ago, despite a further period of confinement in the spring and the continuation of many restrictions. Nevertheless, consumer confidence has been restored since the reopening of shops last May. From 17 May to 29 August, sales increased by 13% in value compared to the same period in 2020, and by 2% compared to the same period in 2019. Yet, over the whole period, growth in value sales is mainly due to online sales, which grew by 34% in the first eight months of the year compared to 2020. Online sales now represent 19% of total sales of high-end beauty products in value, up from 8% in 2019, before the pandemic, and 15% in 2020. ""The year 2021 was marked by restrictions in shops and a third lockdown, which impacted the beauty market in perfumeries and department stores. Consumers demonstrated flexibility, especially when restrictions were lifted. While returning to the shops, they continued, however, to buy online,"" says Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group."
Sustainable cosmetic companies fly high as investors bet on sales growth,"Clean and natural beauty brands are attracting investors around the world as sales are forecast to register steady growth in the future. In North America, Jessica Alba’s The Honest Company, which was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in May, raised USD 413 million and is now valued at USD 1.8 billion. In April, Beautycounter, another Californian company, received investment from The Carlyle Group. The investment firm has taken a majority stake in the natural personal care company, valuing it at US $1 billion. Beautycounter is using the capital to build omnichannel sales, strengthen brand awareness, and new product development. The private equity firm Berkshire Partners has invested in Mielle Organics. The natural hair company has received over US $100 million to help it expand internationally and reinforce its community development programme. Launched in 2014, the brand has been expanding in mass market retailers such as Target, Walmart and CVS. For its part, Bain Capital has taken a majority stake in Hand in Hand, a mission-driven organisation that produces sustainable soap products whilst having a positive social impact. Let’s also note the acquisition of Costa Brazil and EcoFabulous Cosmetics by sustainable materials firm Amyris. Costa Brazil has a range of natural personal care products made using Brazilian ingredients, whilst EcoFabulous Cosmetics specialises in clean beauty products for Gen Z. In Europe, the largest investment went to Aroma-Zone. The French company sells natural essential oils, aromatherapy products, and DIY cosmetics via its online shopping platform and in its brick-and-mortar stores to over 2 million customers per year. Aroma-Zone has received EUR 410 million (USD 485 million) from the global investment firm Eurazeo to expand its retail footprint and boost international sales. The French natural refillable brand 900.care raised EUR 10 million (USD 12 million) in seed capital. Based on a subscription model, the company offers natural products in tablet or stick form. In the UK, Pai Skincare, a London-based organic skincare brand, obtained EUR 7.5 million (USD 8.9 million) from the private investment firm Famille C Venture. It plans to use the investment to expand R&D and manufacturing capabilities. The trend is the same in other regions. In India, the organic beauty brand Juicy Chemistry has got financing from Verlinvest. According to Ecovia Intelligence, large multinationals are expected to purchase more natural and clean beauty brands. In 2020, we saw the acquisition of Thayers Natural Remedies (L’Oréal), Drunk Elephant (Shiseido), Stop The Water While Using Me! (Beiersdorf), and Hello Products (Colgate-Palmolive). The consulting firm expects more mergers, acquisitions and investments in the coming months. “Seeing high consumer demand for natural and organic and clean beauty products during the pandemic, the financial community is ‘going clean’ when looking at investments,” said Ecovia Intelligence in a statement. This month, Ecovia Intelligence will discuss the evolution of sustainability issues in the cosmetics industry at the European edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, hosted online on 25-28th October. Michael Brenner, Executive Board Member of Weleda, will give the opening keynote. He will share the company’s green journey and give his perspective on future developments. The role of green materials, the environmental impact of packaging, how technologies disrupt sustainable supply chains, as well as the marketing and customer issues raised by the move to sustainable cosmetics, will be debated during the event."
J-Beauty: a minimalist approach to beauty that is growing in popularity,"The covid-19 pandemic and the quest for more natural skins may have accelerated the end of K-Beauty (short for Korean Beauty), a vision of beauty straight from that country, which, until recently had appeared unstoppable in winning over followers — and, perhaps even more significantly, has had a wide-ranging influence on the international cosmetics industry. But now the K-Beauty approach, based on layering, and in particular on a ten-step beauty routine, seems to be losing ground to a more minimalist and natural routine, which has been growing in visibility and popularity during the health crisis. And even if K-Beauty later came up with the idea of ""skip-care"" which, tried to gain acolytes by reducing the full routine to just a few multifunctional products, it is, in fact, J-Beauty (Japanese Beauty) which could correspond best to top concerns of consumers at the moment. And since ""we’re always our own best advocates,"" J-Beauty is first and foremost gaining in popularity in its homeland, the Land of the Rising Sun. The J-Beauty based cosmetics market is expected to grow from 521.9 billion yen in 2020 to 554.6 billion yen in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 1.2% over the period, GlobalData experts report. ""Japanese consumers are extremely health-conscious, which also reflects in their beauty purchases. Consumers are drawn towards products which have a positive impact on health and well-being,"" says Sukanyashri Kabali, consumer analyst at GlobalData. And it’s a trend that is also gaining ground in the West, especially in Europe and the United States, with a clear revival of interest in natural ingredients, especially those from Japan such as rice or rice water, which is as popular in cosmetics as it is on social networks, shell ginger or getto, or ashitaba, among others, which are in line with this desire to combine nutrition, health, and the beauty of the skin. All alongside a key — if not the predominant — philosphy underpinning J-Beauty: the idea of prevention. And this is evident through trends that are cropping up all over the world, including the boom of prebiotics in cosmetics. Men and women are no longer looking to systematically repair the damage suffered by the skin, but to prevent it through various actions and a routine that will help it defend itself against potential aggressions. While J-Beauty relies greatly on science, and more particularly on a combination of science and nature, as well as on technological advances, it is also about ancientl traditions. In this respect, we are seeing the arrival of rituals straight from Japan that focus on prevention, particularly in the fight against the signs of aging. This is the case of Kobido, a ""natural face-lift"" technique that relies on a set of very precise movements, and that is now offered by many experts and facialists, but also many institutes and spas. In other words, J-Beauty still has many days ahead of it!"
Men in China go under the knife to boost life chances,"Beauty standards in China can be exacting, from pressure over skin tone, eye and nose shape to the controversial ""little fresh meat"" look — a buzzword used to describe handsome young men with delicate features."" The 27-year-old researcher wanted medical procedures to transform his look from ""engineering geek"" to something he thinks will boost his life chances. “I feel I should be ’fresh meat’ at my age, but I already look like a middle-aged uncle,"" explained Xia. AFP met Xia in Beijing as he was preparing for surgery to plump out his features. He had already spent 40,000 yuan ($6192) on a face-filler procedure earlier this year. “I grew up in the countryside — my face was dark, my skin was bad, I thought my appearance was not good in general,"" he said, adding that he had long planned to rework his face. ""I always felt a sense of inferiority,"" he added. The intense popularity of Chinese social media — rife with trends in cosmetic procedures, beauty ""tutorials"" and advice on how to become ""beautiful"", has added to the pressure for many. Growing numbers of educated men in China are opting for aesthetic and surgical procedures to give them the edge. According to iResearch, around 17 percent of male white collar workers in China have had cosmetic treatments (compared to 30% of women) and the vast majority of men had their first procedure before the age of 30. Xia Zhengyi, the doctor carrying out Xia’s procedure, says he has seen an increase in young men coming to him for procedures. ""Surgery can change the facial expression and give people a feeling of intimacy, which is good for your relationships with people,"" he said. Rose Han, from the BeauCare Clinics investment group, said male civil servants opt for procedures because they worry looking tired or old may mean missing out on promotions. Men in their twenties were most keen on eye and nose reconstruction surgery, according to surgery app So Young, which cited a survey of their 8.9 million active monthly users. ""It’s not like buying a Gucci handbag — it is giving yourself an opportunity. Confidence will bring changes to my work and life,"" said Xia. China’s average national disposable income has more than doubled since 2010 according to government data, and increased wealth among China’s middle classes has also fuelled interest. Zhang Xiaoma left his job at an IT company to become a full-time social media influencer after sharing his own experience of cosmetic surgery. ""You can do more on-camera jobs if you become more attractive,"" Zhang said. His procedures include ""elf ears"" — a procedure that fills ears with hyaluronic acid to make them look more prominent while the face appears smaller. This became popular after a social media star documented the procedure and it went viral. Model Nai Wen has had more than 60 procedures on his face, including laser treatments, and believes cosmetic surgery changed his fate. ""It is as convenient as a face mask — it’s really amazing that you can increase your age but not grow old,"" he told AFP during a shoot. China’s cosmetic surgery industry is now worth 197 billion yuan (USD 30 billion or EUR 26 billion) — up from 64.8 billion yuan in 2015, according to iResearch. But the rapid growth in demand comes at a time when authorities are concerned the nation is facing ""masculinity crisis"". Beijing has criticised the ""little fresh meat"" look, and has proposed an increase in physical education classes for boys to encourage a more ""traditional"" form of masculinity in society. Earlier this month, the broadcast regular ordered TV channels to resist showing ""abnormal aesthetics"" such as ""sissy"" men on screen. There are also safety and quality concerns — the National Consumer Association logged more than 7,200 complaints relating to the cosmetic industry. Xiaoran, a 33-year-old online influencer, died of a serious infection after undergoing liposuction, state media reported in July. The clinic where she had her surgery has since been closed, reported the state-run Global Times. And pictures shared by actor Gao Liu this year went viral on Chinese media, showing dead, blackened flesh on her nose after surgery went wrong. Critics believe there needs to be better regulation. Model Nai admits there is a risk that cosmetic surgery becomes ""addictive."" “You can’t accept an ugly self,"" he added. After his hour-long surgery in Beijing, Xia examines his face in a hand-held mirror, turning from side to side. ""It feels a little bit different, but it isn’t quite as I expected,"" he admitted. ""I think achieving the perfect look may take some time."""
Embracing the Afro in revolt against Venezuela’s ’bad hair’ stereotype,"After a near two-decade struggle with chemical straighteners, she embraced her naturally curly hair and a bold, shoulder-length Afro style and says she feels ""divine."" From the age of 12, when her mother started relaxing her hair, ""I felt obliged to present myself in a certain way, because straight hair gives you status,"" Mejias, now 28, explained at a salon in central Caracas where she was treating herself to a moisturizing treatment. Mejias said she long felt ashamed of her pelo malo (bad hair), as natural Black hair is called in Venezuela - a symptom, some say, of deep-seated racism. Then, she had a change of heart. ""I was tired of salons (for straightening treatments), of not having the freedom to let my hair get wet (as it would frizz). It felt like a form of slavery,"" she told AFP. Changing to an Afro style was ""like meeting me again. It was the best decision I could have made."" Venezuela has a racially diverse population as a result of mixing between indigenous peoples, Spanish conquistadores who arrived in the 15th century and the African slaves they brought from other colonies or directly from Africa. The country also received an influx of Europeans escaping the ravages of WWII and people from other Latin American countries fleeing dictatorships and armed conflict over the decades. Today, more than half the population identifies as mixed-race or mestizo. Yet, it is widely accepted that the darker your skin, the likelier you are to be poor in Venezuela, and to suffer from prejudice. Despite a 2011 law against racial discrimination, the country has a complicated relationship with its cultural identity. Racism is sometimes overt, often subliminal. In Venezuela, ""everything that comes from being Black we think of as bad or... as exotic, that is, not the norm,"" sociologist Zulima Paredes, who has written about the aesthetics of Afro hair, told AFP. The country that has enjoyed outsized success in the world of beauty pageants, has won the Miss Universe title seven times. All its winning contestants were fair-skinned and had straight or straightened hair, reflecting the nation’s continued pursuit of a ""western European"" standard of beauty. In 2018, when dark-haired, olive-skinned model Isabella Rodriguez was crowned Miss Venezuela — her tresses also artificially straightened — she was ridiculed online for her modest background and her mixed-race roots. Hair discrimination also has more practical, day-to-day implications. Paredes, who is also of mixed race, said she suffered workplace discrimination over her hair. Once, applying for a job while sporting an afro, ""they told me: ’look, no, with this hair you will not get in here’."" And the victimization starts young. ""You cannot enter school with an Afro hairstyle, you have to tie it up... or straighten it,"" under many prevailing dress codes, said hairdresser Gabriela Delgado. Under such indoctrination, she herself used long, straight hair extensions until four years ago, when she decided to switch to dreadlocks. ""There are people who start relaxing their hair as young as six, five,"" said Delgado’s colleague Ludizay Gardona, 35. The pair work at Afro Caracas, a salon specializing in black hair styles. ""People have not yet shaken off the stereotype that Black people were slaves and not much else. These prejudices are what we are trying to change... We have to become strong,"" said Delgado. ""This hair has not hurt anyone, it cannot be bad."" The issue was tackled in the 2013 Venezuelan film Pelo Malo about a young boy’s obsession with straightening his hair, which won the best film award at the San Sebastian Film Festival. Venezuela is not the only country to have struggled with the issue. In 2019, South African Zozibini Tunzi, became the first Black woman with a short, natural haircut to be crowned Miss Universe. ""I want to re-assure people that this hair is as beautiful as any other hair,"" she said at the time. In July 2019, California became the first US state to ban discrimination based on a person’s natural hair, in a law that stated that hair was a frequent reason for racial discrimination, particularly for Black people."
Online shopping to account for nearly 30% of global beauty sales by 2026,"Health and beauty ecommerce will grow more than three times faster than store-based retail over the next five years as the COVID-19 crisis, lengthy lockdowns and shuttered high street shops and shopping centres reset shopping habits, according to a new report from Edge by Ascential’s research and data insight arm, Edge Retail Insight [1]. Altogether, the health, beauty and personal care retail category will add US $305 billion in global sales between 2021 and 2026 to US $1.34 trillion, the report’s authors forecast. Reflecting a wider shift to online shopping - a trend accelerated by the pandemic - just over 50% of that growth will come from ecommerce. According to Edge Retail Insight online category sales will have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.1% between 2021 and 2026, far exceeding the growth rate of 3.3% CAGR for store-based sales. The shift to online in this category is embodied in the Edge Retail Insight figures showing Walmart’s store network adding just 3% CAGR growth between 2021 and 2025, compared  to 13.6% CAGR growth in Walmart’s dot com sales over the same time period. As a consequence, online shopping will account for nearly 30% (26.8%) of the global category sales by 2026, up from a fifth in 2021. “Items that were once bought in-store are not only becoming available online, but in an increasingly mobile-first age, brands have been rapidly experimenting with innovative digital technologies to engage customers remotely, such as using augmented reality to allow customers to try on lipstick virtually and getting involved with seasonal events and shoppable livestreaming opportunities increasingly offered by digital marketplace giants like Alibaba, Amazon, JD.com as well as China’s fast-growing group-buying platform Pinduoduo (PDD), which - with an expected 17% CAGR between 2021 and 2026 - will lead growth in the category over the next five years,” said Deren Baker, CEO at Edge by Ascential. The continued inexorable rise of marketplace ecosystems means brands operating in the health and beauty space must focus on understanding how to optimise their growth levers in this channel. “To compete in a new world of retail, brands must leverage marketplace-specific shopper engagement strategies as well as make sure they have strong fulfilment and flexible supply chain strategies to cater for short lead times and meet unexpected surges in customer demand,” added Baker. While Amazon and Alibaba are forecast to grow rapidly between 2021 and 2026, with 14.2% CAGR and 12.4% CAGR respectively, the highest growth rates are forecast in Asia. According to Edge by Ascential, China’s six-year-old mobile app Pinduoduo, which reported at the end of last year that it had 788.4 million users in 2020, ahead of Alibaba’s 779 million, will grow at a CAGR of 17.1% to 2026, while South East Asia’s Shopee is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.8%. Both Pinduoduo and Shopee operate innovative models focused on social engagement and mobile experiences. Shopee is also expanding its cross-border operations in Latin America, while Pinduoduo continues to push its highly successful group purchasing approach to drive further engagement with its users. “The lucrative opportunity of ecommerce in health and beauty has not been lost on some of the dominant forces in the category today. In July, the LVMH-owned French beauty chain Sephora, which has one of the largest beauty store networks in the world, entered the UK market with the purchase of ecommerce firm Feelunique, while in April, US investment firm Carlyle bought Beautycounter, a mostly digital ‘clean’ cosmetics and skincare brand, in a deal worth US $1 billion,” said Florence Wright, Senior Analyst at Edge by Ascential and report author. To address the shifting shopping habits of consumers, brands within the health, beauty and personal care sector more than ever need to take an omnichannel approach and use all digital touchpoints to maximise engagement and increase sales."
How ’genuinfluencers’ are taking authenticity to social networks?,"Too perfect, too smooth, too unreal: the influencers who embrace unrealistic aesthetics are no longer popular. Now in order to win over followers, it’s all about being authentic, even if that means being imperfect and vulnerable. In short, you have to be a ’genuinfluencers.’ This term was coined by trend forecasting company WGSN by mixing ’genuine’ and ’influencer.’ It refers to the social network stars who use their platforms to go beyond product placement. ""The genuinfluencer does not specialise in fashion, beauty or lifestyle content,"" WGSN’s Cassandra Napoli explains to the Guardian. Instead, these content creators ""spread important information that can keep people informed."" This includes health recommendations, but also how to use the platform’s latest features. According to Hilary Williams Dunlap, senior vice president of talent at Digital Brand Architects, a digital marketing agency, interviewed by Vogue, ""the landscape has completely changed in regard to who is considered a person of influence and how we define that term."" A new generation of influencers is gaining traction by being engaging rather than perfect. And today, being too ’aspirational’ — meaning retouched — is flat out considered off-putting by many members of Generation Z. Transparency is also required. Influencers can easily find themselves under fire if they use the wrong term, or exhibit behavior that is at odds with the highly informed Generation Z. Essentially, an authenticity that reflects one’s followers."
Trends: Are men really going to adopt make-up habits?,"Like fashion, beauty is gradually shaking off some of its most deep-rooted stereotypes to move towards less gender differentiation. Today, makeup would no longer (just) a matter of gender or sexuality, but a form of self-expression used by men and women. Just take a look at social networks — Instagram and TikTok, in particular — and you’ll soon see a multitude of videos and pictures of men wearing makeup. It’s a phenomenon being driven by several personalities and influencers, who are contributing to bringing male makeup into the mainstream. Of course, men haven’t waited until 2021 to start wearing makeup. In fact, it’s a practice that dates back to antiquity, and one which has endured over the centuries. From David Bowie to Johnny Depp to Prince, many celebrities have tried to pioneer the practice, paving the way for others to follow, but without ever succeeding in bringing what’s considered an exclusively female domain into the male mainstream. So why now? Probably because the time is favourable to change, driven largely by the will of an entire generation — Generation Z — to shun labels, pigeonholes and to refuse to conform to stereotypes. The fashion industry has quickly caught on, sending out a slew of new gender-neutral collections. Now it’s the cosmetics industry’s turn to meet the demands of a generation with an increasing influence — and buying power. It’s not surprising to learn that men’s cosmetics are booming in Japan, among the younger generation. While the phenomenon may not be taking off at lightning speed, it is making steady progress all around the world. Harry Styles — who famously posed for Vogue magazine wearing a dress, and matched his suit with a boa at the Grammy Awards — has largely contributed to shaking up certain preconceptions in fashion and beauty. He is also one of several men who use eyeshadow and mascara as and when they want, like Jared Leto and many K-pop artists — who are ultra-influential globally. All such individuals are also contributing to challenging certain beauty standards. The result is visible on social media, with no less than 230 million views for the #boysinmakeup hashtag, and over 550 million views for #mensgrooming, on TikTok. Much more than a trend, male makeup is, in fact, a practice that is progressively entering the mainstream, buoyed by unexpected events such as... the pandemic. As more and more women ditched makeup during the pandemic, favouring a more natural and authentic routine, men, on the other hand, sometimes started to dabble with makeup as their days filled up with Zoom meetings. That’s the reason why former baseball star Alex Rodriguez launched a makeup line for men, currently consisting of a concealer for dark circles and wrinkles. ""I realized as I was jumping from meeting to meeting, I needed something quick and easy in my routine to conceal blemishes or razor bumps,"" the sportsman said on Instagram at the time of the collection’s release. So-called Zoom fatigue could well explain, in part, men’s sudden infatuation with makeup. And the trend is confirmed in numbers. Last year, the web data analysis company Moz reported an almost 80% increase in internet searches for ""male makeup looks"" during the lockdown month of April, compared to the same period in 2019, as well as an increase in searches for tips on hiding dark circles or blemishes. For its part, The Guardian recently reported 300% growth in the men’s skincare market in the last six months of 2020, relaying data from one UK retailer. However, these figures tend to show that men’s cosmetics — and makeup — still have a long way to go. From the most upmarket to the most affordable, many beauty brands now offer makeup for men, like Gucci Beauty, MMUK, and, of course, Chanel, Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs — some of the pioneers in the field. And when products aren’t specifically aimed at men, they are often aimed at all, like at Nars Cosmetics or M.A.C Cosmetics. This summer, in London, the War Paint For Men brand opened the world’s very first store dedicated to selling makeup for men. With such initiatives growing at a rapid pace, it seems that male makeup is well on its way to becoming more mainstream."
Sales of global men’s grooming products to double by 2031,"Thus, revenue from the sales of men’s grooming products across the world will nearly double by 2031 from the current value of US$ 55.5 Bn. Geographically speaking, North America is expected to be the most lucrative market for men’s grooming product companies, with an absolute dollar opportunity of around US$ 14.0 billion. In recent years, men’s grooming in the region has shifted from a conventional focus on shaving to a broader perspective of personal care. For example, consumers are adopting varied shaving habits as a result of a growing desire for a trimmed beard over a completely shaved appearance, which is driving sales of beard wax/beard fixers and beard trimmers across the region. South Asia is also set to be an important market for manufacturers, rising at an impressive 12.6% CAGR and capturing 9.4% share of the global market. In 2020, India accounted for 32.1% share in the South Asian market for men’s grooming products, and is expected to grow at a rapid rate. As far as East Asia is concerned, China will continue to be a key market. Sales of men’s grooming products grew 9.2% from 2016 to 2031 in the country. According to the report, grooming is closely tied to remaining clean and looking their best in the natural state for the average Chinese male. This shows that there is opportunity to get better in the Chinese market through knowledge and product endorsement. In terms of products, shave care currently accounts for a significant market share of around 42.3%. According to the Persistence Market Research report, products in the mid-price range, which are affordable to male consumers, currently hold the biggest market share globally and are expected to hold around 53.3% market share in 2031. Eventually, online retailing is expected to be the fastest-growing distribution channel, at a high CAGR of 8.4% over the period 2021-2031. Consumer preferences have shifted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other key factors driving the growth of online sales are the availability of a wider range choice of products and the discounts. Other key trends include the increasing demand for natural and organic products along with alcohol-free fragrances."
China prestige beauty e-commerce sales increased 47% in the first half of 2021,"“One of the key takeaways from the prestige beauty industry’s experience with COVID-19 lockdowns has been that manufacturers and retailers must have an up-to-date and actionable digital strategy,” said Stanley Kee, managing director, APAC, The NPD Group. “Not only are more people buying beauty products online, but new selling formats such as livestreaming or short-form videos are continuing to rise in popularity, providing endless marketing opportunities for beauty brands.” According to the market research firm, hair and skincare e-commerce sales saw the largest increases, at 84%, and 50%, respectively. Fragrances and makeup followed with respective increases of 48% and 34%. [1] Skincare sales continued to dominate China’s prestige beauty e-commerce market in the first half of this year, but it did show a slight decline in terms of value share when compared to the second half of 2020, dropping to 68.5% from 70%. Apart from the sales increases seen in the two highest revenue-generating segments within the Skincare category, Sets & Kits, and Face (60% and 51%, respectively), there was a noteworthy increase of 107% in sales of sun care products. Demand for makeup increased as mask mandates were loosened throughout the country earlier this year. Generating over $528 million in e-commerce sales, Total Face Makeup was the segment that generated the most revenue in the makeup category. “These strong sales signal that more consumers were prepared to spend time outside of the home, unlike last year when the pandemic had gripped the country,” said Kee. “Thanks to the easing of mask mandates in some offices and outdoor settings throughout China in the first half of the year, virtually all prestige beauty segments experienced strong growth.”"
Men’s cosmetics booming among Gen-Z Japanese,"Are the days when cosmetics were only for women coming to an end? Moisturizers, anti-wrinkle products, serums, even make-up: men nowadays have a wide range of choices to offer themselves moments of pampering. This can be observed in many countries around the world, especially in China and the United States, where the market for men’s cosmetics has been growing steadily over the last few years, but also - and especially - in Japan, where the Gen Z male can’t seem to do without cosmetics anymore. The craze is such that Gen Z men - born in the mid-1990s - spend almost 20% more per month on cosmetics than the whole Japanese population, Nikkei Asia reports. The economic daily even states that the best-selling products among this group are estimated to cost more than 2,000 yen (about 15 euros), an amount that is higher than that spent by women. More broadly, while the cosmetics market  declined in Japan in 2020 due to the pandemic, the men’s cosmetics segment has recorded a 4% increase, according to data presented by the firm Intage. The pandemic, and in particular the multiplication of videoconferences, could be at the origin of this craze for men’s cosmetics. However, the phenomenon began long before the health crisis. In 2018, Chanel already launched ""Boy de Chanel,"" a line of makeup for men that now brings together a varnish, an eyebrow pen, a lip balm, a concealer, or even a tinted fluid makeup, all the make-up essentials that could be found in a woman’s beauty kit. There are now many brands that offer cosmetics entirely targeted for men. One of the latest to have launched in the niche is none other than former baseball star Alex Rodriguez, who created his own line of makeup for men in collaboration with Hims & Hers. A key item? A stick intended to camouflage dark circles, wrinkles, and other imperfections. Nothing surprising in 2021, but the product would probably not have received the same welcome a few years ago. The boom in combination skincare also offers men the opportunity to discover a world they are not necessarily familiar with, and which they seem to be embracing with pleasure. The Ordinary, Absolution, Aesop, and Eyden all offer cosmetics that are suitable for both men and women. It’s a trend that is unlikely about to fade away."
Self-esteem: Older women feel more confident about their bodies,"One might think that youth is synonymous with self-confidence, but that’s not the case, as a new study conducted by Australian and New Zealand researchers* Body Image, Volume 39, December 2021, Pages 114-124] reveals. Scientists from the universities of Griffith, Auckland, and Queensland were interested in the level of satisfaction with body image among 15,264 participants aged 18 to 94 years, of which nearly 63% were women. To conduct their research, they looked at longitudinal data covering no less than six years, from 2010 to 2015. Published in the Body Image journal, the study revealed that participants became more satisfied with their bodies over the years, although this upward trajectory did not appear to be meteoric. Self-esteem was not very present in the youngest women, but it increased with age, particularly around the age of 60. The research stops short of fully explaining this phenomenon, although the researchers do offer a few suggestions as to why it might be the case. In their work, the researchers mention the fact that as adults age, they may give more importance to how the body functions than to how the body appears. In other words, health would then come before physical appearance, which could lead to lower expectations on the appearance side. But of course societal pressure may also play a role in these results, since they could have an influence on the perception that we have of our body. Trying to conform to such ideals of beauty at all costs — or more precisely, of not being able to reach them — could play a role in self-confidence. Such pressure may dissipate over time in women, according to the researchers. It should be noted that this improvement in body image satisfaction over time is only slight; women aged 60 remain concerned — although a little less than younger women — about their appearance. Finally, the researchers were also interested in men’s self-perception; overall they showed higher levels of satisfaction with their body image than women, although these also get better throughout their lives."
"Eyeliner, fishnet and combat boots: Fall fashion gets a pop-punk attitude","When it comes to fashion trends, it’s key to keep up as they can evolve at breakneck speed. We were expecting a classic back-to-school season, with a wardrobe full of timeless clothes — especially since sustainability is now a must when buying new items — and pieces that combine elegance and comfort, but we find ourselves with a punk trend in the pipeline. And it’s a trend that offers possibilities for the entire wardrobe, from checks to boots through the fishnet, or just in a few touches of makeup. More precisely, it’s the pop-punk aesthetic that is set to make a comeback this fall, according to the global search platform Stylight. [1] Many of the pieces and inspirations associated with this trend have been getting more and more attention from users in the last few weeks, starting with the fishnet tights (+48% of clicks in July compared to the same period a month earlier) that were left untouched at the back of our wardrobes last fall. But for the pop-punk aesthetic to be perfectly executed, combat boots cannot be forgotten! And this season, they are showing up in a taller version that partially hides the knee (+25% of clicks). And of course, the global search platform has also noticed the beginning of a craze for plaid clothing, from pants to skirt through to dresses (+17% of clicks), and for studded belts (+14%). A trend that’s just simmer but which should increase as autumn approaches. It remains to be seen if pop-punk can also influence the world of beauty with a boom in related hairstyles and makeup looks. If so, we should see an autumn dominated by quiffs, shaved temples, even half-mohawks, studded accessories, and, perhaps the most essential, ultra pronounced, smudged eyeliner."
"Beauty has boosted the mood of Brazilian women during the pandemic, says Avon","An unprecedented survey carried out by Avon, in partnership with consulting firm Grimpa, has highlighted changes in the habits and self-esteem of Brazilian women since the start of the pandemic. Called #OlhadeNovo - named after the repositioning campaign the brand recently launched in Brazil - the study included 1,000 women aged 18 and more across Brazil. All of them were users of make-up products, perfumes and body and facial care products. Even though it was only applied once or twice a week on average, during the height of the pandemic, makeup had a transformative role for women. According to 80% of them, it improved their mood during this period. 78% of women surveyed said they used lipstick to feel good and not for attracting the attention of others, and 74% said makeup can also be used at home. In Brazil as everywhere, the use of facial masks to limit the spread of the Covid-19 disease has changed makeup routines: 33% of women surveyed gave more importance to their eyes and 21% switched from lipstick to balm lips. New habits linked to the pandemic have also boosted the use of face care products: 35% of women surveyed by Avon said they use them. Unlike other consumers around the world, Brazilian women have not given up on perfume during the pandemic; on the contrary if we are to believe the figures published by ABIHPEC! As far as the Avon study is concerned, 46% of surveyed women said that perfumes have the power to transport them to other places or remind them of the life’s happy moments. In short, they also have the capacity to boost their mood! It’s therefore no surprise that, when asked about the future and the beauty habits with which they will enjoy reconnecting when the pandemic is under control, Brazilians mention perfumes (65%), lipsticks (62%). and mascaras (58%)."

Global luxury market grows but gets more regional as Covid curtails travel,"Industry giants have reported results that show the world’s well-heeled are splurging on luxury goods as sales surpass even pre-pandemic levels. LVMH — home to Louis Vuitton, Moët, Fendi, Dior, Guerlain and Kenzo brands among others — saw first-half sales climb by 11 percent above their pre-pandemic level to 28.7 billion euros (34.1 billion) as it reported a profit of 5.3 billion euros, a whopping 64 percent increase from 2019. Rival Kering — which owns the Gucci and Balenciaga brands — bested its pre-pandemic level by 8.4 percent with a record 8 billion euros in sales. Hermes reported a 29-percent jump to 4.0 billion in sales. Both recorded profits of more than a billion euros, beating expectations. The Swiss luxury group Richemont — Cartier, Piaget, and Montblanc — beat its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter by 18 percent, while Italy’s Prada bested 2019 first-half sales by eight percent. It is the ""upper middle class, the rich and ultra-rich untouched by the crisis"" who could not travel or eat out and instead bought luxury goods, said Arnaud Cadart asset manager at Flornoy. The Chinese, ""who represent 35 to 40 percent"" of luxury customers, are still crucial, he added. But while Chinese buyers previously made a lot of their purchases while visiting Europe, they are now making them at home. In fact, ""what was surprising was not so much the recovery in China but the violent rebound in the United States,"" remarked Erwan Rambourg a sector analyst and author of Future Luxe: What’s Ahead for the Business of Luxury. Compared with previous crisis recoveries, after the September 11 terror attacks or the 2008 economic crisis for example, ""the feeling of guilt, the idea that it is inappropriate to buy luxury goods, disappeared,"" Rambourg told AFP.""There is a young generation in the United States that feels comfortable with luxury purchases,"" in particular among the African-American, Hispanic and Asian populations, he explained. Hermes chief executive Axel Dumas told a telephone news briefing: ""We’ve seen a very strong rebound in activity in the United States from our loyal clients as well as a new clientele that came to us thanks to digital"" marketing by the company. Hermes’s sales in the US jumped by a quarter from their pre-pandemic level. Citigroup analyst Thomas Chauvet noted the fact that a roaring US stock market had made many Americans more wealthy, on paper at least. The US government measures to support the economy, including financial aid, have also provided an important psychological boost to consumption. In Europe, the sector’s performance was better than might be expected given the absence of tourists who normally generate half of sales, because local clients turned out. ""Europeans had to a considerable extent deserted this market"" but this year the trend was reversed, said Flornoy’s Cadart. Rambourg added: ""To everyone’s surprise, the brands discovered that by stimulating the local clientele"" via social networks ""the French, Italians, Spanish turned out more than hoped"". Chauvet cautioned that ""the rebound in local demand doesn’t compensate for the loss of tourists.” ""The luxury market will nonetheless remain dominated by local buyers for at least another year,"" Rambourg concludes."

Eye area is number one beauty concern in the age of video calling,"With the pandemic spreading over the world, video calling has become the new normal since public health precautions necessitated time spent apart from family, friends and colleagues. Skincare brand StriVectin has commissioned new research to explore how beauty perceptions and habits have changed after a year of unprecedented disruption. The survey of 2,000 US adults [1] explored the impact living in a largely virtual world has had on how consumer perceive themselves. As experts say that our phone and computer video cameras can intensify shadows around the eyes and nose, highlight blemishes and wrinkles and even make the face look fuller, it is no surprise that 69% of the persons surveyed say the things that bother them on video calls are not the things that bother them when they look in the mirror. Eye concerns are one of the most common ""video face"" complaints, with 1 in 4 US consumers saying they notice under eye circles more on video calls. 30% say they have actually turned their camera off during a video call because their eyes looked tired on the screen, and 71% say they are making an effort to positively accentuate the eye area. All-in-all, 37% have stepped up their efforts with serums, eye creams and devices, while 34% have added products to conceal or diminish dark circles. 31% rely on added definition with color cosmetics and 44% have researched how to look better in video calls specifically, while 33% have even considered cosmetic procedures after constantly seeing themselves on video calls. 51% say their monthly skincare/ grooming/ self-care expenditure has increased since the start of the pandemic. And 52%, more than half, say the spending increase is a result of greater concern over their appearance due to frequent video calls. The revelation is not a total surprise to the R&D and marketing teams at StriVectin. The brand has seen a double-digit percent increase in sales of its eye care products over the last year. ""With eyes the main element of our appearance visible to the outside world this past year, it is natural that they have become our focal facial feature,"" said Alison Yeh, Chief Marketing Officer at StriVectin. Eventually, after a year of virtual meetings, 67% of the US consumers surveyed say they have finally figured out how to ensure they look best on video calls. Nearly half (46%) say their number one last-minute pre-Zoom beauty touch-up is... brushing their hair. And about a quarter (23%) say mascara is their pre-Zoom go-to beauty savior (the number two choice). When asked what they have added to their beauty routine, respondents’ number one response was ramping up their skincare regimen with greater focus on worry areas. The good news is that 56% say that after a year of video conferencing, they are now more comfortable seeing themselves on camera. Perhaps this is why more people say that even post-pandemic, they would prefer a virtual call to an in-person meeting
(47% to 44%)."
In-store shopping: Has the pandemic really changed consumer habits?,"While digital shopping had its heydays during lockdowns and is largely seen as the future of shopping, consumers nevertheless appear to be very happy to rediscover the experiences that are unique to brick-and-mortar retails: touching, trying on, social interactions. This doesn’t mean that they’re giving up shopping online, but that they now count on enjoying the best of both worlds. No less than 80% of consumers surveyed in the United States, France, the United Kingdom and China, say they ""feel comfortable"" visiting physical stores now, according to a report released by the Mood Media agency [1], a provider of multimedia solutions for improving the in-store experience. And while they’re still worried about catching covid-19 from visiting stores (48%) — Chinese consumers being the most concerned (50%) — a majority of consumers say that shopping in physical stores feels good (54%). Consumers in the US are most at ease with the idea of returning to stores (86%). Shoppers in the UK are more confident than in 2020 (just 62%), but still remain the least confident (76%). For now, consumer shopping habits have not yet returned to how they were before the pandemic, but there’s every indication things are changing, and in a positive sense. Nearly two-thirds of global shoppers say they still don’t visit stores as often as they did before covid, but nearly three in 10 (29%) say that they spend more per visit. Note that almost half the consumers polled (46%) say they spend ""more or less the same"" as before. However, six out of ten consumers around the world already say that they expect their shopping habits to return to normal by the end of 2021, and one in five even consider that this is already the case. Still, some seem more optimistic than others. American men are the most optimistic, believing that their purchasing habits will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year (74%). This is not the case in the UK, however, where 14% believe that their habits will never return to how they were before the pandemic. The ability to touch, feel and try products is what consumers around the world found they couldn’t replace and missed the most when stores were closed (45%). It’s also the top factor driving shoppers to physical stores rather than online (59%). The report notes that the social aspect of shopping, which can be enjoyed with friends, is another of the irreplaceable aspects consumers missed (35%), as well as being able to take purchases home right away (35%). Globally, shoppers especially regretted not being able to visit malls (38%) and fashion stores (36%) during the pandemic. The French (46%) and the British (30%) particularly missed fashion stores, while American consumers above all missed not being able to go to shopping malls (40%) and grocery stores (30%). However, consumers do intend to take advantage of the services made available to them when stores closed, therefore enjoying the best of both physical and digital shopping. Click and Collect was particularly popular (33%), as was curbside pickup (19%), not to mention the QR codes placed on products seen in store and then purchased online (17%), although opinions differ from country to country."
Could chatbots be the key to creating customer loyalty in e-commerce?,"While physical stores have reopened across much of the world, consumers seem to be increasingly looking towards a phygital experience, which would combine in-person and online shopping. This requires optimized services that allow them to enjoy a virtual shopping experience that is similar to that found in physical stores. And it’s not an easy thing to accomplish. Chatbots seem to be of particular importance to shoppers but they feel that their mere presence on an e-commerce site is not enough, they expect more extensive capabilities from these features. More than four out of ten (43%) UK shoppers say chatbots never — or rarely — understand them, and nearly three out of ten (28%) say they will leave a website and seek information elsewhere if the chatbot doesn’t provide answers, according to a study by Lucidworks [1]. Shoppers would also like chatbots to be used for more than just customer service. More than half of the British buyers surveyed would like to also use them to get advice from a brand or store employee, and 45% would like to get help finding specific products. Upstream of a purchase, therefore. When it comes to e-commerce, recommendations seem to be an essential element for the buyer. This is something that brands must take into account, if only to compensate for the absence of being able to touch or try on products. Recommendations can also help increase the average value of orders. More than three quarters of shoppers in the UK and US say they ""interact"" with product recommendations all or most of the time, and more than half of Brits surveyed say they regularly, if not always, buy recommended items they hadn’t planned to put in their cart. More generally, both British and American shoppers consider product quality, personalized recommendations and excellent customer service to be key to brand loyalty. According to this study, it’s in the interest of brands to optimize the online shopping experience because many consumers are not yet totally ready to return to physical stores. More than half of the respondents in the UK and the US plan to avoid shopping in physical stores ""as much as possible,"" or at least to go to stores less often than before the pandemic. However intentions vary depending on the sector. Clothing stores could suffer much less from these changes, for example, with more than half of British shoppers (59%) waiting for the restrictions to be lifted before shopping in stores. In contrast, only 26% of Britons surveyed plan to buy electronics in stores when health measures are eased."
"""Make-up and skincare are hybridizing,"" Sandra Maguarian, MakeUp in","Each year, BtoB events bring together thousands of visitors and exhibitors around the world. Unfortunately, since 2020 the shows are on hold, how are you handling it? Sandra Maguarian - The events sector has been on hold for over a year. Nevertheless, MakeUp in Shanghai was able to take place last July in the midst of the pandemic, with a growth of more than 20% for the number of visitors, what a paradox! This unprecedented situation revealed the creative potential of my entire team. In just two months, they were able to set up the interactive platform BeauteaMatch.com which allowed us to keep in touch with the community. In addition, we are incredibly lucky to be part of the Infopro-Digital group which, thanks to the diversity of its portfolio, has been able to support us and keep our jobs for the benefit of an entire industry. I remain convinced that physical shows are the best business providers for beauty suppliers. What is the program for the coming months for the MakeUp in network? Sandra Maguarian - The second semester concentrates all of our exhibitions usually spread over a year. MakeUp in Shanghai will be held on July 7 and 8, MakeUp in New York on September 22 and 23, Clean Beauty in London on October 12 and 13 and MakeUp in Paris on October 20 and 21. We’ll end the year with the amazing MakeUp in Los Angeles on December 9 and 10. It’s a lot of preparatory work but there will be new things in terms of animation with new business and conviviality areas, digital communication, etc. We never lose sight of the fact that our exhibitors are there to showcase their know-how and all our energy is focused on this. What do your shows mean to exhibitors and professional visitors? Sandra Maguarian - I have the feeling that in many ways the MakeUp in - and soon to be Clean Beauty - tradeshows are a creative refuge and an expert response in an exclusive area of makeup / care. We can find the same spirit as the 17th century salons where we met each other linked by the same centre of interest. At Makeup in, it is all the same. Exhibitors know that only brands from the beauty sector will visit them. It is a mutual benefit of commercial, sociological, cultural exchanges with museum exhibitions, conferences on colors, on consumer behavior or, creative workshops. Above all, this is the huge opportunity to do business. MakeUp in shows are an experience for the whole industry chain, with interactions between exhibitors as well. It is where brands discover beauty innovations. How did you manage to stay in touch with your visitors and exhibitors during the COVID crisis? Sandra Maguarian - By being worldwide with our local exhibitions, we have always had very privileged contacts with our exhibitors. Yet they come from a variety of industries ranging from ingredients to packaging and formulation, but they all form a family - the MakeUp in family - that we take great care of. The Covid crisis has hardly changed the frequency of our communications. We created the BeauteaMatch.com platform which offers suppliers and cosmetic brands to keep in touch, to continue to present new products, and focuses on innovation and information in the sector. Your ranks have grown to welcome new ""skincare"" exhibitors. What is it and what is the link with makeup? Sandra Maguarian - MakeUp in is a living brand that adapts to markets and needs. When it came to support the Brazilian market, we went to Brazil. For K-Beauty we went to Seoul. We support the emergence of indie brands in Los Angeles and so on. When again brand marketing managers asked us to expand our offering to ingredients, we did. Today we are witnessing a takeover of the hybridization of makeup and skincare. With ever more sophisticated claims such as a mascara that promotes eyelash regrowth, a moisturizing lipstick ... Hybridization is born from the BB cream. So yes, Makeup in salons are - and have been for several years now - targeting both skincare and makeup brands. You are soon launching a new show in London, ""Clean beauty"". What is this show for? Sandra Maguarian - Here again, our listening to the market shows all its power since for two years the ""clean beauty"" movement - responsible cosmetics, non-toxic for humans and nature - is booming. It was at this point that the need for an event was felt. The launch delay, due to the pandemic, allowed us to refine the concept and focus on the innovation in this area. Our exhibitors will be the suppliers of beauty brands in skincare, haircare, makeup, hygiene etc. who will meet the clean beauty brands of today and tomorrow. How do you see 2022? Sandra Maguarian - I am extremely positive for 2022. The need to free ourselves from our chains will be such that there will be a boom in cosmetic purchases. We will finally be able to meet and erase the traces of the distorting images of video conversations! Thanks to research and innovation, the cosmetics industry never gives up and anticipates consumer trends, needs and expectations in terms of diversity or performance. Therefore, I predict happy days for the cosmetics industry and its players while caring for everyone’s health, especially at our shows."
"Sales of perfumes continue to rise in Brazil, despite the pandemic","In a year when a large part of the Brazilian population has reduced their outdoor activities to carrying out their daily activities (working, studying and chatting with friends) from home, the perfume market could have - as elsewhere in the world - register a significant decline. But that’s not what happened! According to the Brazilian Association of Personal Hygiene, Perfume and Cosmetics Industry (ABIHPEC), the perfume market in Brazil grew 8.4% from January to December 2020, compared to the same period of the previous year. The devaluation of the Brazilian currency against the dollar and the euro, restrictions on travel and the increasing quality of perfumes offered by national brands help to explain this growth since opportunities for purchasing abroad have been reduced. “Brazilians are increasingly surprised by the offer of domestic perfume brands which, in addition to offering very high quality, have made constant investments in innovation in recent years,” said João Carlos Basilio, president of the ABIHPEC. ""The year 2020 has been a challenge for everyone,"" said Olindo Caverzan Júnior, Managing Director of Água de Cheiro. ""We have realigned some forecasts, adjusted our schedule but, despite the chaotic situation, we have been successful in maintaining our franchise network and opening new points of sale."" The company which, before the pandemic, had planned to open 80 units in 2020, finally opened about thirty new points of sale over the year. The company’s sales rose by 23% in 2020 compared to 2019. According to Olindo Caverzan Júnior, the search for well-being linked to the pandemic combined with the “deserve it” effect have driven sales in the category. “In addition, we have invested more in the advertising, especially in television, we have launched new products and special actions with major brands,” he emphasized. The year 2020 also allowed the emergence of new players in the Brazilian market. CR Beauty, for instance, launched in December 2020. ""I very much agree with the proverb that says ‘Smooth seas do not make skilful sailors’,” explained Cecilia Rascovschi, Creative Director of the brand. In the midst of the second wave of Covid-19, the young perfume brand invested in a digital strategy alongside a team of influencers. “We understood that we had to take advantage of this moment, when consuming was not a priority for people, to provide information on CR and its products, without trying to force sales,” she explained. CR Beauty offers genderless fragrances, that are classified according to their olfactory families. A fairly new approach in Brazil. Another novelty comes from the Boticário group. In addition to the launch of its luxury perfume brand O.U.i, the Brazilian giant has also made a new foray into this category with Vult. Initially specializing in make-up, the brand launched its first line of perfumes, created in collaboration with Brazilian influencer Gabriela Sales (aka Rica de Marré). ""We are betting on the strength of the co-creation movement and on a partnership with one of the main beauty influencers in Brazil to consolidate the brand’s entry into this category"", explains Diego Costa, perfume marketing director of Grupo Boticário. According to the marketing director, the three new fragrances are already showing very promising results. “We carefully monitor the behaviour of consumers and we know that their relationship with perfumery has changed during the pandemic. But, it is a category which generates high emotional bonds and whose consumption has not stopped, even at home.”"
"56% of Americans rarely or never use sunscreen, finds recent survey","Despite efforts to inform people about health risks linked to overexposure to the sun and the proven effectiveness of sunscreens to prevent skin damages, skin cancer is on the rise in the US. Over the past decade (2011 - 2021), the annual rate of newly-diagnosed melanoma cases increased by 44% and it is expected that 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70, said The Derm Review, a comprehensive online resource on skin care products and cosmetic ingredients. To get a better idea of why this might be, The Derm Review surveyed 1000 Americans to see how many people follow the doctors’ orders and wear sunscreen on a regular basis. Actually, the survey found that a whopping 56% of participants rarely or never use sunscreen. Indeed, 35% of respondents said they never use sunscreen, while 21% say they wear it once or twice a year or less. Only 19% wear it on a daily basis. According to The Derm Review, this low use might partly explain why skin cancer has increased 300% over the past two decades. “Skin cancer in Americans is five times higher than breast and prostate cancer, and ultraviolet radiation is responsible for 86% of melanoma cases,” explains the publication. Indeed, the link between UV exposure and skin cancer is well-documented; unprotected sun exposure is associated with 90% of non-melanoma skin cancers and 65% of melanoma skin cancers (one of the deadliest types of skin cancer). In addition, the survey revealed that women tend to wear sunscreen more regularly than men with 26% of women saying they wear it on a daily basis, compared to just 11% of men. Out of the respondents who say they never or rarely wear sunscreen, 62% were men and 50% were women. The same gap between men’s and women’s behaviour was recently found in France. Interestingly, these stats mirror the results for new-diagnosed skin cancer cases, which are higher for men than women. Men account for 6% of new melanoma cases compared to 5% for women. Geographically, people from the West wear sunscreen the least with 47% reporting they never use it. The South came in second place at 41% reporting they never use sunscreen. Ironically, these are typically the states who would spend the most time in the sun. About 38% of Northeasterners and 39% of Midwesterners report never using sunscreen. Of those surveyed, Alaska and Hawaii saw the largest number of sunscreen users. Considering people who reported never wearing sunscreen, wearing it less than once a year, or less than twice a year, States where sunscreen use is at the lowest are Rhode Island and Kansas, while Alaska and Hawaii are those with the highest rate of sunscreen users."
Trends: Natural is the new normal for younger US beauty shoppers,"Forget masking imperfections under layers of foundation, concealer, highlighter and the likes; these days it’s all about looking for ways to keep skin in radiant health long term. While contouring techniques counted millions of followers not so long ago — especially among the young — new desires have emerged and the pandemic seems to have accelerated the trend. These days, the watchwords of cosmetics are authentic, natural, essential, reflecting a wider desire to embrace minimalist routines. As a result, Gen Z, has got more in mind than (just) makeup. In fact, young people of approximately 13 to 26 years old see skincare as the Holy Grail of beauty routines. It’s now about nurturing and caring for skin, as the notion of health takes a growing place in the world of cosmetics. In fact, more than four in 10 Gen Zers (41%) polled put skincare as their top beauty category, according to [a study carried out by Klarna, the Sweden-based provider of online payment solutions->https://www.klarna.com/us/business/fresh-faces-full-carts-report/] [1]. After surveying 15,000 shoppers in February 2021, the poll also revealed that Gen Z spends more on skincare than the previous generation, Millennials, as well as Gen X and Baby Boomers. That should give brands some serious food for thought, given how much the phenomenon has been growing in recent months, forming part of wider clean beauty and skip-care trends, shifting the focus to minimalism and the overall health of skin. For younger generations, the biggest consideration when shopping for beauty products was “natural, non-toxic ingredients”. Gen Z and Millennials were also more inclined to buy cruelty-free and vegan products than their older counterparts. While shoppers across all generations agree that brand values factor into their purchasing decision, they have different appreciations of what matters most. The key brand value for younger shoppers is diversity and inclusion, while older generations are more concerned with sustainability and innovation. As a result, according to Klarna, Boomers value sustainability more than the Gen Z when shopping beauty brands. Still, according to the poll, Gen Z hasn’t totally turned its back on makeup. Products of particular interest to younger shoppers include bright makeup palettes, especially for eyes. And this may seem understandable, given that eyes are often the only visible part of the face when face masks are mandatory. But as the weather improves and the summer vacation season approaches, and with sanitary rules hopefully becoming less stringent, beauty looks could be set to take a bolder turn, ushering in bright colours and motifs of all kinds in a bid to shake off a long period of doom and gloom."
The Ordinary is the world’s most sought-after skincare brand,"In just a few years, The Ordinary — a brand that’s yet to celebrate its 10th anniversary — has managed to join ranks with the most popular skincare brands. Analysing search data for more than 70 major skincare brands worldwide, expert advice website Skincare Hero [1] reveals that The Ordinary tops the search list in 41 countries around the world, far ahead of major international brands like Dove (ranking first in 9 countries), Bioderma (ranking first in 6 countries), and CeraVe ranking first (in 5 countries). There’s no denying that The Ordinary, now part of The Estée Lauder Companies,  is a hit on social media, particularly on TikTok — a favorite among Generation Z users — and that the brand is backed by a crowd of influencers including Kim Kardashian, who alone has some 220 million Instagram followers. The brand also fits with several major trends of the moment, meeting new consumer expectations with simpler formulations, no controversial ingredients, minimalist packaging echoing pharmacy brands, and accessible prices. In fact, the brand’s products retail at US$3.50 to US$28.90, with a majority of products priced at under US$10. And price is a major factor for consumers who, from the look of their many TikTok comments, also appear to be satisfied with the effectiveness of these beauty essentials. The Skincare Hero study reveals that The Ordinary tops the skincare brand search list in the USA, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain and Australia. From the look of the ranking of most-searched brands, it seems that accessible skincare is especially popular with consumers. Dove comes in second place, topping the search lists in nine countries — including Bosnia, the Bahamas and Jamaica — while Bioderma comes third, topping the search list in six countries, including Hungary. Next come CeraVe, Estée Lauder, L’Oréal Paris, Vichy, Clinique and Neutrogena."
"“China will soon be the 2nd global perfume market,” Sylvain Eyraud, Takasago","Although it took the Chinese market quite long to embrace the perfume culture, today’s young generation keeps showing a partiality for this luxury product by imposing new expectations. The most legitimate L’Atelier Chine offered by Maison Takasago is aimed to share the knowledge needed about this market recognized as having a very strong potential for the future of perfumery. “As a hundred-year-old Japanese company and market leader in Asia, we endeavour to develop our expertise in all Asian markets, in particular the Chinese. What is the Chinese consumer like today? What are beauty drivers there? What are the olfactory preferences? What are the ingredients with the strongest potential? How can brands go beyond the olfactory clichés according to which China is fond of easy, little sophisticated floral fragrances in order to invent tomorrow’s signatures? It is the first time we have also shared our palette of local, ‘made in China’ ingredients, from the most beautiful natural scents to outstanding collections for a real olfactory journey. All this is essential to invent tomorrow’s greatest signatures and gain ground on the Chinese market,” explains Sylvain Eyraud. “By 2030, China will most probably have become the second global perfume market,” adds Sylvain Eyraud. This statement is based on an in-house study results that predict beautiful days for perfumes in this country. Asia – mainly Japan, Korea, and China – represented 13% of the global premium perfume market in 2020. In this region, China is the most promising country in this critical year, with a 15% growth. Furthermore, Takasago’s study also unveils prospective hypotheses about the evolution of this market from 2020 to 2024, and from 2024 to 2030: it reveals how China should get from the 6th to the 2nd rank on the global market. “On the one hand, there are quite stable mature markets, and on the other, a Chinese market with a remarkable growth potential due to the young generation being open to perfumes. The next five years will set the tone, but what we build today will serve as a basis for tomorrow’s successes,” explains Mathilde Girardon. In a country whose economy is one of the few that ended the year 2020 with a positive growth rate, and where the gross disposable income has doubled since 2010, the situation is highly favourable to the consumption of luxury products, in particular perfumes. Driven by the Millennials generation, this economy is opening to new national specificities brands need to adapt to: a huge craze for digital technologies with a very strong influence of KOLs, the search for new experiences, a will to reconcile men and their environment based on a relationship with ancestral Nature, but above all, the search for a new form of patriotism. “Everything you see in the Western world about the return to local consumption is also true in China. People have this sense of belonging (Chinese Pride) which can be observed in the way they consume, but also in their emotional or cultural references. Their relationship with nature is crucial, although there is still a difference in terms of sustainable maturity between this market and more mature markets, like the US and France,” says Sylvain Eyraud. This patriotic consumption is conveyed by a marked attraction to products Crafted in China, rather than Made in China, which are already present in the perfume segment with well-established brands, like Scent Library, Boitown, ReClassified, Herborist, and O D’Hora, but also by a recognition of olfactory ingredients derived from the country’s herbalist culture. Some ingredients have a particular echo in China, like green and black tea, Ganoderma, jasmine, gingko, ginger, ginseng, bamboo, arnica, and carnation. “China boasts countless treasures: flowers, spices, tea, fruit…,” promises the Takasago team. The group wanted to share 25 unique olfactory treasures with a strong emotional power. The Chrysanthemum Flower, the imperial symbol of longevity in China, Da Hong Pao, a real national treasure, Iris, Magnolia, the plum tree flower, which embodies inner beauty, the jackfruit fruit, Buddha’s hand, Sichuan pepper, star anise, Ganoderma and ginseng, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine, and lastly, the smell of black ink inspired from calligraphy. Each of these smells is associated with its local symbols. If fresh and fruity scents still account for the majority of sales, bolder fragrances, in particular niche perfumes, already follow this trend. “These consumers are ready to be taken by surprise. But to actually surprise them, brands need to understand them, and not just copy what is done in the Western world, so they can better invent the great signatures of tomorrow,” concludes Sylvain Eyraud."
Beauty brands that show diversity in advertising inspire American consumers,"New research from Mintel reveals that more than three-fifths (63%) of Americans say they are inspired by beauty brands that show diversity in advertising. The majority of people who would like to see diversity in beauty/grooming advertising say they feel this way because it “reflects real life” (68%) and “shows that there are different ways to be beautiful"" (56%). What’s more, almost half (47%) of beauty consumers say they have looked for/bought from brands with diversity or inclusivity in the last year and a quarter (24%) have shopped with beauty brands that are minority owned. Indicating further desire for change among beauty brands, almost three-quarters of adults agree the beauty industry plays on women’s insecurities (73%) and society’s idea of beauty is too rigidly defined (72%). This points to opportunities for beauty brands to evolve away from these negative perceptions by inspiring and empowering consumers. “Beauty marketing is increasingly shifting from ‘aspirational’ to ‘inspirational.’ Successful brands recognize that demonstrating a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion - whether through employment, advertising and/or product development - helps drive inspiration and empowerment,” said Clare Hennigan, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Analyst, at Mintel. “Brands have the opportunity to make a real impact by integrating different types of beauty diversity in a way, and at a place and time, that is truly authentic to them. For example, waiting until Pride Month in June to promote gender-neutral products could be perceived as a marketing stunt instead of a brand value. Brands that stand to win are the ones who have committed to diversity as an ongoing practice and genuinely listen to their audience to determine how those efforts are perceived.” However, understanding consumer perception of beauty inclusivity is complicated and nuanced, notes Mintel. Indeed, half (52%) of consumers who use beauty products say affordable products indicate that a brand is inclusive, while 48% say a wide range of shades makes a brand inclusive. Two-fifths (39%) feel that when brands represent diverse groups in advertising that makes them inclusive. But inclusivity indicators also vary by life stage. For example, 55% of Baby Boomers [1] say brands with products that meet a variety of age-related needs are inclusive, while only 32% of Gen Z [2] agree. And 40% of Gen Z think brands that offer gender neutral products are inclusive compared to only 25% of Baby Boomers. When consumers consider whether or not a beauty brand is inclusive, it is heavily dictated by whether the brand satisfies the consumer’s own needs - how accessible the brand is to them personally - underlining the importance of understanding core audience values and needs. “This approach has led to some brands developing hyper-personalized, inclusive products like the L’Oréal Perso, which is said to launch in 2021 and uses AI to create personalized skincare formulas. At the same time, other brands are exploring inclusivity through a minimalist or universal approach. Skincare brand Humanrace markets itself as ‘suitable for all humans.’ Whatever the approach, brands that are able to align their inclusivity efforts with the needs and expectations of their target audience will have greater commercial success,” concluded Hennigan."
Online shopping and homemade beauty come out winners of the pandemic in France,"While beauty stores reopened their doors on Wednesday, May 19 in France, it is clear that the pandemic has forced consumers - and therefore brands - to transform their habits. Beauty’s digital pure plays are undoubtedly the big winners of this particular period. Their sales jumped 43% between February 2020 and February 2021 in France, in the midst of a pandemic, according to the latest report from The NPD Group [1]. A year earlier, during the 12-month period leading up to February 2020, their sales had increased by 10% ""only"". These e-retailers have taken full advantage of the prolonged closure of brick-and-mortar stores and of the shift in shopping habits of consumers forced to go online to find some of their beauty routine essentials. This is reinforced by the fact that brands and retailers have invested heavily in new virtual reality and artificial intelligence technologies now allowing products to be tested at home. Beauty subscription services and beauty boxes were also quite successful during the period. Their sales increased 10% in the 12-month period leading up to the end of February 2021, compared to the same period the previous year, according to The NPD Group. The average individual basket amounted to 22.11 euros. Blissim has maintained its leadership position in France, while players like Nuoo and Big Moustache have grown rapidly. In addition, many emerging trends have experienced a strong expansion during the pandemic. Consumers have turned increasingly to natural, organic and more responsible products. The phenomenon was accentuated by the adoption of ""self-care"" and at home spa routines and by the desire to buy more healthy products. As a result, home-made cosmetics have had a huge following throughout this particular year. The NPD Group reports a 29% increase in sales of Aroma Zone, the French specialist in homemade cosmetics, during the 12-month period ended at the end of February 2021, with an average basket set at more than 35 euros. This is the second consecutive year of double-digit growth for Aroma Zone, which recorded a 28% increase in sales between February 2019 and February 2020, compared to the same period the previous year. Long periods of store closures have negatively impacted the beauty sector in France during the twelve months between February 2020 and February 2021. However, the success of digital players is an excellent signal, according to Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. “These digital companies are breathing new life into the industry and becoming prescribers across the entire sector,” she explained."
USA: What will post-pandemic beauty consumers look like?,"More screen time, fewer occasions to shop out of home, and a social life on hold for several months: the global pandemic has undoubtedly completely changed consumption habits, forcing brands to reinvent themselves in order to adapt to these new ways of life. For its part, the beauty industry must address not only a new beauty routine, but also new purchasing habits induced by the successive lockdowns. PowerReviews has surveyed 10,646 active beauty consumers across the United States. The study found that a majority of Americans (56%) are more focused on skincare now than they were before the pandemic. A situation that may be linked to the fact that people are spending more time at home and may have more time to devote to more thoroughly caring for their skin. Simultaneously, many consumers are cutting back on makeup use. In fact, the survey found that more than half (54%) of consumers indicate they wear less makeup now than pre-COVID, likely because they’re not leaving the house as much, but also because wearing a mask is compulsory in public places. As a result, natural beauty has emerged as a key trend, with people getting back to basics. A trend that should continue in the months to come, even if the pandemic ends. There’s been a well-reported uptick in e-commerce shopping since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a situation that is reshuffling the cards in a sector where, until then, most consumers had a preference for brick-and-mortar stores. The study confirmed things are changing as more than half of shoppers (53%) buy more beauty products online now, compared to pre-COVID. This number is even higher among younger consumers with 66% of Gen Z shoppers and 58% of Millennials (Gen Y) saying they’re spending more online on beauty products now than they did before the pandemic. In addition, Americans are also spending a lot more on the internet. Almost half of them (49%) said they spend more than US$ 50 per month, compared to just 16% in the previous study in 2019. Furthermore, while two years ago, 47% of online beauty buyers said they were typically starting their beauty shopping journey on Amazon, in the last survey they were nearly a half (44%) to say their starting point was a beauty retailer’s website (Ulta.com or Sephora.com). The PowerReviews study also confirmed that, while price, brand and quality still matter when choosing beauty products, beauty shoppers increasingly seek out products and brands that align with their values. More than three-quarters (76%) of shoppers said they plan to buy beauty products that are made sustainably. Gen Z shoppers (86%) and Millennials (80%) are even more likely to purchase sustainable beauty products. However, inclusiveness and racial justice are also emerging as priorities for American consumers. The study tells us that half (50%) of consumers plan to actively seek out beauty products made by Black-owned beauty brands. This number is even higher among Gen Z (75%) and Millennials (58%)."
Social media: new beauty influence trends for 2021,"Brands can no longer afford to map out their strategies without a key element: influence marketing, an essential in the beauty world. Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) have become creators of inspiring content and both free-spirited intermediates and brand ambassadors. More professional, they break the mould and provide innovation and freshness thanks to an expert, impacting profile. And as the share of online sales and the time spent on social media keep soaring, no doubt this trend will keep growing. Meanwhile, social media increasingly develop technological tools and systems for brands: augmented reality, buy buttons, live shopping… According to Kolsquare, if beauty has gained such importance on social media lately, it is because this industry banks a lot on visuals and experience. “Beauty digitalization paves the way for technological innovation: today, you can follow a tutorial or test a lipstick on your smartphone. Influence marketing completes these new technologies with a genuine authenticity made possible thanks to the trust relationship between KOLs, subscribers, and brands,” say the platform representatives. In practice, the format the most widely used by cosmetics brands is image, and by far: 85.9%. Then come videos (10.3%), Instagram stories (2%), and Instagram videos (IGVT), which represent 1%. A visual network par excellence, Instagram is by (very) far the number one medium for beauty and lifestyle. Statistics are quite clear: 90.4% of the 1,210,622 publications related to beauty analyzed in 2020 are on Instagram. With over one million beauty contents counted in 2020, Instagram offers a great variety of formats (feed, stories, lives, reels, IGTV). Lives actually boomed during the first lockdown with 800 million active users every day in April 2020. According to Kolsquare, this format helps brands and influencers increase their communities’ commitment with a place where they can interact live. The use of Reels has also made steady progress since summer 2020. These 15-second videos are much popular among brands, in particular when it comes to explaining how to use a product or launching a challenge. It should be said that 90% of Instagram users follow at least one brand, and 130 million click on a shopping post every month to learn more about a product. As regards the commitment rate, TikTok is actually the most efficient, with 4.9%, followed by Instagram (1.07%), YouTube (0.5%), Facebook (0.15%), and Twitter (0.03%). If it is still far from Instagram, audience-wise, TikTok is gaining ground, especially among the young generation. On TikTok, beauty is at the core of trends, along with other themes like video games, sports, fashion, family and education. According to the latest TikTok for Business report, in 2020, beauty videos grew by 90% in France, 41% in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, and up to 238% in Spain. “On TikTok, people talk about both beauty and blemishes. They celebrate inclusiveness, difference, and mutual help. This creative community is redefining beauty: they want it to be greener, more transparent, and representative of diversity. The most viewed videos are tutorials, tips and tricks, and product tests,” emphasize Kolsquare experts. As for YouTube, it is undeniably the network for beauty tutorials: it is more adapted to longer, detailed videos. According to Kolsquare, beauty will be green, inclusive, and committed in 2021 on social media. The influence marketing platform mentions several typical hashtags and influencer profiles for the year: #skincare - In 2020, a new group emerged among beauty KOLs: skinfluencers – skincare enthusiasts. This group is completed with pharmfluencers, who have a more scientific profile, so they can talk about product ingredients and skin types. #selfcare - The return to naturalness is on a roll, as minimalism is put on the spotlight, as well as the no-makeup and vegan trends. These trends actually grew in 2020, with minimalist, or even no makeup, and reduced rituals: a movement called skip-care. Green brands like Lush, Origins, and Typology boomed. #filter - Augmented reality and virtual reality are more and more widely used in the beauty sector. They make it possible for users to directly test makeup products or accessories. This testing system has thrived since the sanitary crisis began. Influencer remuneration according to the sales generated via a commission calculated with a tracking system (affiliate link, url tracker, promotional code, dedicated Amazon e-shop) is extremely popular in the beauty sector, because it is both efficient and simple. However, to be satisfactory for both advertisers and influencers, it should be based on mutual trust. This key lever requires a clear contract, Kolsquare experts explain. Still, for brands, the main challenge lies in identifying the most relevant influencers. To this aim, Kolsquare promotes their own solution based on the aggregation and analysis of data targeting influencers according to their audience, commitment rate, number of followers, themes they deal with, or even the brands they partner with. “Big Data and machine learning help target particular influencers, learn about their objectives, and also accurately measure a given campaign’s ROI,” highlight the platform experts. In conclusion, Kolsquare emphasizes the fact that KOLs’ creativity, which keeps being expressed through new formats, is an added value and a key advantage for brands. However, as authenticity is more than ever a guiding principle in influence marketing, contacting influencers at random, without taking the time to get to know them and target them, is no longer efficient. As consumers increasingly expect transparency and authenticity, it has become crucial for brands to interact with their ambassadors: they have a lot to gain by appropriately targeting their influencers and maintaining complicity with them."
"“Diversity is a statistical reality”, says The Colors founder Haweya Mohamed","How did the idea for The Colors platform come about? Haweya Mohamed - The idea for The Colors project was born out of an observation: the products and services offered by large corporations do not fully satisfy the aspirations of multicultural consumers. Today, in the world’s largest consumer market, the United States, 40% of people identify as Latino, Black or Asian, according to the official figures of the United States Census Bureau. These ""minority-majority"" groups are expected to make up more than 50% of the North American population by 2045, as is already the case in most major cities such as New York and San Francisco. Culturally, we don’t do this type of demographic count in Europe. However, whether you are in London, Paris, Berlin or Brussels, you can’t help but notice that the consumers in the major shopping areas are clearly multicultural. And what about the 1.2 billion Africans, who will soon be 2 billion, with a constantly growing purchasing power? The Colors is therefore first and foremost about the desire to address these consumer markets by accompanying brands that want to better understand and serve these consumers, but also by accelerating startups that are targeting these markets 100%. What is the aim of The Colors? Haweya Mohamed - Our intention is for The Colors is to become the platform of reference for decision-makers seeking expertise in how to address these markets. It also aims to contribute to advancing the subject of diversity and inclusion in the domaines of fashion and beauty, and to support entrepreneurs who address multicultural populations or who promote skills and expertise of the African continent. The platform brings together experts such as Desiree Reid, who launched Iman Cosmetics; Jackie Celestin, who for a long time was Chief of Diversity at L’Oréal; Noelly Michoux, who recently raised money for her startup 4.5.6 Skin, and many others. It also brings together consumers who are very demanding when it comes to diversity issues and who interact with the entrepreneurs. The mantra of The Colors is ""Diversity is a fact. Inclusion is a choice."" Do you think today’s fashion and beauty brands are inclusive? Haweya Mohamed - Diversity is not an aspiration or assertion, it is a statistical fact. As for inclusion, it is an economic choice that consists simply in wanting to sell to more people. In the future, given the numbers cited above, it will be a matter of ""being able to sell at all."" My feeling is that brands that don’t deal with the reality of consumer diversity will disappear, or at least their influence will be considerably reduced. So basically, it’s not a problem for anyone but themselves. The startups we work with are ""multicultural natives"" and moreover are 100% digital. The challenge for traditional brands faced with Digitally Native Vertical Brands, for example, is not to miss the opportunity for a multicultural transformation, just as they should not have missed the opportunity for a digital transformation — or else they will be disappointed. The most successful brands are inclusive: Nike, Ulta Beauty, H&M, Zalando, Mented Cosmetics, Estée Lauder... For the others, there is still work to be done, because for many marketing and communication decision-makers, embracing multiculturalism will mean leaving their cultural comfort zone. Why is it still difficult today to find hair products, creams, or makeup for all skin tones or all hair types? Haweya Mohamed - The problem starts at the laboratory level. Do they work on all skin types? Do the people in charge feel sufficiently concerned by the subject of diversity to create formulas adapted to skin types 4, 5 or 6? The answer lies in the number of laboratories dedicated to this type of formulation. Of course, there is also the question of distribution. With The Colors, the goal is to promote the creations and know-how of African entrepreneurs in the fashion and beauty sectors. What are the obstacles the most frequently face? Haweya Mohamed - The Colors wants to celebrate diversity through entrepreneurial successes without focusing too much on the known obstacles — lack of visibility, little or no access to retail, and of course little funding. With The Colors, we also want to promote the African agricultural sector. When we talk about natural products such as shea, coconut oil, ylang-ylang and argan, or textile fibers such as organic cotton, we’re just talking about agriculture. Promoting the fashion and beauty sectors also allows us to have more impact on employment and women’s agricultural entrepreneurship. How do you support them as they develop their brands? Haweya Mohamed - Our main means of action are our community of experts, the digital expertise of the Afrobytes community at the service of The Colors community, and our visibility. Then there’s matchmaking, which is in our DNA. The strength of Afrobytes is its ability to bring together communities on three continents: Europe where we are based, the United States where our main tech partners are, and finally Africa where we have been supporting entrepreneurs for years. New brands could change the game, but shouldn’t the giants in these sectors do something too? Haweya Mohamed - Large companies often focus on the acquisition of growing brands, but they should, I think, ask themselves: do I have people in-house who can help me understand what’s going on and develop products that meet specific needs? A recent study done in the US revealed that multicultural consumers drove the growth of beauty products in 2020. It is important to note that multicultural consumers are increasingly paying attention to who makes and sells the brands and products they buy. It’s up to brands and retailers to meet the needs of these consumers. Can the arrival of Gen Z in this market help make the fashion and beauty industries more inclusive? Haweya Mohamed - Gen Z is an inherently multicultural segment of the global population. Many brands have yet to figure out how to effectively address Millennials, let alone Gen Z, which presents an even bigger marketing hurdle. But understanding Gen Z is about understanding multicultural consumers! In an ideal scenario, how will these two industries evolve over the next 10 years? Haweya Mohamed - There’s a study I often quote, which was done by Nielsen analysts in the US, which says the following to the big brands: “if you don’t have a multicultural strategy for your brand, chances are you won’t have a brand in the next 10 years. Multicultural consumers are the fastest growing consumer segment in the US, so it’s important to make a cultural connection with them.”"
The pandemic has made wellness more of a preoccupation for consumers,"In a recent study, American management consultancy McKinsey & Company surveyed 7,500 consumers in six countries around the world (Germany, Brazil, China, the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom) to investigate the growing importance of the quest for wellness in our societies. The study focused on six major categories associated with this theme: health, fitness, nutrition, appearance (fashion/beauty), sleep and mindfulness. A major finding was that 79% of those surveyed considered wellness to be important, while 42% said it was a top priority. The study further noted that the priortization of wellness has grown steadily over the last two or three years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the aspect of wellness that attracts the most interest is health, an area in which consumers are increasingly eager to take control, particularly with data-driven care, apps to manage appointments and smart health devices. In line with this logic, consumers are also concerned about fitness. Particularly with regard to the ongoing health crisis, they have been finding it difficult to maintain their pre-covid levels of physical activity given that gyms have been closed and remote working has become the norm. However, this context has also created a boom in apps and equipment for exercising at home. In all of the countries surveyed, a majority of respondents affirmed that they would like to give more priority to mindfulness. For the authors of the study, this trend is also linked to the pandemic, which has contributed to a global increase in levels of stress and mental distress. Probably for the same reasons, respondents also revealed a growing interest in technologies (apps and trackers) and accessories (blackout curtains, gravity blankets etc.) that aim to improve sleep quality. Last but not least, nutrition also figures large in the wellness trend, with consumers eager for food that not only tastes good but also contributes to health goals. In the realm of services linked to appearance, nonsurgical aesthetic procedures are enjoying rapid growth, notably micro-needling, lasers and oxygen jets. As for clothing, the study confirmed a trend, which has been prevalent since the onset of the pandemic: athleisure. Pioneered in the United States, athleisure focuses on practical and functional garments for comfort and ease of movement. It is also a manner of dressing that strongly correlates with kicking back and relaxing, especially when teleworking. The priority attributed to each of these different aspects of wellness varies from country to country. For example, Japanese respondents were most interested in appearance, while Germans were more focused on fitness. For people in Brazil and the United States mindfulness was of the utmost importance, while the British and Chinese emphasized nutrition."
"Natural beauty records double-digit growth in Brazil, according to Kline","In connection with the COVID-19, Brazilian have intensified their hygiene habits, leading to an unexpected 5.8% annual growth (ex-factory price) in sales of cosmetic and hygiene products, according to the Brazilian Association of the personal hygiene, perfumery and cosmetics industry (ABIHPEC). Furthermore, as consumers in the country isolated themselves and took precautionary measures to prevent infection, they gave renewed attention to the importance of wellness and self-care. As a result, categories such as facial masks and treatments as well as hand/body cleansers and moisturizers increased in terms of demand, found Kline in a recent report. According to the market research firm, several brands successfully launched innovations in these categories such as new facial masks from Quintal Dermocosméticos and the new Beauty Nectar from Elemento Mineral. Skin care products with essential oils as a part of their formulation also grew in popularity, boosted by launches of new products, such as the Synergy of Oils from By Samia and Phytoterápica’s new essential oils, Junípero and Yuzu. In parallel, L’Oréal’s Garnier successfully entered the Brazilian skin care market during 2020, landing among the top 10 natural skin care brands, according to Kline’s Natural and Clean Beauty Global Series report. In addition, found Kline, consumers increasingly gravitated toward brands that offer a more responsible position, both from social and environmental point of views. For example, LiveAloe, with its complete portfolio of organic products; Boni Natural, which made its entry in many supermarkets and drugstores chains; and Cativa Natureza, with its sanitizing lotion. The trend has also helped the natural segment to perform well. Natural brands such as Elemento Mineral, with its complete line of facial treatment, Care Natural Beauty, ad Up2You, which have invested a lot in social media communication and digital channels, also had an extraordinary performance in 2020, said Kline. Actually, most natural skin care marketers were already quite savvy and actively present in the e-commerce domain, and were able to successfully pivot online to meet consumer needs, during lockdowns."
Clean and ethical beauty is an obvious choice for Gen-Z consumers in the US,"“GenZ is a conscious generation as teens this Spring cite Racial Equality & the Environment as their top-two social issues. We have also seen ‘thrifting’ emerge as a strong trend as thinking secondhand is becoming second nature to teens. In fact, 47% of teens have purchased and 55% have sold secondhand,” said Erinn Murphy, Piper Sandler senior research analyst. However, the study does not explain why teenagers are buying more secondhand goods. Price could be the main motivating factor - more than commitment to the environment - especially when you consider that Amazon remains the online shopping site most commonly cited by young Americans (56%), ahead of Shein (7%), Nike (5%), and PacSun (3%). The study of 7,000 Americans with an average age of 16.1 years [1] has also revealed “a female-led spending recovery with upticks in spending on clothing, handbags and skincare in particular.” Furthermore, in the wake of COVID-19 and given these consumers are digitally-native, it is no surprise to see online adoption at its highest ever. 96% of females claimed to shop online vs. 88% last year, while 92% of males claimed to shop online vs. 91% last year. Say goodbye to makeup, the health crisis has completely overturned the beauty habits of this generation, which now has a growing interest in skincare. ""Spending on skincare products for women has overtaken spending on makeup"", reveals the survey. An interesting aspect of this change is that teenagers are increasingly turning to online influencers when seeking information on current trends and new beauty brands (86%). However, dermatologist-recommended products are very much in vogue with Gen-Z, a fact reflected in the ranking of the age group’s favorite brands: CeraVe (35%), Cetaphil (10%), Neutrogena (8%), The Ordinary (7%), and Curology (3%). For fifth survey in a row, Ulta maintains No. 1 preferred beauty destination against Sephora (46% share vs. 39% last year). At the same time, 80% of female teens say they are willing to spend more for “clean” or natural beauty."
"Interest in perfume has never been greater, according to Cinquième Sens","“The pandemic has put the spotlight on anosmia and raised global awareness about the importance of olfaction in our lives. As a consequence, this led to a growing interest in perfumery; not only in a more in-depth knowledge of perfumes but also in the impact the sense of smell has on our well-being and psychological balance"", explained Isabelle Ferrand, CEO of Cinquième Sens in Paris, France. This trend had emerged before the outbreak of the pandemic, but it has been reinforced and accelerated with the different lockdowns. “On the one hand, people have realized the importance of fragrances and want to occupy their free time and learn different things from home. With the pandemic, many people want to do what they never gave themselves the opportunity to do, make their dreams come true and one of these dreams may be to learn more about perfumery. On the other hand, there are the entrepreneurs. People who lost their jobs due to the pandemic and want to start a business in perfumes, soaps or candles,” said Ana María Páez Saldarriaga, director of Atelier Olfativo, Cinquième Sens’ franchisee in Colombia. “We are finding a fascinating mix between individuals and professional interest.  We have individuals who never thought a perfumery training could be available to them based on where they live (i.e. far from the USA perfumery centers of New York and California) so Zoom is giving them new access. Also people who were too crazy at work to invest time to physically go to training now can join us for short snippets since they are working from home and have more flexibility,” confirmed Tami Katz, from U.S. fragrance consulting firm Serendipitee. ""Since the pandemic, there is an increase in individuals who seek help launching a natural perfume brand because they want to change their career and do something they love,"" observed Samantha Taylor from Australia’s The Powder Room. “A booming momentum for olfaction is happening right now,” added Alessandra Tucci, founder of Paralela Escola Olfativa, in São Paulo, Brazil. “Loss of the sense of smell, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic also revived the discussions around scents for wellbeing and emotional comfort,” noted perfumery expert Rajiv Sheth, Founder and CEO of All Good Scents, in India. “We are witnessing a real breakthrough in the relationship to perfume. Previously, people were using perfumes in order to be more attractive. Now, the perfume experience is becoming more complex and increasingly involves a search for personal well-being,” added Isabelle Ferrand. In many markets, people are increasingly interested in knowing more about the link between the sense of smell and their emotions. ""Aromachology is on the rise, we have more and more requests for training on the effect of odours on well-being and health,"" said Isabelle Ferrand. For Ana María Páez Saldarriaga, a lot of perfumery concepts currently emerging in Colombia are linked to emotions (joy, energy, calm, etc.), with some of them inviting to the escapism (one of the hottest desires of the moment). Product wise, the quest for wellbeing and positive emotions is leading to an increase in the demand for home fragrances, according to Rajiv Sheth. In Colombia, “there is a surge new local brands of scented candles, sometimes with air purifying claims,” observed Ana María Páez Saldarriaga. At Cinquième Sens in Paris, the creation of fragrances for candles is indeed the business which is currently recording the fastest growth. In order to address the rise of the demand for perfume education, Cinquième Sens and its franchisees - in 14 countries on all continents - are constantly adapting their training offers to changing demands. For instance, a programme dedicated to home fragrances had been set up even before the acceleration of the demand, in the wake of the pandemic, and a module devoted to sustainable development in the perfume sector (covering regulatory and technical aspects specific to perfumes) is currently under preparation."
Canada’s prestige beauty market begins to recover after steep decline in 2020,"Widespread lockdowns and retail restrictions led to steep declines in several key beauty categories including makeup (-33%), skincare (-9%) and fragrance (-7%). In 2020, the overall Canadian prestige beauty market declined by 17%, according to The NPD Group. [1] A deeper look at the different product categories shows that despite its decline skincare maintained its standing as Canada’s number one category. Furthremore, while fragrance sales declined by -7% consumers spent +6% more on average compared to 2019 as they shifted their dollars towards stronger, more concentrated scents and the iconic designer brands and pillar brands they know and love. Furthermore, sales of fragrance home scents grew by +10% in 2020 as consumers searched for ways to incorporate luxury into their stay-at-home lifestyles. Eventually, with its +33% growth, the hair care category was the fastest growing category across all the countries tracked by The NPD Group. In brief, the top market share gainers for 2020 included hair products; fragrance eau de parfum and eau de toilette; face creams, serums, cleansers and exfoliators; body creams/lotions; candles and nail care. As in most other markets, since brick-and-mortar stores were closed, a part of prestige beauty buyers switched their habits to purchase their favorite prestige products online. Online sales saw an increase of +56% in 2020 as the channel registered almost one third of all prestige beauty sales on the year compared to just 17% in 2019, found the market research firm. While the last 12 months have been difficult, the Canadian beauty industry is beginning to show signs of growth. Year-over-year sales for the week ending March 13 increased by +3%, which was the first time the industry has seen a positive weekly sales increase since the week ending November 21. [2] “As we head towards recovery, there is a great opportunity for brands and retailers to delight and surprise consumers and build loyalty both in-store and online,” said Alecsandra Hancas, Canadian Beauty Industry Analyst at The NPD Group. “Recovery will vary by category, and while Skincare and Fragrance have shown positive signs, there are bright spots even within the struggling makeup category. Lipstick, just like going out, will make a comeback and we can’t wait.” In 2020, prestige beauty sales dropped -16% in Germany, -19% in the U.S.A., -20% in France, and -24% in the U.K."
Make-up: Is orange set to be the next hottest color for lips?,"Lipstick isn’t dead yet! The pandemic has certainly meant it’s been out of the spotlight for a while, relegated to the background by mask wearing, but we haven’t seen the last of it. It is even making a comeback in its most daring shade, a vivid orange that will not go unnoticed this summer. It remains to be seen if it will really get to be seen by the world live in the flesh, or if it will rather make a statement as the star product in beauty styling pix posted on social networks. And yet, by all indications the global pandemic was at the root of a return to more natural makeup looks, with a smoothed-out but not overloaded complexion, lips that are shiny but not tinted, and a more distinct eye, but not overly made up. This penchant for going back to basics is directly linked to lockdowns and the implementation of working from home, as well as to the necessity of wearing a mask in public spaces. Why spend time and effort on a sophisticated makeup look that no one will see? So now what does this return to a vibrant color like this orange signify? The end of the pandemic? That seems somewhat further off. It seems more linked to a need for optimism, freshness and cheerfulness, in response to a gloomy period. And there’s no denying it! These orange lips, these looks full of energy and daring, have a feelgood effect in the midst of the covid era. The positive impact of vibrant colors on the human mind is well known! Followed by nearly 14,000 people on Instagram, Afnan Dano recently posted an ultra bright look, featuring fluorescent orange, from eyelids to lips that has sparked a host of positive reactions. A photo that clear has the power to help forget this complicated period ... at least for a few seconds. And TikTok is also playing a role; the influencers keep coming, one after another to present their favorite orange lipstick, from pastel to fluorescent shades through orange reds... The views on the hashtag ""#orangelipstick"" figure in the hundreds of thousands, and orange lipstick is making an appearance in many videos dedicated to spring 2021 trends. With this springtime inspiration, one has to wonder if ultra-pigmented shades are set to be back in the spotlight after months of absence. Not only are brands focusing on richly pigmented lipsticks and glosses on social media, but beauty influencers seem to have grown tired of natural beauty looks and are gradually returning to bolder looks. It’s a trend that is usually seen in the fall-winter season, but it lets us look forward to a summer of extravagance. It remains to be seen if it will be possible for everybody to live it to its full extent."
UK beauty buyers have adopted the ‘skinimalism’ trend as soon as last year,"As the pandemic led to the periodical closure of brick and mortar stores, with prestige beauty sales declining -24% in 2020, the UK market was affected stronger than its European counterparts, including France (-20%) and Germany (-16%), or than the US (-19%). As far as prestige skincare sales are concerned, the fall reached -23% in 2020 in the UK, according to The NPD Group latest data, and the total prestige skincare market was valued at £295 million. According to Pinterest’s 2021 Trend Predictions Report, ‘skinimalism’, which features a pared down skincare and make-up routine which adopts a minimalist, back-to-basics approach, will be one of the biggest beauty trends this year. However, NPD’s research suggests that UK consumers appear to have embraced this attitude in their skincare buying habits as soon as last year. According to The NPD Group, three skincare subsegments demonstrated the early adoption of the ‘skinimalism’ trend among UK consumers by reporting a decline in sales less than the total category: in 2020 sales of prestige face cream declined 20%, prestige face cleansers declined 17% and facial exfoliators declined 3%. “Face cream, facial cleanser and facial exfoliators are the three sub-segments where consumers have gone back to basics whilst some ‘additional steps’ such as eye treatments and masks have declined in importance in  face skincare as consumers have ‘skinimised’ what products they’re using,” commented Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty. In 2018 and 2019, sales of eye treatment products have represented the third largest subsegment (in value) within prestige skincare, however, in 2020 facial cleansers reported more value sales than eye treatments, reinforcing the trend for a pared down skincare regime. Sales of anti-acne serums increased by 51% in value in 2020 as mask wearing created new needs and consumers focused on skin specific remedies to reveal their glowing skin. “As the pandemic hit, our skincare routine remained consistent when the country went into lockdown. However, consumer confidence has been hit, and people are more reluctant to spend. At the same time consumers focus on sustainability also means that Skinimalism has become very topical. Beauty buyers seem to be purchasing less products, and the products that they are opting for are more targeted. We have also seen an increase in beauty brands concentrate their messaging on the active ingredients in their products. Just some examples of brands that we have observed doing this include Estee Lauder with its latest Advanced Night Repair Serum re-launch, Origins New Multi-powered Youth Serum and in Makeup, Charlotte Tilbury’s new Lip Launch called Hyaluronic Happikiss,” added Emma Fishwick."
Brazil: Sales of cosmetics and hygiene products grew by 5.8% in 2020,"The  5.8% annual growth  (ex-factory price) is well above the 1.1% forecasted in August. According to ABIHPEC, this impressive rise can be explained by several factors, starting with the intensification of hygiene habits in order to reduce the risk of contamination by the new coronavirus. With sales up 808% compared to 2019, sanitizing hand gels are the best illustration of what the trade association calls the “Covid-19 basket”, which also includes paper tissues (+77%), kitchen towels (+33.2%), liquid soap (+22.3%), bar soaps (+9.5%) and toilet paper (+12.7%). Other product categories, also linked to hygiene habits, took advantage of the situation, such as bath products. However the performance of the skincare category, for body and face, is one of the most surprising, with sales up 21.9% from 2019. Indeed, all the products in this segment recorded a double-digit growth! Facials and face care masks recorded growth of 91% and, for body care, scrubs performed the best, with an increase of 153.2%. Sales of the perfume category increased by 8.4% in 2020 (ex-factory price again) compared to the previous year. Despite a relatively long shutdown and the operating restrictions to which they have been subjected, perfumeries have been able to reinvent themselves and invest in alternative sales channels to attract distance buyers. Online shopping, experience sharing on social networks and virtual interaction with brands, have allowed perfumery shops to keep in touch with consumers. The other explanatory factor for the growth of perfume sales is the increased interest in in local brands. On the one hand, restrictions on foreign travel have limited the opportunities for duty free shopping and, on the other hand, the increase in the price of imported items, linked to the rise of the dollar against the Brazilian currency, boosted the competitiveness of local brands. The intensification of personal hygiene habits also led Brazilian consumers to increase the frequency of baths and showers and, consequently, the occasions for washing their hair. According to ABIHPEC, sales of shampoos increased by 7.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. Sales of conditioners increased by 18.6% and those of hair care products by 12.6%. Note that the Brazilian cosmetics and hygiene industry recorded its first trade surplus in 2020 (USD 23.4 million), after a decade of deficit."
Zoom era sees pandemic boom in US plastic surgeries,"He knew he would have time to recuperate in the privacy of his own home. And Young suddenly found himself face-to-face with his own image while participating in an increased amount of video calls. ""It’s something new when you have to stare at your face for a couple of hours a day and there’s only so much you can do with good lighting and good angles,"" he said. Young, 52, already had been a fan of Botox injections but went under the scalpel for the first time in October. He had a lower face and neck lift, upper and lower eyelid surgery and laser resurfacing. ""You first discover that with Zoom when you see yourself and you’re like, Oh, yikes!"" the trainee real estate agent explained, as Dr Michael Somenek examined his barely visible scars. Young is far from the only one who has found themselves disappointed with the reflection they have seen in the webcam over the past year. Virtual consultations for cosmetic procedures have risen 64 percent for surgeons in the United States since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, which lists Botox injections, dermal fillers, breast augmentation and liposuction as among the most popular services. ""We have absolutely seen an increase in the number of surgical cosmetic procedures that people have been seeking directly related to Zoom,"" said Somenek, who has seen a 50 to 60 percent increase. ""The number one procedure that people have been coming in for is either their upper eyelids or their neck. Because they see (their neck) either hanging on the camera or looking like a double chin."" A similar phenomenon was observed in Brazil, the world leader in plastic surgery procedures, with 13 percent of the global market, according to figures from the International Society of Plastic Surgery. And the reasons were quite the same. ""I think the pandemic in general has given everyone time to like, sit back and take care of those things that we’ve been pushing further and further along,"" explained Ana Caceres, who was able to work from home after undergoing a plastic surgery operation she had wanted for a long time. She recovered at her parents’ house outside Washington after a December breast reconstruction and lift that helped her deal with a source of insecurity she has had since adolescence. ""I didn’t have to take off all this time, because I still was able to work from my bed with my laptop,"" the 25-year-old said. ""When life is going on and you have places to be, it’s so easy to push things along further and further,"" Caceres said, sporting a top she says she now has the confidence to wear. And she has scheduled arm liposuction for the end of this month. Her surgeon, Dr Catherine Hannan, says consultations at her clinic in the US capital have nearly doubled since the beginning of the pandemic. ""Our patients have more frown lines, because they’ve been so stressed for the last year,"" she said. And Hannan says a face or body change can have a psychological impact, too. ""This is a way that patients are saying, I can’t travel, I can’t see my family, this is something I can do to make myself feel more confident right now."""
The Chinese men’s cosmetics market is getting polarized,"“There is a ‘soft’ representation of men (in advertisement as well as TV series and movies) targeting women – the Little Fresh Meat ‘poppy dogs’, these prepubescent looking men with flawless skin, wearing make-up, with sophisticated hairstyles, projecting the ideal, sensitive and romantic boyfriend,” explains Laurence Lim Dally, CEO of Hong-Kong-based intercultural branding agency Cherry Blossoms. To her, the trend in China is more about representing Little Fresh Meat to promote female cosmetics, which both Chinese and Western brands would do. Most cosmetic brands would target men with products men and women can both use. However, this representation of masculinity, partly influenced by the South-Korean pop culture, also seems to have an impact on the men’s market. Already the first in the world, the Chinese men’s cosmetics market was estimated at 12.5 billion yuans (1.9 billion USD) in 2020 by market research company Mintel, and should rise by 50% to reach 18.5 billion yuans in 2025. The object of everyone’s desire, this dynamism triggered the emergence of local brands, like Coen (科恩), Just A Cool Brand (JACB), or Make Essense (理然), which are seeking to capture this market, still dominated by major groups. According to Mintel, L’Oréal, Beiersdorf, and Japanese group Rohto share 60% of the men’s cosmetics market in China. Press agency Reuters says six new Chinese brands managed to raise over 300 million yuans thanks to investors. They aim to get as successful as compatriot Perfect Diary, who achieved a meteoric rise among the young Chinese women generation with playful, affordable cosmetics and countless promotional campaigns. In light of these new players, other advertising imagery might make a comeback. According to Laurence Lim Dally, “the representation of masculinity in China remains dual. At the opposite of the Little Fresh Meat, brands targeting men still represent more ‘macho’, traditional representations of masculinity.” “With the rise of national pride, fueled by the successful management of the Covid-19 crisis by China, more ‘manly’ representations of men emerge, notably through patriotic action movies embodying China’s superpower”, she adds. Patriotism may have also revived the polemic against men wearing make-up or earrings, called ‘Sissy pants’ by China’s influential state media Xinhua, in 2018. “Possibly for that reason, we see some Little Fresh Meat celebrities evolve from ‘poppy dogs’ to ‘wolf dogs’. They keep their flawless skin but grow muscles, wear lighter make-up, street style and adopt a more mature and ‘manly’ body language,” says Laurence Lim Dally. In fact, the men’s facial skincare market has embarked on a journey of growth transformation, with male consumers polarizing, explains Alice Li, Senior Beauty & Personal Care analyst at Mintel. Some men have started to expand their routines with a wider range of facial skincare products, from facial masks to suncare products. “Mintel data shows that in 2020, Chinese men use 2.3 types of facial skincare products on average, up from 1.7 types in 2017,” she adds. “Here is the potential to encourage men’s usage with skincare bundles that include a range of different products.” However, a growing proportion of men are still struggling to understand the need for facial skincare and have dropped out of the category over the past few years. The percentage of men who have not used any facial skincare products in the past six months has increased in the past three years, from 12% in 2017 to 21% in 2019 and 25% in 2020. 25-29-year-olds and tier-one city consumers are more likely to stop using facial skincare products. “This indicates that some men still take facial skincare as a dispensable and optional category; they do not think it is necessary to use facial skincare products and just drop out after a few trials,” analyzes Alice Li. After revolutionizing the market, in particular with the Chanel Boy makeup range in 2018, and then the unisex Givenchy Mister range, how can Western brands position themselves on this complex market? “As Western brands may be more at ease with inclusive representations of gender, they may have a card to play to forge new aspirational masculinities in China, which would stay away from the Little Fresh Meat persona, while expressing more gender fluidity,” suggests Laurence Lim Dally. “Chinese brands might remain more conservative when representing masculinity for the male gaze,” she concludes."
Mintel’s four key beauty and personal care trends for 2021,"In a recent report [1], Mintel  announced four key consumer trends set to impact the global beauty and personal care industry during 2021. Beautiful Mind: Brands have an opportunity to build normality in uncertain times through routines using products that protect, bring value, and rebuild trusting relationships. “Brands that successfully highlight the use of beauty routines as a way to combat stress and anxiety will drive long-term value for consumers. Brands will need to  create strategies for third-party experts to educate consumers about the future of holistic wellness with self-care that touches on the mind-body-spirit connection,” said Sharon Kwek, Associate Director, Global Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. Beauty Re(Valued): As spending comes under scrutiny, product functionality and purpose will drive usage. Value will be measured in quality, convenience, and impact rather than currency. While experiences will become more valuable than tangible products, brands wishing to encourage consumers to trade-up will need to redefine value, beyond just cost, but through the impact of purchase . Channel Changers: Robust ecommerce strategies will allow brands to win with a true omnichannel approach that pushes the boundaries, engages all of the senses, and offers new layers of digital experience. “Brands will need to develop strategies that drive commerce to own-brand sites that advocate authenticity, as well as challenge big marketplaces that have yet to provide clear supply chain transparency,” added Kwek. Beauty Eco-lution: As consumers emerge from COVID-19 confinement, they will re-evaluate priorities with eco-ethical considerations driving more purchases. As many consumers will continue shopping local with less focus on price, collaborating with and supporting local businesses will be an important long-term strategy. “The next evolution of ‘clean’ will be created by marrying ethics with safety to cater to the conscious and careful beauty consumer focused on avoiding undue risk inside and outside the box,” concluded Sharon Kwek."
Brazil’s ABIHPEC is optimistic for 2021 despite very uncertain times,"“Things could have been much worse,” said João Carlos Basilio about the year 2020. With market growth expected to reach about 6% last year, the beauty industry in Brazil has had to reinvent itself to address the challenges - and the opportunities - that emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. To date, the exact results of the year are yet to be unveiled, but according to João Carlos Basilio, “the growth of the sector should be significant, given the difficulties that have arisen in 2020."" “With regard to the pandemic, it has been crutial that our sector be considered essential for the country, in particular by the federal government. Our factories have not stopped. As a result, it has been possible to maintain the production and the jobs of the population, as well as the growth of the market.” Sales of items pertaining to the so-called “Covid basket”, such as hand sanitizers and liquid soaps, have sky-rocketed. However, other categories - such as body care - also rose sharply in 2020. “With Brazilians spending more time at home, figures show consumers focused on products enabling them to perform mini spa rituals at home.” From January to October 2020, sales of the body care segment increased by 17.1% (ex-factory price), compared to the same period in 2019. Sales of exfoliators soared 159.9 %. ""These data show the strong ritualization of the bathing time, consumers have transformed it as a moment of relaxation and disconnection from the stress of everyday life"", emphasizes João Carlos Basilio. A similar phenomenon has occurred for facial skin care. The category saw an increase of 30.9% between January and October 2020. Skin care masks were the most sought after, with an increase of 102.6%. ""Facial masks were already very popular with Brazilians, even before the pandemic, and as people were spending more time at home their interest grew even further."" In Brazil too, e-commerce was one of the main winners of the pandemic. ""According to a survey carried out by Go2Mob in November 2020, 35% of Brazilians have started to buy online or have increased the volume of their online purchases after the start of the pandemic and this is a shift that will last."" Digital platforms have notably made it possible to meet consumer expectations during major annual festivities such as Mother’s Day, Lover’s Day, Father’s Day, Black Friday in November and Christmas. ""The current environment is still very uncertain, but we are still optimistic about 2021, after all, despite all the difficulties encountered throughout 2020, we have seen a V-shaped economic recovery curve materialize"" , says João Carlos Basilio. According to him, the waffling of the government regarding income-support for households and businesses, especially SMEs, as well as uncertainties about ""structural reforms that the country urgently needs, encourage to remain cautious."""
"Germany prestige beauty sales declined 16% in 2020, reports The NPD Group","Germany prestige beauty market generated EUR 2,7 billion in sales during 2020 and reported a 16% decline compared to 2019, found to The NPD Group [1]. Germany is the only country, along the five largest European markets for prestige beauty, with an overall decline in sales below 20%. For instance, the prestige beauty market posted a 20% drop in France and a 24% decline in the United Kingdom. According to the market research firm, Germany’s performance is mainly due to shorter lockdown periods, as well as the industry’s online channel maturity. Online sales in Germany saw a 25% increase in 2020. However, as in the other European countries, this rise could not compensate the declines from brick-and-mortar stores. The e-commerce channel registered almost one quarter of all prestige beauty sales in 2020 compared to 16% in 2019. The EUR 1.4 billion fragrances category decreased by 14% but still represents the largest share of prestige beauty sales in Germany. Juices showed double-digit decline but overall showed a better performance in the market compared to gift sets and ancillaries. Retail lockdowns in Germany happened during Easter and Christmas, two key consumption periods for fragrances. Also, during Mother’s Day, the category suffered as it took place three weeks after the spring lockdown. The skincare category, the second largest category in Germany’s beauty market, posted an 11% drop and showed the best resilience among the three main categories. According to The NPD Group, the key factor contributing to skincare’s annual performance is the higher percentage of online sales even before the retail lockdown. E-commerce now represents 27 percent of the category sales. The other main explanation is the trend towards more beauty “me-time” at home. With a 27% drop, makeup reported the biggest impact from the pandemic. Reduced social life during and after lockdown, as well as mandatory mask wearing contributed to the decline. This was noteworthy for the sales of lip products, which declined by 40%. Eye products such as mascara and eyebrow resisted better than the rest of the category. Within face products, blushes and highlighters had a difficult year, while tinted moisturizer and setting sprays were less affected."
"U.S. prestige beauty sales declined 19% in 2020, reports NPD","The U.S. prestige beauty industry generated $16.1 billion in 2020, a 19% sales decline compared to 2019, according to The NPD Group. By category, makeup sales were down (-34%) for the year followed by skincare (-11%) and fragrance (-8%), while hair grew 7%. Shifting consumer priorities toward self-care and little luxuries, and broader lifestyle changes due to the pandemic moved the needle in unprecedented ways, creating pockets of growth amidst the industry’s overall sales decline. Self-care became essential in 2020, with the winning areas of the market being those that helped to create a spa environment at home. The top market share gainers for the year touched on all categories, including hair treatments and masks; fragrance candles; face exfoliators; body creams/lotions, cleansers, and oils; and nail care. Despite the tight race between makeup and skincare throughout the year, makeup ultimately maintained its position as the largest beauty category based on dollar sales for 2020; however, it has also been the most negatively impacted by the pandemic, as it was the case in France and in the UK. Face remained the largest segment in makeup and sales declined faster than the overall category, but some products increased their market share including setting spray/powder, tinted moisturizer, bronzer, and concealer. Eye makeup gained share while lip saw the steepest declines, a shift that has, in part, been a byproduct of mask wearing. Nail was the only segment of makeup to grow in 2020 as consumers took nail care into their own hands. In skincare, the areas of growth were not enough to compensate for the declines across the largest areas of the market: face cream, face serum, and eye treatment. Most of skincare’s growth stemmed from body products, including body creams/lotions, exfoliators, cleansers, serums, and devices. With clinics closed and elective surgeries placed on hold, consumers turned to at-home microdermabrasion and body sculpting-type products to achieve results. Fragrance, while down for the year, declined at the slowest rate thanks to a second half rebound, similarly to what happened in France and in the UK. Although the brick-and-mortar channel remained challenged, the rate of decline decelerated to a great extent during the second half of the year, allowing the accelerated online growth to offset that loss. In terms of the bright spots that helped fragrance overperform compared to the other categories, parfum sales grew double digits for the year, as consumers are showing a greater affinity towards longer lasting scents. Parfums also tend to be more expensive, which further helped boost dollar volumes for the category. In addition, home scents, which have been on the uptick for the last few years, saw accelerated growth in 2020 as consumers brought the meaning of comfort at home to another level."
"Prestige beauty sales in the UK down 24% in 2020, reports The NPD Group","COVID-19 has changed consumer buying habits, with many adopting a digital approach to their shopping. On the one hand, sales of prestige beauty products in brick and mortar stores declined 44% in 2020 when stores were forced to close intermittently due to government restrictions, according to The NPD Group. On the other hand, prestige beauty sales online increased 47% in 2020, up 21% points compared to 2019. Actually, the pandemic has accelerated a trend that was already well established, since the prestige beauty market online has reported double digit growth in the UK for several years. Despite a harsh context, fragrance demonstrated its resilience in 2020 and was one of the best performing categories in prestige beauty. In 2020 total prestige fragrance sales declined 17%, seven points less than the overall prestige beauty market. The first lockdown had a negative impact on sales in the fragrance market and 50% of the year’s total losses can be attributed to the period from April to June. When stores reopened, recovery was in sight, and the market showed promising signs, performing positively in November, growing 2%, despite the second lockdown. In 2019, 52% of fragrance sales occurred in the last three months of the year. October to December 2020 accounted for 57% mix of full year sales, confirming that fragrances remain one of the most important Christmas gifts for consumers. The NPD Group made similar observations for prestige fragrance sales in France. Skincare came into sharp focus in 2020. It was the most resilient prestige beauty category during the first lockdown as consumers maintained their skincare routine. The skincare category declined 21% in 2020, but sales of anti-acne serums increased by 51% in value in 2020 as mask wearing created new needs among British consumers. Sales of prestige hand soaps grew 38% in 2020 compared to 2019. Furthermore, following the #selfcare trend, prestige bodycare gained more than 1% of market share due to the popularity of body creams, lotions and spray as consumers turned to spa-at-home routines. Make-up, one of the pillars of the UK beauty market, was the most challenged category in 2020. Sales of prestige makeup in the UK declined 40% compared to 2019. Remote-working, reduced social life and the trend for natural makeup led to a decrease in demand. For example, sales of lip make-up declined 50%, due to the government regulations to wear face masks. “The UK’s prestige beauty industry has been hugely challenged in 2020, however brands and retailers remain resilient and the trends we witnessed in previous years have accelerated during the pandemic. This includes the growth of online sales, the importance of a multi-channel retail approach, and the influence of social media on a consumers path to purchase,” said Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty. Earlier this month, The NPD Group published similar figures regarding the French prestige beauty market which posted an unprecedented 20% drop. However, brick and mortar stores were less impacted in France (-26%) and online sales (+52%) performed even better that in the UK."
"Skin protection: Consumers want more, according to Mintel","As the year went by, it became inevitable to increasingly use screens to work, do shopping, and even socialize. But this extended exposure to blue light provokes skin and eye damage. A study by Unilever exposed its effect on our skin, saying 30 hours of exposure to blue light from smartphone or laptop screens can increase the inflammation level in skin cells by 40%. This risk should be taken into account, because the habits related to screens have become widespread. In the US, 67% of consumers think group video chats will still be a popular way to socialise after social distancing ends. And this data boosts cosmetic innovation. Truly Blueberry Kush CBD Body Oil is designed to moisturise, detoxify and calm skin, while working as a natural shield against blue light and supporting the skin’s barrier function. Likewise, Dr. Nassif Firming Neck Treatment is an anti-ageing cream said to help resist the ""tech neck"" wrinkles caused by using a phone or laptop for hours every day. In addition, as they are coping with the sanitary crisis, consumers also want additional protection against bacteria and external particles. This expectation should actually last and become widespread once sanitary measures have been lightened. The notion of protection against pollution also remains relevant despite the short lockdown relief. According to Mintel, in the UK, 42% of adults are worried about the level of air pollution they are exposed to. And yet, in 2020, 56% of launches containing protection against pollution were face care products; 11% were body care products, and 8% sunscreens – two segments for which consumers expect the same claims as part of a holistic vision. The UV protection added to skincare products is beneficial in many regions. It accounts for a large part of launches – 46% between October 2019 and September 2020. Still, for consumers who long remained locked down indoors, Mintel recommends innovations focused on sun products with skincare or cosmetic advantages, while keeping the same basic protection message. For example, Fenty Beauty has now launched the Hydra Vizor Broad Spectrum Sunscreen, containing niacinamide and hyaluronic acid for additional beauty benefits."
French exports of cosmetic products decreased for the first time since 2009,"During what has been a harsh year, marked by a global health and economic crisis, France exported more than EUR 15.7 billion of cosmetic products, a decrease of 11.8% compared to 2019, according to figures released Friday by the French Federation of the beauty industry (FEBEA). “Despite the troubled context, French cosmetics now hold 24% of the world market share. The ‘Made in France’ label remains an essential asset for the sector and for our economy as a whole,” said Patrick O’Quin, president of FEBEA. According to French customs, this is the first decline in French exports of perfumes and cosmetics since 2009, and only the second in the last 20 years. This drop is to be compared with that of exports from other French manufacturing sectors, all on a downward trend in 2020, with the exception of pharmaceutical products (+ 4.7%). On the other hand, exports of French cosmetics to China grew by nearly 20.7% in 2020. Even if the pace is slowing down compared to 2019 (+48%), this sharp increase marks the growing importance of the country for the French perfume and cosmetics industry. Indeed, the Asian giant is now the number one market for the French cosmetics industry, ahead of Germany and the United States. For instance, China is “by far the leading buyer of French lipsticks, with more than one in four exported the country,” said the FEBEA. Skin care and even face makeup are “very popular with Chinese consumers,” added the trade organisation. During this very atypical year, sales of soaps performed very well, all over the world with an increase of 11.3% in value compared to 2019. It is in Asia that this progression was the strongest (+22%), ahead of Europe (+19%). On the other hand, French exports of perfumes fell by 16% and those of eau de toilette fell by 27.9% over the year, due in particular to a reduced number of launches, but also to the halt to travel retail."
Luxury perfumes: How the pandemic is revolutionizing the shopping experience,"No more testers, no more solo olfactory wanderings: now, customers must ask shop assistants when they want to smell perfumes. Masks and social distancing also have an influence on the shopping experience. All this has largely contributed to the rise of online sales and the emergence of digital technologies. “The recovery we experienced online actually saved us. The public’s appetite incited us to reinvent ourselves in the digital world,” explains François Hénin, founder of Jovoy, the Embassy of Rare Perfumes. However, the current situation does not seem to have altered perfumistas’ curiosity too strongly. “In this slowdown context favourable to discovery, some people want to purchase the same perfumes, while enthusiasts are eager for new launches,” adds François Hénin. Brands and the media do their best to feed this appetite with new fragrances, some of which are only available online, while promotional games flourish on social media. However, “ boxes are the best new perfume boosters,” says François Hénin. “Thanks to regular newsletters, they gained the public’s buy-in: when they fall in love with a perfume, people tend to buy a bottle online”. For Jovoy, it is a way to transpose their generous sample policy to the digital sphere – a significant advantage in this tricky period punctuated by lockdowns and other restrictive measures for physical stores. With this in mind, Jovoy also made boxes structured around different themes (seasons, materials, events). Boxes being a more intimate and serene discovery method, they are now on a roll. For example, “taking in account both subscriptions and unit sales”, sales on the Auparfum website “rose by 20% compared to last year,” says Lucile Rives, of the Nez team. The website’s e-shop (shop.bynez.com), which displays books, candles, and games, actually saw sales increase by 40%, compared to 2019. “We need to keep surprising people and innovating, even online,” explains François Hénin. “For example, in our boxes, we slip scented papers which provide information about the fragrance, including the olfactory pyramid. We want people to have fun.” To re-enchant online shopping, Jovoy also offers various gifts with purchase. For a 100 ml bottle, you get one of these small gifts of all sorts: testing doses of perfumed detergent by pH Fragrances, flasks of the Nosy Be vanilla absolute by Parfumeurs Sans Frontières, a 15 ml new BDK perfume to discover… Brands are definitely willing to play the game, hoping to gain some visibility. New virtual experiences are also welcome. Since the information provided in the press is not enough for perfume lovers, Instagram lives and other videos are getting widespread. “We are going to organize an online competition. Web users’ most beautiful descriptions will be posted on our website, and winners will get bottles,” François Hénin eagerly reveals. To get rid of the trouble related to social distancing rules in stores and offset the decline of physical traffic, Jovoy offers private consultation sessions in small groups of two to three people – an opportunity for customers fond of this luxury cocoon to experience a special moment. In North America, LuckyScent offers to make an appointment to get the same advice as in stores. “These initiatives encourage concept stores to develop new analytical skills – and customer loyalty,” explains François Hénin. Brands and major groups also take action. Puig multiplies innovative initiatives to re-enchant the shopping experience in stores. To comply with sanitary rules, the group developed a tool derived from Wikiparfum, AILICE, to be able to visualize a fragrance before smelling it thanks to a QR code on customers’ smartphones. When scanning a perfume’s bottle or packaging, AILICE automatically analyses the information and retrieves the relevant content in a perfume database (olfactory family, main ingredients, etc.). For now, this new technology has been deployed in Penhaligon’s stores in the UK and Asia. In the same vein, Puig partnered with Air Parfum to devise a diffuser which perfectly renders the complexity of trails. Thanks to this tool, in summer 2020, they unveiled Paco Rabanne’s PaCollection in “3D” at the Sephora store of the La Défense shopping mall, west of Paris. In South America, Natura recently fitted their stores with the MultiScent 20 scented tablets. This technology developed by Brazilian startup Noar is now brought to fragrance players and retailers all around the world by the Orlandi group. There is little doubt this type of technologies will soon become a perfume shopping basic. Perfectly aware of these stakes, the Paris PCD show organizers partnered with Coty to make the ESP and ESEPAC students work on innovative perfume testing solutions. Curator journals like Nez, websites and blogs specialized in perfumes, as well as boxes and sample sets are likely to get increasingly popular in terms of perfume discovery. Still, what impact will the context have on creation, but also on our relationship with perfumes, in the long run?"
Skincare trends: Blue-light protection and at-home treatments on the up,"In the space of a year, women’s beauty concerns have been shaken up completely by the covid-19 pandemic, with mask wearing, the switch to home working and successive lockdowns. Right now, skincare is all about going back to basics, protecting skin from the harm it can face day to day, and deep treatments that don’t involve leaving the house - no matter where in the world you may be. The blue light emitted by screens can be harmful for skin cell renewal, and can affect skin’s natural radiance and accentuate wrinkles. So it’s no surprise that internet users have been searching for skincare to combat this phenomenon. The global search platform Stylight notes a +136% increase in Google search interest for ""blue light skincare"" since the beginning of 2019, peaking at +336% in May 2020, during lockdown. [1] Faced with these gloomy times of lockdowns and face masks, internet users are also looking to boost their skin with products rich in vitamin C. On Stylight, clicks for the top vitamin C serums rose sharply (over 1,000%) in late 2020 to early 2021, compared to the same period last year. Another notable trend of early 2021 is at-home beauty treatments. While it’s currently still possible, in some countries, to go to beauty salons for favorite treatments, consumers seem to be looking for home-based alternatives. As a result, chemical peels — which can be applied at home — are popular right now. According to Stylight, clicks on top BHA/AHA peels increased by over 1,000% at the end of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Similarly, eyebrow dyes and eyelash growth serums are gaining ground (+1,000%), showing growing uptake among some beauty fans for the kinds of treatments usually carried out by specialists in salons. Other top trends include celebrity skincare brands, which are still riding high. After bursting onto the scene a few years ago, this trend has gone from strength to strength, and the pandemic hasn’t put paid to that. KORA Organics by Miranda Kerr (+485%), Fenty Skin by Rihanna (+300%) and Jessica Alba’s Honest Beauty (+181%) are among the most popular brands. Note too, the growing popularity of pharmacy staples and newfound interest in age-old Ayurvedic wellness practices and tools — two trends to watch closely."
France: Sales of prestige cosmetics record unprecedented 20% fall,"According to The NPD Group, sales of prestige beauty products fell by 20% in France in 2020, under the impact of restrictions linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. Brick and mortar prestige beauty stores (perfumeries, department stores) recorded a 26% drop in sales. The main reasons are: three months of compulsory closure, curfews and travel restrictions. Of course, consumers often turned to e-commerce over the period. As a result, sales of prestige beauty products in the online channel rose 52% and e-commerce now account for 16% of prestige beauty sales in France (vs. 8% in 2019) However, the shift did not compensate all the losses of physical stores. According to The NPD Group it absorbed only 18% of the loss. In December, The NPD Group had already noted the resistance of the perfume category between January and the end of October 2020. Despite the second lockdown in November, the end of year celebrations boosted the category, with a 17% increase in perfume sales between November 30 and December 27, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, confirming how much prestige fragrances remain a popular Christmas gift in France. As a result, sales of prestige fragrances dropped 15% in 2020. For its part, the skincare category has experienced contrasting developments. The facials segment fell 25% in 2020. However, sales of acne and blemish products jumped 32% in value, in response to the new needs created by wearing masks. In contrast, prestige body care products gained over 1% market share, driven by the popularity of creams, lotions, and other body sprays used by consumers in their home spa routine. The makeup category suffered the most in 2020, with a drop of 35% compared to 2019. The reduction of social interactions, linked to the rise of teleworking and the growing popularity of the nude trend both contributed to lower the demand. The need to wear facial covering also had a huge impact on certain products. Sales of lipsticks, for instance, fell by 53%. In contrast to the general trend, the prestige haircare category recorded impressive growth in 2020, with sales rising 27%. However, this category is underdeveloped in the selective channel and sales are mostly made online (59%) where the offer is larger than in brick-and-mortar stores. This unprecedented decline is confirmed by Procos, the French federation of specialized retailers, whose panel recorded an 18% drop of beauty & health retails in 2020. For its part, the LVMH group announced a 22% drop in sales of its perfumes and cosmetics business. This situation could lead to a rapid repositioning of the major distribution chains. Germany-based retailer Douglas, for instance, announced its decision to close 62 stores in France, and around 500 in Europe, out of a total of 2,400 stores, in order to focus investments on digital sales."
Top 5 beauty predictions for 2021 (and beyond),"From transparency to radical traceability As trust is the new currency, safety and wellness become key; therefore, brands will need to explore radical traceability solutions. Transparency is a prerequisite of conscious consumption, and 2020 has reinforced the need to make a safe choice for anything applied on skin. Moreover, reaching global wellbeing implies ethical decisions, especially in luxury. IPSOS Luxury survey shows that 90% of the affluent Chinese expect brands to have an ethical/ecological commitment, and 88% expect them to respect animal wellbeing. More than words, consumers call for facts. According to the UEBT 2020 survey, consumers expect more information on packaging: 82% want to know the origin of ingredients, and 78% wish to know the social impact of sourcing local ingredients. In 2020, the discussion on ethical sourcing accelerated. In the USA, Beautycounter has made a massive communication on responsible sourcing, pointing out the “clean” origing of their Mica and the urgency to fight against hidden forced labor. British E-Retailer, Cult, has cooperated with the blockchain technology platform Provenance to collect information about the source, ingredients, craftsmanship, and requirements of its products, and then use evidence to prove the authenticity of this information From ""skinification"" to augmented ""healthification"" ""Skinification"" was the major trend in 2020, as consumers shifted from makeup to the ""pandemic-proof"" skincare market. But what 2020 has taught us is the importance of prevention for our health. According to Innova’s Consumer Survey 2020, ""six out of ten global consumers are increasingly looking for F&B products that support their immune health. One in three says that concerns about immune health increased in 2020 over 2019"". Sales of vitamins, supplements, and even homeopathic remedies experienced unprecedented levels during the April coronavirus pandemic in the US. We have seen skincare transitioning to self-care, as consumers were spending more time at home. Interest in wellness has increased, and new brands are taking the stand to answer this new need. Disciple offers a holistic approach to stress-relief and answers to anxiety-related skin issues such as acne. The British wellness brand Nue Co. launched Forest Lungs, a fragrance ""supplement"" intended to ""deliver the healing effects of nature to the body [and] support the reduction of everyday stress."" From skintellectualization to ""Science Inside"" The ""skintellectualization"" of Beauty has emerged as a significant trend in 2020, propelled by Gen Z. Empowered by digital tools, these consumers are armed with in-depth Beauty knowledge and are now ""ingredient wizards"", even more attentive to INCI. Online, they are building a digital Beauty library, thanks to all the knowledge passed on forums and social media. Simultaneously, a new generation of influencers such as skincare guru Hyram in the US or Secret de Peau in France, deciphers every product. Ready to make the next leap, ingredient-focused brand Inkey List drives the trend with a pedagogical approach to imperfections, specific protocols, and a radical education of consumers. While recent years’ fascination for mystical wellness was key, led by gurus such as Gwyneth Paltrow, we now see a renewed quest for scientific legitimacy. 2020 was the year of the emergence of scientific expert brands such as Dr. Barbara Sturm. From sustainability to eco celebration The recent sanitary crisis led to an acceleration of the expectation of consumers for purpose-driven and sustainable solutions. Mc Kinsey mentions ""sustainability first”, while 57% of consumers in Germany and the UK declared, ""they had made significant changes to their lifestyles to lessen their environmental impact."" From zero-waste dining restaurants, zero-waste design, second-hand fashion or trashion (fashion with trash), innovation with eco-friendly solutions have accelerated, pushing brands to rethink packaging, product-delivery system, and delivery. New refill solutions (ex Unilever, Clarins Eco-Bar, Shiseido) have propelled the concept of zero waste beyond Indie. In the USA, Clean retailer Credo has sped up their Clean 2.O philosophy prioritizing sustainability and a ban on in store single-use packaging. From lockdown beauty to unleashing freedom Lockdowns have transformed homes into safe life-spaces and wellness sanctuaries. This ""home-hubbing"" behavior created new needs, like self-care, intimate skincare, or the quest for minimalism. Lockdown was also an opportunity to self-experiment. Makeup became a powerful tool to fight boredom and fuel personal creativity. From maximalist nudes to extreme color payoffs, ""lockdown looks"", we witnessed the rise of highly creative looks shared on social media. Some 46% of women and 41% of men said they’ve spent more time on social media during the pandemic (Business.com). Instagram story, Tik Tok, and Twitch thus became the perfect platforms to boost self-expression, fight boredom, and seek inspiration. These platforms privilege movement, fun, freedom, far away from the lavish looks of Instagram and the hybridization of the virtual and real world. Shining example: the collaboration Travis Scott x Byredo gave birth to the Space Rage perfume, which encapsulates the essence of space to fly from home. The virtual gathering also increased to connect meaningfully, express creativity, and feel alive. Beauty brands surfed the trend: Morphe collaborated with the d’Amelio sisters on TikTok, and ELF created ASMR-like videos for their new Mint Collection. New into cosmetics market, Twitch might also impact the make-up market… The Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation, Consulting and forecasting agency, specialist of the beauty world, just launched its latest Inspiration Makeup USA trend book.

US consumers urgently demand wider diversity in haircare products,"Haircare brands need to make 2021 the year they step up and meet the untapped needs of those with non-straight textured hair. According to Mintel, the majority (56%) of US adults do not have straight hair texture, and when it comes to products available for consumers with wavy, curly, or coily textured hair, options are limited. “Hair diversity needs to be a key focus for haircare brands in 2021. Despite the presence of Black-owned haircare brands targeting those with coily or curly hair, bigger brands have been slow to create products for this market and face difficulties with authenticity perceptions. Just as in skincare and color cosmetics, consumers are demanding a wider variety of haircare products for different hair textures,” said Andrew McDougall, Global Beauty & Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Consumers have even stronger expectations as they do not feel confident with their hair skills. Most of them think they lack the advanced skills needed to recreate certain hair styles as well as a professional stylist. For instance, 68% of Black Americans describe their skill level at using hair products as “basic” or “intermediate”. This compares to less than half (46%) who feel confident about their skills. According to Mintel, there is an opportunity for brands to help bridge the gap between skill and confidence when it comes to creating the right look. “For many, hair is more than just a style statement, it is a key part of their identity. Brands need to recognize the specific needs of consumers with, for example, curly or Afro-textured hair and validate the motivation behind the look. In turn, they will become a trusted source to help consumers achieve their desired look,” continued Andrew McDougall. During the pandemic, increased interest in overall wellbeing has led many consumers paying closer attention to their hair health as they opt for natural hairstyles and the products that support them. Indeed, one in three (34%) Brazilian women describe their current hairstyle as “natural,” i.e. without coloring or treatment, while almost nine in 10 (88%) Black American women think health is the ultimate beauty accessory. But more needs to be done here; curly- and coily-textured hair is very fragile and 58% of Black American women agree that not everyone can wear natural hairstyles as a result. “One opportunity brands can act on now to help those with wavy or curly hair embrace a natural look is to stop the narrative that curly hair presents a problem. There are still issues around the stereotype that curly textures are ‘difficult.’ And while some brands are beginning to challenge this, more needs to be done to relieve the pressure women feel to constantly control their hair,” concluded Andrew McDougall."
At home hair dyeing: A first for one in three US women during quarantine,"""With so many people turning to at-home hair color during the shutdown, we wanted to ensure they had somewhere to turn for help. We utilized our social channels to share tutorial content as well as details of Garnier’s various educational tools, such as our Virtual Shade Selector. We want to continue to be a resource and provide info wherever someone may be searching for it,"" says Greg Hui, Senior Vice President of Marketing for Garnier USA. According to research, the average American woman feels that she has aged almost four years over the course of 2020 due to stress from the pandemic. This added stress manifested itself in many ways, including the appearance of new gray hair. – Nearly half of the women polled (42%) reported discovering new gray hair during quarantine.
– With more than half of women (52.32%) agreeing that they have gone gray faster during quarantine than they would have otherwise.
Half of the women surveyed (50.37%) reported that they dyed their hair during quarantine to cover up grays. Why and how women chose to color their hair at home during quarantine varied. – Respondents reported various reasons for coloring their hair at home during quarantine, including grown out roots (17.86%) and color fade (15.36%), One in five women also reported that they colored their hair during quarantine for some needed change.
– Four out of five women dyed their hair themselves for the first-time during quarantine (80%).
– Women turned to various sources to learn how to color their hair at home for the first time, including Instagram (30.49%), online websites (29.2%), and YouTube (23.5%). With quarantine lasting longer than many expected, women had to do their best to determine when and how often to color their hair at home.
– Since the start of quarantine, more than half (88%) of women say they have dyed their hair at home multiple times (more than once).
– Women were eager to maintain their color early into quarantine, with one in three women (31%) first dying their hair at home between 3 and 4 weeks at home, about a quarter (25.04%) first dying at 5 to 6 weeks in, and one-fifth (19.08%) of women holding out until 7 and 8 weeks. Oftentimes, the most difficult part of coloring hair at home is determining the right product. – Women used their time at home to try new products and shades they might not have otherwise. Nearly half of respondents (42.7%) reported trying a new brand of at-home hair dye than they have used before, and about a third of women (37.2%) reported that they tried a color that they might not have otherwise because they were at home.
– Various factors are considered when deciding on what brand of hair color to use at home. First and foremost, nearly half of women considered the price and value of the brand (48.9%) followed by how long the color would last (44.5%). Next, about a third of women looked for brands with a large range in color options (39.5%), brands that would not damage their hair (36.4%), how available and easy it would be to get the product (34.6%) and the level of chemicals found in the formula (33.7%).
– Women shared concerns about coloring hair at home for the first time. Nearly half of women shared concerns about if the end results would be as desired (47.8%) and if they were selecting the right shade (42.7%), while a third of women (33.6%) were concerned about damaging their hair. Quarantine has proven to be a time for experimentation among women as well, especially when it came to their hair color. 
– During quarantine, a quarter of women (25.54%) reported using a color care mask, and another quarter of women (24.44%) tried at-home hair color for the first time. About one-third of women reported dying their hair with bleach or going blonde.
– Some experimented a bit more with daring shades. More than half (54.55%) of women who dyed their hair during quarantine decided to try a new, bold shade for the first time.
– Respondents found inspiration from a number of people and places, including social media (30.4%) and celebrities (40.83%), while others (42.18%) reported utilizing the opportunity to try something new since they did not need to leave the house. 
– This unexpected opportunity to go bold may have even inspired some women to stick to their new, bold shades, with two-thirds (62.45%) of respondents reporting they would be likely to turn to a bold color again next year. With many women coloring their hair for the first time or reaching for shades outside of their typical choices during quarantine, it will be interesting to see how hair color behavior continues to shift once life returns to ""normal"" after quarantine.
– Most respondents plan to keep their hair color more traditional shades, such as brown (25.27%), black (20.65%), blonde (10.98%), and red (8.76%).
– More than two-thirds (66.75%) of women plan to continue to dye their hair at home, with one in three (31.99%) planning to exclusively color their hair at home."
Growth in natural personal care products market continues despite the pandemic,"Initially stemming from Europe and North America, consumer demand for natural and organic products has spread to every continent. The highest growth in the last decade has been in Asia, notes Ecovia Intelligence in the second edition of their report on The Global Market for Natural & Organic Personal Care Products [1]. Many Asian brands are launching natural and organic products to meet growing consumer appetite for ‘clean beauty’ products. China is now the largest market in Asia for this segment, in spite of it being boycotted by many ethical brands, due to the almost compulsory need for animal tests to import cosmetic products in the country. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the North American market the most, finds Ecovia Intelligence. Emergency measures introduced during lockdowns has led to the temporary closure of department stores, beauty retailers, as well as salons and spas. Such outlets generate over a third of natural and organic personal care product sales in the US and Canada. However, Natural food shops like Whole Foods Market and Natural Grocers generate most sales. The European market has also been adversely affected by the pandemic. Although many retailers and professional outlets have been temporarily closed during the pandemic, there has been an increase from specialist retailers, drugstores and pharmacies, and online retailers. The largest market remains Germany where natural and organic products now have 10 percent market share. Ecovia Intelligence finds the adoption rate of standards varies between regions. There are now over 30 standards for natural and organic personal care products. The highest number, as well as adoption rates, is in Europe. “Over 70% of natural and organic personal care products are certified in Germany and France. COSMOS and Natrue are the most popular standards,” says the market research firm. However, the adoption rates of standards are increasing in almost every region as they provide assurance to consumers that products do not contain contentious chemicals. In North America, sustainability schemes like Non-GMO Project are also gaining popularity."

 The year has been tough for all kinds of industries, not just beauty, but searches for cosmetics have been down across the board. However, there are still some companies which have seen interest on the up in the last quarter and not only hygiene and health related names! PÜR Cosmetics saw an increase of 337.9% - the biggest spike in searches throughout Q3, while Kitsch, who are best known for their designer hair products, saw interest grow by more than double. Merci Handy, who had the biggest increase in popularity in the last edition of the index, is still benefitting from the current situation. Their colourful hand gels made using clean ingredients, have understandably been in high demand over the last couple of months. Huda Beauty remains by far the most followed beauty brand on Instagram. At the latest count, the brand had over 47.9 million followers, steadily closing in on the 50 million mark after adding around 4 million new followers since the last edition of the index. Once again, they’re followed by Kylie Cosmetics (24.8 million) and M·A·C Cosmetics (23.4 million). Huda Beauty also takes the crown when it comes to the highest number of hashtag mentions on Instagram, with over 27 million people posting about Huda and her products. That’s an increase of about 2 million from quarter 1. Anastasia Beverly Hills and M·A·C Cosmetics are ranked 2nd and 3rd, respectively. Read the full report: Cosmetify Index Q3 2020"
Pandemic lockdown fuels plastic surgery boom in Brazil,"Regiane de Oliveira Sousa, a 38-year-old sales representative from São Paulo, has used her stint of working from home to improve her personal beauty. Over the past six months she has had time to get cosmetic skin peels, breast reduction surgery, liposuction to remove unwanted fat, and facial harmonization treatment. ""Friends of mine have also taken advantage of teleworking to do these surgeries,"" she told AFP. ""When we stay at home, we have more time to look at ourselves in the mirror, because we no longer have this hectic life, where we move around constantly,"" said de Oliveira Sousa, who is about to receive a lip-plumping acid injection at a clinic in an upscale São Paulo neighborhood. Cost of the procedure: 3,800 reais (around $730), or almost four times the monthly minimum wage in Brazil. Her surgeon, Cintia Rios, said there has been a significant increase in cosmetic operations this year, about 40 percent more compared to what was done before the pandemic. ""I had to lengthen my work hours and I hired three employees. Beauty is not in crisis, thank God!"" According to Rios, otoplasties - cosmetic ear surgeries - are also popular because people feel that wearing a face mask makes their ears stick out. Usually such surgery is for children around the ages of eight or nine, ""but this year, many adults are doing it."" Lips are also important, adds de Oliveira Sousa, ""because during telework videoconferences we see each other permanently on the screen."" Rios’s clinic was forced to close from March to May due to strict lockdown measures to control the spread of the coronavirus. Today, however, business at the clinic is booming. ""We had the impression that it was the end of the world,"" said orthodontist Thiago Aragaki, referring to the lockdown period. Aside from his dental work he performs simple cosmetic procedures, such as botox injections to eliminate wrinkles, at his office in a working class neighborhood east of São Paulo. ""We reopened in June, with all the necessary precautions. Some patients have stopped coming, but we’ve had new requests,"" especially for lip augmentation injections, he said. That’s exactly what Rita Monteiro Meireles, 34, came to his office to do. She sees the confinement as a chance to use her savings to carry out cosmetic surgery enhancements that she has dreamed of since her divorce three years ago. ""I didn’t like my face, and after getting a bichectomy (surgery to remove cheek fat) I was the happiest person in the world,"" she said. Monteiro Meireles smiled as she looked at her new face in a handheld mirror, her lips still swollen after the botox injection. Plastic surgery may serve as a palliative during times of anxiety and uncertainty, said Henriette Morato, a psychologist at the University of Sao Paulo. ""It’s a way of demonstrating more control over your own life, to change what is still possible,"" she said. Even though some cosmetic surgery clinics have seen demand for their services increase, ""not everything is rose colored,"" said Denis Calazans, head of the Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgeons - especially because of the multi-week lockdown earlier in the year. ""It’s an atypical year,"" he said. ""We should be showing figures lower than those before the pandemic"" for the entire sector, he said, even if clinics offering simple procedures have done well. Working at home and saving on money otherwise spent on travel or outings has allowed well-off Brazilians ""to invest in themselves,"" he said. Brazil is the world leader in plastic surgery procedures, with 13 percent of the global market, according to figures from the International Society of Plastic Surgery. But when all cosmetic procedures - including non-surgical procedures such as botox injections - are included, it comes in behind the United States."
Towards a return to basics for the world of beauty in 2021?,"2020 was the year beauty went natural, with makeup giving way to minimalist beauty looks. Out went foundation, lipstick and assorted highlighters, as lockdowns gave many people the chance to give their skin a break, to let it breathe, and to pamper it with self-care rituals. And it feels like there’s no going back. So, the natural beauty trend seems to be here to stay in 2021. Tendrils of neon yellow, blue, pink or orange hair was supposed to be the major incoming hair trend of the year, seen over and again on the runways of fashion’s four capitals, and adopted in advance by various models and influencers. But that was before covid-19 hit and the pandemic turned everything upside-down. When hair salons were forced to close in the springtime, people weren’t panicking about a lack of neon hair dye, but simply the prospect of facing the dreaded ""badger stripe"" of gray roots that were sure to grow back during lockdown. From Europe to the USA, people flocked to the internet to seek advice on dealing with hair at home. In fact, Google’s top trending ""beauty how-to"" searches in the US this year include ""How to cut men’s hair at home"" and ""How to color your hair at home."" With tutorials, video calls and over-the-phone appointments, hairstylists went out of their way to help as many people as possible get stuck into home coloration. But, in the end, many people ultimately decided to go with the gray. Like Helen Mirren, Isabel Marant and Demi Moore, many women chose not to rush back to the salon when lockdown ended, transforming what the collective imagination once considered a ""flaw"" into a stylish feature. After making tentative inroads for a few seasons, the trend - which is in tune with the wider ""body positive"" movement - looks like it’s here to stay. Makeup is the (beauty) segment that’s been hit the hardest by covid-19. While lipstick, in various forms and evolving textures, remained popular in many regions in 2019, this year, consumers in many countries have completely turned away from it this year. With the mask a daily reality, lipstick seems to no longer be a beauty essential, with sales plummeting by as much as 50% year on year by mid-year in the US, down 49% between August and October in the UK, and lip makeup products plunging in the spring in Japan (down 22% in March). That proved a tough blow for brands, which had gone all out on dark shades and bold brights - from raspberry pink to deep plum and browns - as well as matte textures this year. It turned out to be a total flop total that no-one saw coming, and looks set to change the game for 2021. The same goes for facial makeup. In 2020, it was supposed to be all about glow, but, in the end, everything went minimalist. The multiple layers of foundation, highlighter and powder are gone - over - as people now look for a natural, healthy kind of glow, preferring to take care of their skin rather than try to hide imperfections. And with covid-19 putting us all in face masks, facial and lip makeup took a backseat while eyes moved center stage as the focus of attention. So while 2020 was supposed to big up bushy brows, women ultimately opted for perfectly groomed lines — a surprise trend that became (virtually) inevitable when face masks were made mandatory in public places in many global locations. Anti-pollution, anti-waste and natural personal care products were destined to be big news in 2020, according to the various predictions of industry players and search platforms. And, as it happens, they weren’t entirely wrong. In terms of skincare, solid, natural, vegan and organic products gained further popularity this year. But in terms of trends, these were outstripped by maskne. Maskne (or mascne) - aka mask acne - burst onto the beauty scene in 2020 as a new term to describe the irritation, spots and other blemishes caused by wearing face masks. Without the global public health crisis, products for treating acne wouldn’t have had such a bumper year. Internet searches about ""maskne"" saw a huge surge in June, up by as much as 811% and interest in premium solutions, including tools, among men and women has been registered in the US, India, France and other countries. And while maskne should logically disappear with the disappearance of face masks — unless we’re destined to spend the rest of our lives hidden away behind facial protection — this perceived need to take care of our skin has nevertheless given rise to another new trend, dubbed ""skip-care."" Straight from South Korea, ""skip-care"" is all about ""skinimalism,"" stripping back beauty routines to the bare essentials to avoid endless layers of product. Put simply, it comes down to doing things better, differently and with less, letting skin breathe and getting back in touch with a more natural, more authentic kind of beauty. Probably one of the key beauty mantras as we head into 2021."
TikTok fuels Gen Z appetite for miracle beauty products and fragrance dupes,"While makeup has waned for many during the pandemic, “miracle products” - must-have beauty products that promise to zap wrinkles and blemishes in an instant - have been buzzing on TikTok, stirring up a real appetite for these seemingly ""revolutionary"" formulations. The Cicapair skincare line from Dr.Jart+ proved a particular hit this year. Certain products in the line promise to even out skin tone and immediately reduce inflammation and redness. These products, in particular, have been popular with Gen Z, with videos on the subject flourishing this year. Stylight confirms that clicks for the Dr.Jart+ brand grew over 1,000% in November on the platform, while Google searches for the terms ""Dr.Jart+ Cicapair"" were up 809% over the last two weeks of October. Other miracle products proving a hit with young people include the Revlon Pro Collection Salon One-Step hairdryer and volumizer, with Google search interest up 170% over the course of November 2020, and Gisou Hair Oil (+300% Google search interest over November 2020). Why buy a US$300 fragrance when you can pick up a dupe [1] for a fraction of the price? That’s another key trend on Tiktok, where users share tips and tricks for finding low-cost scents that smell just like big-name fragrances. The Baccarat Rouge 540 fragrance from Maison Francis Kurkdjian, for instance, has been a hit on the web, with Google Trends reporting a 100% increase in searches over the course of November. But, according to Stylight, TikTok users discovered that the Cloud by Ariana Grande scent smells very similar, driving keen interest in the American singer’s considerably cheaper fragrance, with Google search interest growing 213% over the course of November. In terms of skincare, TikTok users looked to natural ingredients, simplicity and cruelty-free formulations with enthusiasm for the brands CeraVe (1,000% more clicks for CeraVe products on Stylight in November 2020 vs 2019), The Ordinary (+407%) and Paula’s Choice (+100%). The Stylight report is based on the platform’s internal data collected from the 12 million monthly users across its international platforms. Clicks on different brands & product categories, over the period from November 1 to November 30, 2020, were analyzed and compared the results to the same period in 2019. Whenever the selected timeframe of analysis may refer to another period, or the data may originate from an external source, it was duly referenced in the body of the report."
France: Prestige fragrances prove more resilient to the crisis than makeup,"Sales of prestige fragrances were less impacted by the closure of beauty salons, perfumeries, and department stores than sales of prestige skincare and makeup, reports The NPD Group. With a turnover of 1.21 billion euros between January and the end of October 2020, the prestige fragrance market recorded a drop of 18% in value in France compared to the same period in 2019. A significant drop but lower than that of the overall prestige beauty market (-22%). Despite two compulsory lockdowns, French women did not give up their favourite fragrances as much as one might fear. However, prestige make-up and skin and body care products showed less resilience. According to The NPD Group, online stores have clearly driven sales in the fragrance category, this channel representing 13% of overall sales made between January and the end of October (compared to 7% in 2019). Over the first ten months of the year, online sales of high-end fragrances climbed 41%, a much stronger performance than the overall online prestige beauty market (+34%). Furthermore, online sales of have accelerated their growth at the end of the first lockdown. From August to October 2020, they grew by 46% in value, confirming increased consumer confidence when it is about to buy their favourite scent online. Perfume gift sets were particularly popular with the French with sales increasing by 98% compared to the same period a year earlier. “During the recent months, brands and retailers have demonstrated their ability to adapt very fast and with agility by offering new ways to test perfumes at home and by developing online or phone advice, click-and-collect and live streaming solutions. Consumers are discovering new ways to shop, their habits are changing and we anticipate good performance in online sales during the 2020 holiday season, a trend that will continue in 2021,” comments Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. Despite new services and the implementation of stringent sanitary measures, sales in brick-and-mortar stores were strongly impacted between August and October 2020, with a drop in sales of -9% compared to the same period in 2019."
Virtual stores: a relevant solution between physical and digital shopping,"A few days before the November lockdown in France, Clarins launched a first virtual store before spreading the concept across Asia and in Dubai. In just a few clicks, web users are immersed in the brand’s world, surfing as they wish, just like they would in a physical store. “With virtual stores, it is possible to create experiences much more focused on strolling and discovery than standard e-shop product displays. Users rediscover the pleasure of walking around, and there is a form of sensoriality, with a notion of volumes, textures, and materials. In addition, you get to be more active and satisfy your curiosity as you discover the store’s different departments, just like in a shop,” says Laure Braive, an independent consultant specialized in customer experience and marketing content. Just like with the brand’s new flagship store in Neuilly-sur-Seine, west of Paris, the objective is indeed to highlight proximity by creating tailor-made user-friendly spaces. Clarins learnt from the pop-up store in which they invited customers to share expectations for this future store and new merchandising. Deploying this new concept in the virtual store before physical stores is also an opportunity to test it. One can discover the Skin Atelier, get informed about the ingredients used in Clarins formulas, by clicking on the plant wall, get a beauty consultation, test a lipstick in augmented reality, or purchase one of the brand’s iconic products by directly connecting on the e-shop. Parfums Christian Dior has adopted the same concept with a virtual visit of the Champs-Élysées store, plus an access to product descriptions, links to the e-shop, and video content. “For brands in general, it is also a way to make their world accessible to all. For Dior, it makes it possible for customers who could not visit it to discover the Parisian flagship store. Plus, it is a way to leave room for messages which cannot not always be passed on through physical retail, usually due to space efficiency issues, sustainable commitments, or the brand’s heritage,” adds Laure Braive. As regards personalization, the strategy adopted by Charlotte Tilbury is a reference: a large virtual discovery space in line with the brand’s world, multiple meeting points where users can walk around, a welcoming message by the creator, which make the experience more human, makeup tests in augmented reality, and shopping directly on the website, without having to get on the e-shop. “It more or less combines the best of the two worlds. Given the current situation, it is a concept that will definitely develop. It is in line with the whole virtual shopping renewal dynamics, which, through digital technologies, is aimed to get customers increasingly involved. Other trends are emerging, like Live Video Shopping, or one-to-one appointments on the phone or via videoconference. All these dimensions are reinventing e-commerce.” Charlotte Tilbury recently launched a video consultation campaign with the brand’s makeup artists and consumers. In November, Clarins offered several consultation solutions by phone, for 15 or 20 minutes, with a personal shopper or a beauty coach. The pre-determined themes, “A beautiful skin, even with a mask”, or “It’s all about my eyes”, and many others, resulted in free, personalized exchanges to guide customers and give them advice. “It is really differentiating to mix virtual stores with personalized services. When you go shopping in a physical store, you also expect experts to give you advice. This is what remains to be developed in this concept,” concludes Laure Braive."
Skinimalism and cocooning are going to be the biggest beauty trends in 2021,"Forget heavy foundation, contouring and other layers of product building up on the face: beauty in 2021 will be all about minimalism. It’s basically a continuation of 2020, but without the constraints and the forced nature of this year’s trends - i.e., face masks and lockdowns - or at least, we hope. Men and women look set to embrace the latest ""skip-care"" trend from South Korea, which involves limiting beauty routines to just a handful of products. It’s simply about doing things better, differently and with less - letting skin breathe and returning to a more natural kind of beauty. This is one of the key trends of 2021 outlined in the annual Pinterest Predicts report, published Friday, December 11 by the image-based social media network. It reveals how web searches are now focusing on products and techniques that give a natural glow without going overboard. Year-on-year, searches for ""glowing skin how to get naturally"" have quadrupled, as have searches for ""face yoga exercises."" Web users have also been searching for ""homemade skin care"" (+110%) and for ""aloe vera face mask"" (+115%). The covid-19 pandemic - and especially the related lockdowns - has allowed many people to try out simple things entirely for their own personal well-being. And that’s a trend that’s set to continue in 2021, according to Pinterest. Bathing rituals, in particular, are having a moment as the new stay-at-home spa days, with an uptick in searches for ""spiritual cleansing bath"" (+180%), ""full moon bath ritual"" (+90%), not to mention ""bath tea recipe"" (+60%). The same goes for fashion, where cozy, protective, comfortable clothing looks set to ride high above more sophisticated designs. Year-on-year, searches for ""quilted clothes"" have quadrupled, while searches for ""cozy aesthetic outfits"" and ""home dress women"" have both doubled. Searches for ""cocoon sweater"" are also on the up (+155%), as well as ""fluffy slippers"" (+90%). Here too, the pandemic seems to have shaken up people’s habits completely, with potentially long-term effects. Despite going back to basics and focusing on natural beauty, people could be tempted to add a bold touch to their day-to-day looks after such a morose year. In the beauty world, that could pave the way for bright colors and motifs on body parts like nails and eyes. According to Pinterest, searches for ""indie nails"" were up 21 times year-on-year, while ""smiley face nails"" were up nine times and ""butterfly eye makeup"" was up six times. It looks like brows are also going bold with standout styles like goth eyebrows (+120%) and bleached brows (+160%) proving popular. The Pinterest Predicts 2021 report is based on Pinterest internal data on global searches, comparing searches carried out between October 2018 and September 2019 to searches carried out between October 2019 and September 2020."
How did the Covid-19 pandemic change the Asia-Pacific beauty marketplace?,"The recently published Mintel’s annual Asia Pacific: Beauty and Personal Landscape has focused on the evolution of consumer trends in the region and market opportunities for brands. “The beauty and personal care industry in Asia Pacific has taken a hard hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumer attitudes and behaviours have shifted as a result and the industry has faced unprecedented challenges, but also opportunities. Innovation is also flourishing in the sector,” said Angelia Teo, Research Manager, Mintel Beauty & Personal Care, Asia Pacific. Key highlights of the annual report include: Growing consumer interest in sustainability and health The outbreak of COVID-19 has further heightened consumers’ awareness of sustainability and health. According to Mintel’s Global COVID-19 Tracker, 87% of Indian consumers have indicated that environmental issues have become a higher or lower priority for them– second only to eating healthily. Meanwhile, Mintel Global Consumer research shows that 78% of South Korean consumers would like to see more innovative environment-friendly products, and 90% of consumers in Japan think it is important to manage their emotional wellbeing. “Therefore, how to share and showcase sustainability initiatives and precisely respond to consumer’s health needs is one of the most important factors for brands to engage consumers now and in the years to come,” explained Mintel. Haircare, clean and green beauty drive innovation and new experiences Regardless of how the market changes, consumers are always ready to embrace new concepts and experience new products. China’s haircare market has maintained steady growth over the past five years with a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8%, according to Mintel research. Haircare products’ import value in the first half of the year increased 21%, compared with the same period the previous year. Interest in haircare is continuously growing among Chinese consumers, with many haircare brands taking inspiration from the skincare industry and innovating around textures and ingredients. Moreover, Mintel Global Consumer research indicates that 75% of consumers in Australia and New Zealand love trying new experiences. As competition for clean and green beauty continues to grow, especially from Western markets, ANZ beauty brands should work harder for their consumers and lean into expertise to stand out in the congested beauty market, rather than just focusing on clean or proving dermatological efficacy or safety.

"“The Travel Retail market will adjust”, David Dayan","Premium Beauty News - What can you say about the situation in travel retail? David Dayan - Before Covid, travel retail was a key driver for perfume and cosmetics luxury brands. This sector achieved two-digit growths for ten years and brands worked hard to be present in airports. Due to the sharp decline of air traffic, airport shops have lost between 75% and 85% of their turnover on average. I am still positive, I am sure we will recover: there are actually a few encouraging signs. But I think it will take five to ten years to reach the same results as in 2019. Our business segment is definitely capable of reacting increasingly faster when it comes to finding solutions and alternatives. We need to adjust. Premium Beauty News - How? David Dayan - We implemented solutions as soon as February 2020, such as the click&collect and call&collect options. Travellers can check on the Internet whether a product is available in our duty free stores, at the airport or in border shops in their destination countries. They only need to make an order on the phone or online. Then, before they fly or pass the border, they collect their shopping, which has been prepared and kept safe, and of course, they benefit from tax-free prices. We are also working with a few African governments to create specific collection points for duty free shopping upon arrival. Premium Beauty News - What is at stake in terms of sales? David Dayan - There are about ten operators around the world, the most well-known being Dufry, Heinemann and Lagardère, to name just a few. In airports, they take care of everything that is called “non-air” and purchase concessions over several years. Then, these concessions are turned into stores or restaurants. As an example, in Paris, in 2018, “non-air” revenues were higher than air revenues. Asians were quick to understand the craze for duty free shopping in these stores. The Beijing airport spreads across 300,000 m2, including a 200,000 m2 area occupied by stores and restaurants. Likewise, governments have understood it is profitable to open downtown duty free stores for tourists. To give you a concrete example, a month ago, during the Golden Week on the duty free island of Sanya, in southern China, travellers bought for more than 1.2 billion USD in this type of store! How come? First, there are no taxes. Secondly, consumers are sure the product is authentic – there are many counterfeit products on these markets. Then, foreign currencies are used. And lastly, with Travel Retail Exclusives, there are products or offers you can only find in airports or downtown duty free stores. Of course, the same goes for Africa. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how big is the Duty Free market in Africa? David Dayan - Over the past ten years, many African countries have managed to develop and highlight their own specificities to attract tourists. Rwanda is an eco-destination, Tanzania and Mozambique focused on safaris, and Western Africa chose seaside tourism. The most prominent airlines started signing agreements with these countries, like Emirates Airlines, which now serves over 60 countries in Africa. Many African airports are equivalent to European airports in terms of infrastructures and service quality. They are often the most beautiful places to buy luxury products. Between 2018 and 2020, about 15 new airports were opened in Africa. Three quarters of them were built by Chinese companies, which triggered a flow of Asian tourists, whose share rose from 12% to 18% in ten years.

Could smart mirrors transform the post-pandemic shopping experience?,"While Japanese manufacturer AGC recently introduced a smart mirror that can help users try out makeup virtually while also getting expert advice from beauty pros, will these tools will these tools become more common in beauty shops in the wake of new hygiene requirements linked to the Covid-19 pandemic? When implemented in an outlet, this kind of innovation allows virtual product testing and could help limit physical contact while renewing the shopping experience. In the age of social distancing, brands and manufacturers of all kinds have been getting creative to develop tools that bring the services customers used to enjoy in stores into people’s homes. As a result, the beauty world has flourished with a host of applications dedicated entirely to hair colouring or virtual makeup, offering a helping hand to those who haven’t been able to test products in real life during covid-19 lockdowns. Beyond makeup and skincare, new digital solutions are also making their way in the world of perfumes. The Multiscent20 solution from the Brazilian start-up Noar, for instance, has been implemented by Natura in their new phygital concept store in São Paulo and is now marketed worldwide by Orlandi. Whether it’s Meitu’s Magic Mirror or the YouCam virtual reality solutions developed by Perfect Corp, virtual testing is already well established in the makeup world. Now, the Japanese manufacturer AGC is going even further with a new smart mirror that could be used to transform the shopping experience in department stores or standalone beauty stores. The device, called Mirroria, uses artificial intelligence to bring users virtual advice from beauty pros. It takes the form of a classic mirror placed on top of a built-in monitor, using an optical technology to create a mirror that doesn’t require metal film. This is what makes Mirroria different from other smart mirrors, an AGC official told Nikkei Asia, and this apparently improves image sharpness both on the mirror and on the screen. When used with specific applications, the mirror also lets users try out all kinds of makeup to see the results virtually before making a purchase. According to the Japanese business publication, this innovation - designed to limit face-to-face contact with in-store beauty advisors in pandemic times - is expected to go on sale from the first half of 2021. The market for smart mirrors is currently booming and is expected to achieve a compound annual growth rate of between 12% and 14% by 2025, according to several analysts. In any case, these devices look set to soon join the wealth of beauty innovations available in stores, especially since their potential field of application is very wide. Based on the innovations presented at the latest CES in Las Vegas, in 2019 and 2020, as well as makeup, smart mirrors could be used to help customers make choices on hair colors, contact lenses, or even tattoos."
Top six beauty trends spotted at Cosmoprof Asia Digital Week,"With more time spent at home, consumers are indulging in, and mastering, beauty treatments enhanced by the latest augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including devices complemented by virtual consultations and personalised data. The A.I. Vibration Therapy by Waveon (South Korea) features AI-enabled vibration massage with multi-functions to deliver moisture and nutrients deep into the skin. Users can carry out their entire skin care routine with it, from cleansing to prepping the skin, reducing pore size and preventing moisture loss. Meanwhile, the AR Beauty Mirror Solution by Frontis (South Korea) allows consumers to consult for skin problems and obtain recommendations on skincare products via skin analysis, AR and AI chatbot; while the Laser Hair Growth Comb by Zhongshan Cenci Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (China) uses high frequency vibration to massage the scalp and infrared light to promote hair growth. Many products claim ingredients and products unique to particular regions and bearing certifications attesting to their authenticity, in support of local economies and celebrating uniqueness globally. The Waphyto Regena Toner by St. Louis International, Inc. (Japan) is a rich moisturising lotion made from five natural ingredients, namely mulberry, Japanese calendula, gotu kola, mugwort and horsetail, grown in the Mikawa region in Central Japan. Meanwhile, the Luxom collection by OMECS Cosmetic & Surgery (Italy) revitalises and purifies the skin, thanks to its hero ingredient, the Sicilian saffron flower. KH Bio Gentle Shampoo by SOCO (Italy) contains pomegranate centrifugate rich in vitamins, polyphenols and antioxidants for hello to silky smooth hair. Physio Natura Perse - Breast Emulgel by PDT Cosmetici (Italy)  is designed to improve breast tone and volume with a formula that contains hexapeptide-38, cyclodextrins, and African Kigella extract which protects capillaries, improves microcirculation and prevents skin sagging. This year, brands are taking hygiene to the next level of sophistication through innovative products that do more than simply banishing germs. They include self-cleaning packaging and multitasking products such as gels, mists, lotions and nail polish that nourish the skin while guarding against germs. The UVC Disinfection Case by Belle Cosmic Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Hong Kong SAR, China) is a portable, UV disinfecting case that kills 99 percent of bacteria, viruses, and mould on items that are placed inside it. The case provides an ideal way to sterilize objects while travelling as no chemicals, liquid or heat are needed. Another illustration of the trend is the Sanitizing Hand Cream by Farmaceutici Dott. Ciccarelli (Italy) that prevents skin dryness, redness and chapping due to frequent use of alcohol-based products by nourishing and protecting the skin barrier. In addition, the product contains tea tree oil which is known for its antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. Eventually, the Wellfare Hand Serum Moisturizing & Sanitizing by Universal Beauty Products (Italy) is a hand serum that nourishes the skin while delivering purifying and sanitizing benefits. Thanks to Active Oxygen in its formula, the serum is as potent as a hand gel that delivers 70 percent alcohol. New discoveries and advancement in science has made possible the creation of novel skincare and cosmetic products with enhanced absorption, efficacy and safety, as well as multiple functions. For example, the Lyophilized Double Effect Eye Mask by Changzhou Weibo Hi-Tech Biotechnology Co., Ltd (China) is created using the isol® cream freeze-drying technology which promotes transdermal absorption and potency of ingredients. Meanwhile, the W.Skin Laboratory A.M. (Anti-Melasma) Cream by J&J Company (South Korea) is a multi-cream that addresses freckles, wrinkles, pigment, skin tone, and dark circles. The product has undergone 10 different clinical testing and contains EWG green level ingredients. Face-lifting device Homethera by Attibe Beauty Co., Ltd (South Korea) features high- intensity focused ultrasound technology that promotes skin regeneration through stimulating collagen and elastin production, enabling professional face treatments to be experienced at home. Powerhouse ingredients from nature are satisfying the demand for efficacious, environmentally friendly, plant-based formulas that enhances health and boost immunity. For instance, Green For Skin by Floslek Cosmetic Laboratory (Poland) is a line of eco-friendly cosmetics with replaceable refills that are 100 percent recyclable. This vegan skincare line contains a variety of vegetables including parsley extract, cucumber extract, celery seed extract and pea extract to provide deep hydration to the skin and render it naturally beautiful. The ION Intensive Reducer Set by 01Skin Digital (Spain) features iontophoresis technology patches that are patented worldwide, and a nutricosmetic shot containing natural ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, Centella Asiatica, green coffee and horsetail. The iontophoresis technology enables the ingredients to penetrate into the deepest layers of the skin where fat is localized. According to the company, clinical studies demonstrate that cellulite can be reduced by 80 percent over the course of two months. Skincare gems under this section are the Superfood For Skin Pink Vera Soothing Cream by Farmskin Inc. (South Korea), which moisturises, and soothes irritated skin; Truly Nourishing Ginseng With Honey by Back At One (South Korea), which helps to restore skin radiance and clarity; Anti-Age Elixir Restorative Night Serum Bakuchiol & Avocado by OnlyBio.life (Poland), which accelerates skin repair and increases skin firmness; and The Youth Lift Express Mask by Pollen Botanicals (Australia), which lifts the skin and smooths out fine lines in only 10 minutes thanks to its content of hyaluronic acid, bentonite clay and organic herbal extracts. The use of face masks has dramatically impacted beauty routines leading to the development of transfer-resistant colour cosmetics and specially formulated skin care products that address mask irritation. The Art Complexion No Transfer Wet Compact Foundation by B.Kolormakeup & Skincare is a new-generation hybrid powder made with a clean, vegan formulation that achieves zero transfer when used wet, while providing optimal adhesion, lightness and long- lastingness. Its hybrid technology delivers a bouncy consistency and velvety touch to the skin. Enriched with hyaluronic acid microspheres, Art Cosmetics (Italy)’s Lady Vain No- Transfer LS is a long-lasting and no-transfer blurring matte lipstick that creates a soft focus and a faded make-up effect. An external lab test showed that the product does not fade or release its colours on masks.

"Online beauty purchases are appealing, under certain conditions","This survey was conducted among 2,000 British and American consumers aged between 16 and 35 [1], generations Y and Z indeed. The report shows that 44% of respondents bought more beauty and skincare products online than in store over the past six months, compared to the pre-lockdown period. However, 56% of total consumers (62% of female respondents) acknowledged turning to familiar products and brands rather than trying new ones when buying online. ""In an industry that prides itself on face-to-face interactions - from personalized consultations to in-store product sampling - the shift to digital experiences could signal growth challenges for Beauty and Skincare brands,"" write the authors of the report. Indeed, before choosing the perfect shade for their skin tone, buying the cream that best suits their needs, or making sure that a serum is effective, consumers look for more guarantee and advice and need reassurance. The e-commerce shopping experience totally is different from the in-store experience. The report shows that a vast majority of consumers (74%) are more likely to buy online when the website includes customer reviews, which is often the case. Female buyers are even more likely to consult customer opinions (80%) than men. When physical stores closed due to pandemic restrictions, brands and retailers therefore have had to be even more inventive, to make their e-shops more attractive and allow consumers to shop with confidence. There are many factors that can convince internet users to click buy. For instance, receiving free samples of the product to try before purchasing it motivates 72% of respondents; 66% of those surveyed are likely to buy if the site personalizes product recommendations based on the client’s searches. The use of virtual reality or artificial intelligence tools that let shoppers ’try-on’ a product also encourages 45% of users surveyed. While the covid-19 pandemic encouraged consumers to go digital, it has also made consumers think about how they consume. In the past few months, many studies have shown increasing interest in sustainable and ethical products in every sector. The Nosto report shows that the words ""clean"" (68%) and ""cruelty free"" (65%) drive online sales. However, the term ""vegan"" applied to skincare spurs sales to a lesser extent (41%)."
"In 2020, beauty is more digital, more hygiene-focused and at home","""While some of the more extreme limitations on everyday life seen in 2020 may be rare occurrences going forward, there is no doubt that many aspects of consumer behaviour have shifted for the long-term,"" writes Lisa Holmes, Global Consumer Insights Expert at Euromonitor, in the market research firm’s Beauty Survey 2020 report. Euromonitor sums up the shifts into three key trends: the rise of online beauty among consumers’ habits, the importance of personal hygiene, especially for hand hygiene, and the rise of the time dedicated to at-home treatments and indulgences. 2020 has been characterised by a rapid shift to online shopping.  According to findings from Euromonitor’s annual beauty survey - fielded in June and July 2020 - 34% of consumers can now be considered “digital beauty” shoppers, meaning that they purchase hair, skin or colour cosmetic products through online retailers and are influenced by digital media, online user-generated, or expert-generated content when shopping for or using beauty and personal care products. One the main consequence of the pandemic is that beauty consumers are growing more comfortable buying skin care, hair care and cosmetics without first testing or examining them in person. E-commerce developments have also helped brands gain access to new markets, thus increasing the competition between heritage and emerging brands. Indeed, online platforms are creating a common digital shelf where global, local, private label and independent brands all compete for consumer attention and spending. While hand washing and sanitising have always played a large role in the daily hygiene habits for most consumers, these habits have been magnified in 2020. Euromonitor’s beauty survey findings show that nearly all consumers (93%) wash their hands at least twice a day and over half of them do so five or more times. Use rates vary by age group, with the youngest washing their hands less frequently. They also depend on product categories, with alcohol-based disinfectants being especially popular outside the home. Furthermore, the renewed focus on hand hygiene among global consumers fuelled increased needs for hand care products, particularly lotion and creams to heal dry or chapped skin caused by frequent washing. “For many consumers in 2020, focus has shifted from out-of-home treats such as salon visits, to ‘self-care’ activities that can be done from the comfort and safety of home,” writes Lisa Holmes. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, many factors have driven the growth of self-care at home: hair salons and beauty parlours closed, concerns about contamination risks, more time available, need to save money. “Even indulgences such as spa treatments have shifted to home environments in 2020. Self-care in the beauty and personal care space is now frequently associated with activities such as hot baths, home manicure and pedicures and self-applied face masks,” adds Holmes. Euromonitor’s data show that over half of women (55%) paint their nails monthly as a minimum, and that nearly two-thirds of women and one-third of men apply a face mask at home at least monthly. The most common types of at-home face masks are cream-based, gel and peel-offs, though sheet masks have consistently grown in popularity over the past five years. “In 2015 only 22% of face mask users turned to sheet masks, which jumped to 27% in 2017 and now stands at 35% in 2020,” highlights Holmes. Even when consumers venture back into salons and spas, at-home self-care habits will persist, forecasts Euromonitor. Indeed, many consumers now seek lower-cost and more convenient options for indulgence. Read the full report here."
"U.S. beauty market to surpass $128.7 billion by 2030, finds P&S Intelligence","According to P&S Intelligence, there were 312.3 million internet users in the U.S. in 2019 and e-commerce accounted for 16.0% of all retail sales in the nation. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, these numbers were consistently increasing. “The growing e-commerce industry bodes well for the U.S. beauty and personal care products market, as fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs), including beauty products, are some of the most-purchased commodities via online platforms,” explains P&S Intelligence. Actually, a wide variety of beauty products, including clean beauty products and hyper-personalized skincare products, is available online at reasonable rates and, sometimes, at substantial discounts. This abundant offer has helped increase their penetration in the country, according to P&S Intelligence. Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a negative impact on the market. “Sales of actual beauty products have reduced due to subdued manufacturing and supply, lower wages, and widespread unemployment,” explains the market research firm. For instance, L’Oréal has recorded 4.8% lower sales in North America during the pandemic. However, not every section in the market has reported disappointing statistics. The demand for toiletries, including soaps and sanitizers, has soared in the country, as regular washing of hands is being considered one of the best ways to protect oneself against the virus. Furthermore, as stores were closed, the sales from online channels have increased. According to P&S Intelligence, the cotinuous growth of on-line sales is one of the primary reasons the U.S. beauty and personal care products market is set to grow from $81.1 billion in 2019 to $128.7 billion in 2030, at a steady 4.8% CAGR during 2020-2030. In the coming years, the U.S. beauty and personal care products market is predicted to witness the most-rapid advance in the click & collect category, under segmentation by mode of purchase. In this mode, people pay for the products online and then collect them from a designated store. “This mode saves the time of people otherwise spent in long queues at hypermarkets,” highlights the market research firm."
"“Sustainability is the post-COVID era’s key challenge”, finds industry summit","Seventeen national beauty associations and fifteen trade organizations participated in the first Opeanstreams Global Beauty Industry Summit, hosted by the Openstreams Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to education and collaboration in the global beauty sector, created by beauty trend platform Beautystreams. Originally slated to take place at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the event included video interviews and a lived Q&A session. “By understanding the industry’s current challenges, we can better determine which key topics to focus on globally. We hope that by openly sharing ideas, perspectives, and priorities, we can create an ongoing movement towards positive change and collaboration,” said Lan Vu, founder and CEO of Beautystreams and the Openstreams Foundation. The future of retail was one of the first topic emerging from the discussions. The pandemic has dealt retail a severe blow this year, with consumers dialing back their spending across all product categories and expressing a marked preference for online shopping. Kunto Widarto, of the Indonesian beauty association PERKOSMI and senior executive at the Martha Tilaar Group, said the pandemic “basically changes everything, with a significant decrease in the overall market spending and consumption, especially for color cosmetics.” Participants discussed the substitution of in-store interaction with personalized virtual appointments, as well as brands’ development of experiential content through livestreaming, and the need to reassure shoppers by boosting safety precautions in stores. Deeply impacted by the pandemic, trade shows are also focused on further developing their digital experience. Enrico Zannini, Show Director of Cosmoprof Bologna, remarked “It is important to re-invent our activity, in order to better support the industry in a global restart. Digital tools and new technologies can be helpful to improve the experience of operators and exhibitors.” Many participants questioned the future of in-person events at a time when much of the world is masked and working remotely, while acknowledging that trade shows offer tangible benefits. “We recently conducted a survey of more than 4,000 professionals which explored the impact of COVID-19 on the exhibitions industry. More than two-thirds of respondents said that in a post-pandemic world, the face-to- face interaction that can only be had at physical shows will be just as, or more important than pre-COVID-19,” said Elaine O’Connell, Show Director at Beautyworld Middle East. Participants also highlighted the urgency surrounding sustainable industry practices, spurred by an increase in environmental activism worldwide - a trend that the pandemic has further accentuated. Consumers are rewarding businesses with a more explicitly “purpose over profit” model, while companies are working to reduce excess packaging, avoid unethical ingredients and overcome the longstanding notion that environmental-friendly products are necessarily more expensive. “Investing in sustainability in the context with which we are living can benefit the company both in terms of revenue and reputation,” said Renato Ancorotti, President of Cosmetica Italia. Carlotta Jacobson, President of CEW in the USA, noted the evolution of the clean product trend towards product safety. “When you go through a pandemic, naturally you place importance on what’s safe.” However, she emphasized the need for clear communications, “there is a lot of misinformation and a lot of women are very confused about it.” Christophe Masson, CEO of France’s Cosmetic Valley, described a nascent awareness among consumers of the relationship between cosmetics and biodiversity, which he suggested the industry should promote. Patrick O’Quin, President of FEBEA in France, agreed. “The crisis shows that we need to think differently. And thinking differently means certainly to have a broader vision of sustainability, and of biodiversity,” which has often garnered less attention than developing a circular economy or reducing humans’ carbon footprint. Indirectly related, but affecting sustainability, is how companies have changed office policy, allowing employees to work from home temporarily or permanently. “We’ve already seen, for example, just the stay-at-home orders that have taken place around the world have resulted in better air quality in many cities, and this is a reminder that our transition to a low-carbon economy could have many public health benefits, including cleaner air,” observed Francine Lamoriello, EVP Global Strategies for the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) in the United States. And on the COVID-19 crisis, Matteo Moretti, President of Polo della Cosmesi in Italy, conveyed a positive perspective, “I believe with every difficult period, there are also unique opportunities.” The success of the first Openstreams Global Beauty Summit has led organizers to cast their eyes toward a second event in 2021. “It quickly became apparent that there was a lot of desire for this kind of dialogue in the industry,” said Lan Vu. On November 25, the Openstreams Foundation will release the Openstreams Global Beauty Industry Summit Official Report 2020, a compendium of key insights from the first Summit, as well as the results of an exclusive survey of individual professionals from throughout the beauty supply chain. The report will be complimentary to all beauty industry professionals worldwide.
"
China’s biggest spending spree under close scrutiny,"The marathon spending spree has for more than a decade seen China’s army of shoppers shell out colossal amounts of cash that has dwarfed the incomes of many small nations. And this year was no exception. While ""Single’s Day"" - so-called for its annual 11.11 date - has long-been a 24-hour event, e-commerce giant Alibaba - which created the event in 2009 before being imitated by all of its competitors, including JD.com and Pinduoduo - has expanded it to an 11-day promotion beginning November 1. According to Alibaba, as of Tuesday night, the group’s platforms had already processed 372.3 billion yuan ($56.5 billion) in sales over that period, more than the GDP of Iceland, Lebanon and Georgia combined. This year’s shopping is being closely followed around the world as a guide to the state of China’s crucial consumer sector, which is increasingly more important to the future of the world’s biggest economy. To date, Alibaba has not provided a comparison with last year’s sales, while many economists hoped to read these figures as confirmation of the recovery of the Chinese economy after the shutdown suffered in beginning of the year due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Last year, ""Single’s Day"" sales on Alibaba platforms alone for the 24-hour period totalled $38.4 billion, a rise of 26% compared to the previous year. “Single’s Day originally focused on sales of certain items like beauty products and electronics,” said Melanie Sanders, Asia-Pacific head of retail for consultancy Bain & Company. “But e-commerce in China has expanded to include just about anything a consumer might purchase, including groceries, as digitally savvy Chinese opt for the convenience of online shopping. The pandemic, which has made many Chinese wary of crowds, is furthering this trend,” she said. ""We’re expecting it to be another very, very strong year, another record,"" Sanders said. ""Retail in China is largely getting back now to last year’s levels."" As the country emerges from the effects of the virus and tight lockdowns, China is expected to be the only major global economy to post positive growth this year, according to the IMF. However, the recovery in retail sales has lagged that seen in industrial sectors, but is gaining pace, analysts said. As Alibaba, JD.com, and Pinduoduo compete aggressively for Single’s Day, Chinese regulators cast a gloom over the biggest e-commerce stretch of the year by announcing draft antitrust rules that signal a looming crackdown on high-flying internet giants. The texts published on Tuesday outlined plans to prevent ""monopolistic behaviour"" among internet companies, which tend to develop captive ecosystems. Alibaba’s Taobao platform, for example, supports payments via its own Alipay rather, but not the WeChat Pay technology of rival Tencent. Chinese tech shares tumbled for a second day Wednesday. Alibaba shed more than eight percent in Hong Kong - just a week after regulators halted an enormous IPO by its Ant Group financial arm - and rival JD.com fell a similar amount."
Holistic beauty and e-commerce redefine post-COVID Asia beauty markets,"In Asia, the personal care sector has rebounded relatively quickly following the height of the pandemic. In China, before COVID-19 hit, the personal care market was forecast to grow 9% in 2020, but is now on track for a -5% decline. In South Korea, the market should shrink by -8%, compared with expected growth of 4.8%. The impact has been lower in Thailand, where the sector was expected to remain flat, but has declined by -2.1%, according to Kantar. However, according to Kantar, COVID-19 pressed ’fast forward’ on developments that were expected to take five years to unroll. Increased concerns around health have changed consumers’ expectations of beauty: they expect brands to help them feel and live better, not just look better. Priorities have shifted from fixing issues - such as erasing wrinkles - to building a strong foundation. ""Consumers want personal care products to be highly effective, and offer more sophisticated functions,"" says Ashley Kang, Head of Beauty, Kantar Worldpanel. ""Already gaining in popularity before the outbreak, derma-care products have gained further traction, and the trend is spilling over from skincare into body care and make-up. The leading country for derma is Korea, with 56% penetration."" Clean beauty has also risen in importance, with brands expected to be safe and environmentally responsible. Consumers are looking for natural, gentle and vegan ingredients. Restrictions on physical movement have forced a shift in spend from offline to online platforms. Kantar does not expects Asian consumers to move away from online channels now they’re able to visit stores again, as they’ve ’tasted’ advantages such as convenience, greater accessibility and lower prices. Offline channels remain important, however - in Thailand, offline traffic is still 19 times higher than online traffic - and this channel is recovering, albeit slowly. In markets where ecommerce is more mature, whereas shoppers once used one or two platforms for their beauty purchases, the landscape is diversifying with different platforms catering for different shopping missions. According to Kantar, the rapid development of ecommerce has given smaller brands greater reach, and helped them gain traction. These include local brands, which have excelled due to being ’ecommerce ready’, combined with their understanding of local consumers’ needs: 70% of China’s top growing cosmetics brands are domestic in origin. With the pandemic hitting incomes hard, most Asian consumers are paying more attention to getting maximum value for their personal care spend. “This doesn’t mean they’ll go for the cheapest option, however; they evaluate their choices based on benefits,” highlights Kantar. Whereas premium beauty was on the rise before coronavirus, mass and masstige brands are now growing their market share. However, despite increased price sensitivity, demand for luxury has remained strong in some markets due to the fact that “the highest income consumers have been least affected by COVID-19”."
Towards a new idea of luxury perfumes?,"The tone had been set by initiatives like Michelle Pfeiffer’s brand Henry Rose, a pioneer as regards ingredient transparency, recycled glass bottles, and cradle-to-cradle-certified formulas, and by pH Fragrance, who developed the clean perfumery concept in France. More recently, CK Everyone and My Way by Armani also left their marks on people’s minds with ethical concepts involving natural ingredients, refillable bottles, and quantified and quantifiable targets about the product’s impact. These examples show that perfumery is gradually adopting a new form of creation better in line with the market’s ecoresponsible trends. As an example, three new high-end brands are emerging this fall, and they have a common point: a global strategy for improving the environmental impact of both their juices and containers, including samples. Aemium, Nout, and Obvious have reshaped perfumery to make it match a new idea of luxury. Born from Emmanuel Roche’s motivation and the talent of two perfumers at Maison Robertet, Karine Vinchon Spehner and Serge De Oliveira, Aemium has developed a range of high-end perfumes certified natural or organic by Ecocert/Cosmos and containing over 99.9% natural ingredients. They are composed of 13% to 17% 100% natural perfume extracts made in Grasse, 74% organic wheat alcohol, some water, and vitamin E derived from French sunflower to protect formulas from oxidation. The bottles, whose elegance is inspired from old perfumery, are based on lightened glass and are refillable – and recyclable, of course. The caps are made of aluminium with no plastic insert, so they can also be recycled. Secondary cases traditionally made of cardboard filled with Cellophane were replaced with light wooden boxes derived from poplar groves located in France. Plastic is even banned in sample caps, which are made of cork. The whole range is made in France. It consists of seven unisex 100 ml fragrances and of a discovery box containing the samples. It offers uncommon original notes – liquorice, almond, pink pepper – and a few bold combinations. The perfumes are available on the online shop, and will soon be in alternative perfume shops for EUR 137 (100 ml bottles). David Frossard had already created Différentes Latitudes, which launched some of the greatest alternative perfume brands in the 2000s, founded the Liquides perfume bar, and co-founded the brand Liquides Imaginaires. This time, he wanted to provide perfumes with a new vision of olfactory luxury. To him, conveying respect for the living with a range was just obvious. Here, the juices created by Amélie Bourgeois and Anne-Sophie Behaghel, of Flair Paris, are mostly short, natural formulas with an organic alcohol base. They do not demonize synthesis, provided it is clean. The bottle is made of partly recycled glass with an unscrewable pump for recycling, the cap is made of cork (from offcuts derived from cap productions, and it has no plastic insert, so it can be recycled), serigraphy is based on resin free from any volatile organic compound (VOC), and the case is made of FSC-certified cellophane-free paper. The range counts seven 100 ml fragrances sold for the recommended retail price of EUR 110 at Liquides and at the Bon Marché department store. Using her ecological awareness and taste for beautiful things, Laurence Lecoq, Nout’s founder, created a range of six luxury Eaux de parfum whose organic and vegan, Cosmos Organic-certified formulas are claimed to be ethically, ecoconsciously sensorial. Composed by nose Laure Jacquet, of Robertet, the juices only contain natural and organic ingredients derived from ethical sourcing to obtain formulas concentrated in essential oils, isolates, and organic wheat alcohol. The white glass bottles are topped with an SFC/PEFC-certified wooden cap derived from sustainably managed French forests. The whole product can be recycled and is showcased in a pouch made of unbleached, organic recycled cotton. Here, again, remanence and bold notes are very subtle so they can compete with conventional perfumes with powerful base notes, like cedar, patchouli, tonka bean, and benzoin. Nout perfumes are available on the e-shop and will soon be in a selection of perfume shops, for EUR 155 or EUR 165. These three new approaches to perfume do present a few variants, but they are all mainly focused on respect, without compromising on an exceptional trail."
"USA: Professional hair products sales almost recovered 2019 level, found Kline","Professional hair product sales in June 2020 were 98% of the same month totals a year ago, according to the most recent findings from Kline PRO, Kline’s salon retail products and services database. In fact, shampoos and conditioners were ahead of last year at +6% and +12%, respectively. According to Kline, this is welcome news for an industry that had a nearly complete shutdown from mid-March through most of May. While it is not business as usual quite yet, the data are revealing the types of products and services that have the best performance compared to pre-COVID times. Hair care products that provide color care benefits have always had the highest category share but saw a bump in the second quarter to 34.0% of the market, peaking in April at 43.7%. Since most salon doors were shuttered at this time, ordering online and curbside pickup from salons became a lifeline. Data shows that kits and multipacks of items for color care surged in this timeframe to 134% over YAG [1] as stockpiling products became a reality. Regional shifts in product sales are evident, as the operational status of salons was left to state governments. The Midwest region, consisting of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, fared the best of all five regions. Quarterly market share rose from 20.8% YAG to 25.2%. Midwestern salons posted a remarkable performance in June product sales with an increase of almost 26% over last June. While salon product sales are important, the crux of salons’ survival rests with services, which comprise 94% of their revenues. Concern has been high within the industry regarding what business will be like post-COVID. Will clients return? And if they do, will new regulations and procedures allow salons to operate at the same volume as before? The final answer remains to be seen, but early data shows that clients are willing to begin returning to their stylists in the salon, at least for certain services. Services are not recovering at the same rate as products. Service revenues were essentially non-existent in April. Kline’s PRO Pulse: U.S. Independent Salon Market Performance Index  shows improvement each month of the quarter, culminating with an index for the quarter of 35.2 compared to Q2 2019. June, however, was very promising at an index of 75.7. “Services that are rebounding the best are those that are more high-tech and require the expertise of a professional stylist,” says Paula Gottdiner, Kline PRO Project Manager. “Personally, I had no hesitation in returning to my salon for a color service when it re-opened. Evidently, I was not alone in doing so, as hair coloring revenues in June were up nearly 2% over a year ago.” Other services that saw increases in revenue include straightening/smoothing with a haircut, color and treatment, and thinning hair treatment. As noted by Gottdiner, these are services highly valued by clients and not ones easy to perform as an at-home DIY. “Based on what we are seeing with Kline PRO, the salon industry is on track to recover,” says Gottdiner. “We are in the midst of processing the transactions from the third quarter and expect to publish the data in the next couple of months. It will be interesting to measure the recovery and be able to analyze both the product and service components of the industry.”"
Pandemic pushes millions of shoppers online in Latin America,"“Covid-19 has been an accelerator of trends, and in electronic commerce it has been very powerful,” said Oscar Silva, an expert in global strategies with the consultancy firm KPMG in Mexico. ""More than 10 million Latin Americans who had never bought online now do so regularly,"" he told AFP. The dominant regional force is not Amazon or eBay but Mercado Libre, which has a similar business model and is present in 18 countries. Despite the economic turmoil unleashed by the pandemic, the Argentinian company doubled its sales in the second quarter of this year thanks to a 45 percent rise in the number of customers to 51.1 million. Its market capitalization reached $55 billion, challenging Brazilian mining giant Vale for the title of Latin America’s most valuable company. The tectonic shift in consumer habits is likely to endure, said Silva. ""People were afraid of fraud or that the product wouldn’t be what they expected. It’s very likely that a large percentage of these customers will stay after realizing how easy and efficient online commerce is,"" he said. David Geisen, head of Mercado Libre’s Mexican arm, said that ""loyal users now buy in 12 days what they bought before in 17, frequent users in 24 days what they bought in 79, and sporadic users in 29 days what they bought in almost a year."" At the start of the pandemic, top sellers included face masks, antibacterial gel, thermometers and oximeters, but demand gradually spread to other goods and services. The boom even reached Cuba’s tightly controlled economy, with sales soaring on the government’s tuenvio.com platform, which struggled to meet the expectations of some customers. ""I’ve made around 40 purchases and I’ve had about 40 problems,"" Jorge Noris, a 34-year-old IT worker, told AFP in Havana. There have also been hiccups in Mexico. One man who tried to buy a cellphone online complained he received a soft drink instead, although the store - part of Mexican magnate Carlos Slim’s empire - eventually sent him the right order. Many businesses have gone bankrupt because they had a poor online offering or none at all, Silva said. ""The big platforms are the winners, but we also see neighborhood businesses that keep their customers or win new ones using something as simple as WhatsApp,"" he said. According to the firm AppsFlyer, downloads of e-commerce mobile applications grew 93 percent in the second quarter of the year in Latin America, with Brazil and Mexico leading the way. Brazil, the region’s biggest economy, saw online commerce grow nearly 57 percent between January and August, with 135,000 new online stores, according to the Brazilian Association of Electronic Commerce. Governments in the region are eyeing the online boom as a source of tax income to fund increased public spending during the pandemic. New jobs are also being created, replacing some of those lost during the economic downturn. While unemployment stalks millions around the region, Sergio Garcia is optimistic about his future after a year as a parcel courier for a global e-commerce giant. ""Demand has grown a lot during the pandemic,"" said the 60-year-old, who earns the equivalent of about $0.30 for each package he delivers on foot. ""It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s more than other jobs,"" he said."
How far will Clean Beauty go?,"Awareness of the need to develop the notion of clean beauty emerged in the United States as a response to a regulatory gap in cosmetics formulation. Then, it soon reached European markets, although the latter were already subject to more restrictive regulations. Who triggered this phenomenon? Increasingly watchful consumers who paid attention to what they purchased and had lost confidence in brands. According to a recent study conducted by Kantar Worldpanel, in late 2019, 44% of French people said they paid attention to the composition of hygiene-beauty products, compared to less than 40% in late 2012. As for confidence, out of an average of 88 brands continuously followed up over several years, it declined from 32% to 27% between 2013 and 2019. “Consumers are watchful and statistics prove it,” confirms Anaïs Dupuy, Business Development Manager at Kantar. These statistics include evaluation applications, which have been increasingly seducing the public since they appeared. 5.1 million consumers scanned the composition of hygiene-beauty products in September 2019. Meanwhile, small brands boomed to become part of the biggest new customer recruiters: DIY, bulk products… But most of all, this is due to the constant progress made by organic and natural cosmetics which, in 2019, still represented 8.6% of hygiene-beauty volumes, i.e. 3.4 points more than in 2015. “If, in early 2020, the hygiene-beauty market started slowing down with a weaker growth rate and a decline in the average basket value, organic and natural cosmetics resisted and kept recruiting new shoppers,” adds Anaïs Dupuy. Last May, almost 60% of French people said they had purchased organic/natural hygiene-beauty products at least once over the previous 12 months, while they were only 52% in early 2019. Cosmetics viewed as clean have obviously become a growth driver on this market, and no doubt the new post-COVID era will strengthen this phenomenon. “Clean beauty was born out of a health concern and a will to create non-toxic cosmetics – whether synthetic or natural – free from any suspicious ingredients. The sanitary crisis intensifies this will,” claims Candice Colin, creator of the Clean Beauty application and of Beautylitic, and founder of Officinea, the organic, natural, endocrine disruptor-free cosmetics brand. “As a consequence, we noticed the situation has changed in sectors which had not made progress yet. I think the main clean beauty triggering factor in this COVID period is luxury, whereas the two concepts were still recently opposed. Luxury brands have been making significant modifications to their formulas, because they can no longer overlook this phenomenon: clean beauty does not question efficacy. There is no reason why there would be an offering in supermarkets and not in the luxury segment,” adds Candice Colin. Pascale Brousse, founder of the Trendsourcing agency, shares the same opinion. “Luxury was still standing apart a few months ago, but they no longer have a choice. Who will buy a EUR 150 cream if the composition is not in line with the excellence they highlight?” she asks. As a matter of fact, categories like makeup and haircare, and even hair colouration, in the luxury segment, have been innovating and multiplying launches, as can be seen with the Le Rouge Français and La Bouche Rouge lipsticks, Kure Bazaar nail polish, and very recently, the new Respect hair care range by high-end hairdresser David Lucas. From the smallest brands to giant groups, the prospects related to more conscious beauty are much positive for the future. In addition, the lack of any legal and official definition of clean beauty makes it possible to adopt all sorts of approaches: clean, organic, natural formulas; ecodesigned, refillable packaging; bulk, solid, powder products… Anything is possible to make clean cosmetics progress. New players are emerging, and those that had adopted it right from the beginning go even farther. We cannot but be delighted.

The French cosmetics industry is planning a return to normal in 2022,"According to the study, carried out on behalf of the French beauty federation (FEBEA), the turnover of cosmetics sector dropped by 10% during the first six months of the year, however, sales recorded strong disparities between product categories. Indeed, while sales of beauty products have fallen by 25%, those of hygiene products have doubled, driven by the health concerns linked to the outbreak. As far as French exports are concerned, the drop reached 14% in the first half of the year for cosmetic products, compared to 18% on average at the national level. Over the entire year, the cosmetics sector should suffer less than the French economy as a whole, according to Asterès. Indeed, the consulting firm anticipates a 5% drop of the industry’s net sales in 2020. A figure to be compared to the decline of total household consumption in France, which is estimated at 7%. In detail, hygiene products could register an annual increase of 30%, while sales of beauty products could fall by 17%. Regarding investments, the drop reached 12% for cosmetics on the first half, versus 16% on average at the national level. As for cosmetics exports, they could fall by 9% in 2020, less than total French exports (-17%), the study forecasts. In this area also, there are strong disparities since French exports of cosmetic products might drop by 10% in the Americas but are expected to rise by 3% in China. Th situation is also at a stalemate in travel retail, in the wake of the collapse of air transport. According to Asterès, sales of cosmetics in travel retail outlets should register a fall of at least 65% in the year 2020. In the end, the French cosmetics market is expected to return to its pre-crisis level in 2022. However, as far as exports are concerned, the rebound could be slower, especially in the most affected regions (the United States and India, in particular), with a return to the 2019 level expected only in 2023. If the French cosmetics sector as a whole benefits from an overall solidity, ""very small businesses and SMEs, which represent 85% of the cosmetics sector, are clearly more vulnerable"", notes the FEBEA. Very small businesses, in particular, suffered a 54% drop in turnover, compared to 35% for large companies, during the first half of 2020. Beauty salons and prestige retailers (perfumeries and department stores) are also among the most impacted sectors. According to Asterès, they should see their annual sales fall by 25% and 23% respectively. On the other hand, sales in supermarkets and drugstores, fully benefiting from the boom of hygiene products, are expected to grow by 2%. In addition, online sales are expected to skyrocket (+38%), but their weight remains too low to impact the entire sector. Despite the sector’s strengths, the FEBEA therefore insists on the importance that public policies will have to limit damages and ensure a fast recovery of the most vulnerable companies. The trade organisation therefore pleads for a tax credit supporting the digitization of production tools. According to Asterès estimates, in the cosmetics industry just one more robot per company would increase the overall productivity by 3.5%. For Patrick O’Quin, president of FEBEA: “The cosmetics industry remains a high-performance sector, with all the assets needed to face the crisis and accelerate its transformation. However, the sector’s SMEs, which create a great deal of employment throughout France, deserve specific support during this period."""
Will the cosmetics industry become addicted to powder?,"Founded by Hélène Azancot, General Manager of various brands of the L’Oréal group over the course of her career, young brand Yodi Beauty offers face and hair care products in the form of powder. “We aim to reach consumers who want to consume beauty differently and help them turn to conscious beauty. I felt like putting my expertise and knowledge in the service of new cosmetics based on transparency, education, and minimalist formulas, and with which science progress helps achieve new things,” she says. To make things different, Hélène Azancot’s idea is to remove, not add. “Remove anything unnecessary, anything that is not pure efficacy, like preservatives, additives, allergens. And to remove preservatives, the first thing to get rid of is actually water!” she explains. According to the creator, the anhydrous powder solution is in line with objectives of efficacy, protection, but also sharing and eco-design. Easier to use by the whole family and lighter than solid products, powders can be easily taken everywhere. For now, the range counts two nourishing shampoos, Nutritive Argan and Douceur de Lait d’Amande, and three face cleansers, Vitamine C et Fleurs d’Hibiscus, Charbon Purifiant, and Trio d’Huiles. Formulated with a base concentrated in natural actives and enriched with a prebiotic, these products suit all skin or scalp types, and both men and women. “We worked on our formulas for two years. It is a real detox. Thanks to powders, we revive products with fewer, but just as efficient ingredients. We remove, without losing,” adds the founder. As for packs, the brand’s commitment to eco-design is respected, as they chose aluminium bottles covered with recyclable and compostable bioplastics labels. In line with current trends, including DIY, powder is making progress and gaining ground on unexpected segments, just like oils did a few years back. “Consumers in search of new gestures like powders. They boast a strong environmental dimension, and they are easy to apply and use,” explains Anne Rutigliano, Marketing Director of the Anjac group, whose Aircos company, leader of cosmetic powder manufacturing, has just launched a range of six skincare, cleansing, and exfoliating products. “These formulas offer many ecological advantages, since they do not contain any water. As regards efficacy, the lipophilic actives associated with powders are those with the best affinity and intradermal penetration, and powders also offer very good adhesion to the skin for a cleansing action,” she adds. Based on a dermocosmetics approach to suit all skin types, the range includes a cleanser and an exfoliating product for oily, dry, and highly sensitive skins, in addition to an “all skin type” version. Products are talc-free, since it is a controversial material suspected of being potentially carcinogenic, and contain up to 95% of ingredients of natural origin. “Right now, our only constraint lies in the fact that the actives currently available are mainly hydrophilic, so they mix with water. We have a limited choice of (lipophilic) ingredients for dry products. But our Aircos R&D has managed to add hydrophilic ingredients to our water-free powders,” explains Anne Rutigliano. “Also, for mass production, and in particular packaging, powders require adaptations to ensure the right dosage and preserve the quality of the formula and the powder thinness,” she adds. Yet another evidence of the cosmetic potential of powders, over the summer, Aircos opened a sales office in California, and a laboratory will be inaugurated in early 2021, to pave the way for these products. Renowned for their know-how and industrial capacity in this segment, the Technature laboratory has been working, since its creation, on a water-free approach to face care with masks and cleansers. They are now launching a hygiene range with shower gels, shampoos, a conditioner, and a hair mask based on argan oil, goji berries, and avocado. “With this product type, we aim to both keep up with the clean beauty trend with more natural formulas free from any controversial ingredients and simplify the list of ingredients. We have been making powders for a long time, but we have reviewed our packaging so that the general public likes them,” explains Communication and Marketing Director Anne-Claire Roudaut. All formulas contain over 97.7%, and up to 99.7% ingredients of natural origin, and are available in two versions: either as a powder compact with direct application on the skin or hair, or as a bottle with a powder to rehydrate. “It is the ‘I make my own shampoo and shower gel’ version. Consumers keep their own bottle and purchase refill bags: it is a simple gesture, they save money, they adopt an ecoresponsible behaviour, and the formulas are natural, so it is a win-win,” adds Sales Manager Rachel Roger Mazurié. Other than environmental impact reduction, the absence of preservatives, and the pleasure to make your own product, Anne-Claire Roudaut highlights a sensorial advantage. “Our products feel very soft and velvety. Plus, they do not make the skin feel tight, compared to fluid products,” she says. Given its technological expertise, Technature has almost no limits in terms of manufacturing. “We have the right technology to add both oily and aqueous extracts to our powders,” claims Anne-Claire Roudaut. Anhydrous powder cosmetics are more environmentally friendly than others in many ways. And brands and consumers have already understood that."
"Fragrance leads recovery in UK prestige beauty market, reports The NPD Group","In very challenging circumstances during Covid-19, fragrance performance has improved from -67% during lockdown (12 weeks from 22 March 2020 to 13 June 2020) compared to the same period in 2019 to -13% post-lockdown (12 Weeks from 14 June 2020 to 5 September 2020) compared to the same period in 2019. According to The NPD Group, fragrance is outperforming the entire prestige beauty market, helping to lead the market recovery. Post lockdown (12 weeks, from 14 June 2020 to 5 September 2020), fragrance reported a -13% decline in sales, versus the same period in 2019, compared to the whole of the prestige beauty market which is down -24%. This weak performance in prestige beauty is attributed in part to the ongoing challenges faced by the make-up sector. “The popularity of fragrance can be attributed to a number of factors. Fragrance doesn’t require touch when applying or appreciating it. Retailers are also utilising unsold giftsets to encourage consumers back into store using price promotion, and as a result fragrance giftsets have reported in positive growth of +32% post-lockdown (12 Weeks from 14 June 2020 to 5 September 2020) compared to the same period in 2019. Consumers are now increasingly price conscious and opting for products that are perceived as value for money,” said Emma Fishwick, Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. Mintel, for his part, noted last week a strong dynamism in sales of facial care products in the United Kingdom."
Nine ways COVID-19 will boost the greening of the cosmetics industry,"Hosted by Ecovia Intelligence on an online platform on 2-5th November 2020, the next European edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will discuss the sustainability implications of the coronavirus pandemic on the cosmetics industry, with a focus on nine key issues: Skin health and the human virome. The human virome (or virobiota) is the total collection of viruses in and on the human body. The pandemic has elevated consumer interest in anti-viral products, such as hand sanitisers, hand washes, and cleaning products. John Jiménez, Senior Exploration Scientist at Belcorp, will give an introduction to the human virome and discuss its relationship with skin health. How does the skin microbiome interact with the virome? What are the implications to the cosmetics and personal care industry? Will we see new personal care products designed to create a healthy virome, as we currently have for the skin biome? Natural ingredients for skin immunity. Consumer demand for health and natural products has increased since the virus outbreak; many consumers are buying such products as they look to boost their personal immunity. Dr. Anne Marie Fine, medical doctor and author, will give details of natural ingredients that can be used in personal care formulations to improve skin immunity. How can personal care products help build skin immunity? What ingredients can boost the skin’s natural defence against microbial pathogens? Evolution of sustainability issues. The sustainability agenda has changed considerably this year. The pandemic has highlighted social inequality with citizens in developing countries unable to get the same level of healthcare and treatment as those in the western world. The Black Lives Matter movement has shown how racial discrimination and prejudices exist in society. Although climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental pollution remain pressing issues, they risk being overlooked as governments and organisations grapple with the coronavirus crisis. A number of speakers will discuss the changing sustainability agenda in the cosmetics industry. What green issues are likely to be most important in a post- COVID world? Disruption of raw material supply. Lockdowns and emergency measures introduced during the pandemic have disrupted the supply of raw materials to the cosmetics industry. Natural ingredients, especially those from developing countries, have been particularly affected. Higher freight costs, longer transportation times, as well as quarantine measures at ports have caused disruption. The pandemic is leading to some cosmetic and ingredient firms to start setting up regional and local supply networks. Such developments will be featured in a dedicated session (Supply Chains). Upcycling food ingredients. Food side streams (by products) are increasingly being used as a source of cosmetic ingredients. Some companies are upcycling as they turn to sustainable sources of raw materials. Others are doing so as they look to re-direct waste from landfill and develop circular systems. Case studies will be given of operators making natural ingredients by upcycling, including product innovations. Sustainable palm oil and rainforest ingredients. Palm kernel oil is widely used in the personal care industry, however questions remain about sustainable sourcing. Peter Becker, Sustainability Senior Manager at Evonik, will give details on a new cross-industry initiative - Action for Sustainable Derivatives - that encourage transparency in supply chains and zero deforestation. Its aim is to positively transform the industry by sustainable sourcing and production of palm oil derivatives. Some argue the solution to deforestation lies in commercialisation of rainforest ingredients. Forestwise will show how the organisation is working with indigenous communities in Borneo (South-East Asia) to collect wild harvested rainforest ingredients. With more than half of Borneo’s rainforest lost in the last 50 years, its mission is to preserve what remains. Forestwise will give details on how it has set up supply networks for illipe butter, kukui nut oil, and other rainforest ingredients. Social value of cosmetics. Although sustainability is now entrenched in the cosmetics industry, few operators are focusing on social issues. Stefan Siemer, Head of Corporate Sustainability at Weleda, will explain how brands should address their social impacts. The company will highlight its Diversity Wins programme, which provided employment to refugees coming into Europe. Retailing implications. The coronavirus pandemic could change the face of retailing forever. Online retailers reported a sales surge as many physical stores closed during lockdowns. Although most have re-opened, social distancing measures and weak consumer sentiment are leading to sluggish sales. Stephanie Yaguer from Red Ant will give insights from its Safe Retail Initiative, showing how consumers feel about retailing of beauty products. Marketing to the post-COVID consumer. COVID-19 is having a profound effect on consumer behaviour, changing the way we greet, work, shop, and use cosmetics & personal care products. A futurist will discuss the long-term implications on these changes: how will the post-COVD consumer behave? What are the marketing implications to brands and retailers?

"UK: Facial skincare usage surges in COVID-age, says Mintel","Following a dip in usage in 2018/19, facial cleansing is well and truly back in vogue among British women. According to Mintel, over the last 12 months [1], usage of these products rose from 50% in 2019 to 55% in 2020 in the United Kingdom. There’s also been an increased use of micellar water (from 25% to 29%) and usage of toner has risen from 25% to 31%. And it’s not just cleansing which has witnessed a COVID boost, moisturising has proved popular too. According to the market research firm, usage of moisturisers saw a decline in 2019 as women cut back on their beauty repertoires, but 2020 has seen renewed popularity. Day cream/lotion is proving to be the cream of the crop, as the number of Brits dipping into these has shot up from 60% in 2019 to 67% in 2020. Night cream usage has also flourished, increasing from 44% to 47% over the same period. Women surveyed by Mintel about their beauty routines during lockdown [2] confirmed the shift. Overall, 30% of facial skincare users said they had moisturised more since the outbreak of COVID-19, (rising to 41% of 16-24s), while one in five (18%) facial skincare users spent longer on their routine and one in seven (14%) had used more facial treatment products such as face masks. Overall, attention to hygiene including hand washing increased significantly at the beginning of April [3] when 81% of Brits said they had washed their hands more often. “In this COVID age, consumers are seeking physical and mental wellness, and facial skincare has benefited from the wellbeing benefits of following a beauty routine,” explains Roshida Khanom, Head of Beauty and Personal Care, Mintel. According to Mintel, the British women’s facial skincare market has enjoyed value growth in recent years, increasing by 1.4% in value in 2019 to reach £1.18 billion. Star performers include the cleansing (including cleansers, toners and makeup removers) and skincare face mask segments - which both saw a 9% rise in value in the twelve-month period ending June 2020. The mandatory use of face masks/coverings in a number of public places in 2020 could boost prospects for facial skincare, with new product development (NPD) in skincare products to soothe irritated skin. Skincare brands can also extend their ranges to release comfortable face coverings to reduce skin issues. Increased hygiene also presents future NPD opportunities for gentle facial cleansers designed to be used multiple times a day, or cleansing formats that can be used on the go, while including antibacterial claims could also appeal. While facial skincare remains a focus for women, there has been a 5% decline in colour cosmetics sales - falling to £1.76 billion last year. According to Mintel, 55% of female facial skincare users have reduced how frequently they wear makeup. While the trend was well established before the pandemic, in particular in the wake of the success of Korean beauty routines, the outbreak of COVID-19 may well have played a significant part too with frequency of makeup usage down. “Makeup usage will fall further throughout 2020, as social distancing measures remain and working from home becomes the next normal for many. Makeup/skincare hybrid products, such as BB/CC creams, could have more appeal as women cut back on using heavy foundation. The category has already seen NPD from makeup brands entering skincare in 2020 which will continue,” added Roshida Khanom. Finally, just as face coverings in public places have become the new norm, facial skincare masks in the home have seen a boost in popularity. Usage of peel-off or wash-off masks rose from 25% in 2019 to 32% in 2020, while sheet leave-on mask usage increased from 15% to 22%. These masks have particularly captured the interest of young 16-24s - almost two thirds (62%) of whom enjoyed the luxury of a peel-off or wash-off mask in 2020. “The face mask segment has benefited, with the lockdown giving people more time to themselves. Sheet masks have also seen NPD in biodegradable formats, targeting sustainability concerns,” concluded Ms Khanom."

Covid-19 pandemic gives major boost to e-commerce,"The trend was brought into sharp relief on August 18, when British high street mainstay Marks & Spencer announced it was culling 7,000 staff. Hours later, in contrast, online behemoth Amazon said it was hiring 3,500 in the United States. However, the M&S slimdown is only one part of the picture in the UK, with 2,500 more job losses announced at department store Debenhams, which in April entered administration for the second time in a year. Hundreds more jobs are also to be lost at other well-known British high street chains. By contrast, Britain’s largest supermarket chain Tesco placed a sizeable feather in its online cap by saying it was creating 16,000 permanent jobs to deal with strong growth in its online activities. ""It is very clear that the digitisation of commerce, (even) if in place for a long time, is accelerating enormously,"" said Hervé Gilg, managing director and distribution specialist at Alvarez & Marsal corporate transformation services. The benefits are being reaped by those companies which were already carrying out a sizeable chunk of their activities online. That troupe is led by Amazon, which doubled its net profits in the second quarter of this virus-challenged year. Following was Germany’s fashion and lifestyle e-commerce heavyweight Zalando, which saw its active customer base rise 20 percent in first half 2020 to 34 million. US giant Walmart, although not an online ""pure player"", has also shifted in that direction to benefit from the upswing in virtual commerce in the US and its second-quarter results soared past estimates on an e-sales jump of 97 percent. “COVID-19 has seen a lot of consumer purchasing behaviour move towards e-commerce due to necessity, with isolation and shops being closed,” said Sam Murrant, Lead Payments Analyst at GlobalData. Actually, global e-commerce grew 41 percent “in only three months compared with 22 percent growth for 2020 as a whole to date,” said market research firm Kantar. In France, the United Kingdom, Spain and China, the average market share of e-commerce went from 8.8 percent of value (in 2019) to 12.4 percent in second quarter 2020, added Kantar. It highlighted that in China, online shopping already amounts to ""a quarter of expenditure on mass consumer products."" The trend was already under way before Covid-19 began to batter the global economy. But the brutal falloff in out-of-home spending has had ""a major knock-on effect for non-food commerce dependent on physical sale points"", Gilg said. The unprecedented development has ""made all retail actors understand or else confirm that it is indispensable to have an online presence and to be as competitive as possible there,"" says Stephane Charveriat, senior associate director with the Boston Consulting Group. “Even companies well-advanced in e-commerce have understood they lacked capacities to meet the demand they faced during the lockdown and are still facing in the context of the epidemic,” adds Mr. Gilg. That has meant evolution, which ""requires significant means and investments,"" observes Charveriat. But that need comes at a time when company coffers are relatively bare and money placed aside for online purposes is cash which does not therefore flow to the physical business. These transformations will take place under the pressure of already well established global heavyweights, such as Amazon. “Clearly, it is a sizeable challenge to confront large platforms,” says Charveriat. He says French firms must define an internet strategy, be it in the form of alliances with others, in order to compete in the digital marketplace with existing big hitters. Still, Gilg says the existing physical presence of distribution brands can be a major asset in that regard, for example, catering to visiting international tourists who may want to experience what a brand has to offer on-site when post-Covid tourism does eventually take off again. “Apple has shown very effectively how a shop can act as a stage,” to show off its wares, Gilg said, adding that while commercial clicks have their value, retail mortar can provide physical brand ""authenticity."""
UK beauty market expected to decline 10% in 2020,"“Cosmetics and toiletries are losing out in the COVID-19-driven decision between what is essential and what is dispensable, particularly as almost half (43%) of UK consumers plan to socialize outside of the home less frequently in future [1]. This will contribute to the forecasted -10% (£1.7bn) value decline in the UK cosmetics and toiletries industry in 2020 [2],” explains GlobalData. As consumers have fewer out-of-home occasions, the cosmetics market has taken a backseat. “Even when consumers do venture outdoors, the wearing of masks is further diminishing the need for cosmetics,” comments Lia Neophytou, Consumer Analyst at the data and analytics company. As a consequence, sectors such as fragrances and make-up that are most suited to out-of-home occasions will see greater decline than skincare and oral hygiene that are generally used irrespective of plans to socialize. These latter categories will also see comparatively less decline as people have a heightened awareness of personal cleanliness amid the pandemic. “Brands operating in the skincare and personal hygiene categories are in a better position than most - though a degree of innovation is still required to mitigate the extent of sector decline and speed up recovery. Investing in marketing campaigns and re-positioning products typically used out-of-home to align with the at-home occasion would be wise,” adds Neophytou. For example, combining hand sanitising and skin moisturising - as Unilever’s Vaseline brand recently did with their new range of products - may be a good idea. However, among the most affected categories some segments may also successfully navigate through the crisis.  Eye make-up, for instance, increased its share of the prestige make-up market by 3% in the UK, during and after lockdown, according to The NPD Group. “Pre-lockdown, eye make-up accounted for 22% of total prestige makeup sales and increased to 24% of prestige make-up sales during lockdown. Once lockdown was eased, eye make-up increased its share to 25% of total prestige make-up sales,” explains the market research firm. According to The NPD Group, mascara and eye shadow sales drove the increase in share during this period. However, the focus on eye products is also evident in the brow segment, since brow products increased their market share in makeup from 4% pre-lock-down to 5% post-lockdown. On the contrary, as consumers are required to wear face coverings in shops, on public transport and other public spaces, the lip segment has declined in share, driven largely by a decline in demand of lip colour. While all sectors in the cosmetics and toiletries industry are expected to return to growth in 2021, they will not recuperate their pre-COVID-19 value immediately. Shifts in consuming habits and priorities will play a role in the difficulties of the beauty demand to return to post-crisis levels. However, according to GolbalData, economic and financial uncertainty will further contribute toward this. Indeed, 25% of UK consumers that are earning less due to COVID-19 will purchase beauty and grooming products at the lower end of the price range in future, compared with the UK average of 20% [3]."
Brazil: ABIHPEC anticipates sales of cosmetic products to grow 1.1% in 2020,"For manufacturers of personal hygiene, perfumery and cosmetics, the most critical months of the Covid-19 crisis in Brazil have passed. In any case, this is what announces João Carlos Basilio, executive president of ABIHPEC, who has just published the sales figures for the sector from January to May 2020. Compared to the same period last year, the Brazilian market has increased by 0.6% in turnover and 2.8% in volume. Although modest, this growth is very good news for ABIHPEC. ""For our sector, it is a very positive asset to stay in the green,"" said João Carlos Basilio. “Much of this result is a reflection of the significant increase in purchases of products that make up what is called the ’COVID-19 shopping basket’, such as hand sanitizers and liquid or solid soaps. This group of products contributed 21% of the total growth of market (in value, based on ex-factory prices) during the first five months of the year,” he explained. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the products that have recorded the fastest growth. Due to the lack of a products on the market, many cosmetic companies quickly reacted and adapted their production facilities to address the demand. Others, who already offered these items, stepped up production. As a result, more than 6,300 tons have already been sold. An increase of 3127% (volume / tonne) as sales did not exceed 200 tonnes during the same period in 2019. Liquid soap, another key product for hand hygiene, recorded an 18.9% increase in sales (ex-factory value). “Brazilians are used to take care of themselves and their personal hygiene. Amid the pandemic, we have noticed several changes in purchasing habits and preferences between the different segments of the sector,” explains Basilio. Sales of shampoos and conditioners, for instance, respectively grew by 2.9% and 9.2% (ex-works value). ""Such figures make us think that consumers probably take more baths and wash their hair more often,"" said the president of ABIHPEC. The skincare category, especially for adult skins, also met a significant success during the first five months of the year. Sales of anti-wrinkle and anti-aging cosmetic products increased by 13.4% over the period. Additionally, despite social distancing measures and the use of facial masks, sales of lipsticks grew 12% in volume. “We believe that despite the context, people continued to dress and wear make-up at home, in particular to participate in virtual social events, such virtual happy hours and professional video meetings,” adds João Carlos Basilio. For the president of ABIHPEC, in addition to behavioural changes, the industry’s good figures can also be a consequence of the price cuts made by cosmetics manufacturers in recent months. “This shows how the sector was able to react quickly. By offering products at a lower price, the industry was able to adapt its offer to the new reality. Price cuts helped to create purchasing opportunities for Brazilians who did not have to give up consuming our products.” According to João Carlos Basilio, ABIHPEC forecasts a growth of 1.1% in 2020 for the entire perfume, cosmetics and hygiene sector in Brazil. “We are very careful when we talk about recovery. The pace will perhaps be slower, because the economic context is still quite complex,” he underlined. However, according to the Executive Chairman of ABIHPEC, the business community has received with great enthusiasm the results of this first part of the year. ""For many of them, June was a very positive month, with demand picking up, apparently continuing the process of sectorial recovery already seen in the May figures,"" he concluded."
Germany records smallest decline in prestige beauty sales during lockdown,"Within the five biggest European prestige beauty markets, Germany shows the smallest decline in year-to-date value sales as of the end of May 2020, performing better than UK, Spain, France, and Italy, according to market research firm The NPD Group. Due to the closure of the majority of retail stores during the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced retail traffic right before and after the closure, the selective beauty market in Germany registers a loss of -23 per cent over the first five months of 2020 (Jan.-May). [1] The brick and mortar closure of five weeks from March 16 to April 19th was the shortest closure period compared to the other four European countries. Additionally, thanks to the drugstore channel in Germany that remained open, as well as the maturity of the e-commerce channel, the sales declined -65 per cent during the five-week closure in Germany. In comparison, France declined -88%, Spain -87%, and Italy -86% during their respective store closure period, according to The NPD Group. Up to week 11 (March 15th, 2020) the German selective beauty market was flat compared to last year. Fragrances and hair categories registered growth while makeup and skincare showed a negative performance compared to the same period in 2019. For calendar year 2019, the online channel showed a +14 per cent growth, brick and mortar, which stands for 84 per cent of the value sales recorded a -3 per cent result. During the closure of the majority of the brick and mortar stores in Germany (March 16th - April 19th, 2020), the market changed its dynamics. E-commerce climbed up to almost 60 per cent of the sales weight and more than doubled growth pace. Thanks to the high e-commerce weight before the closure and the rising home-spa trend, the skincare category was able to show a better resilience compared to the total beauty market. “While E-commerce has a higher growth rate when compared to brick and mortar, it only accounted for 18 per cent of the German prestige beauty market before the brick and mortar closure,” said Samantha Grand, Director of Beauty Prestige Germany at The NPD Group. Furthermore, even five weeks after re-opening of brick and mortar, the weight of prestige beauty sales in e-commerce was still higher than in the brick and mortar channel. “The main question is how much of the brick and mortar decline will be compensated by the online dynamism, and how resilient could the prestige beauty industry be towards the new prioritization of consumers spend. Another question is if the ‘new normal’ will drive a change in assortment, pricing and promotion. The beauty industry will have to engage with consumers in more creative ways, involve new technologies, and find ways to make the shopping experience appealing and enjoyable during these changing times,” concluded Grand."
"For Brazilian women, price is the key factor when buying make-up products","However, only 8 out of these 22 products are used on a regular basis. According to Picodi, this can be explained by the fact that 39% of the women who answered the survey buy their cosmetics when they are on sale, while 32% wait they are finished and 29% whenever they want. A large majority of the women who participated in the survey (77%) said price is as the key buying factor for make-up. The brand is crucial for 55% of them while 30% said their choice is based on their own preferences. Less important buying factors are: recommendation from influencers (28%), expert opinions (20%), the list of ingredients (18%) and the opinion of friends (16%). Therefore, it is not surprising that only 15% of Brazilian women said they prefer high-end cosmetics rather than their less expensive counterparts. However, 45% of them indulge themselves in buying prestige cosmetics occasionally, while 40% said they never buy such products. The price is also a decisive factor for the choice between traditional and ecofriendly cosmetics. The majority of women surveyed (54%) stated that they buy ecofriendly cosmetics only when the price is reasonable. However, 38% always buy eco-friendly cosmetics while only 8% said they have no interest in this kind of beauty products. For many Brazilian women, makeup is part of the daily beauty routine. However, 13.9% of Brazilian women surveyed do not wear makeup. Among those who do, 37% wear makeup daily, while the majority (44%) wear make-up occasionally and 19% only on special occasions. Statistically, the makeup case of a typical Brazilian woman contains: 8 lipsticks, 3 lip liners, 3 blushes, 4 mascaras, 7 eyeshadows and 9 nail polishes. Compared to other countries in Latin America, Brazilian women spend more on make-up than Mexican women (USD 290) and Argentine women (about USD 236 per year)."
Ten trends spotted at China Beauty Expo 2020,"“CBE 2020 played a vital role in driving and leading a recovery not just for the beauty sector but for the entire economy,” said Sang Jingmin, founder and chairman of China Beauty Expo. Each edition of CBE gathers the latest technologies and products from leading companies and brands. This year also saw a remarkable showcase of new concepts, ideas and technologies. Here is a selection of the main trends spotted during the show. 1. Growing consumer interest in technology During this year’s expo, CBE teamed up with Alimama (Alibaba Group’s digital marketing platform) to release the 2020 Meiyi White Paper, which identifies major consumer profiles and market segments for accurate targeting. According to the report, which was released on July 8 at the 2020 International Cosmetics Technology Conference hosted by CBE and Supply World, a growing number of Chinese consumer groups have keen interest in the benefits of technology in beauty products, which in turn is driving the need for technological innovation to bring the cosmetics sector to a new height. From the design of their pavilion to the products showcased, Proya was a good illustration on how cosmetic brands explore high-tech solutions to provide new aesthetic benefits to their customers. It’s foreseeable that technologies will be a key focus for Chinese brands in search for growth opportunities in the future. 2. Content marketing continues to attract attention Currently, content marketing is indisputably the best form of marketing for brands to communicate with consumers in China. At CBE 2020, different brands adopted various forms of content marketing to increase their visibility, including recommendations by key opinion leaders (KOLs), content planning and topic discussions. 3. Anti-aging and sensitive skin repair products are gaining popularity As far as skin care is concerned, anti-aging and sensitive skin repair products were the most eye-catching items showcased at CBE 2020. Efficacy is a key factor of success for skincare as consumers are increasingly demanding. Herborist Derma, a sub-brand of Shanghai Jahwa, presented three freeze-dried ampoule products, one of which was 77 Polypeptide Firming Freeze-Dried Powder made from three anti-aging ingredients including polypeptide, ginseng extract and retinol using the freeze-drying technology to deliver benefits such as firming, filling and fine line correcting. The growing popularity of anti-aging and repair solutions were also manifest in the latest technologies showcased by upstream businesses. 4. Consumer differentiation calls for accurate targeting of user by the brands According to the China’s Meiyi Science and Technology White Paper, there are eight types of cosmetics consumers, each with distinctive preferences. Therefore, it’s important for brands to focus on key groups to launch relevant products. At CBE, the Huanya pavilion highlighted a collection of 11 different brands - such as Face Ideas, Ausperi, Mor and Moina - conceived to better target different market segments and explore new consumer needs. 5. International giants expand their presence Over the years, international brands have been one of the major highlights of CBE. Hall N5 and E8 gathered Japanese and Korean Brands, Hall E2 was dedicated to international pavilions and imported products, Hall E3 and Hall E7 to international brands. These international exhibitors contributed to attract vast numbers of visitors and buyers. There were also a large number of niche brands on display at CBE 2020 such as Chuan Xi. Some of them will have to join forces with partners to be more successful on the huge Chinese market. 6. Consumer demands changed as a result of COVID-19 In the wake of the pandemic, consumers are more concerned about health and safety than ever. As a result, cosmetics with natural ingredients are preferred as they are generally considered as safer. Hola, a natural skincare brand with ingredients sourced in Australia, showcased its top product lines including the Instant Soothing Repair series, which received a warm response. Pien Tze Huang launched a new collection of moisturizing products based on traditional Chinese medicine and focusing the “Beauty of Health.” Japan’s Polystar, in Hall N5 also featured the theme of “Beauty and Health”, signaling efforts to add “healthy” elements to communicate a lifestyle of external beauty and internal wellbeing to Chinese consumers. 7. Increased integration of online and offline retail channels New distribution channels such as social e-commerce and live streaming have been important contributors to sales growth in recent years in China. In line with this key trend, CBE 2020 conducted live streaming throughout the event to help brands combining both online and offline channels to expand their customer base. At the expo, Kafellon demonstrated the use of mini app streaming and mini app stores to empower retailing. 8. Experience and service remain key retail goals During the expo, brands and retailers introduced new or improved retail approaches based on the current market ecosystem. Cogi Formula, for instance, introduced a formula experience center focusing on professional instruments and products, and Xcheng emphasized the creation of an omnichannel interaction retail platform. However, the ultimate purpose of these new retail approaches is still about experience and service. 9. Skincare still a hot trend It is worth noting that upstream OEM/ODM companies such as Intercos, Kolmar, Nox Bellcow and 3INS are increasing investments into the skincare lines. According to Intercos, color cosmetics and skincare products used to represent around 50% of the company’s business revenue respectively. However, these days, the revenue from skincare products has accounted for 75% of the total, exceeding that of color cosmetics. Kolmar also made greater efforts to promote its skincare lines during the expo by launching five skincare products with different claims. 10. Upstream businesses shift more attention to interaction with consumers At CBE this year, more and more upstream businesses highlighted trendy and fun elements to showcase how their products interact with consumers. For example, Cosmax created a “brands supermarket” to showcase 20 concept-brands that are well-developed in terms of product offerings, trademark and selling points. Baho’s booth design was characterized by a fusion of technology and art. It used state-of-the-art technologies, 3D mapping in particular, to visually present its facial mask products and culture, as well as its development and innovation processes. Easycare, in designing its booth, focused on trendy and fun elements appealing to young consumers. For instance, it featured a themed area incorporating bathroom items into the setting of a bar. The next edition of China Beauty Expo is scheduled to take place from May 12-14, 2021. The organizers are looking to introduce more digital service offerings to further enhance the show."
Global anti-racism protests confront India to its dark-skin bias,"When Chandana Hiran was a child, she was urged to lighten her skin. Today the Indian student is leading a campaign against whitening creams and achieved her first victory when cosmetics giant Unilever dropped the word ""fair"" from its popular Fair & Lovely skin-lightening cream. L’Oréal and Johnson & Johnson announced similar initiatives. ""They have been thriving on selling insecurities to women,"" 22-year-old Hiran, who launched an online petition against Fair & Lovely, told AFP. ""The narrative is that if you are dark-skinned, you cannot achieve anything in life. So being a dark-skinned girl I’ve always felt that maybe... I need to be fair."" Beauty giants have long profited from the society’s bias to sale whitening products, by advertising the message that beauty, success and love are linked to pale-skins. Unilever made $500 million from Fair & Lovely sales in India last year, according to Bloomberg. Now, after mounting outrage sparked by the Black Lives Matter protests in Western cities, companies like Unilever say they ""want to lead the celebration of a more diverse portrayal of beauty"". But campaigners warn their fight has just begun and that, without greater efforts to counter entrenched bias against darker skin, the rebranding remains superficial. Colourism - prejudice against darker skin tones - in India is pervasive. While British colonialism helped fuel colourism, the bias is deeply rooted in India’s ancient caste hierarchies, experts say. ""The assumption is the higher castes are fairer than the lower castes,"" sociologist Suparna Kar of Bangalore’s Christ University told AFP. As a result, many associate pale skin with wealth and beauty - a prejudice bolstered by Bollywood films which rarely make darker-complexioned women the star and frequently portray successful city-dwellers as fair-skinned. Actress Tannishtha Chatterjee, long vocal about colourism, told AFP: ""When I have been cast in urban roles, a make-up artist would come and tell me that it’s an ’upmarket’ role, so ’should I make the skin tone two shades lighter?’"" Many Indian women start using whitening products as children. Seema, a 29-year-old domestic worker in New Delhi, has used Fair & Lovely since she was 14. Most of her female relatives use it - including her 12-year-old daughter. ""When I look at the fairness-cream commercials it looks like a good product... they show that when people become fairer, they get jobs, they get proposals for marriage,"" she told AFP. Indeed, newspaper adverts for arranged marriages regularly call for brides with ""milky white"" complexions. Beyond India, the obsession is also widespread in Southeast Asia. ""Having a whiter skin is seen as... part of what is euphemistically called (a) ’pleasing personality’,"" University of the Philippines’ medical anthropologist Gideon Lasco told AFP. Such prejudices have exposed generations to self-loathing and low self-esteem, experts say. Furthermore, some adulterated products pose significant health risks: they may contain hazardous levels of mercury or hydroquinone. In Indonesia, the pursuit of ""white skin"" has led to the sale of toxic, unregulated products, prompting a government crackdown. But activists say it will take time to alter such ingrained biases. In India, a nation of 1.3 billion people, whitening products make up about half the skincare market. But change is coming, and several campaigners believe future generations will see the world - and themselves - differently."
Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020 will be held under one roof,"While last year’s edition has been impacted by the political situation in Hong Kong, Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020 have to cope with the economic and sanitary uncertainties linked to the Covid-19 pandemic.  As a consequence, joint organisers BolognaFiere Group and Informa Markets have decided to collocate both events under one roof at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) from 11-13 November. While the situation related to the Covid-19 has greatly improved in Hong Kong, with several consecutive days and weeks of 0 to near 0 newly reported cases of the disease, and an improving trajectory of recovery in neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Japan, and Malaysia, travel restrictions are expected to be eased in the region.  However, with many countries and regions still not reaching similar levels of stability yet, the organisers have proactively decided to combine the two fairs typically held at Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) and AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE) all under the roof of HKCEC for 2020. Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020 will also see the first-time debut of a Digital Week held right after the physical event. This initiative is a virtual extension of the event which will enable travel restricted beauty professionals worldwide to participate in Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020. The fair’s Digital Week will include virtual presence for select exhibitors, real-time online business matchmaking for sellers and buyers, and a host of content rich recorded and live sessions including seminars and footage from the fair. ""Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020 will be an important recovery platform for the international beauty industry,"" said David Bondi, Senior Vice President – Asia of Informa Markets and Director of Cosmoprof Asia Ltd. ""Our decision to move the two fairs into one venue as well as launching a virtual experience apart from the live event is to create an inclusive opportunity. Our Digital Week is also a good experiment to see how we can continuously improve our offerings and services for the future."" Finally, with regards to onsite health and safety measures, organisers say they have adopted “the highest standards along with following local/federal and global health protocols and working closely with the venue operators to provide an optimally secure and safe environment.”"
Sales of nail polishes expected to fall by 17% in 2020 in Brazil,"The almost global temporary closure of beauty salons and cosmetic stores due to the Covid-19 pandemic did not impact all beauty categories the same way. While perfumes and makeup generally suffered more than others, skin care products were less impacted and gained market shares. ""In the United States and in some European countries, the nail category benefited from Covid-19,"" explains Fernanda Soro, LATAM marketing manager at Sensient Technologies. Referring to recent media reports, Fernanda Soro says figures are impressive. ""During the first week of the lockdown, British women bought 18% more nail polish than they usually do. Sales of bases and topcoats were even higher,” she highlights. According to McKinsey, the nails category was one of the main winners in March and April 2020 in the United States, in particular in the ""Do it yourself"" (DIY) segment. Compared to the same period in 2019, sales increased by more than 200%. ""Based on this information, it was believed that the nail category could follow an identical trajectory in Brazil, or at least that it would remain stagnant during the pandemic. But, unfortunately, that did not happen,” laments Soro. GlobalData, which has been updating its forecasts for the Brazilian cosmetics market every 15 days, since the very beginning of the pandemic, now expects a sharp drop in sales for the nail care category in 2020. According to the research company, the market could drop by -17% compared to last year. Before the pandemic, the average scenario predicted sales of nail products to grow by 3% in Brazil. ""This serves as a warning. We have to be more and more creative to try to reverse this figure,” says Fernanda Soro. According to her, several reasons can explain the differences between the Brazil and other countries regarding nail care sales. ""At the start of the crisis, we thought that following the international example, Brazilian consumers would buy nail varnishes online and would have their nails done at home. Unfortunately, it did not happen like that.” Brazilian consumers are not as comfortable as one might think with online shopping, they are suspicious about the quality of service and are reluctant to record their personal data on the internet. The recession in Brazil is also mentioned among the possible causes. ""The entire world has been affected by the Covid-19 epidemic. But the situation here is even worse. Our unemployment rate was already huge and we are still facing a political crisis,” she adds. However, Fernanda Soro remains confident and expects a gradual recovery of Brazil’s nail market. According to GlobalData figures, the category is expected to grow by 3.9% per year on average by 2024, the fastest growth rate among all decorative cosmetics. “When our lives return to normal, the category will return to a robust growth. Brazilian women like to go to their beauty salon every week, it’s part of our culture. It is a moment of relaxation and social relationships. You feel good with your nails done, it improves your self-esteem,"" she concludes."
Beauty brands on racism: a calculated decision?,"Major companies usually stay apart from social and political conflicts, especially in a polarized time. They tend to be afraid of offending their customers and associating their brands with sensitive subjects. But in some cases, they are forced to make a stance or even to change their practices. In the context of the death of George Floyd and anti-racism protests, cosmetic brands came under fire regarding the stereotypes their products may convey. Criticisms pointed out “colourism”, the belief that lighter skin is somehow better. A belief that cosmetic brands have been accused of perpetuating with their skin-lightening products and marketing practices. Hindustan Lever, the Indian arm of consumer giant Unilever, therefore announced it would rename its ""Fair & Lovely"" skin-lightening creams, in order to make it more inclusive and to celebrate “all skin tones"". In a statement published on June 27, French cosmetics giant L’Oréal announced it will be removing certain words - including ‘white/whitening’, ‘fair/fairness’ and ‘light/lightening’ from all its ’skin evening’ products”. The company did not give any further information on the time frame of the change, nor the specific products or markets included. Meanwhile, US-based Johnson & Johnson has decided to move a step further and said it would stop selling some Neutrogena and Clean & Clear products, in Asia and the Middle East. “Conversations over the past few weeks highlighted that some product names or claims on our Neutrogena and Clean & Clear dark-spot reducer products represent fairness or white as better than your own unique skin tone,” the company said in a statement. The company also committed US$10 million over three years to help fight racism in the U.S. However, whether spontaneous or not, corporate initiatives are far from being always successful in increasing personal connections between brands and their customers. Sometimes, they can generate as much criticism as the initial situation. This is how French activist Rokhaya Diallo questioned the very fact of selling cosmetics intended to lighten dark skins. ""So is it ok to continue making money on this disaster,"" she lamented on Twitter about the L’Oréal group’s decision. Fashion and beauty brands that have embraced the themes of inclusiveness and diversity in recent years are now discovering that these subjects are at least as sensitive as environmental themes, and the words ‘diversity washing’ are now used to point out the brands making more communication than real efforts. When at the beginning of June, L’Oréal claimed standing “in solidarity with the black community, and against any form of injustice of any kind”, their message was perceived as pure newsjacking: a technique which consists in rapidly launching a communication campaign to bounce back on highly publicized events. And they were accused of hypocrisy by model and transgender activist Munroe Bergdorf. Bergdorf was hired by the beauty company in August 2017 but was fired days later after a controversy over comments she posted on Facebook in response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. L’Oréal finally apologized and rehired Munroe Bergdorf. To avoid being at odds with public opinion, companies must act on these issues on a daily basis and not only when they make the headlines. Facts are more important than words: according to a 2019 report from the Boston Consulting Group, only three African-Americans and 24 women head the 500 largest U.S. companies."
Perfumes: beautiful sleeping brands rising from their ashes,"As soon as the early 2000s, niche perfumes’ growth facilitated the return on the market of old French companies that had disappeared after the 1929 economic crisis and World War Two. Most of these beautiful sleeping brands are houses that had their hour of glory under the Ancien Régime or in the golden age of modern perfumery, before sinking or falling into oblivion after the Roaring Twenties. At the dawn of the third millennium, a few entrepreneurs managed to give them a new lease of life by joining the search for rarity and craftsmanship – either real or mythologized. Among others, this trend lives on a need for roots and legitimacy which the history of an old house actually meets, analyzes Diane Thalheimer, expert in perfumes and founder of consulting agency Red Berry. “It is easier to launch a brand with a base than starting from scratch.” On the other hand, the retro movement is on a roll, conveying a reassuring message. However, to be successful, the marketing arguments and olfactory experience should be consistent. “Santa Maria Novella  is a perfect example of this: the design and perfumes ideally embrace the DNA of this old Italian house from Florence” – the creations are signed by great names and the style is polished, in line with the brand’s spirit. No doubt the Lubin house, a pioneer of this movement, is now one of the most acknowledged. Its creator, Pierre-François Lubin, became the Perfumer of the French Royal Court in 1815, and it did well until the war’s aftermath. In 2003, as the brand was about to disappear, Gilles Thévenin purchased it from Mülhens. And if it slowly took off again starting from 2005, since then, the brand has definitely broadened its range with re-releases and new launches. It has also opened its own store in the quarter of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in Paris. There is also Teo Cabanel, a small perfume house born at the dawn of modern perfumery – and a favourite of the Duchess of Windsor’s in the 1930s. Fallen into abeyance during the 20th century, it rose from its ashes in 2005. Today, the brand counts more than ten references with rich, sophisticated formulas. Another icon of the genre, Houbigant, the renowned house that lived through the French Revolution, saw its prestige fade after WWII and started declining in the 1980s. Reborn in the 2000s, it settled in several prestigious addresses of the niche, collaborating with famous perfumers, like Jean-Claude Ellena. The opening of points of sale specialized in perfumery intensified this phenomenon, as it offered companies more visibility: the revival of iconic 1920s brand Jovoy by François Hénin was followed by the inauguration of a luxurious store for the public to (re)discover old houses, like Isabey, Lubin, Maison d’Orsay, or Le Galion, a house founded in 1936 that met success thanks to Paul Vacher, Miss Dior’s legendary perfumer, and resurrected by Nicolas Chabaud in 2014. These brands open out more easily in this ideal environment than a department store, where niche and selective brands are mixed. The situation is much different for young arrivals: there are limited places in physical points of sale. In addition, old houses also count among the brands that most radically implement the codes of modernity, massively turning to digital networks for both communication and distribution. For example, when three young graduates of the French École Supérieure du Parfum decided to breathe new life into Violet, with the help of perfumer Nathalie Lorson, they quickly chose to mix the traditional channel with online selling. Plus, their collection covers different genres combining inspirations from old formulas revisited with a palette of current ingredients and, more recently, limited editions with a modern style launched through crowdfunding. The same goes for Marcelle Dormoy, a house whose history was written in the early 1920s. Created by an independent dressmaker whose creations included perfumes, the brand disappeared in the aftermath of the war, unable to find any rescuer. It was eventually brought out of oblivion by Louise du Bessey, who was seduced by the creator’s avant-garde feminism. She revived the brand with three new fragrances signed by Karine Chevalier. From the very beginning, Louise du Bessey banked on the digital channel, where “small brands enjoy more proximity with the public”. She also made this choice because she noticed “a deceleration of traditional distribution: Millennials no longer identify with it, and stores are ill-adapted to small brands.” If online selling made new concepts successful, like Sillages Paris, which was entirely designed for this particular distribution channel, it may seem a bit bold for brands that capitalize on their old roots. And yet, paradoxically, it may be less risky for them than traditional distribution, in particular due to the better margin it can offer. According to Louise du Bessey, the idea is to “offer qualitative perfumes for an affordable price”. In addition, the social media game actually gives small players more chances than traditional channels. Rarity, beautiful materials, the search for meaning, originality, and alternative distribution are the main drivers for these brands’ revival, as they pick up elements from their heritages to enhance their creations and storytelling, while using modern tools."
"Brits ready to return into beauty shops, but not with just any condition","Are British beauty addicts prepared for the reopening of brick and mortar beauty stores? According to The NPD Group, 29% of UK consumers would not queue to buy beauty products. The Global information company said results from its COVID-19 Consumer Sentiment Pulse Survey also show that 35% are not prepared to wait when testing a beauty product and 26% would not line up to pay. “6% would be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more to enter the store, test a product and pay. A wait of 10 minutes appears to be the preferred time that would-be shoppers are prepared to wait in line, with 29% happy to wait this long to enter a store, 26% to test a product and 28% to pay,” found the survey. A part of consumers do expect to return to bricks and mortar stores. Almost one third (32%) would be prepared to shop in town or a city centre, 22% would visit a retail park or shopping centre, and just 15% would shop in a small store. However, shopping from home is the most popular option: 43% said they would visit an online shopping site for their beauty essentials. Furthermore, shoppers are less inclined to casually shop and browse, as one third of consumers said it is very unlikely they will go shopping without a specific purchase or product in mind. Hygiene and social distancing will be paramount. As bricks and mortar stores reopen, the in-store experience need to be adapted, particularly the testing process for products. Indeed, 82% of respondents said they were apprehensive about trying a beauty product in-store. Brands and supplier have therefore already provided makeup or perfume tests compliant with sanitary requirements and are working on touchless solutions. In addition, 59% buyers expect stores to enforce social distancing during the shopping experience. 54% believe increased hand sanitisation options in retail outlets are a must. 48% believe that disposable testers are essential, and 46% expect that counter staff to wear face coverings. There is some optimism in the study as nearly 70% of consumers believe their financial situation will remain the same or improve in six months-time. There is greater optimism amongst 18-34 year old’s who felt positive about their financial situation in six months compared to 33% of 35-54 year old’s and 13% in the 55+ age group. Making up for lost time, 25% of consumers plan to purchase prestige beauty to make-up for missed occasions like birthdays for friends and family or to celebrate the end of lockdown. “Visiting bricks and mortar stores is an exciting prospect for many consumers and queuing and social distancing will become the norm. Beauty buyers in our survey are willing to queue but ensuring a short wait time will be critical to benefit the maximum number of people who want to shop,” said Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty."
"After hygiene, solid products are revolutionizing skincare","Stick foundations, highlighters, blushes, concealers… makeup already offers many solid products for their functional, travel-size, and easy-to-use qualities. Non-deformable and totally or almost totally deprived of water, solid cosmetics are also gaining ground in the hygiene category, due to the no pack movement. Solid shampoos, shower gels, and toothpaste have conquered cosmetics departments, initially driven by small independent brands with a natural and organic profile, before the trend was followed by mass market giants: N.A.E. for Henkel, Love Beauty and Planet for Unilever, L’Oréal… And yet, it is still hard to assess the size of this market. “In the United States, for example, most of the brands that have entered this market are indie brands that do not appear in Nielsen or NPD statistics. In Europe, it is estimated that this market represents 5% of the cosmetics market, but according to the current forecasts, it will soon achieve a strong growth. In France, solid cosmetics make up a very dynamic market with different brand typologies: there are independent (Respire, Umaï), professional (Christophe Robin, Cut by Fred), but also masstige brands (Yes To, Sephora…)”, explains Stéphanie Reymond, founder and Director of Effervescience, a technical and marketing consulting agency specialized in beauty. French independent pioneer brand Lamazuna perfectly embodies this boom. Initially focused on the zero waste concept applied to the bathroom, Lamazuna was launched ten years ago with reusable cleansing wipes. Then, starting from 2014, they developed solid cosmetics: toothpaste, deodorants, shampoos, and conditioners with 100% natural and vegan formulas. The COSMOS-Organic-labelled solid conditioner was released in May 2020. Today, the brand counts over 50 references and achieves a 10-million-euro turnover with 30% export sales. “We used to be a small natural and organic brand and we have become a consumer brand,” says founder Laëtitia van de Walle. It only took a few years for solid products to reach new consumer profiles. “In 2015, our consumers were mostly young urban girls. Now, there are as many men as there are women, and no more age limits,” adds the creator. “Demand evolves at the same pace as consumers change the way they make a purchase, taking action for the environment. These new consumer-actors make the offering evolve towards new proposals,” confirms Stéphanie Reymond. Laëtitia van de Walle reveals she now aims to focus her innovation work on the skincare segment. There are countless galenic possibilities, most of which are inspired from makeup: stick serums and sun products already exist, as well as cleansing or exfoliating powders, pebbles… but the trend can still evolve if things are considered from other angles. “Drivers include raw materials, formulas, technology transfers derived from other industries, packaging… but solid cosmetics could also grow by entering the luxury market,” explains Stéphanie Reymond. The movement emerged a while ago. For example, in 2018, the Sicaf laboratory, which belongs to the Anjac group, focused their R&D strategy for solid cosmetics on the prestige market. “We wanted to develop solid products for premium brands, while guaranteeing the sensoriality and efficacy of a standard cosmetic product. It was a huge challenge because it did not exist,” explains Béatrice Anthouard, Formulation & Prospective Director of Sicaf. In 2019, the laboratory introduced a first range at Cosmetagora which won the formulation award. This range reproduced all standard skincare gestures in sticks: cleansers, masks, scrubs, serums, creams, eye contours… “Starting from that moment, we noticed a real craze among our customers and prospects, not only from the natural segment, but also premium brands,” says Béatrice Anthouard. To preserve sensoriality, the laboratory has not completely got rid of water in their formulas: they turn gel textures and emulsions into solid formulas. “It is definitely possible to obtain a stick with water. It is a technical feat we have just industrialized,” adds the Director. The second generation to be launched next autumn does not comprise any pack, this time, and the formulas are exclusively anhydrous in order to reduce water consumption, in line with the Blue Beauty movement. “It is a real challenge to offer solid face care products without any packaging, while preserving sensoriality and performance. The formulas need to be designed with actives that provide interesting results, but which can also resist high temperatures for several hours,” says Béatrice Anthouard. For this five- to six-product face care range, the laboratory worked on solid formulas and on the ergonomics of finished products by drawing inspiration from facialist techniques, which have come back to the fore. “Consumers will need to get used to these new gestures, but the Covid crisis is actually a positive catalyser,” adds Anne Rutigliano, Marketing and Communication Director of the Anjac Group, to which the Sicaf laboratory belongs. This differentiating approach has already seduced several brands: according to Sicaf, they are already discussing future launches based on the concept. Simple, but efficient gestures, the return to basics, health security… all these consumption criteria related to the current crisis will also boost the development of solid formulas in cosmetics. To accelerate innovation in this field, next autumn, the Effervescience agency will launch the STAR (Solid Technical Accelerator Responsible) Cosmetic Programme in partnership with Tectic. The idea is to create and coordinate a network of players in this segment, decipher and analyze the market, trends, and scientific and technical challenges, and inspire opportunities and insights in relation to solid cosmetics."
"Demand for sun protection products to remain strong, despite COVID-19 impact","According to Fact.MR, the Covid-19 pandemic has shrunk the growth of the sun care products market in several regions. During stringent lockdown, North America and some countries of Europe have witnessed a sluggish demand for sun protection products. In the United States, for instance, sales declined by nearly 20% by the end of March 2020 owing to prevalence of work from home conditions. However, in countries like Indonesia, China, Japan, and in other Asian countries, demand has remained intact. Fact-MR expects the impact of the pandemic to remain for the first two quarters and to recover by the end of the third quarter. The market research firm thus maintains its forecasts: – The global market of sun protection products is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 7% during 2020-2030.
– The North American market is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 7% during 2020-2030 owing to the growing per capita spending on cosmeceutical products.
– Self-tanning care products are expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 7% by 2020-2030, owing to per capita spending for self-tanning products in regions like Europe and Asia.
– East Asia is set to clock an absolute $ opportunity of nearly US $ 3 Bn. during 2020-2030, owing to the rising demand for products with anti-aging and anti-pollution ingredients.
– The European market for natural oil as a sun protection product is expected to grow by 2X during 2020-2030, owing to the convenience of applying the product. North America and Europe presently account for nearly one third of the global sun protection product consumption, with new opportunities linked to a large number of people suffering from sensitive skin issues and rising demand for clean beauty trends. In recent years, players of the sun protection products market have therefore shifted to natural oil ingredients (commonly extracted from carrot seeds, coconut oil, raspberry seeds, and several other natural products) as a solution to attract consumers with a growing preference for organic products. However, according to Fact.MR, East Asia and South Asian markets are among the most lucrative regions in the market and are expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 8% during 2020-2030. Per capita spending in this region is expected to increase in markets like China, India, Japan and Indonesia owing to higher expenditure on sun protection products for hair and skin."
"Online sales of prestige beauty soar in France, driven by skin care","Despite the closure of beauty salons, perfumeries, and department stores, French women have not completely suspended their skincare routine during the quarantine period. Indeed, online sales took over and allowed some of them to transform their bathroom into a real at-home beauty salon. According to the latest report from The NPD Group, online sales of prestige cosmetics [1] generated 21.6 million euros in April 2020, with a total of 491,000 units sold, representing an increase of 73% in value and 69% in units compared to the same period a year earlier. Skin care is the category that most appealed to French women during the compulsory social distancing period. Face and body care products accounted for 37% of online purchases of prestige beauty products in April 2020 (while in April 2019 they accounted for 29% of online purchases and 18% of total purchases in the selective channel), while online sales more than doubled. As far as face care products are concerned, online sales thus rose by 3.4 million euros compared to April 2019, a rise of 153%. In this category, the big winners are face care creams, serums, exfoliators and masks. The sunny weather during April 2020 in France also boosted online sales of sunscreen products, which increased 223% compared to April 2019. Regarding body care products the rise was even more impressive with online sales skyrocketing by 225% in April, mainly driven by scrubs, oils and food supplements. During the very first weeks of the lockdown, online sales struggled to take over from physical stores. However, the interest of consumers for at home well-being products - which was pointed out by Pinterest, for instance - finally materialized in e-commerce during the second phase of confinement, in France as in most developed countries, as found by Contentsquare. “After the shock that followed the announcement of the lockdown and first quarantine measures, consumers have adapted their purchasing behaviour and online sales have accelerated week after week. The period that we have just passed did not fundamentally turn trends upside-down but had an accelerating effect on phenomena which began to emerge before the crisis such as the replacement of makeup routines by skincare ones,” said Mathilde Lion, beauty expert Europe at The NDP Group."
"Waxed chests, face masks, beard oil: Indian millennials defy gender norms","After exfoliating his face and buffing his nails, Lakshay Narula crossed another grooming frontier - applying hair removal cream to his chest and with it, upending India’s rigid gender norms. ""I spend 15 minutes on my hair alone and a day prior to shoots, I exfoliate my face and use traditional herbal face packs,"" Mumbai-based television anchor Narula told AFP. ""I am a man and am doing it for myself to feel confident."" Hair removal cream did not seem like a radical step, the 29-year-old said. ""It felt fantastic,"" he told AFP, adding that it was time to drop the idea of men ""grooming (themselves) only to impress women."" From charcoal face scrubs to beard oils to tinted moisturisers, Indian start-ups are hoping to capture the attention of appearance-conscious professionals like Narula. With one in four Indians owning a smartphone - the majority of them male - social media is a key battleground for pushing products challenging symbols of masculinity from an earlier era, like the 1990s Bollywood ’action hero’ covered in sweat and grime. Today, the movies are more likely to feature stars who never have a hair out of place, even as they deploy flying kicks to beat up bad guys. Advertising styling gel, as Bollywood star Ranveer Singh has done, is a natural next step. Veet, a brand owned by British giant Reckitt Benckiser, turned to heart-throb Kartik Aaryan to flog its hair removal cream to more adventurous customers. Popular actor Ayushmann Khurrana even bought a stake in beauty start-up The Man Company (TMC), whose competitors have recruited social media influencers for endorsements. But creating a market for previously unheard-of products often requires extra effort. ""When we launched a charcoal peel-off mask, we made explainer videos"" for men unfamiliar with the product, TMC founder Hitesh Dhingra told AFP. The firm also uses Instagram to encourage customers to share selfies with their products, he added. The model seems to be working - Narula says the same friends who earlier mocked his skincare regimen are now asking him for product recommendations. Even the coronavirus pandemic hasn’t deterred Narula, who says he is taking advantage of hair salons being closed during the lockdown to try new hairdos for video conferences and work calls. As well as giving him confidence when he goes live on Instagram, ""the whole process is very therapeutic amid the rising stress levels,"" he said. According to research firm EuroMonitor International, India’s male grooming industry grew 10 percent between 2017 and 2018, with sales topping 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion). Traditional consumer giants are also hopping on the bandwagon by investing in grooming start-ups. India’s Emami Group conglomerate purchased a 30 percent stake in TMC, while Colgate-Palmolive and Mumbai-based Marico Limited both own stakes in rival start-ups Bombay Shaving Company and Beardo. N. Chandramouli, chief of brand insights agency TRA Research, told AFP large firms were supporting start-ups instead of trying to market their own products ""because they feel that these smaller players have a sense of intimacy with the consumer"". ""A lot of brands are now speaking directly to men,"" Che Kurrien, editor of GQ India, told AFP. ""So, exposure levels are very high, and it’s very hard not to get influenced."" With prices starting at 150 rupees ($2) for face wash, the products are relatively affordable and even self-described ""low maintenance"" men - those who followed a soap-and-shave routine - have switched gears. ""Grooming helps men land better jobs, have better romantic prospects or get access to nightclubs,"" Mumbai-based communications executive Suraj Balakrishnan, 30, whose regimen includes oils for his beard, body and hair, told AFP. ""When you look good, you tend to feel good... looking well-groomed and well-dressed gives you an edge."" Savvy entrepreneurs have also latched on to the trend by launching beauty salons targeting men and offering services from facials to manicures to waxing. Unlike their corporate counterparts, niche grooming brands are not shy about tackling controversial issues. A TMC social media campaign for Valentine’s Day featured a gay couple, a man applying lipstick, and a father struggling with body image issues. It garnered 16,000 likes on Instagram - with users applauding the company for shooting down toxic masculinity norms. Like South Korea and Japan, which boast thriving markets for male beauty products, India’s grooming industry exists against the backdrop of a notoriously sexist culture. Many wonder whether the changes it posits are merely skin-deep. ""We are still in the throes of change,"" said Balakrishnan. ""Grooming physically does not mean you’re shifting lifelong attitudes completely. Transition takes time."""
Online beauty shopping is becoming an even more usual habit amid coronavirus,"Following an initial drop off in traffic, in France and the United Kingdom, online beauty retailers have seen an impressive increase in visits and an uplift in the amount of time being spent on their sites, as well as a strong rise of transactions, throughout the lockdown period. Despite this global uplift in online sales, some countries have been slower to benefit. In France, online sales of cosmetics have been longer to return to their pre-epidemic level and have not increased as much as in the UK and US. According to Contentsquare, the gradual upturn in online beauty sales corresponds to the evolution of consumers’ priorities during the period. After an initial focus on basic necessities (food, health products, etc.), consumers directed their purchases towards equipping their home for its new functionalities (office, school, leisure) with a rise in technological products, media, decoration ... Once these questions were settled, beauty, fashion and luxury returned to their position in the mind of online shoppers. “With so many countries going into lockdown and people being advised to stay home, it would be easy to assume that consumers aren’t going to worry about their morning beauty routines. In fact, the opposite is true. Consumers are focused on their personal well-being. Many are finding they have more time to devote to beauty and health goals they’ve had for a while and often these activities provide stress relief as well,” said Aimee Stone Munsell, CMO at Contentsquare. Reflecting both the closure of brick-and-mortar businesses and this desire to indulge oneself, luxury cosmetic have been acclaimed online. “Renewed interest in beauty products may also reflect the way many players in the beauty industry have been focusing their promotions. We’ve seen many brands offering discounts and pushing luxury hand soaps and other necessities to the front of their homepages. This is helping to combine health, beauty and wellbeing in the minds of consumers,” concluded Aimee Stone Munsell."
"""Our exhibitors will be visible online"", Sandra Maguarian, MakeUp in Paris","Premium Beauty News - The MakeUp in Paris trade show, which was due to be held in June, will eventually take place under a 100% digital format. Sandra Maguarian - Yes, it was really with great sadness that we had to make the decision to cancel MakeUp in Paris 2020 because, on the one hand, of a government decree, and because, on the other hand, and as we can witness today in France, health conditions are still not optimal for the organization of an event of this size. In this context, we wish to offer our community a means of developing its activity and of maintaining dynamic links between the various players in the market. Hence, in addition to our shows, we are launching a platform that fits perfectly into our ecosystem in order to continue our mission as a beauty service provider for the industry. This platform will give exhibitors and visitors facing budget restrictions and/or busy agendas the chance to always be visible, to successfully conclude negotiations, meet new partners, boost their business, etc. Our VVs (Virtual Visitors) will be able to both contact their usual suppliers and identify new ones, discover novelties, participate to online conferences, listen to replays, read articles on upcoming trends... Registration for visitors will be free and filtered/moderated by our teams. An exceptional video-conference will mark the launch of this platform, which will be operational all year round, and whose name will be www.Beauteamatch.com. Premium Beauty News - How do your exhibitors feel about this future digital experience? Sandra Maguarian - Well paradoxically, all those with whom I had the opportunity to speak to assured me that their factories/laboratories were running, whether in France or abroad. Often for the manufacturing of essential products for the medical staff but also to fulfil the orders of many brands who mostly sell online. My doubts are more on a one-year term, even if I remain convinced that the make-up/hybrid shift will be the keystone of the new make-up consumption trend which, unlike the skincare segment, will suffer more from this Covid19 period. But our exhibitors are full of resources, they innovate continuously and actually most of them have already positioned themselves on our platform. Premium Beauty News – As for the other events, MakeUp in Shanghai should take place in July and MakeUp in New York in September. How are the prospects? Sandra Maguarian - The recovery in China reinforces the idea that MakeUp in Shanghai will take place in the best possible conditions in early July. We have recorded no cancellations from Chinese exhibitors. They will all take part to the event and I wish to thank them for that. Actually new exhibitors have even showed up, shortly after the lock-down was lifted by Chinese authorities. Of course visitors from outside China will not make the trip, but Chinese visors alone should suffice to satisfy our exhibitors. As for MakeUp in New York, we remain vigilant and if the slightest security doubt persists, we will make the necessary decisions. One of the reasons for the positioning of our shows in different markets is to limit long distance trips and to satisfy local markets. This is why the impact of the possible disaffection of foreign visitors is relatively low. Premium Beauty News - In New York, if things turn out right, you are supposed to inaugurate a new venue, the Javits Center. Can you give us a sneak preview of what this edition will look like? Sandra Maguarian - Yes, we hesitated for a long time before embarking on this new adventure at the very famous Javits Center. One of the halls of this exhibition centre is unparalleled in New York with a huge glass roof that offers a beautiful luminosity. The Javits has become in a few years ""the place to be"", certainly thanks to the total rehabilitation of the Hudson Yards quarter, not to mention the subway station at the foot of the building. We can’t wait to show it to you. Premium Beauty News - Finally, you have planned to launch a new event dedicated to Clean Beauty in London. What are the prospects like? Sandra Maguarian - It’s an extraordinary impetus that has driven us to create this very first event dedicated to Clean Beauty, a must. Suppliers are showing a great deal of interest and are registering spontaneously to the event, as for brands they almost blamed us for not having launched this event earlier! We created a Steering Committee consisting of international personalities and organizations in connection with the Clean Beauty movement. Committee members will meet in the coming days.... by video-conference of course!"
"Hit hard, the luxury industry will emerge from the crisis with a new face","Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many luxury companies have pivoted to address urgent public-health needs: factories that produced scarves and perfumes now manufacture face masks and hand sanitizers, and many luxury groups have made monetary or product donations to hospitals and other not-for-profit organizations. In a longer-term, with millions of people relying on the luxury-goods industry to make a living, this unprecedented crisis forces luxury players to jump into the future now. With 20 to 30 percent of revenues generated by consumers making luxury purchases outside their home countries, the industry is heavily dependent on ""global shoppers"". [1] The suspension of most international travels therefore had an immediate effect on sales, and the impact was amplified by the closure of shops and the great confinement which followed the global spread of the virus. As the pandemic is shaking some of the foundational aspects of the luxury industry sales are set to contract between 20-35% in 2020 according to Bain & Company. [2] Actually, according to the market research firm, after strong start to the year in all key regions (Mainland China, Europe, America), the collapse of tourism and the imposition of lockdowns led to an estimated 25 percent drop of sales in the first quarter of 2020. Luxury sales in Japan and the rest of Asia also declined, albeit at a slightly slower pace. For its part, Euromonitor estimates the fall in sales of luxury goods to 18% in 2020, with no category being immune to the pandemic. [3] Most of the main luxury markets will be impacted: -25% for North America, -22% for mainland China (but only -5% in Japan and -1% in South Korea), between -15% ( United Kingdom) and -26% (Switzerland) in Western Europe, where the German market is expected to decline by 23%, France and Italy by 20%. From the start of the crisis, online sales have remained resilient. When stores are closed, e-commerce is a crucial channel for keeping sales up, communicating with customers, and forging a sense of community around a brand? For the future, McKinsey therefore recommends brands to accelerate their digital investments and shift media spending to online channels. According to Bain & Company, the online channel, already experiencing double-digit growth in 2019, will continue to gain share and account for up to 30 percent of the market by 2025. This goes hand-in-hand with the younger generations (Gen Y and Gen Z) becoming the majority of the luxury market. Furthermore, as China has begun to lead the way toward a recovery, Chinese consumers are set to cement their status as crucial drivers of the industry, accounting for nearly half of all purchases worldwide by 2025, according to Bain. As a region, mainland China will account for 28 percent of the luxury market, up from 11 percent in 2019. “There will be a recovery for the luxury market but the industry will be profoundly transformed,” said Claudia D’Arpizio, a Bain & Company partner and lead author of the study. However, it will take time for the market to recover. Bain & Company anticipates that a recovery to 2019 levels will not occur until 2022 or 2023. Market growth will resume gradually from then on, reaching an estimated EUR 320-330 billion by 2025."
“Less is More”: the new normal after Covid-19 in the USA?,"During the confinement, life in the big cities reorganizes, public transports are free but one must enter the bus through the door in the middle of the bus and not approach the driver. Gym classes and religious services moved on-line. In New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, the quarantine started late... women wanted to get their hair and nails done before solitary confinement. There was +3% growth in the two months of January and February, with skin care outperforming perfume and makeup (NPD). The National Retail Association had a provision of $350 billion dollars to protect small businesses. Their employees would benefit from 39 weeks of unemployment (instead of the usual 26) and they would receive an additional aid of 600$ per week. Finally, a tax credit of 15 billion dollars was allocated to those businesses that did not fire their workers. Today, the authorities in New York announced a return to the ’new normal’ by mid May at best, and Chanel has guaranteed wages for its Beauty Advisors working for their company at  Saks until that date. Three companies that are doing well during the crisis are Amazon, Walmart, & Target – they’ve rarely done better. Early in the pandemic, they put in place services to help elderly or handicapped clients. They managed to keep prices down for “essential” and “non-essential” products, while in stores in towns, prices rose. Walmart opened their Super Centers an hour earlier, and limited the number of customers by  taking appointments in order to help those with reduced mobility. Scooters were made available for clients, as well as employees who would assist each client with their shopping list and a cart. Aisles were made into one-way traffic in order to limit people passing each other and to help make shopping faster. All the goods were loaded into peoples’ cars or delivered to their homes. Walmart pharmacies, which usually had long waiting lines, opened a 24/24 exclusively drive through with very good results. At the beginning of the crisis, Amazon was hiring 100,000 employees, Walmart 10,000, and Target 9,000. Target and Walmart also announced they were looking for more local brands as well as local suppliers for their stores. During their confinement, American women were determined not to give up their beauty regimes: haircare, nail-care, and eyelash extensions were not to be abandoned. On March 13, the government asked dermatologists to reschedule all non-essential appointments until further order. Some have decided to take a break from intensive dermatologist treatments, certainly not for acne. Dermatologists have seen an important rise in irritations due to intensive use of hydro-alcoholic gels. Kline has announced a severe recession, a 2.5% fall in beauty care products - all the way to 80% for certain brands. Hygiene and haircare are already coming out ahead. Most likely quality will replace quantity regarding products. “Less is more”, will become the new normal."
UK beauty addicts indulge themselves with nail products during lockdown,"Historically, the “lipstick theory” has proven true, with lipsticks (during the four recessions from 1973 through 2001) and eye makeup (in the most recent 2008-2009 recession) performing exceptionally well during recessionary times. With the global economy heading towards what is likely to be a historic recession, will nail colours - and more generally nail care products - be the beauty product consumers choose to indulge themselves during difficult times? Amidst the Covid-19 epidemic, sales of online nail products reported double-digit growth in the UK’s first weeks of lockdown, according to The NPD Group. Sales of prestige nail products online increased 12% in the week beginning 16th March 2020, when the general public were instructed to work from home, avoid pubs and restaurants and implement social distancing. In the week beginning 23rd March 2020, following the government order for all non-essential businesses to close, online sales of prestige nail products increased 24% compared to the same period in 2019. “With nail salons and beauty businesses closed, UK consumers turned to at-home manicure rituals to maintain their nails and boost their mood,” commented The NPD Group in a statement. Of course, the total value of online sales alone remains modest compared to total sales during normal times. In the week beginning 23rd March 2020 consumers spent £23,000 online buying prestige nail colour (average price £14.69). Sales of base coats/topcoats increased 102%, sales of colour enamel increased 18% and sales of nail care increased 13%. During this phase of lockdown, pink, red and beige were the top three most popular shades. As far as brands and products are concerned, the best-selling nail colours of the period are (The NPD Group): Top Five Best-Selling Prestige Nail Colours (in alphabetical order) Chanel - Le Vernis Long Wear 18 Rouge Noir
Chanel - Le Vernis Long Wear 504 Organdi
Chanel - Le Vernis Long Wear 562 Coralium
Dior - Vernis Rouge 999
YSL - La Laque Couture 01 Rouge Pop Art “The increase in sales of nail products online, particularly intense nail enamel shades, indicates that nail care could be the ‘Covid-19 Lipstick Effect’. Consumers are increasingly turning to self-care and home based beauty treatments like at-home manicures to improve wellbeing and boost their mood. An application of nail polish is quick, simple and provides an instant result,” said Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty."
"The U.S. beauty market could decline by 2.5%, the steepest drop ever","The recession due to the Covid-19 pandemic will resemble nothing known since WW2. Previously forecast to grow at a CAGR of 3.8% through 2023, Kline has revised its forecasts for the USD 75 billion U.S. market due to the unfolding crisis. New forecasts, published by Kline last week in a special report on the topic [1], indicate a decline of 2.5% in 2020 as the most likely outcome, with the best-case scenario reflecting a 1.5% gain and the worst-case scenario at an 8.1% drop. Such a drop has no precedent. So far, the 0.8% drop in 2009 during the last recession is the biggest market dip ever reported by Kline. The only other time Kline noted a market decrease was a 0.3% falloff in 1991 amid another recession. “Given the unprecedented situation that is unfolding globally as both a health crisis as well as a financial one, it is not surprising that the beauty market should experience its worst performance now,” says Carrie Mellage, Vice President of Kline’s Consumer Products Practice. “Even our worst-case scenario of -8% probably does not feel steep enough given the dark days we are all living, but there are enough essential categories in the mix to keep the market stable.” Indeed, Kline’s forecasting analysis clusters beauty categories into four groups: – Rescue categories, such as hand sanitizers and liquid hand soaps, that will experience spiked levels;
– Everyday basics, like shampoos and deodorants, which consumers are expected to more or less use as usual;
– Soothing solutions, such as facial skin care and nail polishes, which are expected to decline near term but may benefit from consumers turning to them as a treat and/or to maintain or establish a part of their routine they can still control;
– Can-wait categories, including fragrances and colour cosmetics, which are expected to decline sharply during social distancing of the health crisis and continue to suffer during the economic fallout in the years to come. “The cosmetics market will undoubtedly suffer in 2020 and in the years to come, but we expect it to recover within three to five years as it has in all past recessions,” says Mellage. “Compared to other industries, the beauty market is fairly recession-proof, and its products will continue to be desired by consumers - both for meeting basic needs as well as an indulgence.” Historically, the “lipstick theory” has proven true, with lipsticks (during the four recessions from 1973 through 2001) and eye makeup (in the most recent 2008-2009 recession) performing exceptionally well during recessionary times. “Perhaps we’ll have another winner in the mix this time too,” concludes Mellage."
Cosmetic dermatology: Five key trends spotted at IMCAS 2020,"The global medical aesthetics market is projected to reach USD 17.07 billion by 2023 from USD10.30 billion in 2018. “Botox and fillers” remains the leading category in terms of value (51.5%) in 2019. That’s an estimated increase of 9.2% yearly until 2023. On the other hand, invasive surgical treatments have fallen by 14.5% over the past year. Artificial intelligence and the integration of robotics propelling the industry to another level, was the biggest message coming from the lectures and the exhibitions. Robotics and AI with visions systems are increasingly going to be assisting in aesthetic procedures. The highlight of the show, no doubt, was the world premiere of NextMotion, a ‘world first’ AI managed injector robot. A robotic arm equipped with a vision system and artificial intelligence that allows it to autonomously deliver the treatment plans decided by doctors. Combined with an electronic syringe it can steadily deliver calibrated doses to the thousand of a millimetre, with a very high accuracy, both in the positioning of the points as in the injected volumes. Virtual reality was another strong theme. The days of patients having to visit a doctor face to face in a clinic setting are not a necessity. Increasingly, consultations will be delivered in a virtual world model with a new type of clinician, the “virtualist” through web-based portals. It is already effective at skincheckonline.com: patients can upload selfies of themselves and the doctor uses AI to acts as its eyes. In cosmeceuticals, AI for skincare is growing. Universkin provides skincare customized by doctors using AI. Using an AI digital assistant and a very thorough dermatological questionnaire which is verified by image analysis, Universkin is able to create a personalized treatment plan. It’s no longer about being masculine or feminine. There is a move away from extreme femininity and masculinity, in favour of an androgynous look. The male metrosexual is fading away, as male patients are becoming increasingly interested in women’s procedures. Chin augmentation and jaw reshaping, high cheekbones, smooth skin, a thin and straight nose and a plump and luscious mouth are the new desires from men. A drive for female features that are slightly masculine are the new desire for women. A slightly masculine jaw and a straight nose. It’s like having a tattoo. They want to express themselves. A recent overhaul in regulations in Europe has resulted in more rigorous scrutiny of medical device manufacturers and greater emphasis on patient safety. Specifically, the new regulation will demand that manufacturers of medical devices for sale within the EU must adhere to strict guidelines to ensure that their products are safe to use and ensure patient safety. A growth in procedures to challenge typical beauty norms was another strong theme at IMCAS. Recreating looks and giving patients the freedom to do that. A perfect example of this was Strōma Medical that uses lasers to disintegrate eye pigments, turning dark eyes into blue ones, although it turns out more of a green. But there is no way to reverse it as its permanent. The Strōma technology is not yet commercially available and is subject to more clinical trials. The brand messaging and imagery displayed by aesthetic brands at IMCAS was all about redefining attitudes, towards the accessibility and acceptability of aesthetic procedures in people across all ages and genders. In summary Consumer demand continues to drive non-invasive procedures to the top of all aesthetic procedures. The Aesthetic market is fully part of the mainstream, and appeals to all genders and ages. Androgynous looks are coming. No gender stereotypes anymore, as males are attracted to female features and women are attracted to male features. The use of technology will play an increasingly significant role across all areas of aesthetic medicine, but will not replace doctors. It will be used as an essential tool to improve patients safety and outcomes. Regulations within the industry  are much needed, and we can expect that similar regulations to the ones that we see coming to Europe will expand globally in the not too distant future. With other global regions following the MDR lead."
Skincare and fragrances drive prestige beauty sales in Germany,"Within the five largest countries for sales of prestige beauty products in Europe, which are tracked by The NPD Group, Germany has the biggest prestige beauty market in value sales, after UK and France. Among these three markets, Germany is the only country that didn’t show an overall decline in sales in 2019, thanks to a dynamic e-commerce channel. With sales of prestige beauty products reaching EUR 3.2 billion, the German prestige beauty market remained flat in 2019 compared to the previous year [1], with fragrances and skincare increasing by 1 percent and 3 percent, respectively, and makeup declining 4 percent. [2] With net sales totalling EUR 1.7 billion, fragrances still represent the biggest prestige beauty category in Germany. As in other developed markets, sales continue to be propelled by the growth in stronger concentrations: perfumes grew by +38 percent while eau de parfums increased by +10 percent. However, these segments only account for a small share in overall fragrance sales. “While juices overall continued to grow in the market, gift sets declined after last year’s stable result. We also see a slight decline in brick and mortar for fragrances while online continues to grow, especially driven by bigger fragrances sizes in e-commerce,” added The NPD Group. Skincare, the second largest category in Europe’s prestige beauty market, grew faster compared to fragrances. According to The NPD Group, a key factor contributing to skincare’s annual performance in Germany is the double-digit growth of online sales. Indeed, e-commerce now reaches 20 percent of the category sales, while the growth of brick and mortar sales was slightly negative in 2019. In total, the category brought in EUR 0.8 billion this year, with ‘German’ and / or ‘natural’ brands as the top growth contributors. Looking at specific segments of the market, facial moisturizers and anti-aging, especially through products such as serums, grew in value sales. Also, beauty supplements continue to be a trend that’s contributing to growth in Germany’s prestige skincare market. Makeup had a tough year in 2019. According to The NPD Group, with a total result of EUR 0.7 billion sales in 2019, the category lost EUR 28 million compared to the previous year. Eye products, especially eye shadow palettes, were under pressure, but the face and lip segments did not escape the drop in sales. “My one word to characterize the beauty industry in 2019 was ‘consciousness’ - the beauty consumer becomes more and more aware of the ingredients, environmentally friendly production and reputation of a beauty product”, said Samantha Grand, Germany Beauty Executive Director at The NPD Group. “Transparency and sustainability become more important, and consumers focus on the social and environmental impacts of their beauty products. This could be a benefit for G-Beauty brands [3] - brands that are manufactured and designed here in Germany, as well as it will be for any brands with natural or green positioning.” A report published last year by Naturkosmetik Konzepte already highlighted the dynamic growth of natural cosmetics in Germany which had gained more than a million consumers, all distribution channels combined, in 2018."
Beyond the crisis: COVID-19’s effect on consumer behaviour?,"The implementation of social distancing measures, including the encouragement to working from home, closure of bars, restaurants and most shops, have an immediate impact on consumption. As far as beauty products are concerned, the consumption of certain categories will certainly decline in  the short term. In China, where people first experimented compulsory lockdowns, Kantar Worldpanel observed a drop in hair washing frequency and #nohairwash being a popular hash tag in social media. [1] “We can foresee that in a short period, the related categories, such as hair shampoo, conditioner, will see a drop in purchasing. But in the medium to long term, with the relief of epidemic situation and people returning to work the hair care category will soon start to pick up,” said the market research firm. In China, Kantar also noted a huge short term impact on make-up products, with a strong decrease in the frequency of use. However, as far as these products  are concerned, a return to pre-epidemic habits might be more difficult. However, the increasing popularity of video conferencing, video dating, selfies and livestreaming on social networks mean many consumers - in particular the youngest ones – are still wearing makeup but they have adapted. In China and other Asian countries, some sophisticated females even invented ""face mask makeup styles"" focusing on eye makeup. In the short term, Kantar also notes a collapse in the use of fragrances during the lockdown period, since their use is strongly linked to social occasions. Nobody knows how long and how stringent lockdown measures will last in Europe and the Americas, it is pretty sure however that social distancing and hygiene habits (including frequent hand washing and the wearing of masks) will last. Led by hand wash / sanitizer, body cleansing is surely a hero category during the epidemic outbreak. The high level of use is due to continue as consumers will continue to focus on hygiene. And with the increasing frequency of washing hands, there will be an increased need for hand cream. The increased focus on cleanliness may also impact the way consumers consider ingredient safety. According to Mintel, the pandemic will have implications on the evolution of clean beauty.  Prior to Covid-19, consumers were increasingly reluctant regarding ingredients such as preservatives and artificial ingredients in their beauty products due to perceived health risks. In the future, “consumers will be more willing to accept these ingredients as long as brands provide evidence of efficacy and safety, both from a health and environmental perspective.” [2] As the arrival of the novel coronavirus will further push the notion that “natural isn’t always better” , it could also have an impact on emerging concerns such as the cutaneous and hair microbiome. “As consumers become more aware about viruses and germs living on surfaces, BPC products packaged in ways that eliminate the need to touch one’s face will stand out. Spray and stick formats in both cosmetics and facial skincare have been increasing in popularity, and with the arrival of COVID-19, “touchless” beauty products will see increased demand,” found Mintel. However, sustainability issues, as well as concerns related to shorter supply chains, and local productions, should also gain popularity, especially in Europe and North America. According to Mintel, this will encourage beauty makers to formulate without water. By offering products in a powder form, for instance, brands will appeal to consumers’ safety and environmental concerns. “Not only do waterless formulas reduce the need for preservatives, they also minimize waste,” said the trends agency. Finally, while the lockdown period is the occasion for new age categories and demographics to test both DIY and online shopping, the impact on traditional retail channels could be severe ..."
Skincare: Consumers love superfoods and high-tech beauty,"Health benefits of superfoods are well known and their success among consumers is now extending to skin care. Indeed, beauty products enriched with these “miracle” grains and fruits are becoming more and more popular with consumers. This development has been highlighted by the latest Stylight, which also noted a growing enthusiasm for high-tech beauty products, CBD infused skincare, clean beauty and anti-pollution products.] report on beauty trends for 2020. For example, there was a dramatic increase of 1,650% in clicks for Beekman 1802’s Pure Goat Milk Soap at the end of last month and a surge in interest in Peter Thomas Roth’s Pumpkin Enzyme Face Mask, which has been saved no less than 36,000 times in Sephora wishlists. So-called “clean beauty” products, which feature organic, natural or - at least - non controversial ingredients, are also increasingly sought-after by consumers. In particular, Stylight highlights an upsurge of interest in brands that are tagged as ""clean,"" most notably Briogeo, whose natural hair products recorded an increase of 800% in clicks over the last five months, and The Ordinary brand which registered an increase of 260% in clicks at the end of February. For some years now, high-tech has exerted a growing influence in the world of beauty, much to the delight of beauty addicts who now benefit from more effective home-care treatments. Facial cleansing brushes are particularly popular, notably those made by the Foreo brand, which saw a 465% increase in clicks at the beginning of 2020. Last but not least, in an extension of the trend for natural, vegan and protective treatments, there has been an increase in searches, clicks and purchases of cannabis-infused and anti-pollution products. To compile its report, Stylight analyzed data from October 2019 to February 2020, on the behavior of its users who together purchase more than 100,000 beauty products per month, via Stylight online platforms in Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom. Stylight searches 1,300 online shops at once and compare prices of more than 27 million products."
The coronavirus pandemic pushes the world economy into uncertainty,"The coronavirus pandemic is leading to a historic drop in equity markets globally, shut borders and disrupted daily life around the world, as governments took increasingly drastic measures to try to reduce the severity of the global outbreak. Far from having been contained in China, the viral outbreak has now caused more deaths outside the country than inside. Spain and France imposed severe lockdowns over the weekend, now followed by other European countries and by the United States. “The problem of technical disruptions in certain production chains has become a secondary issue. We are facing a brutal supply and demand breakdown that impacts multiple channels,"" said Olivier Passet, Director of Research at Xerfi. If many economists expect a violent but temporary shock with a recession over two quarters, depending on the area, the damage could nevertheless be significant. Beyond the transport and leisure industries, which are massively impacted, some start-ups that have not yet demonstrated their profitability could be the first to fail. ""We can estimate that 10 to 15% of the economy could end up in a dire situation, with powerful ripple effects on a third of the economy,"" said Olivier Passet. As a result, the global financial situation is also tightening. “Measures of economic uncertainty such as equity market volatility increased sharply in countries around the world,” said the IMF. “Credit spreads have widened broadly across markets as investors are reallocating from relatively risky to safer assets.” Finally, with borders being back, the pandemic could mark the entry into a new phase of re-localisation. With increased concerns related to ethics, sustainability, costs, speed and flexibility, proximity had already became a key factor of success for many players, in particular in the high-end packaging industry. In addition to this natural shift, the question is: will the pandemic-linked recession amplify the recent trade wars or lead to a greater international co-operation?"
"U.S.A: Prestige beauty sales remained flat in 2019, said The NPD Group","The USD 7.6 billion makeup category still represents the largest share of beauty sales. A key factor contributing to makeup’s annual performance (-7%) is the overall decline in makeup usage. Indeed, nearly one-quarter of women in the U.S. are using much/somewhat less makeup today, found The NPD Group in The Changing Face of Makeup, the market research firm’s latest report in conjunction with CivicScience. The findings show that casualization is factoring into this, with more women working from home and also embracing a more natural look. “’Natural’ is a big buzz word in many industries, especially beauty – in terms of product ingredients as well as consumers looking to achieve a more natural look. How makeup responds to this movement will be key to its revival,” said Larissa Jensen, vice president and beauty industry advisor, The NPD Group.  “Historically, NPD data has detected a shift between makeup and skincare every four to five years. Based on this, and the slowdown in makeup that began to take hold in 2017, I anticipate we’ll see makeup rebound in the next one to two years.” Skincare brought in USD 5.9 billion for the year, and natural was the top growth contributor. Natural brands represented 30% of total skincare and sales grew by 14% over 2018. Looking at specific segments of the market, staples such as cleansers and moisturizers grew and more targeted treatments were among the top performers, including acne treatments, brighteners, exfoliators, and lip treatments. Eventually, fragrance sales totaled USD 4.5 billion and this was propelled by the growth in stronger concentrations - perfumes (+49%) and eaux de parfums (+9%). While artisanal fragrances continued to grow at the fastest rate, it is the success of top ranked designer brands that captured the largest share of category sales, which has driven the sales performance. “My one word to characterize the beauty industry in 2019 was ‘disruption;’ my word for 2020 is ‘connection’ – not in terms of technology and devices, but the human connection we have to each other, to brands, and to the environment,” said Jensen. “As topics such as transparency and sustainability become more mainstream, consumers are putting the social and environmental impacts of their purchase decisions front and center, and brands will need to act accordingly.”"
Cosmoprof rescheduled for September as WHO labels coronavirus a ’pandemic’,"The outbreak of Covid-19 continues to turn the annual calendar of international trade fairs upside down. The organizers of the Cosmoprof show in Bologna, Italy, have just announced a new postponement of the event, which will finally take place from September 3 to 7, 2020. ""Since the beginning of the emergency linked to the outbreak of Coronavirus in Italy on 23 February, we have been constantly monitoring the situation, with the aim of identifying the best solutions to support the cosmetic industry,” said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere.  “The restrictions affecting our country and the limitations on international travels announced by other nations do not currently create the necessary preconditions for the business and networking activities at the basis of a global event such as Cosmoprof. The decision to further postpone the show in September, also based on evident prudential reasons related to the health emergency, is the result of a responsible dialogue with associations and institutions, with the common goal of creating the best scenario for the relaunch of the sector."" The World Health Organization called the new coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday. The number of cases across the globe has risen to more than 124,000 with 4,500 deaths, including a jump in fatalities in Iran and Italy in particular, according to an AFP tally. Signs of a widening European crisis emerged Wednesday, with Ireland, Albania, Belgium, Sweden and Bulgaria registering their first deaths, while Italy clocked more than 2,300 new cases in the last 24 hours and infections in Spain jumped by a quarter to more than 2,100.  Cuba, Brunei, Honduras, Bolivia, Ivory Coast and Turkey have announced the diagnosis of the first cases on their territory. The United States saw the first signs of an emergency footing with the New York government forming a containment zone around the suburb of New Rochelle at the centre of an outbreak. At the same time, President Donald Trump announced that he will close its borders for 30 days to travellers from most European countries. “Cosmoprof is an international event, which every year attracts over 265,000 operators from 150 countries to Bologna. The actual restrictions are limiting the presence in Italy of buyers, distributors and retailers from the main markets in Europe, Asia and America for the next few months, thus draining the lifeblood of our event as well,” explained Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof SpA. Wall Street stocks dove deeper into the red in afternoon trading Wednesday. More generally, disruption to supply chains from China, flagging demand and wildly fluctuating stock markets have sparked a series of profit warnings from companies. Yesterday, the organizers of the Esxence show in Milan also announced a second postponement of the event."
The French beauty cosmetics market remains fragile,"According to Kantar, sales of beauty and hygiene products recorded a paradoxical growth in 2019. Indeed, “hygiene-beauty occasions” (the number of uses per individual and per week) continued to decrease, down from 44.2 in 2018 to 44.1 in 2019. Even if it seems a minor decrease, in particular compared to the previous years (the index was at 49.1 in 2015), it shows that buyers are still in a de-consumption mood. ""This phenomenon is explained by a continuous simplification of beauty routines,"" explained Anaïs Dupuy, Business development Manager at Kantar. In such a context, the rise in sales recorded in 2019 is mainly explained by the impact of sales promotions which encouraged consumers to buy more products and stock them, highlights Kantar warning about a potential backlash this year. In 2019, consumers bought 51 products on average, compared to just over 50 in 2018. This resurgence of sales is not due to the 25-34 year old, who tend to reduce their purchases, but to senior buyers - especially the 50+. The most dynamic categories are hygiene products, with hair and shower products (+4% by volume) performing well, while makeup is the category that suffered the most with a decline of 5.5% in volume compared to the previous year. For their purchases, French consumers visit more and more retail channels: 3.38 on average in 2019, compared to 3.25 in 2015. However, perfumeries, super and hyper markets continue to lose market shares, while discount shops and hard discounters are progressing. According to Kantar, these figures show that French are looking for good deals and good prices, and are therefore ready to visit more outlets. Finally, the success of green cosmetics continues unabated. According to Kantar, the category has gained nearly 8.1 million  consumers since 2015, and buyers of these products spend more and more frequently. ""All indicators are green for this trend,"" concluded Anaïs Dupuy. As far as prestige beauty products are concerned, sales continued to decrease in 2019 (-1%), for the fifth consecutive year. ""Since 2015, the French prestige beauty market has lost 4% in value,"" said Mathilde Lyon, Europe Beauty Expert at The NPD Group. However, sales during the fourth quarter were very strong and compensated a large part of the losses recorded during from Q1 to Q3. In particular, there was a sharp increase of sales during the Black Friday week (+22% compared to 2018) which is now the second best performing week of the year, with 82% of sales made with a discount. The French market has also benefited from a surge in the number of tourists in 2019. According to The NPD Group, Global Shoppers - who do not buy only in duty-free - represent 8% of the French prestige beauty market, up 13% compared to 2018. As in other countries sales of prestige make-up declined strongly, however contrary to other markets the skincare category did not take over in France and sales remained flat."
"Bologna, Barcelona, Düsseldorf... the coronavirus impacts major beauty fairs","The postponement of the Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna show, one of the main events in the global cosmetics industry, had the effect of a bombshell. The fair should normally take place from 11 to 15 June 2020, provided that the situation evolves positively in Italy. A few days later, the organizers of the in-cosmetics Global show, which was to be held at the end of the month in Barcelona, were also forced to announce the postponement of the event from June 30 to July 2, 2020. Several other trade shows  have also been postponed: – PCHI China, the first to be rescheduled, should eventually be held from 02-04 June 2020 in Shanghai,
– Beauty Düsseldorf and Top Hair - Die Messe Düsseldorf will be held on 18-20 September 2020,
– originally scheduled for 08-09 April 2020, MakeUp in Shanghai and Luxe Pack Shanghai, should take place on 07-08 July 2020 at the Shanghai Exhibition Center,
– The 12th edition of Esxence - The Art Perfumery Event in Milan has been postponed from May 30 to June 2, as well as the Experience Lab fair.
– the M.A.D.E. Paris show, initially scheduled for March 17 and 18, is postponed to May 13 and 14, 2020, Furthermore, the TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition & Conference was due to be held in Singapore on May 10-14 has been cancelled. However, the organizers of the World Perfumery Congress (WPC), which is to be held from June 02 to 04, 2020 at the Miami Beach Convention Center, have announced will be held as scheduled. In a context where many large companies have decided to limit travels of their staffs, trade show postponements are disrupting the communication of suppliers. While Cosmoprof Asia was disrupted by protests in Hong Kong in November, access to innovations is further complicated. Of course, postponing or canceling international trade shows is just one of the many problems associated with the Covid-19 outbreak. More than 110,000 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in over 100 countries since the epidemic erupted in December in Wuhan, China. According to an AFP toll based on official sources, the outbreak killed 3,862 people, with the vast majority of fatalities being in China. Italy - Europe’s worst-affected country - reported 97 more deaths on Monday, bringing its toll to 463 and pushing Europe’s total past 500. The situation disorganizes many supply chains and has a massive impact on sales in travel retail and luxury goods. The health emergency is thus coupled with an economic alert. European stock markets slumped dramatically, following a dramatic downturn in Asia, with indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt falling by seven percent or more."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna postponed to June,"With more than 265,000 visitors and more than 3,000 exhibiting companies in 2019, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is one of the most important trade fairs for the global cosmetic industry. Initially scheduled on March 12-15, the show is postponed to June 11-15, 2020. ""The latest news concerning novel corona virus in Italy have forced us to review our positions,” said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere in a statement. “In agreement with the Regional Government of Emilia Romagna and with the Municipality of Bologna, we have assessed the situation, and postponing the event is currently the most correct solution, to support Italian institutions engaged today in protecting our health."" The 2020 program and special initiatives will not undergo substantial changes, added the organizers. Almost at the same time, the organizers of Luxe Pack Shanghai also announced the postponement of their event. Originally scheduled for April 8 and 9, 2020, Luxe Pack Shanghai should finally be held on July 7 and 8, 2020 at the Shanghai Exhibition Center. When the first cases emerged in China, the PCHI trade show, focusing on personal care ingredients, had already been postponed before being finally rescheduled on June 2 and 4 in Shanghai. The World Health Organization on Monday said the new coronavirus epidemic had ""peaked"" in China with new cases declining steadily there, but warned that a surge in cases elsewhere was ""deeply concerning"" and all countries should prepare for a ""potential pandemic"". Recent developments also caused falls of more than three-percent in several European stock markets - with Milan plunging 5.4 percent - amid fears the epidemic could hit the global economy. The International Monetary Fund has already lowered its growth forecast for China in 2020 by 0.4 points to 5.6%. With China being the world’s second largest economy, this decline should cost 0.1 point of growth to global GDP. The crisis is not only impacting global tourism and sales of consumer goods, especially luxury goods, but is also disrupting value chains, with many production sites closed or idling in China."
"Dave Lackie, Sarah Berryman and Hannah Ween named top three beauty influencers on Twitter","Dave Lackie (@davelackie), editor and founder at Beauty Departure magazine, was revealed as the top influencer during the fourth quarter of 2019. With over 162,000 followers, David Lackie reached a maximum “influencer score” of 100 on GlobalData’s Beauty Influencer Platform, which tracks more than 250 global beauty experts and their discussions on Twitter. Sarah Berryman (@sarah_berryman1), a beauty blogger, was ranked second among beauty experts with an influencer score of 73, while the UK-based beauty and book blogger Hannah Ween (@HannahHeartss) was ranked third with an influencer score of 63. The top 10 beauty influencers also include Makeup.com (@makeupdotcom), Hayley Hall (@hayleyhall_uk), Jeffree Star (@jeffreestar), Anastasia Smith (@GlamorableBlog), Chloe Brewer (@LadyWrites_Blog), Kirsty Merrett (@labelsforlunch) and Siobhán (@Beautylymin). Among the companies, Sephora has emerged as the most discussed company among the beauty experts, followed by Clarins and Boots UK, respectively. The conversations about Sephora were led by its winter beauty product collection, which includes Winter time eye & face palette with warm neutrals, crystal face palettes and earth eye palettes. According to GlobalData, in Q4 2019, ‘Makeup’ emerged as the top trend discussed among the industry experts, followed by ‘Skin Care’, ‘Lipstick’ and ‘Eye Shadow’. The conversation about make-up was largely driven by the latest collection of makeup products launched by different companies in the market."
France: Perfumes and cosmetics exports passed the 15 billion euro mark in 2019,"French exports of cosmetic products continued to grow in 2019, with an increase of more than 9%, according to figures released by French Customs on February 7. For more than 10 years, exports have driven the growth of the French perfumes and cosmetics industry and reached 15.7 billion euros in 2019. The cosmetics industry remains a major pillar of the French foreign trade, the second most performant sector after the aeronautics. Moreover, French cosmetics also attract tourists: out of 5 cosmetic products sold in France, 1 product is bought by a foreign visitor. In total, more than 50% of the French production is exported. Europe remains the number one destination for French cosmetics exports, followed by the United States and Asia. The latter is growing in importance, with exports to China skyrocketing (+48% in 2019 compared to 2018). China , which was the 7th market in 2018 for French cosmetics now ranks 4th.  Exports to South Korea (+26%) and Singapore (+16%) also sharply increased. Today, one out of five French cosmetic products is sold in Asia. After an average increase of 10% per year since 2013, exports of cosmetics have enabled France to maintain its position as world leader with an estimated market share of 23%. Skin care is the main product category among French cosmetics exports, it represents more than 7.3 billion euros, an increase of more than 46% over the last five years. Perfumes and toilet waters also perform extremely well with sales abroad reaching more than 4.8 billion euros, up by 23% over the last five years. While the makeup category only comes in third position, exports of coloured products for the lips have increased by almost 80% over the last five years to reach more than 730 million euros in 2019. It is therefore not surprising that Hermès chose this category for its first foray into the make-up sector. According to FEBEA, the trade organization gathering French cosmetics makers, this success is based on solid positions in ""all the levels of the value chain"". For instance, the cosmetics industry’s R&D is the most efficient in France, with 3.6 patents filed per million euros spent. ""This success is also based on the entrepreneurial dynamism of the sector,"" added Patrick O’Quin, FEBEA president. ""Each year, 170 new cosmetic companies are created in France, fuelled by the sector’s abundant innovation. Alongside major internationally recognized groups, our sector brings together almost 85% of SMEs, spread across France. In particular, in the territories which found ways to enhance their historical know-how in the field of perfumes - Provence for example - or their natural resources, Brittany in particular, thanks to the success of marine cosmetic ingredients.”"
"""Independence restores the meaning to the art of perfumer,"" Nathalie Feisthauer ","Premium Beauty News - You worked for large perfume houses before becoming independent? Nathalie Feisthauer - Yes, during 30 years. I learned to be a perfumer at the École de Roure (from 1983 to 1986), before joining Givaudan where I stayed 24 years, including four in New York. Then I joined Symrise. I was fortunate enough to discover the creative process when times were very different from now and to meet in teams or brands, fascinating personalities. These were the days of real briefs, real biases. Premium Beauty News - Why was it so different? Nathalie Feisthauer - Today it would be impossible to launch a perfume like Poison de Dior, for example. Brand interlocutors now mostly have a marketing approach. Furthermore, to alleviate the burden and responsibility of a launch, we now work with ten teammates on the development of a fragrance before it is tested. We are not looking for the best fragrance, but for one that will not displease anyone. We work for two years on finding an audacious accord for which we spend two years more smoothing. It’s very frustrating. This approach leaves little room for artistic creation. Perfume has become a product like any other. Premium Beauty News - Hence the desire to leave this system? Nathalie Feisthauer - Yes. I suddenly realized, I had had enough of this context, which is blatant from a marketing point of view: we programme best-sellers that don’t sell, with a limited lifespan. Besides, with the exception of J’adore by Dior, great successes rarely pass consumer tests, like Coco Mademoiselle, Angel, Light Blue, Terre d’Hermès… The system has become complete nonsense. So I wanted to find meaning by founding my own laboratory. The question is not so much how to create an original or popular perfume, but rather how to follow a project in its entirety. Premium Beauty News - Have you found a new lease of life in niche perfumery? Nathalie Feisthauer - Yes. A bit like a disillusioned chef who decides to open his little inn to reconnect with fine products and people who appreciate them. I also reconnected with some aspects of the trade that I like, by being in direct contact with the client. In the beginning when I was working in a large perfume house, I used to exchange with clients, even if contacts took place with marketers. Over time, my role was limited to the formulation of accords that I no longer presented in meetings. Today, assessors are the ones who choose the tests to propose to brands, sometimes by tapping into old projects that won’t necessarily fit to the brief. You therefore no longer have the possibility to choose or to explain your creative process. It is, once again, very frustrating. Fortunately, as a freelance perfumer, I discovered the much-appreciated freedom of being able to choose the accords that I propose. Premium Beauty News - What does your customer base look like today? Nathalie Feisthauer - I work with the Gulf countries, especially the United Arab Emirates, but also with Russia, the United States and many European countries. So I work on a wide variety of projects, whether they are won, lost or in progress, which is pleasant. In Dubai, many customers want to interact directly with the perfumer, which opens up opportunities. This diversity nourishes me. Premium Beauty News - You are also very popular in Russia! Nathalie Feisthauer - Yes, for the past three years, my work has been very appreciated over there. I won two FIFI Awards over there last November, and I regularly receive masterclasses of Russian perfume students wishing to improve their skills in France. It is a fun country, where people intensely love perfume. It is also a very open market, where small players are more visible. And this is also true for Iran or the United Arab Emirates. Premium Beauty News - Tell us more about Fluo_ral by Nomenclature, which was singled out at the last FIFI Awards in Russia.  Nathalie Feisthauer - The brand Nomenclature was created by Karl Bradl and Carlos Quintero from the Aedes de Venustas boutique in New York. The idea was to divert calone from its iodized, marine side, to reveal it in a darker light. To illustrate the packaging of Fluo_Ral I drew inspiration from the photo of a sea in a dark night in which some fluorescent algae sparkled. I dressed it with rhubarb, blackcurrant, pink berries and floral notes against a woody base, dominated by incense. An interesting exercise, with an innovative rendering. Premium Beauty News - Did you observe that olfactory preferences changed according to the markets? Nathalie Feisthauer - Not specifically. If oud wood remains unavoidable in the Gulf, the region has opened up to other, more classic influences. The offer is therefore very varied in the area, this significant gap being propitious to an evolution in tastes. In Russia, the offer is also very wide. The market has also evolved a lot in France over the past ten years, particularly under the influence of Middle East customers. Premium Beauty News - What is your viewpoint on the evolution of the niche perfume market? Nathalie Feisthauer - Originally, niche perfumery was born from a quest for meaning and originality. For me, the niche is a perfume shop that adopts the artistic vision of a creator, far from the more homogeneous proposition of the selective circuit. This is what I like, to transcribe a story, with an olfactory bias. But today, niche perfumery has evolved considerably. Niche brands have multiplied, resulting in an effect that I would describe as a ""false niche"": that is to say, pioneer houses who today depend on large groups. On the other hand, we see emerging some small, highly technical alternative brands, but who cannot compete financially and struggle to impose themselves in terms of distribution. Not to mention big perfume houses in the selective, which almost all have a prestigious exclusive collection featuring the codes of the niche. A context, in which this perfumery, which intends to be more personal, born in the shades of a commercial approach, returns in the hands of large groups, in terms of distribution. It’s a rather ironic development when you look at. Niche perfumery is difficult to describe because it is multiple, the positive side being that there is currently room for every desire, every project."
Novel coronavirus sends shockwaves through the travel retail industry,"The impact of the current health crisis on several economic sectors, including tourism, luxury goods, and prestige fashion and beauty retails, is likely to be worse than during the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003 or the swine flu crisis in 2009, simply because so many more Chinese people travel abroad and buy these products than back then. In this context, high-end fashion and beauty brands are logically displaying support to their key market in Asia, pledging millions of dollars to support the fight against the novel coronavirus. The Kering Group, parent company of brands including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, and Ulysse Nardin, announced on Tuesday that it would donate CNY 7.5 million (USD 1.08 million) to the Red Cross Foundation in Hubei. On Monday, Paris-based fashion conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy, which owns Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Celine, and Christian Dior, pledged CNY 16 million (USD 2.3 million) to the Chinese Red Cross Foundation. French personal care company L’Oréal pledged to donate CNY 5 million, while U.S. cosmetics company Estée Lauder promised CNY 2 million; and Austrian producer of glass Swarovski CNY 3 million. The travel industry is the first to be impacted. Mainland China with its 1.3 billion inhabitants is the top contributor to world tourism numbers with 159 million foreign trips in 2019 according to GlobalData. Most Chinese tourists go elsewhere in Asia, most often to Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. When they venture further afield it’s usually to Europe, the United States or Australia. France is their top destination in Europe, with 2.2 million Chinese visitors in 2018, followed by Germany, Italy and the UK. The detrimental impact of the outbreak on air passenger numbers will also cause concern for airport retailers. “Over the last few years airport retailers, especially those in Europe, have tailored their propositions, integrated Chinese payment solutions and invested in Mandarin-speaking staff to target Chinese passengers and maximize sales growth opportunities,” says Honor Strachan, Principal Analyst at GlobalData. In 2003, SARS caused tourism spend in China to collapse while visitor numbers to Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong significantly dropped off, causing airlines to ground planes and reduce flight schedules. Coronavirus has already dented retail and leisure spending across the Chinese New Year holiday due to consumers being encouraged, and in some cases forced, to stay in and avoid travel. In response to the crisis, retailers are considering closing stores, with the China Duty Free Group closing its mall in Haitang Bay – impacting the APAC duty free market in 2020. “Asia Pacific is forecast to be the fastest performing region for airport retail spend in 2020, with sales rising 8.4% to US$21.7bn - 45.1% of the global channel. If the coronavirus continues to spread globally over the course of 2020 its impact on tourism and economies, particularly across APAC, could be severe,” adds Strachan. And the crisis effects will be felt beyond airports, hotels, restaurants and tourist sites. As tourists, and specifically Chinese tourists are also big spenders, the shockwaves will probably impact most luxury and premium brands. Actually, the crisis has already sent Japan’s key Nikkei index plunging, with stock in Shiseido falling more than five percent on Monday."

"Convenience and personal control to top 2020 global consumer trends, according to Euromonitor International","This year again, Euromonitor International. They try to strike a balance between the two and that not always easy as sometimes these are complimentary desires, but they may also conflict with each other. For instance, to achieve greater convenience, consumers may be required to relinquish personal control. The amount of data and privacy consumers will exchange for these desirable benefits will vary by culture, territory and individual. According to Euromonitor, brands must find the right balance between building trust, providing security and delivering products and services that add value to outweigh consumer concerns in the year ahead.] takes stock of the changing expectations and behaviours of consumers.

Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2020 to explore the new frontiers of beauty,"From 12 to 15 March with Cosmopack and Cosmo|Perfumery & Cosmetics and from 13 to 16 March with Cosmo|Hair, Nail & Beauty Salon, the B2B event will host experts to share the possible factors that, from now until 2030, will characterize the evolution of beauty worldwide and how the industry will have to adapt to phenomena such as the digital revolution, new forms of socialization, attention to sustainability and environmental resources, and the multicultural evolution of our society. At the main entrance of the show, a dedicated area will host 32 start-ups specialized in online platforms, digital solutions, virtual apps for product testing, e-make-up and 3D make-up services, software and services for customization, new solutions for retail stores, and interactive digital platforms. This “beauty tech” area will be located within the Garden of Innovation, managed by the beauty trends agency Beautystreams and dedicated to the megatrends that will influence the society in the future and to the innovations that will characterize the beauty sector in the next 10 years. The start-ups will participate in Cosmoprof Next - a pitch competition that will promote the best projects. As industry players, from global leaders to indie brands, are increasing relying on the know-how of the cosmetics supply chain, Cosmopack, the part of the show dedicated to contract manufacturing and private labels, process and packaging machinery, primary and secondary packaging, applicators, ingredients and raw materials, is gaining momentum. In addition to pavilions 20, 15, 15A and 18, Cosmopack expands its presence in 19PK, part of hall 19. To optimize the visit routes, the development of Cosmopack foresees an increasingly marked division between the different specialties of the supply chain, and in 2021 an entire pavilion will be dedicated exclusively to machinery. Hall 15 will host international manufacturers specialized in full services for the industry. Focus of the hall 18 will once again be the OEM and packaging companies. In addition, this year, The Factory (the live presentation of the manufacturing process of a specific cosmetic product) will present a face-foundation suitable for multiple skin tones, thus answering to a new approach focused on diversity and multicultural society. Also opening from Thursday 12 to Sunday 15 March, Cosmo|Perfumery & Cosmetics, the part of the show dedicated to finished beauty products sold through retail channels, will feature a special area focusing on the transformation affecting the beauty universe.  In addition, a “Garden of Fragrances”, in partnership with Nez la Revue Olfactive, will imagine the place of perfumes in 2030 not as objects but as a part of a broader olfactory culture. Also in the Cosmo|Perfumery & Cosmetics section, the Cosmoprime zone will gather young brands and the Zoom On Emerging Prime will host young companies entering the international business of Cosmoprof for the first time. In addition, the Extraordinary Gallery will focus on the most innovative Indie Beauty brands. Exhibiting companies will have the possibility to participate in the Cosmoprof & Cosmopack Awards 2020. A jury made of 50 opinion leaders, representing trend experts, managers and R&D, designers, journalists and influencers, will select the most innovative entries. For Cosmoprof Awards, there are five categories dedicated to the best proposals in finished product: Skin Saviors, New Kid, Hair Industry breakthrough, Make-up and Nail game-changer of the year, Nature Miracles. The Cosmopack Awards will celebrate the excellence in the supply chain, following 5 categories: The Fountain of Youth: the ageless Skincare formula, Luminary make-up packaging, Designers’ delight in packaging, The make-up formula transformer, Champion of sustainability. Winners will be announced on March, Friday 13, at the Service Center."
Cosme Tokyo to spotlight “made in Japan” and natural products,"After breaking its previous records last year, with 762 exhibitors from 30 countries and 25,627 visitors, the organizers of the three day show announce almost 900 exhibitors from 35 countries and expect 30 000 visitors this year. The show is held at the same time and under the same roof than two other events: Cosme Tech Tokyo, dedicated to the development of cosmetic products and gathering packaging and ingredients suppliers, and Inner Beauty Tokyo, dedicated to beauty and health foods. The three events form the Cosme Week Tokyo, concomitant to the Life Style Week which features eight specialized trade fairs focusing on gifts, baby and kid products, stationary, homeware and fashion. This unrivalled conjunction of events helps to attract a large number of visitors. With the J-Beauty label being one of the most attractive trend around the globe - certifying both quality and technology - visitors from the rest of Asia-Pacific region, but also from North America and Europe come to visit the show in order to source innovative products or get inspiration from local trends. “Recently, we have seen the rise of Japanese cosmetic products using regional and traditional ingredients such as horse oil, salmon collagen, mild rice bran water from Kyoto or Mt Fuji water,” explain the organizers. Reflecting the continued growth of the organic/natural beauty market in Japan and Asia, this segment now accounts for an important part of the show floor. As far as “made in Japan” products are concerned, the use of local ingredients is a predominant trend for natural and organic products too, in particular local botanicals, or typically Japanese substances such as SakeKasu (Japanese sake extract). With Japan being the world’s second largest cosmetics market, the show also attracts numbers of international exhibitors. About 35 countries should participate in the 2020 show, mostly from Europe - including France, Italy, Poland and Germany - and the USA. Exhibitors from other Asian countries, in particular from Korea, and from Middle East also showcase their products. Cosme Tokyo

Veganism was one of the hottest beauty trends in 2019,"Prestige skincare brand CeraVe already sells animal product-free products in the UK and multiple other countries, but the company announced plans this year to make its products more vegan-friendly in the US and Canada. Back in February, the L’Oréal-owned label set itself the target of making its offerings in North America more than 90 percent vegan by the year 2021, and told Allure that it was working on replacing one of its ingredients, a type of cholesterol derived from sheep’s wool, with a vegan version. Another L’Oreal-owned label, Dermablend Professional, also took steps towards championing animal welfare this year by becoming certified cruelty-free by PETA and announcing plans to cut animal-derived ingredients from its formulas to ensure that they are 100% vegan. ""People are looking for brands that align with their values and our goal is to empower our consumers with the confidence and knowledge they need to make the best decisions for their beauty routines,"" said Malena Higuera, General Manager at Dermablend Professional, at the time. Avon was another titan to pivot towards veganism, unveiling a five-piece skincare collection called ‘The Distillery’ in September. Free from animal products and harmful chemicals, the products also featured low-water formulas and recycling packaging, where possible. Besides the new lines and new orientations global beauty giants in the way they are approaching the use of animal-derived ingredients, 2019 also saw the arrival of several new, vegan beauty brands. From Millie Bobby Brown’s ‘Florence By Mills’ line to Kesha’s label ‘Kesha Rose Beauty,’ the industry’s hottest new additions were noticeably free of animal products, suggesting that vegan beauty is here to stay."
Skincare sales on the rise in Spain as women opt for a more natural look and young men get more interested in beauty products,"According to Kantar’s latest study on beauty, hygiene and personal care habits [1], 72% of Spanish women claim to use little make-up and prefer a more natural look, as opposed to 62% of women worldwide. Such results translate into a long-term decline of make-up, while facial moisturising products that help skin look healthy are added to the routine. However, purchasing behaviours vary according to age. The youngest group, from 17 to 24 years, associates a more natural look with a well-groomed look. They achieve this by using make-up products such as powders, concealers and foundations, in that order. On the other hand, older women prefer to wear no make-up on their face, showing their natural beauty. Furthermore, Kantar notes the natural look trend in Spain has been able to coexist with other apparently opposing fashions, such as elaborate hairstyles and decorated nails. The number of people using professional manicure services for example, has grown by 4 percentage points in the last year. Another trend that is fast on the rise in the country is the growth of the men’s beauty and hygiene market. According to Kantar, the number of Spanish men who say they are well informed of the latest trends and fashions in personal care is 34%, 10 points above the European average. The upshot is that men now make up 4 out of every 10 cases of weekly product use, half of which is from the 25 to 54 age bracket. At the purchase level, the industry has bounced back slightly in the past year, billing 1.3% higher than in 2018, but 14% less than ten years ago. However, retail traffic remains at a standstill."
How beauty brands addressed sustainability in 2019,"Dove hit the headlines in October, when it announced plans to replace its plastic bottles with recycled ones and reduce its virgin plastic use by more than 20,500 tonnes per year. The Unilever-owned beauty giant will start the process of launching new, 100% recycled plastic bottles (where possible), across all its product ranges in North America and Europe by the end of this year. The Procter & Gamble-owned personal care brand Gillette made all its disposable razors and replaceable-blade cartridge units recyclable in Canada this year. The brand also rolled out a program with waste management company TerraCycle, making it easier for Canadian consumers to recycle their old razors. P&G-owned haircare label Herbal Essences marked World Water Day in March with a series of recyclable shampoo and conditioner bottles comprising 25% beach plastic. The limited-edition bottles, which were created in partnership with TerraCycle, were available through June 2019. The L’Occitane Group, which counts the beauty brands L’Occitane en Provence, Melvita, and Erborian as part of its portfolio, teamed up with the sustainable plastic innovator Loop Industries this year to get more eco-friendly with its packaging. The group plans to incorporate Loop PET plastic (which is 100% sustainable) into its product packaging from the year 2022. British luxury retailer Selfridges announced in November that it is banning single-use, plastic-based beauty wipes from its store shelves, in a bid to encourage more sustainable purchases instead. It is estimated that the wipes can take up to 100 years to fully degrade. In July Brazil-based beauty giant Natura & Co, which owns the brands Natura, Aesop and The Body Shop, pledged to limit its contribution to global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, as part of the ""Business Ambition for 1.5°C: Our Only Future"" campaign. The group also committed to reaching net-zero emissions by the year 2050. Garnier USA marked Earth Day by encouraging people to recycle their beauty empties and offering shoppers a free recycling bin. The brand, which has an ongoing partnership with the with waste management company TerraCycle, claims to have diverted more than 11.9 Million empties from landfills. L’Oréal has been working on making beauty packaging more environmentally-friendly with the packaging company Albéa. The duo announced the invention of a carton-based cosmetic tube in October, which sees plastic for the most part replaced with a bio-based, paper-like material. The creation is expected to start going into industrial production in the second half of 2020."
Global Shoppers boost global perfume sales,"Overall, the year 2018 revealed positive trends in the Americas, with a +6% and +10% growth in the US and South America, respectively, while Europe achieved a relatively stable growth at +1%. However, the data released in late September 2019 highlight rebalanced growth dynamics. The North-American market experienced a marked slowdown, with a rate reduced to +1%, and Europe made some progress, with +2%. Still, these improved dynamics in Europe remain driven by the same markets as in 2018, i.e. Southern countries, Spain (+5%), and Italy (+6%), while France and the UK recorded null or negative values. “It should be said there is a major difference to take into account: perfumes remain the premier category of prestige beauty in Europe, in all countries, contrary to North America, where they are the 3rd category after makeup and skincare. This means Europe is a prominent area on the perfume market. And in terms of turnover, it represents more than twice the US,” explains Mathilde Lion. If Europe remains a key market, it is also partly due to its counting the most tourists: 767 million in 2018 (+6%, compared to 2017). And these count among the biggest perfume consumers, both in Travel Retail and on local markets. “This phenomenon cannot but intensify, and it already has a significant effect on the category,” adds Mathilde Lion. Indeed, beauty is the category that attracts half the visitors in Duty Free areas. And within this category, 67% of consumers turn to women’s perfumes, and more than half, 56%, make a purchase, which is the highest conversion rate in Travel Retail. In addition, women’s perfumes offer the highest global average buying basket (66USD), which is even higher among Asian travellers: up to 99USD for Chinese tourists. One of the main market changes is the growing potential of e-commerce. “On the most connected markets, it is really e-commerce that drives perfumes’ growth, although the penetration rate is lower than on the other categories. Online skincare has boomed,” says Mathilde Lion. Perfume penetration rates remain low: in 2018, they reached 17% in the UK, 14% in the US, and only 7% in France, so there is a huge potential to harness. However, there was a slowdown in perfume on this channel in France between January and October 2019, with a 7% growth in this category, compared to 16% in 2018. Secondly, Eaux de Parfum dominate women’s perfumes, and this trend has also been intensifying in the men’s perfumes category, to the detriment of Eaux de Toilette. “Higher concentrations are increasingly popular in men’s fragrances, and this is going to last,” foresees the analyst. In Europe, men’s Eaux de Parfum launches had increased by 32% in late September 2019, and there was a 4% increase in women’s – no change compared to 2018. Third, the lower growth rate of fragrances over 150 euros (fine and niche fragrances, leading brands’ exclusive collections…) is worth mentioning. This category grew by 6% in 2019, compared to the two-digit growth rate observed over the past few years. “There are fewer launches. And if these fragrances still contribute to perfumes’ upmarket move, they will not change anything on the global level, because they represent a very limited market share,” comments Mathilde Lion. Lastly, naturalness is gradually inviting itself in the perfume category. The natural perfume market achieved a very strong growth in 2017 in the US, and then a slowdown in 2018, although ethical and ingredient expectations are still strong. “This trend still weighs very little on this market: 19 million dollars in the US, i.e. 0.5% of the market. So, there is a gap to bridge,” explains Mathilde Lion. In conclusion, the growth is maintained, although there are distribution issues to take into account. Consumer expectations change, there are still as many launches, which keeps the category healthy, and the naturalness demand is slowly emerging. We will see what happens during the festive season, which is still likely to influence results in any country."
Information & Inspiration becomes Asia Cosme Lab and broadens Asian market deciphering,"For almost 20 years, Florence Bernardin and her team have been deciphering and analyzing Asian consumers, trends, and cosmetic products. Thanks to an ever-growing expertise, they highlighted flagship products from Korea, like the BB cream and cushions, and deciphered Chinese market expectations. Now, they are focusing on the offering developed in South-East Asia, a region rich in indie, nature-oriented brands. Their approach targeting brands and suppliers unveiled the richness and inventiveness of this area in terms of ingredients, formulas and textures, packaging, and hybrid concepts. Florence Bernardin’s skills gradually seduced the greatest global cosmetics leaders, including Asian companies, in search of in-depth knowledge of these markets and their specificities. In the past 16 years, the watch offering got wider from Japan to China, where the annual growth rate reached 21% in the cosmetics industry starting from 2014, and as far as South Korea, which boasts the world’s biggest cosmetics consumers, and more recently, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Thailand – dynamic countries whose characteristics (climate, religion, skin types) require extensive analysis. “We have really made progress with market changes: Korea has become the world’s innovation laboratory, and makeup and skincare brands made in and for China have boomed. But we have a sweet tooth, so we increasingly focus on new markets who have been growing from an economic standpoint, and whose beauty offering is now very actively revealing itself to the world, driven by an ever-influencing Korean model which also has firmly anchored local specificities. These markets will keep opening, but they do have specific needs, and we are here to decipher them,” explains Florence Bernardin. Based in new offices, west of Paris, the team is now composed of ten employees of four different nationalities who are experts of their own country. Information & Inspiration, which became Asia Cosme Lab in October 2019, helps both brands and suppliers enhance various areas of their offering development strategy: market visits, range development, formula assessment, concepts and storytelling validation, comprehensive overview of the local product offering, follow-up of influencers and retail… “Our expertise is relevant in that we have an external perspective, which is the reason why we count an increasing number of local players among our customers: they ask us for our vision of their own market. From the outside, you always see things more objectively,” says Florence Bernardin. In the near future, Asia Cosme Lab aims to develop their overview offering on indie brands  to conclude financial agreements, analyze the boom of local brands, follow up new formulas, and extensively analyze emerging segments: perfume, men, baby care, senior care, halal beauty… Starting from next year, they will publish a newsletter about the markets mentioned and provide free or payable online access to whole articles on topical issues. These prospects are perfectly in line with the economic and demographic dynamics of Asian countries, whose annual growth rate is estimated at 4% from 2018 to 2020 in the Asia-Pacific region."
"The quest for health and a natural look boosts sales of beauty products in Asia, says Kantar","Sales of beauty product grew by +8% between 2017-18 in Asia, compared to +4% for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) as a whole, finds Kantar in a recent report [1]. According to the market research firm, the quest for health is one of the main key drivers behind this growth. ""Asian people believe health is almost twice as important to their happiness as having more money,"" says Ashley Kang, Head of Beauty Sector at Kantar Worldpanel division. ""They see what they put on their skin as a health supplement - and this has changed the products and benefits they desire. They are extremely knowledgeable too, so brands must be transparent in their communications. The wellness trend is also encouraging certain emerging formats to thrive."" For instance, new sophisticated formats in skincare and makeup that provide derma-care properties are rising in popularity. Derma brands have reached almost 45% penetration in Korea, a massive influx from just over 25% in 2017. Their second highest reach is Taiwan at 40%, an increase from 37.6% in 2017. Derma products can be used to treat specific skin issues, such as eczema or sensitive skin, or emerging issues such as pollution protection. “With consumer brands launching their own ranges, derma-care is increasingly more mainstream, when it was once a niche segment and a domain of brands with a heritage in pharmaceuticals. Developments in retail and distribution are helping to increase the footprint of these products outside drugstores,” explains Kantar. Natural glow is the most sought after look in Asia right now, says Kantar. This quest has helped drive sales of serums that promise intense hydration with the highest penetration rate in Korea (61%, rising from 58% in 2017). In China, penetration of serums has increased from 18% in 2017 to nearly 26% today. In addition to hydrating serums, specific makeup products - including liquid foundation, BB creams, and primer/concealer - can help people achieve the right translucent effect. “All of them are soaring in popularity,” says Kantar. Kantar predicts that makeup that provides skincare or medicinal benefits will be a key growth area for the future. Various crossover products have already emerged between the skincare and makeup segments, such as toner cream that brightens the skin. “Positioning these products closer to skincare can be an effective strategy in China, where there remains a perception that the pigments in makeup could be harmful,” adds the market research firm. The number of men using skincare products is growing steadily across Asia, particularly in China, South Korea, and Thailand. They are buying in more categories as they add more steps to their beauty regime. However, most are still not buying products that have been created specifically for men. Products targeted at men contribute 10% of the total value sales for beauty in the region, but this segment is growing slower than unisex skincare brands. ""Men in their twenties are most likely to buy men-only skincare products, but as they get older they begin to use whatever products they find on the bathroom shelf,"" explains Ashley Kang. ""There is a substantial growth opportunity here for brands that can shift spend from unisex products to men-only variants, and prevent men from ’lapsing’ as they get older, particularly for products promising oil control, anti-aging, whitening, and sunscreen benefits."" Eventually, Kantar points out the interest of Asian shoppers in customised products, which are rapidly gaining momentum in both skincare and makeup."
"Consumers’ oscillations between nature and science, connection and disconnection to disrupt the global beauty market","Science and nature, on the one hand, connection and disconnection, on the other, form the two beauty and personal care trend spectrums identified by the market intelligence agency in a recent report on global beauty and personal care trends for 2030. “Over the next 10 years, consumers will explore the push-pull between nature and science. Advances in software, hardware, apps and augmented reality will herald the Fourth Industrial Revolution, significantly changing the way consumers choose, purchase and interact with beauty and personal care products,” says Sarah Jindal, Senior Global Analyst, Innovation and Insights, Mintel Beauty & Personal Care. Within this “science and nature” spectrum, consumers will change their opinions on what is ‘natural’ or ‘clean’. “As lab-grown products continue to enter the market, consumers’ comfort with biotechnology will increase. At the same time, mistrust of ‘clean’ and ‘green’ labels will see consumers scrutinize ingredient lists and question product efficacy,” adds Sarah Jindal. “We’ll see biometrics offer an innovative way for companies to interact more personally with consumers by providing valuable customizations.” In 2030, according to Mintel, the clean beauty industry will just be the beauty industry and the focus will be on transparency and an eco-ethical mission rather than fear marketing. “Success will only be achieved by the brands that offer full transparency and avoid misunderstanding,” highlights Jindal. Waste-free, engineered and lab-grown natural ingredients, data, transparency, are some of the key words of this first trend. While toggling between connection and disconnection, consumers will seek out their tribe, with beauty and personal care brands serving as a facilitator. “We predict the next decade will see even greater polarization with consumers fluctuating across a spectrum of behaviour driven by both information and emotion, connection and disconnection. Expect to see remote-control services bring access to the geographically disconnected, village commerce open once unreachable markets and more consumers ‘switch off’ as they strive to find real-world connections,” explains Sarah Jindal. At the same time, consumers are losing the ability to relate to one another on a human level, while access to floods of information has detrimental effects, bringing into question the concept of authenticity. “Every purchase will be carefully considered as consumers move to a more minimal approach, making investments in high-quality, high-performing products and reusing and upcycling products wherever possible,” highlights Jindal. Customisation, services, biometrical data, simplified skincare, space-farmed ingredients, variety of cultures and lifestyle are among the key words of this second trend. In a world that becomes more polarised, the next decade is monumental for the global beauty and personal care industry, finds Mintel."

"Value, functionality and ethics top priorities of British people when purchasing beauty products, says Sagentia research","Sagentia commissioned a poll of 2,029 adult Brits [1] to find out what matters most when they’re choosing personal care products such as body wash, cleansers, moisturiser or shaving gel. Ethics just as important as sensory features Responses indicate that when people are buying personal care products, ethical and sustainability credentials (34%) are just as important as sensory characteristics, such as fragrance (31%). However, value for money (67%) and functional benefits, such as helping skin or hair problems (54%), are top priorities for most people. Sagentia spokesperson Matt Herd says the findings show how the growing public discussion about climate change is moving mainstream. It’s changing how people think about the products they use and what they expect from brands. He believes people want personal care and beauty products that they can feel good about using. ""According to our findings, most people agree that personal care and beauty brands have a responsibility to do more,"" Herd explains. ""However, younger people aged 18-24 seem more inclined to take practical steps in this vein. We found that 33% would like to personalise the way packaging is sourced, for instance to make it more environmentally friendly."" Herd acknowledges that many leading personal care and beauty brands have published sustainability reports and objectives. However, he says the Sagentia research findings indicate that people want to see practical evidence of change, rather than corporate statements. ""It’s all very well having a company ethos that talks about sustainability, but it needs to filter down to the products too,"" he says. ""Packaging is one part of this. But it’s also important to think about the ingredients used in personal care and beauty products - where do they come from, how they are sourced. This is a complex issue, but consumers expect the brands they trust to tackle it head-on."""
ADF&PCD Paris will take on a new dimension in 2020,"ADF&PCD Paris is to return in January 2020 alongside a brand-new show, PLD: Packaging of Premium & Luxury Drinks. The aim of the organisers is to create a new forum for packaging creators to share ideas and inspiration, and to source new suppliers and products from each other’s markets. ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2020 takes place on 29th and 30th January 2020 at Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Paris, and has been developed around the theme ‘Innovate Together’. The theme wants to reflect the show’s position as an event covering the closely related markets of drinks, cosmetics and aerosols; and an event for whole teams involved in packaging projects across the design, marketing, packaging development and buying functions within brand owners. “It is clear that packaging developers, designers and buyers share common challenges across the cosmetics, drinks and aerosol markets - both in terms of technical challenges and brand positioning. The launch of PLD is a direct response to demand from our community for an event that offers the opportunity for packaging creators in the premium and luxury drinks markets to source and share technologies and ideas; and to learn from their colleagues in aligned sectors,” explains Josh Brooks, event director at ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2020. This cross-market/cross disciplinary ethos extends to the show floor, which is organised to allow cross-pollination between ADF&PCD and PLD exhibitors. Suppliers that work across multiple verticals are housed in a central avenue that connects all zones. There will be a total of 16 hours of content in total, covering the key themes and challenges in packaging development: technical challenges, sustainability and material choice, consumer and market trends, design inspiration and cross-functional team challenges. This year, the conference agenda has been developed in close partnership with an official Advisory Board, comprising senior people from across the industry. Other highlights include: – The ADF&PCD Paris 2020 Awards: The annual awards celebrating the very best the sector had to offer in 2019. 
– Visitor tours: Tours on offer to visitors will include the Made in France tour; and Eco-tours, which highlight leading products and suppliers of sustainable packaging solutions.
– Innovation & Technology Theatre, which will be the home of new product presentations, launches and insight into the latest technical possibilities in packaging, with sessions themed by product type to make it easier for visitors to find the new products they are looking for."
Cosmoprof Asia 2019 to focus on sustainability and customisation,"Two months before the event, the organizers of Cosmoprof Asia were not hiding their satisfaction. Indeed, the first protests did not dampen the enthusiasm of exhibitors and visitors for a show that has established itself as a must in the Asian region.  With an exhibition area of up to 118,900 square meters, over 3,100 exhibitors, 25 country pavilions, the show was boasting a double-digit growth in visitor pre-registrations. Unfortunately, the continuation of protests and some violent clashes with the police led the organizers to adopt several measures to reassure exhibitors and visitors.  Security measures have been heightened on both venues (AsiaWorld-Expo for Cosmopack Asia and the Hong Kong Convention Center for brands and finished products), and the number of bus shuttles has been increased. “The Cosmoprof Asia team has been monitoring the developments in Hong Kong closely and working meticulously with our partners: venue management, contractors, hotels, security, and services providers to create additional measures and plans to enable a seamless trade experience,” explain the organisers. At the same time, marketing and promotional activities for visitors have been strengthened. More than 10,000 hotel nights will be offered to buyers, each exhibitor can invite two buyers to benefit from this offer. The show’s advertising budget was also increased by 50%. However, the organizers said the impact of public incidents on recent Hong Kong trade shows, including September’s Hong Kong Jewellery & Gem Fair, has been minimal so far.  “Commercial activities in this dynamic and business-oriented city go on as usual. It is also true that, the public incidents usually take place over the weekend while Cosmoprof Asia is taking place during weekdays which means there is a lesser concern on safety,” highlights David Bondi, Senior Vice President Asia at Informa Markets. As far as cosmetic products are concerned, Korea is this year’s Country of Honour, with more than 630 exhibitors, as well as thematic seminar and live demonstrations showing the power of K-beauty. A common theme for both venues will be sustainability: installations and common areas will emphasize the importance of the respect for the environment and circular economy for the future development of the cosmetics industry worldwide. Visitors of the Cosmopack Asia section will be presented the production steps of MEXME, an all-in-one cosmetic product created thanks to the collaboration of the design agency centdegrés and selected Cosmopack Asia exhibitors including Baralan, Cho Chuang, Red Of View, Wish-Tech and Yecai Paper Products. MEXME is a tool that combines make-up for the eyes (mascara, eyeliner, eyebrow, and brush) and lips (mat gloss, mat lip pencil, lip balm). In line with the customisation trend, visitors will be able to build their own tools according to their needs. Dedicated to the fragrance sector, the 2019 edition of CosmoLab will offer an olfactory journey created in collaboration with Opal Cosmetics. Visitors can test single fragrances, experiencing their personal interactions with them, and choose the notes to use when creating their own fragrance. “Now more than ever Asia is still a key market for the cosmetic industry worldwide, and Hong Kong is the best gateway for the main markets in the Asia-Pacific region, such as China, Japan and Korea. Hong Kong is really a melting pot of people coming from the whole continent, and a reference trade stage. Thanks to this strategic location, Cosmoprof Asia is the best hub where to observe local trends, be updated on the latest regulations to enter Asian markets and be inspired by new technologies and inspirations,” points Enrico Zannini, General Manager at Bologna Fiere Cosmoprof."
"Retail: “With Sources, Carrefour banks on the need for transparency”","Premium Beauty News - What did a general company like Carrefour focus on to launch Sources? Gwenaëlle Ogor - What has been going on in the food industry is now visible in beauty: consumers increasingly use applications to know exactly what they buy. According to a study conducted by Statista, the product composition has become the second buying criterion, after the price. It is now considered more important than product efficacy, and it is a major issue, so we wanted to meet this customer need for reassurance. Premium Beauty News - So, should we talk about transparency and/or clean beauty? Valentine Fournier - It is definitely a store dedicated to transparent beauty. Transparent, because we explain everything about product composition to our consumers – we do not hide anything. Thanks to the Beautylitic tool, we now know everything about every single reference in our selection, so we can signal products containing phenoxyethanol, for example. Of course, we take action for clean beauty and hope that in the long run, the selection will be more significant than it is now: we have decided to ban only 76 controversial ingredients. We have made this choice because we consider than in certain categories, the market is not advanced enough yet for us to offer both efficient and clean products – typically, makeup and sun products. However, 17% of our products have the “Les Yeux Fermés” label, which guarantees they contain no controversial ingredient or allergen, according to the Clean Beauty application. So, we can also offer 100% clean products if consumers want us to. Premium Beauty News - What value does the Beautylitic tool add? Candice Colin - This software was designed to carry out a dynamic analysis of thousands of references, i.e. whole departments, in order to manage referencing more efficiently. Taking into account multiple crossed criteria, our algorithms decipher products according to the nature of the ingredients, their use per product category and function, their regulatory aspects, the scientific studies potentially characterizing a solid controversy regarding the very typology of the product concerned… All this is meaningful due to the use of a number of controversial ingredients in most daily products, and not just cosmetics, which creates cocktail and cumulative effects we have no control upon. And as it is managed by our scientific team, our work is fully documented. We provide distributors with essential data for them to understand what they sell. This has become crucial. Generally speaking, there is a huge crisis of confidence going on, and to me, distributors are increasingly considered responsible for the products they offer. Premium Beauty News - As the creator of the Clean Beauty cosmetics deciphering application, are you “comfortable” with the fact that all these products are not clean? Candice Colin - Today, although of course, consumers look for products with more and more irreproachable compositions, I think that above all, what they want is transparency, so they can make well-informed, conscious choices. No one can live a 100% clean life, but we can definitely make choices. That is where the strength of the Sources concept lies. The store offers both highly safe and more conventional products, but it is all clear and explained by beauty advisors. That is the message I want to send. Of course, we try and contribute to developing more virtuous chemistry practices, but what is really important is the notion of not taking customers for fools. The crisis of confidence in our industry results from a huge gap between product reality and what advertizing has done with it. Premium Beauty News - Let’s talk about Sources again. Beyond the features we have already mentioned, how is the offering positioned? Valentine Fournier - We do not attract customers with the price, but with the composition. And yet, the brand is still affordable. 60% of our selection is also available in Carrefour supermarkets and in our parapharmacies. In addition, we have developed our offering so it meets the needs of every single customer in each category. Lastly, we are keen on discovery. We want to be a real new brand laboratory to provide constant renewal. Plus, we offer many mixed services: barber, beauty enhancement, hairstyling, makeup, and manicure bars, beauty salon for both men and women… Premium Beauty News - Are you going to deploy the concept? Valentine Fournier - It is a pilot store, so we are going to wait for a few months to see how it does and possibly develop the concept. We might also create an online version."
"Despite increased competition, the French cosmetics industry benefits from a strong ecosystem","The numbers probably make salivating some less flourishing industries. With 250,000 jobs for 3,200 companies, from SMEs to global leaders, France has some of the world’s most famous beauty brands and is the world’s leading exporter of cosmetic products. Depending on the year, the beauty industry is the 2nd or 3rd contributor to the country’s trade balance and 60% of its annual turnover (31 billion euros in 2017) is exported. Between 2010 and 2018, foreign sales grew at an average annual rate of 5%, according to a recent study by Asteres for the French federation of the cosmetics industry (FEBEA). ""It’s a soft power. With some luxury fashion brands and wines, it is one of the sectors that enjoy worldwide acclaim and build the most of France’s reputation abroad. And this is also what will bring tourists,"" Charles-Antoine Schwerer, director of studies at Asteres told AFP. According to the market research firm’s study, the France’s good reputation in this sector makes it possible to increase the average value of a French cosmetic product by about 30%, compared to a similar product from another country. ""French cosmetics remain the market’s benchmark. It is one of the few sectors where most companies, including small ones, operate at a global scale, where there are still business creations, with very low default rates,"" says Patrick O ’Quin, the president of the FEBEA. With a growing demand in Asian markets, where French cosmetics are highly prized by customers, the horizon seems clear, but some clouds could slightly darken the blue sky. At the forefront of which are the recurring consumer concerns regarding product safety, including the possible presence of endocrine disruptors or nanoparticles in some cosmetics. ""There is a real mistrust of the general public regarding the industry, and this also affects the cosmetics industry. But we must remember that France has one the most stringent regulations and product safety requirements,"" said Christophe Masson, general manager of the Cosmetic Valley cluster, which organizes the Cosmetic 360 trade show dedicated to innovation. In response to these concerns, giant cosmetics makers are trying to jump on the natural cosmetics bandwagon by launching their own natural ranges. L’Oréal, for instance, has launched an offensive on organic cosmetics in Western Europe, one of the few segments to resist sluggish sales in the region. However, for Christophe Masson, the main threat on the horizon is rather the competition from major players such as Korea and Japan, under the effect of ambitious public policies. ""The countries competing with France have smartly listed the cosmetics industry as a strategic sector and have consequently allocated strong resources to the sector,"" he says. In this context, ""it is important to allow our companies to work together, to facilitate the creation of links between the academic and the industrial worlds to ensure that new technologies continue to emerge in France.” To boost growth, the sector is multiplying innovations, for instance by riding the ""beauty tech"". Each year, about 650 million euros are spent on research and development by French beauty companies. Thanks to an ecosystem combining research, education and industry, France remains very attractive for cosmetic players. Japan’s Shiseido, for example, has chosen France for its global perfume centre and the American group Coty has set up the headquarters of its luxury division in Paris. ""Everything is fine, but we cannot afford to rest on our laurels,"" said Christophe Masson, Cosmetic Valley."
Cosmetic 360: innovation around major contemporary beauty themes,"As for the exhibition itself, the organizer has announced an offering mostly focused on CSR, as will be seen with the innovation totems put forward by the 220 exhibitors. “CSR is really getting global in our sector. Companies had already made commitments regarding products and ingredients, so now they are deploying their actions on all levels: processes, logistics, consumer experience, Human Resources, packaging… And all this is conveyed by a number of innovations to discover throughout the event,” explains Franckie Béchereau, the show’s Director. As an example, for the first time, a new animation zone will gather the Glass Valley players, who will introduce their own CSR strategy. And the Cosmétopée Zone sponsored by Greentech and focused on new sourcing approaches will offer the public an entertaining and interactive Quiz Challenge. Likewise, the digital offering was strengthened, in particular with Artificial Intelligence systems to analyze consumer needs in real time. The animation created by incubator The Place will highlight the possibilities provided by massive data analysis by manufacturing makeup products in real time based on the information collected on the first day of the show, at the entrance. Innovation again: The Tech Corner area is designed to highlight future technologies. And this year, the Paper Touch developed by the LGP2 laboratory of the French University of Grenoble will be in the spotlight: this innovative process is intended for manufacturing interactive paper for illuminated and communicating packaging applications. Once again, the Startup Zone will be quite busy, with 30 young, less than 5-year-old cosmeto-digital companies coming with new, disruptive solutions. The area will feature the main trends of the exhibition, in particular with a well-represented hair care offering. The Hackathon will again be organized by the LVMH Group and its Maisons: this year, the main theme is “Sustainable Beauty”, and over 50 young participants are expected. But another trend will also be highlighted: wellbeing associated with notions of positive and inclusive beauty, but also clean beauty and nutricosmetics. “We will welcome many exhibitors in the field of superfood, like Finnish laboratory VTT, and much will be related to CBD-based products, as the branch is getting structured,” adds Franckie Béchereau. Lastly, under the banner Activist Beauty”, the paid conference programme will be focused on companies’ responsible economic, social, and environmental strategies. This year, networking and contact schemes will be further enhanced through several initiatives. Open Innovation will offer project designers the opportunity to meet six market leaders: Nuxe, Chanel, L’Oréal Research & Innovation, LVMH Research, Rodan + Fields, but also IFF, a player positioned a bit more upstream. Over 200 events are scheduled throughout the show. In addition, Cosmetic 360 has always been the place for global clusters to meet. The 4th annual Cosmetics Clusters Rendez-Vous will gather about a hundred professionals to discuss collaborative projects, especially in the research area. The show’s global dimension will also be enhanced, with 30% foreign exhibitors, including from new countries, like Finland, Sweden, or New Zealand. The country in the spotlight this year, the US, will be represented in the US Block through the main trends it conveys. “So many things come from the US and eventually influence our industry in terms of distribution, social media, indie brands, CBD, wellness, beauty tech, and others,” says Franckie Béchereau. Visitors will learn more about these themes with the talk shows organized in the central area. On the agenda: for the first time in Europe, the Mink startup will showcase their 3D printer that instantaneously generates its own makeup based on pictures. The private gala marking the show’s 5th anniversary will take place at the Lido at the end of the first day, and the Awards ceremony will be held on October 17. Since it was created, Cosmetic 360 has always banked on favouring qualified visitors and selecting exhibitors according to the relevance of their innovations. “That is how synergies are made possible. Our approach is definitely pyramidal: we invite the highest function of every service and welcome visitors you will never see elsewhere. Likewise, we are very demanding with exhibitors,” explains the event’s Director. “What satisfies us most is that there is an increasing number of Korean visitors coming separately. That is quite significant, given the importance of innovation in this country”, she concludes."
Cosmoprof Asia 2019 readies to welcome visitors in Hong Kong,"Cosmoprof Asia 2019 will open its doors in less than two months. How many exhibiting companies will showcase in Hong Kong? David Bondi -  We are really satisfied by the first numbers recorded by the next edition of Cosmoprof Asia. We have more than 3,100 companies exhibiting in a total show floor up to 118,900 sqm. The exhibition keeps growing, and I really think that this demonstrates the right decision to have two fair venues, one at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center and one in AsiaWorld-Expo. We can now host more companies wishing to do business in Asia, coming from all over the world. This year 24 country and group pavilions will feature small and medium companies showcasing their distinctive offers. We are very glad to welcome the first-ever Russian pavilion too. A special role will be played by Korea, which will be our “Country of Honour”: Korean beauty will be the key topic for seminars, live demos and special initiatives. Why is it so important for companies and professionals to participate in the exhibition? Enrico Zannini - Cosmoprof Asia was the first international edition of our Cosmoprof platform: thanks to the strength of our Cosmoprof exhibition in Bologna, we could propose ourselves as a reliable partner for companies and professionals interested in new business opportunities abroad. Now more than ever Asia is still a key market for the cosmetic industry worldwide, and Hong Kong is the best gateway for the main markets in the Asia-Pacific region, such as China, Japan and Korea. Hong Kong is really a melting pot of people coming from the whole continent, and a reference trade stage. Thanks to this strategic location, Cosmoprof Asia is the best hub where to observe local trends, be updated on the latest regulations to enter Asian markets and be inspired by new technologies and inspirations. You referred to the two fair venues for Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Asia: is this strategic division important for the constant growth of the show? David Bondi - For sure! Not only can we host more exhibiting companies, but also we are able to offer much more focused contents to attendees for both venues and facilitates specific sourcing need. At AsiaWorld-Expo, all international leaders from the supply chain can show their innovative solutions for the beauty industry, thus providing brands, private labels companies, R&D developers and technicians with the most performing formulations, the most cutting-edge packaging designs and the most avant-garde technologies. This year, more than 950 suppliers will exhibit including industry leaders like Intercos, HCT, Toly Group, Chromavis, Yonwoo to name a few.  At the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, we will host around 2,100 companies, specialized in finished products and brands for all the beauty sectors: Perfumery & Cosmetics, Beauty Salon, Nail & Accessories, Hair Salon and Natural & Organic. This venue is really a strategic location for buyers, distributors, retailers and marketers coming from all over the world to discover what is new for the Asian markets. You are working on a lot of special initiatives to offer more contents to your attendees: which are the most important ones? Enrico Zannini - We are working on many initiatives designed to offer new content and suggestions to operators, buyers, R&D managers and entrepreneurs attending our exhibition. Our show combines the possibility to increase your networking and work on new business projects together with the chance to be updated on the main novelties for the beauty sector and be inspired by avant-garde technologies and services. We will select the most impacting and innovative products, thanks to the Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Asia Awards. We will focus on the latest industry trends and cutting-edge solutions with Cosmotalks, seminars and panels with the participation of highly qualified speakers from international trend agencies, market research companies and academies. For an overview of the trends that will influence Asian, trend-scouters, distributors and opinion leaders can refer to CosmoTrends: a veritable trends bible, prepared by the international agency Beautystreams. The great results of Cosmoprof Asia come from the successful collaboration with BolognaFiere Cosmoprof: any plan for the future? David Bondi - For sure, the partnership with BolognaFiere Cosmoprof is the key factor for the success of our show. Our joint venture proves that sharing the knowledge and the expertize of two leading teams, such as Informa Markets and BolognaFiere, is the secret to offer a good service to our clients. For 2020, we are working together on new exhibitions in Asia, thus answering to the constant growth of the beauty sector in the continent. What are the special features of the show and special experience created for attendees? Enrico Zannini - We organised events at both venues to drive innovation and provide customers next level experience. At AWE To enrich the visiting experience of Cosmopack Asia, The Factory, the realization of the production steps of a beauty product, a key initiative of the exhibitions of the Cosmoprof network, will present MEXME in Hong Kong: a highly innovative all-in-one cosmetic product, created with the collaboration of centdegrés and selected Cosmopack companies. Then, CosmoLab will host an olfactory journey created in collaboration with Opal Cosmetics. Visitors can choose the notes with which to create their own fragrance, directly on the showfloor. At Cosmoprof Asia, at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Center, the latest professional developments are at the center of the Cosmoprof Onstage sessions: live demos with hair show, nail art and make up sessions and beauty treatments. For hairstylists and hairdressing salon operators, the reference event is On Hair.  The special event is made possible through the collaboration with industry leaders. This year event will be kicked off by the largest professional hairstylists’ organization in the world, OMC, bringing along with a series of fascinating hair show and workshop"
"""Chinese consumers feel very strongly about their cultural heritage"", Émilie Coppermann, Symrise","For Emilie Coppermann, Master Perfumer at Symrise and creator of the fragrance, the female Chinese fragrance buyers are ""curious and hyper connected"" and have open their mind to new olfactory codes from the West. However, their main “references remain mainly rooted in the Asian culture and focused on natural and soft scents.” Boosted by a growing interest from Chinese Millennials, sales of fragrances are booming in China. In this buoyant context, the Jahwa group, owner of the Herborist brand, chose to celebrate its 120th anniversary with the launch of what it wished to become the ""first Chine prestige perfume.” For this ambitious development, far from the habits of the brand, the group has drawn on the experience of global design agency centdegrés, which has taken over the repositioning of Herborist’s global image since 2008. For the packaging, the agency imagined a hourglass-shaped bottle, thus expressing the three dimensions of time suspension, as suggested by the tperfume’s name. ""This fragrance stops time. It reflects the paradoxical status of time in China, which is both infinite and cyclical, with no beginning or end,"" said Matthew Rochette-Schneider, General Manager Greater China & Southeast Asia at centdegrés. The development of the fragrance has been entrusted to Symrise. To better understand the brand’s DNA, Émilie Coppermann travelled to China and visited Herborist’s spas and shops. ""I was deeply moved by the brand’s minimalist, natural, feminine and sophisticated identity. That’s why I wanted a flower that could express these values and be found in China as the main ingredient of perfume. Therefore, I selected magnolia and used both the flower and the leaves,"" explains the fragrance creator. Symrise and centdegrés teams worked in close collaboration during development phase with the aim to achieve ""a truly consistent and unique product"". ""Chinese consumers are increasingly supportive of the creations launched by local brands. In this context, Herborist’s Mon Instant was created to be a true Chinese perfume, from the concept to the ingredients. As far as olfactory trends are concerned, I think that natural fragrances will continue to prevail. Furthermore, the current interest of Chinese consumers in their own traditional heritage could pave the way for the development of fragrances based on traditional Chinese ingredients,"" concludes Émilie Coppermann. To meet these expectations, the master perfumer imagined a very feminine and floral natural fragrance, inspired by the values that have been driving the brand for more than twenty years. Please note: Claire Viola, VP Digital Strategy, Fragrance Division at Symrise, will speak at the 3rd Fragrance Innovation Summit, on November 7 in Paris, on the theme: ""Philyra AI-powered perfumer assistant and the millennial generation in Brazil"".

Six avenues towards sustainable cosmetics,"The next edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will discuss practical approaches to change formulations, packaging, and consumption of cosmetics and personal care products to help prepare for a circular economy. Case studies will be given of operators helping move the industry away from linear models of consumption, focusing on six key avenues: Overhaul in design thinking. Is poor product design responsible for many of the sustainability issues facing the cosmetics industry, such as plastic pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and chemical impacts? According to Professor Dr. Michael Braungart, Co-Founder of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry, cosmetic and personal care products can be designed so that materials can be continuously recycled. Adopting the Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) design approach could be a way to start creating positive impacts (as opposed to reducing negative impacts). Packaging waste innovations. It is estimated that over 7 million tonnes of plastics enter the ocean each year and cosmetics. Unfortunately, personal care products are not minor contributors to packaging waste. Lee Mann, Global Community Trade Manager at The Body Shop, will show how it has set up supply chains for the world’s first ‘fairly traded’ recycled plastic. The company has partnered with Plastics For Change so that waste collectors in India pick plastic waste, which is then used in haircare bottles. The initiative is removing plastic pollution whilst giving a premium to impoverished communities in India. Another speaker will show how plastic waste can be used to create new products. Sustainable packaging materials. With growing consumer opposition to plastics, a number of green packaging materials for cosmetics and personal care products are emerging. Green formulations. Many cosmetic and personal care companies are looking to replace synthetic chemicals in formulations, and a number of alternative green raw materials are emerging. EFP Biotek will discuss green alternatives to silicones, petrolatums and lanolin. Genomatica will give an update on its bio-based glycols, DuPont on green preservatives, whilst Covestro will present its new green hair care ingredients. Waste equals nutrients. Food by-products or side streams are becoming recognised as a rich source of cosmetic ingredients. A growing number of ethical cosmetic brands are using such ingredients in their formulations.

"In uncertain times, Brits Embrace “mindful beauty”","Sales of prestige lavender-based beauty products in the UK reported an increase of 552% in value sales in the period January 2019 to end of April 2019 according to The NPD Group. Products based on aromatherapeutic ingredients have reported a similar increase in sales in the skincare sector in the period January 2019 to end of April 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. Sales of rose-based beauty products increased 6% and lemongrass infused products increased in by 5%. Frankincense was a stellar performer in this category, where products formulated with this traditional constituent, said to relieve stress and anxiety, increased sales by over 200%. According to The NPD Group, the growth in sales of these aromatherapy-based beauty products demonstrates a return to comforting, nurturing, heritage ingredients which are central to the Mindful Beauty ritual, popular on social media and amongst wellness bloggers. For instance, #mindfulbeauty has been used over 30,000 times on Instagram as people share their mindful rituals which combine ‘slow beauty’ with mindful gestures, breathing techniques and meditation. These products include (but are not limited to) cleansers, masks, moisturisers and mists to bath and body favourites like soaks, bath and body oils, body and hand creams. “2019 has been a challenging year for many people and in uncertain times, customers return to natural, heritage ingredients and products that offer a comforting, nurturing effect on skin, body and soul. The emergence of the Mindful Beauty trend is a response to the need to achieve solace and self-care in beauty rituals that calm the mind, cleanse the skin and offer a little ‘me-time’ during the morning, evening and weekend beauty ritual,” said June Jensen, Director, NPD UK Beauty. While brands can embrace this trend by infusing their new products with the required ingredients, bricks and mortar retail stores could seize create immersive brand experiences which engage all of the senses."
Cuba falls in love again with the beard - and it’s not about Fidel,"Cuba’s old guard, for the most part, no longer sport iconic beards, but the youngsters do. Clean-shaven President Miguel Diaz-Canel’s government only features one hirsute minister, vice-president Ramiro Valdes, 87. Having a beard these days on the streets of Havana is definitely more a question of style. ""Lately there are a lot of people, especially young guys, who are letting their beards grow - it’s a trend,"" said barber David Gonzalez, 31, as he trimmed a customer’s goatee in his city center salon. In Old Havana’s Rue Obispo, Franco Manso, 24, took scissors to his own beard during a lull in business at his craft shop. ""I saw that it suited me, so as it’s the fashion, I decided to keep it,"" he said. Castro told US television in an interview after the revolution: ""My beard means a lot of things for my country. When we have fulfilled our promise of good government, I will shave off the beard."" In the end, he decided to keep it. But Castro’s facial hair carried such symbolism that the CIA hatched a plan in the early 1960s to un-beard the revolutionary leader. The plot involved an attempt to put thallium sulphate into his shoes so that his beard would fall out and make him a laughing stock. Castro, however, canceled the trip during which the chemical was to be used. Over the years, the symbolism has diminished, even if young Cubans continue to be surrounded at every turn by images of Fidel and Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos - the revolution’s most famous ""barbudos."" But according to clean-shaven journalist and writer Manuel Somoza, there were overwhelmingly practical reasons why beards took such a grip on Cuban culture in the immediate aftermath of the revolution - blades were practically non-existent. Before 1959, Cubans used American Gillette razors, but ""when the embargo began in 1962, everything was complicated,"" says Somoza, 74. ""Beards spread, not only because the beard had a patriotic connotation, but also out of practical need, because the blades of razors were of very poor quality and shaving with them was a nightmare!"" Somoza told AFP. Shaving cream and aftershave quickly became an unattainable luxury, and men had to make do with the cheap soap and scratchy blades acquired with the Cuban ration book, or libreta. Havana thus looked to Soviet-era Czechoslovakia to provide blades under the brand name ""Venceremos"" (’We will Overcome’), sold in boxes bearing the revolutionary slogan ""Patria o Muerte"" (’Homeland or Death’). In time came Soviet-made blades Sputnik and Neva, popularly known in Cuba as ""men’s tears"" because they painfully dragged bristle from the skin, rather than cut it. Schoolchildren used them to sharpen their pencils. Relatives abroad often came to the rescue. ""Glued into their letters home were two, three or four Gillette razors,"" says Somoza. ""When they arrived, it was a party!"" When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990, Havana descended into a deep economic crisis that further complicated access to razors until 1993, when Cubans were allowed to use the dollar as currency and modern razors started to appear in shops. ""I think that the young people’s beards of today have nothing to do with those that we had... Today the young guys are more connected to world fashion,"" said Somoza. For Alain Gil, a 23-year old employee at the Cuban Cinema Institute, there are some benefits to his newly hirsute appearance. ""My girlfriend likes men with beards, she says it’s sexier."""
"“Even in tomorrow’s highly connected retail, sales will depend on humans,” Nathalie Pichard, toPNotes","Premium Beauty News - As physical stores are being challenged by online selling, what becomes of shop assistants? Nathalie Pichard -  They are still playing a crucial role, but it is increasingly difficult for them. Today, things are quite confused in points of sale. The perfume market has become very complex. Launches have multiplied without any training work done, and new concepts have emerged without much explanation. For example, a perfume brand based on a vegan concept was recently launched, and in-store, most staff members could not really explain what it actually meant. Much too often, no one has anticipated beauty assistants’ perception of the brand, and the issue is raised only when problems arise. Then, it is too easy to criticize shop assistants. It is a demanding job, people are not very highly considered and well-paid: brands do not invest much on them. Premium Beauty News - It is often said that with customers who have become experts, because they get informed on the web, shop assistants are out of their depth. Nathalie Pichard - Again, this is too simplistic. Beauty advisors also get informed online, and the majority of people visiting points of sale are far from being experts. In any case, accurate, well-structured sales arguments definitely have unequalled impact and efficacy and can complete, and even amplify digital marketing actions. However, it is true there is a lot to do. It is still not that common to find “augmented beauty advisors” equipped with connected digital tools, and who can provide both expertise and additional experiences. Again, the problem is the lack of investment. To me, although tomorrow’s retail will be highly connected, sales will still depend on humans. Premium Beauty News - And yet, training cannot be the only answer, can it? Nathalie Pichard - That is not exactly what I am saying. If training is a powerful tool for brands, it cannot substitute for a good product and strong concept. Still, it can create a favourable environment and boost performance, in particular by “sticking” the brand’s arguments to people’s minds. If the brand cannot sell among shop assistants, it is likely the latter will not engage in their relationships with customers, failing to make them live the brand’s famous “experience”. Training is a long-range, most powerful weapon whose tangible effects and positive impacts are not sufficiently measured right now. Premium Beauty News - What are the key ingredients for successful training? Nathalie Pichard - First, training needs to be continuous. One session every now and then does not really make sense. Being a shop assistant is a difficult job, and like in any trade, weariness and routine sometimes prevail. So, you need to keep feeding stores with information and emotion related to the brand. You need to support your advisors, encourage and help them over time. You need pragmatic arguments and easy-to-use recipes, especially for perfumes, because they are such tricky products to sell. Premium Beauty News - Does a good product that sells well online really need assistants? Nathalie Pichard - Probably not. But you cannot create a brand only with products. A well-designed, well-positioned product can definitely sell very well, almost on its own. But, there is always a risk for the brand to lose its grip, disappear behind the product, and see its story no longer passed on or firmly anchored in consumers’ minds. Premium Beauty News - Last August, you celebrated the 10th anniversary of toPNotes, your consulting and training agency dedicated to perfume. What lessons have you learnt from this experience? Nathalie Pichard - The adventure even started a bit earlier, when we launched the toPNotes newsletter dedicated to perfumes, 12 years ago. This tool helped perfume professionals reflect and exchange. It is now published every three months and is also used as a networking, visibility-enhancing tool by players in the perfume world. Plus, it promotes the training and consulting business I created ten years ago. In practice, we offer both sales professionals and perfume brands & suppliers tailor-made materials and workshops. Then, brands can also benefit from complementary activities in marketing and communication writing, in particular focused on the digital world. Our expertise covers the customer journey and in-store experience, selling techniques, the brand’s ceremonial, etc. Paradoxically, in a market eager for creation and innovation, sometimes we get too pretentious, trying to get something out of the extraordinary… So, our role also consists in helping brands keep it simple… Our customers are both multinationals and young brands aiming to train their teams, in France and abroad. For example, we recently worked with an Indian distributor who wanted to educate his shop assistants about the niche perfume world and its specific selling techniques. Our added value lies in the fact that we come from the perfume world and have an essential, specific experience of the trade, when many other players are generalists. Almost all our customers work in the perfume industry, although some of our methods can be reproduced in other categories. Fragrance Innovation Summit Nathalie Pichard will deliver a presentation at the next Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris, on November 7, 2019.

Women in the UK want simpler beauty routine,"Over the last year [1], almost three in ten (28%) women have reduced the number of products in their facial skincare routine, with young Millennials aged 20-29 most likely to have simplified their routines. For instance, the proportion of women using just one product to cleanse their face has risen from 25% in 2018 to 28% in 2019. Meanwhile, the proportion of women using four or more products to cleanse has fallen sharply from 26% in 2018 to 18% in 2019. The biggest facial cleansing casualties include facial cleansing wash (from 55% to 50%), as well as facial cleansing wipes (from 54% to 43%) and facial toners (from 29% to 25%). Usage of facial care products has also taken a tumble in the last 12 months. The number of women using day cream/lotion declined from (from 66% to 60%); while night cream/lotion fell from 48% to 44% and blemish balm (BB), colour correct (CC) and daily defence (DD) cream slumped from 21% in 2018 to 15% in 2019.  Overall, the women’s facial skincare market is expected to decline by nearly 1% in 2019, falling to an estimated £1.16 billion from £1.17 billion in 2018. This comes as Mintel research [2] reveals there has been a decline in the purchase of make-up, potentially led by reduced usage following the trend for naturally radiant skin. Indeed, some 31% of women who wear make-up are buying colour cosmetics less frequently now compared to last year, and 19% have spent less on the category in the last 12 months. “A growing number of UK women are turning away from the multi-step K-Beauty routine, hoping to reach the same glowing result without having to put the time in. This need for simplicity has pushed them towards minimalist skincare products with more intense active ingredients, such as serums and oils,” said. Alex Fisher, Global Skincare Analyst at Mintel. “Disposable wipes have been hit particularly hard as consumers become more aware of the product’s negative effects on the environment. As sustainability grows in importance, many beauty consumers are deliberately cutting out these single-use products,” she adds. In such a context, one bright spot in the UK facial skincare market is face oils and serums. Penetration amongst women has remained at 24% from 2018-19, while usage of other treatments (i.e. eye cream, exfoliator, peel or wash-off masks, sheet or leave-on masks, overnight treatments) have declined. According to Mintel, some 40% of women who use facial caring products associate serums with being nourishing. Serums also have an association with ‘glow,’ as 20% of female facial skincare users think serums are brightening, representing radiance and luminosity."
"USA: The clean beauty movement gives its imprint to a robust skincare market, reports NPD","U.S. women are increasingly turning to online research to better understand the ingredients in - and the brands behind - their facial skincare products, according to recent data released in the Women’s Facial Skincare Consumer Report [2] from The NPD Group. The report noted that nearly 50 percent of women surveyed prefer to research products online prior to buying them in-store, citing online reviews and ratings, as well as social media influencers, as their sources of information. “Consumers are using their spending power to ensure their voice is heard and supporting brands that commit to natural ingredients and transparency,” stated Larissa Jensen, executive director and beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. According to NPD, 46 percent of facial skincare users report purchasing products free of sulfates, phthalates and/or gluten, representing a 6 point up-tick over the past two years. In addition, more than half of women look for skincare products made from organic ingredients. The report also found that brands making a public commitment to ingredient transparency have become top-of-mind for consumers, with several of the more well-known transparent brands ranking among the Top 25 in highest awareness-to-purchase conversions. “Skincare continues to perform well among engaged female consumers, regardless of what generation they are in. The number of consumers who are making purchase decisions primarily based on the price of a product is decreasing; as the significance of knowing exactly what they are putting on their skin becomes more important,” Jensen added."
"Applying mascara, male bloggers challenge Russia gender norms","The 26-year-old is one of a growing number of young men in Russia who are offering makeup tutorials and beauty advice online — a practice that is not only boosting their profiles and bank balances but also challenging the conservative country’s strict gender norms. ""I feel that my work is a ’fun’ education that helps people develop in a different way,"" says Gevorg, who goes by just his first name online. He began offering tips on the internet several years ago while working in a beauty store and finding many of his female customers had a limited idea about what they could do with the products. The silver-haired blogger keeps his audience updated with regular Instagram posts and a couple of YouTube videos a week, in which he answers questions from viewers and discusses his latest purchases. Across the two platforms Gevorg has more than 250,000 followers and subscribers, many of them young women, and earns a living not just from sponsored posts but also in-person makeup workshops in cities across Russia. ""My work is to show a wide audience that makeup isn’t about looking like a brightly painted escort — it’s about looking the way you want and showing that you have a choice, whatever you do in life,"" he says. Male beauty blogging is a global phenomenon that has exploded in popularity in recent years - spawning US stars such as James Charles and Jeffree Star, with some 15 million YouTube subscribers each - and is tied in with major brands like MAC and Maybelline hiring men to front campaigns. But in Russia, where LGBT activism is all but illegal under a controversial ""gay propaganda"" law, and politicians are more likely to praise women’s beauty than champion gender equality, the trend has a particular significance. Gevorg admits he found it hard to deal with aggressive online comments when he first started posting about beauty products, which often targeted his Armenian background. ""They said that in Armenian culture you can’t look like that, it’s not moral,"" says the blogger. ""I used to try to engage with people... now I just hit the block button and it doesn’t bother me anymore."" Despite his bright online presence, the stylist says he avoids problems in the street by wearing neutral makeup or none at all. Other top Russian beauty bloggers have reported harassment online and off. Igor Sinyak, who has more than 400,000 Instagram followers, was this year threatened by a group of young people as he was leading a masterclass in a store in the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, some 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) east of Moscow. Videos released on YouTube showed security ushering him out of the building. Russia’s most prominent male beauty blogger by numbers, Andrei Petrov, has posted screen grabs of the abuse he receives via Instagram and YouTube. Sergey Naumov, a 27-year-old whose popular Instagram show sees him copy the makeup of an invited guest, agrees his clips could come as a ""shock"" to many in the country. A native of Chelyabinsk, Naumov moved to Moscow as a teenager and found work as a makeup artist, later launching an eponymous line of beauty products which he promotes through his account. While his videos are intended mainly as entertainment, the entrepreneur hopes they are also expanding Russians’ ideas about what men are allowed and able to do. ""I don’t think the problem’s so much that Russia is a naturally conservative country, more that for such a long time there was the Soviet Union,"" Naumov says, an era when conformity was encouraged or enforced. ""You have to wait for people to become more open, more receptive to new ideas and that is quite a difficult thing,"" he adds during an interview in GUM, the Soviet-era department store on Red Square that has since turned into a high-end shopping destination. ""But it’s exactly shows like mine, like Andrei Petrov’s, like Gevorg’s, that do make people a bit more tolerant, not towards gays per se, but towards guys who wear makeup - it shows that it’s normal."" Sergey Ostrikov, who makes a claim to being the first male beauty blogger in Russia 12 years ago, says Russians are already much more open than they were to content like his. ""There was a lot of aggression towards me at the very start,"" recalls the 31-year-old from the Siberian city of Abakan, who now manages two of his own cosmetics brands. ""Most of it came from women - they were saying, ’How dare a man get involved in this area that was purely feminine’."" The phenomenon of male beauty blogging has ""undoubtedly"" helped the LGBT community in Russia, he added. ""Now there’s a new ’digital native’ generation who have seen stuff like this from their childhoods - they take it all very calmly. Everything’s changed in the last decade and it’s all got easier."""
Retail: Four trends that are changing the face of the beauty sector,"For Adeline Çabale, there is no time to lose: the world of beauty must transform its approach to retail as soon as possible to meet the new consumer expectations. For this former L’Occitane executive, co-founder of the consulting agency the Retail Factory: ""Brands and perfume and cosmetic retail stores are lucky there are not too challenged for the moment by pure internet players, at least in Europe. But, all of them are conscious that the world is undergoing huge changes and that the game play could be very quickly upset."" The North American market was thoroughly upset by the emergence of new brands leveraging on the internet and social networks to develop their notoriety and sales: by building their reputation thanks to the support of influencers and Hollywood stars, like Anastasia Beverly Hills, by imagining a community co-creation model, like Glossier, or by building a personality-driven multi-millionaire pure player business model, like Kylie Jenner or Kim Kardashian, with no physical store (or almost), or by reinventing beauty consumption habits through membership subscriptions, like Beauty Pie. Makeup was the first category impacted, but currently there are now a number of personal care or perfume brands who managed to successfully develop, for a majority of them, digital models. If in retrospect, we can also note that online success can be just as dazzling as it is ephemeral, it cannot be denied that these players have destabilize the balance established and imposed some adjustments to the entire industry. ""The most established brands are fully aware of the challenge and are looking to take the lead,"" highlighted Adeline Çabale. ""Much of our work is to accompany them on this path."" Retail Factory organizes both training courses around the transformation of retail, and retail tours in France and abroad to help its customers ""rethink their POS via an in-store experience and the expertise of sales assistants"". For Adeline Çabale, beauty retail is undergoing major changes around a number of sometimes contradictory trends. ""The most important and most obvious one being the Green/Clean trend,"" she explained. ""In the United States, this involves the development of clean beauty multi-brands like Detox Market, Credo Beauty or Beautycounter."" Beyond ingredients, the eco-responsible trend extends to the packaging sector and to the entire purchasing experience area, including outlets. ""Patagonia, which has long stood as a marginal forerunner, is becoming an example to follow whatever the sector."" Without being incompatible with the desire for naturalness, the other big trend of the moment is, according to the President of Retail Factory, uninhibited luxury. ""People are looking for a casual and intimate relationship to luxury, as can be experienced at Chanel’s New York Atelier Beauté in Soho, with its very instagrammable architecture, its scent room to perform blind perfume tests, its digital application that eases the retail experience and where the sales assistant becomes an expert and a prescriber. The act of purchase becomes a mere formality, it is the customer’s brand experience that will become paramount"". More generally, Adeline Çabale also notes an overall rise of the frictionless trend. ""This is obvious at Glossier and its showroom boutique where no stock is visible. Once the payment is made, products arrive on an automated wall, in a personalized bag, with the first name of the buyer on it, as if it were common practice."" From this point of view, French and European brands and retailers still seem to be lagging far behind in terms omnichannel issues. ""The click & collect is indeed operational, but retailers did not seize the opportunity to propose complementary sales; and the back and forth between online and physical locations is not always fluid."" Players have really become aware of the issues but still face budget problems to complete the synchronization of their online and offline information systems. ""The most advanced country in the area is undoubtedly China, where - almost - every purchase is done with a smartphone. With the United States not far behind."" Finally, in the longer term, vocal trade should really be ""the trend to follow"", according to Adeline Çabale. ""Shopping with your voice is very intuitive and natural. Voice speakers are more and more present in American homes, there is still a lot to be done in terms of technology, but it’s certainly a future trend... and a new emerging distribution channel."" And again, the brands who will know how to impose themselves best in the area should also be the ones changing the rules.

Skin sensitivity boosts skin care sales in Asia,"Data from Mintel shows that 44% of female facial skincare users in China say that having sensitive skin causes them to change or upgrade the skincare products that they use. Meanwhile, a third (34%) of Chinese consumers who use sheet masks will pay more for a sheet mask that’s suitable for sensitive skin. In Southeast Asia, as many as 42% of urban Indonesians purchase products for acne or pimples, while two in five (39%) urban Thais purchase products to treat acne, adds the market research firm. And it’s not just female beauty consumers who are seeking solutions for their skin sensitivities. According to Mintel, seven in 10 (69%) urban Thai male consumers and 63% of urban Indonesian males are spending more on specific treatment products (e.g. pigment cream, acne patch). “It is imperative that beauty and personal care players in Asia understand the nature of Asian skin and that it is more prone to sensitivity due to a thinner stratum corneum. In this light, Asian consumers are on the lookout for effective solutions that help relieve or resolve issues caused by skin sensitivity, resulting in a shift in consumer behaviour and consumption habits. The time is now for companies, brands, manufacturers and retailers to be a pillar of support and build trust with consumers living with skin sensitivities,” said Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation & Insights Analyst, Mintel Beauty & Personal Care. With more and more consumers demanding beauty solutions that help with sensitive skin, Mintel research indicates that they need guidance when choosing the appropriate skincare options. As many as three in four (73%) Chinese beauty and personal care shoppers say that they prefer a beauty advisor who can provide appropriate suggestions on skin issues. “While Asians may be aware of their skin sensitivities, it is important that companies, brands, manufacturers and retailers support consumers in choosing the skincare that will work best for them - and this encompasses all consumer touchpoints, be it through an official brand website, advertising, in-store shopping experience or social channels. Essentially, consumers are in need of expert advice, something that is highlighted in Mintel Trend ‘Return to the Experts’ which uncovers how expert human advice is back in fashion”, Sharon continued. Finally, according to Mintel, beauty brands catering to skin sensitivities and the medical industry will have an opportunity to share objectives. Almost half of Indonesian (49%) and Thai (47%) male facial skincare users say that it is important for their facial skincare products to be dermatologist-tested or endorsed by a medical expert. “To boost their credentials, and hence confidence, among consumers, brands can look at partnering with hospitals or doctors who are either working on or are experts in skin sensitivity”, Sharon concluded."
The Alchemist Atelier challenges bespoke perfume,"As customization and digitalization are all the rage in the world of beauty, and in particular of perfumes, The Alchemist Atelier, the Noustique Perfumes brand, breaks the codes and redefines bespoke perfume. From now on, thanks to the Scent Creator and to an app, perfume fans can become their own perfume-creator at home, or in the first Paris-based Alchemist Atelier store. That is where perfume lovers can directly compose their own 20 ml Eau de Parfum, with the help of a perfume-creator, or attend a one-hour-and-a-half workshop. This new device just the size of a coffee machine results from research work carried out by Alvaro Suarez, one of Noustique founders, and is produced by BSH, the European electrical appliances expert. But what was a real first was that Alvaro decided to partner with a perfume specialist, Puig, to manufacture bases and accords. Beware, no gimmick, quality is guaranteed! The perfume-creators of IFF (Fanny Bal, Juliette Karaguezouglou and Nicolas Beaulieu) and Puig (Elizabeth Vidal, Camille Latron and Bérénice Watteau) worked hand in hand to design 16 bases and 18 accords that can all be combined. In addition, the Alchemist Atelier app provides help with the creative process, by illustrating the formula under development with superb pictures of ingredients. This way, the budding perfume-creators can modify their formulas, with the nose or the eye. The inventions are then produced by the Scent Creator, fitted with highly accurate dosing mechanisms, before being automatically recorded by the device and stored for future purposes. For the four Noustique founders (Alvaro Suarez, Hugo Lasala, Kuba Jedlinski, Albert Casademont), all aged over 30, the fragrance itself no longer matters to perfume brands. “In all perfume stores, there is a fight between brands and packaging, and the juice no longer plays a role!” explains Alvaro Suarez. Each of the founders carries within himself the desire to restore perfume’s prestige. And thanks to technology, they are considering creating a unique perfume, and even providing consumers with value and technology, while creating new business models. Of course, all this also involves a connected experience which federates a community of perfume lovers. What for? To help beginners acquire a common vocabulary and invite them to share their formulas with the Alchemist Atelier community, exchanging them as they would a cooking recipe! In short, The Alchemist Atelier makes it possible for anyone to discover the old, complex art of perfume creation, thanks to the Scent Creator, a most modern, unique tool. Partnerships with brands, including L’Artisan Parfumeur, are already being discussed. In the future, this service may be offered in the Puig group brands’ stores. Rates: Workshops from €59 to €119 – Scent Creator €599 with a free workshop 
Bases & accords from €18 to €26. The Alchemist Atelier: 36 Rue Etienne Marcel 75002 Paris. Open from Mondays to Saturdays, from 11:30am to 8pm. "
Men’s fragrances: French males increasingly interested in higher concentrations,"The men’s fragrance market is far from being negligible in France. By way of comparison, the value of this segment is practically two times lower in the United Kingdom over the same period (116 million euros). As already noted by The NPD Group in the United States, there is a growing interest on the part of French male consumers for higher concentrated essences and launches on this segment have multiplied. While less concentrated eaux de toilette (toilet waters) remain the most coveted category for men, accounting for two-thirds of global sales, the study shows a growing interest in more concentrated, and therefore more intense, perfumes. Sales of men’s eaux de parfum  - which are more intense than toilet waters - rose by 28% between January and May 2019, representing a value of 50 million euros. Even more concentrated, extracts have seen their sales level to double compared to the same period in 2018. And prices, much higher for the most intense categories (74 euros on average for an eau de parfum, 94 euros for an extract, compared to 65 euros on average for all men’s fragrances) do not seem to be a key factor for French male consumers. ""Price does not seem to hamper the interest of consumers looking for more intense and longer-lasting formulas. This enthusiasm for more concentrated fragrances within the men’s fragrance category brings back value and participates in the upscaling of the category"", explains Mathilde Lion, expert beauty Europe at The NPD Group.

Young men transform British hair colourants market,"Usage of in-home hair colourants is soaring among Britain’s star-struck young males, as they take inspiration from celebrities and social media personalities. According to the latest research from Mintel, the number of 16-24-year-old men using hair colourants has grown from 38% in 2018 to a colourful 46% in 2019 [1]. Celebrities and social media personalities seem to play a significant part in the choice of hair colours by young British males: one in five (19%) male in-home colour users say they took inspiration from social media personalities for their latest hair colour choice, while a further 14% drew inspiration from celebrities/models. This compares to the mere 7% of female users who say the same. Showing their adventurous side, just a quarter (25%) of men used the same colour they have always used when they last dyed their hair. “Major celebrities like Zac Efron and Zayn Malik, and 2019 Love Island contestant Jordan Hames have debuted bleached or vibrant coloured hair recently, which has resulted in young men feeling encouraged to express their individualism through their hair colour,” said Alex Fisher, Associate Director for Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. While Britain’s young men are experimenting with their locks, it seems the nation’s more mature ladies are going ’au naturel’ as usage of at-home colourants among women aged 65 and over reduced from 36% in 2018 to just 27% in 2019. UK in-home hair colourants market: Key figures – 46% of British men aged 16-24 used hair colourants in 2019, up from 38% in 2018. 
– 19% of male in-home colourant users took inspiration from social media personalities for their latest hair colour.
– Usage of in-home colourants among women aged 65+ reduced from 36% in 2018 to just 27% in 2019. “At the other end of the age-scale, dissatisfaction with the anti-ageing rhetoric has meant fewer older women are now using colourants, instead, accepting their naturally grey hair. This movement gained momentum in the summer of 2017 when Allure magazine announced it would no longer use the term ‘anti-aging’. Since then, a number of celebrities have spoken out about embracing ageing including Salma Hayek, Helen Mirren and Daniel Craig,"" added Alex Fisher. Actually, overall sales of in-home colourants are far from bright. According to the figures revealed by Mintel, the hair colourants market declined in value by 2% falling to £311 million in 2018. The market value of semi-permanent colour grew by 1% from 2017-18 to reach £13.2 million, while permanent colour fell by 2% to £218 million. Natural versus vibrant continues to be an issue as seven in ten (71%) adults think hair colourant brands should use natural ingredients wherever possible, while half (27%) think a vibrant result is important, rising to 43% of 16-24 year olds. “The growth of temporary colour has not outweighed the decline of permanent colourants. The trend towards ageing naturally means permanent colourants must seek a new heartland, while younger consumers’ expectations for exciting and changeable looks give brands the opportunity to become the experts of at-home techniques. Beauty brands are moving towards natural ingredients to replace chemicals that cause concern for their users. However, in a category that relies on end colour result to create consumer satisfaction, formulation is important and can be difficult to change without affecting efficacy. While semi-permanent dyes can seem less damaging, many consumers are bleaching their hair underneath to get these vibrant results, causing a lot of damage by itself. Many colourants brands are incorporating natural claims where possible, without interfering with the basic chemical reactions that create the vibrant results people want,” concluded Alex Fisher.

Men’s niche and premium scents boost U.S. prestige sales,"For instance, men’s fragrance sales grew by 10 percent - representative of a nearly USD 8.0 million gain - during the two weeks leading up to Father’s Day in 2018 [2]. “The men’s fragrance business continues to enjoy steady growth and not only during times of gift-giving,” stated Larissa Jensen, Beauty Industry Analyst, The NPD Group. “While holidays and new product launches create excitement around men’s fragrances, the release of luxury concentrations like perfumes among several of the top-performing brands currently account for what’s driving growth in the market.” Actually, male consumers have come to better understand the value of highly concentrated formulations, which tend to be more potent and long-lasting. Based on NPD’s Scentiments survey, 35 percent of men indicated that they prefer to wear a scent that not only can they smell, but that others can smell as well [3]. However, according to The NPD Group, growth sales in the men’s prestige fragrance segment are not only due to increased demand for luxury concentrations, but also due to increasing interest in artisanal brands.  “These types of brands are growing not only in popularity but also in distribution, giving the consumer even more options this Father’s Day than have historically been available,” Jensen added. During June 2018, the niche artisanal category grew 13 percent, and it continues to be the fastest growing brand type within men’s fragrance, up 25 percent year-to-date."
MakeUp in Paris will celebrate its 10th edition on June 20th and 21st,"Premium Beauty News - What are the perspectives for the tenth edition? Sandra Maguarian - We expect this edition to be more dynamic than ever! With a total of 164 exhibitors, all the activities and events appreciated by visitors and exhibitors are returning: the Innovation Tree, the Color Wave project, in partnership with Beautystreams, which announces a year in advance the future star colour in beauty, the MakeUPigments area [1]. For the first time, a trends area will bring together agencies participating in the show. We believe this will create synergies and make it easier for visitors to find what they are looking at. And, of course, we will offer many workshops and conferences on the latest trends and technologies. This year, we have asked Anthony Mathé, semiologist to talk about the 40 and 50-somethings, and because the environment is the big topic of the moment, L’Oréal, Quantis, Elipso and Heinz Glas will present the SPICE initiative (for Sustainable Packaging Initiative for Cosmetics) and how manufacturers make their best to reduce waste. The Comité Français de la Couleur (CFC) will also make a focus on Iconic Beauty Colors: Red, Black & Pink. Premium Beauty News - Are special animations scheduled? Sandra Maguarian - Of course! We have planned a spectacular scenography to welcome the visitors at the entrance and we’ll hold an opening and ribbon cutting ceremony with the 15 exhibitors who participated in all the editions since the creation in 2010 [2]. We have also scheduled a charitable operation, which was a key feature of our first editions. The MakeUp Gallery will host seven young artists (painters, graphic designers, photographers) and an auction sale of their works. All proceeds go to fund the CEW Beauty Centers. Last but nt leats, we invite all our exhibitors and some of their clients to a private night tour of the Louvre. Premium Beauty News - What is your personal take of these ten years? Sandra Maguarian - MakeUp in Paris and its North American and Asian spin offs have given great visibility to the makeup category. This show allowed to better highlight the creativity and innovation of all market players. With the MakeUp in shows we created an original concept and set up a platform adapted to the needs of the make-up industry at a time when it was undergoing a considerable transformation. Makeup has emerged as a flagship category in the beauty market, one of the most innovative and dynamic. Finally, I also believe that we have created a family. This is something we can feel at each show. Indeed, the make-up supplier industry is quite small and everyone enjoys meeting several times a year at the different MakeUp in trade shows around the world. This will be the 10th edition of MakeUp in Paris, but also the 33rd MakeUp in show! Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Paris has also become an important landmark in terms of innovation! Sandra Maguarian - MakeUp in Paris has become a reference where exhibitors present innovations, novelties and specific colour palettes. We can also observe the same phenomenon at the New York and Los Angeles editions. It must be said that the market has accelerated with an insatiable need for new products. This is clearly seen in the success of the Innovation Tree, which counts more candidates every year. Premium Beauty News - How are international editions evolving? Sandra Maguarian - In Los Angeles, where the MakeUp in trade show is held alongside Luxe Pack, we are moving to the Convention Center for the 2020 edition. This will allow us to host new exhibitors. Several companies are also on the waiting list in New York, where we also have plans to expand our exhibition area in 2020. As for the Asian shows, they are galvanized by the hyper dynamic trend of the Chinese market in particular and the Southeast Asian region in general. MakeUp in Paris

Mobile barber cuts a dash with Afro-Caribbean Londoners,"In a quiet street in south London’s trendy Brixton district, known for its ethnic diversity, 25-year-old Kristian Robertson parks his trailblazing mobile salon. For a little over a year, he has worked for Trim-It - a start-up offering haircuts for people with Afro-Caribbean roots. Opening the customised van’s sliding door reveals a silver barber’s chair, a large mirror, a hair dryer and drawers overflowing with scissors, clippers and hair products. As he carefully prepared his equipment for the day’s first customer, the meticulously groomed Robertson said clients are ""always amazed"" when they see what is inside. ""Appearance is important, whenever you wanna go somewhere or even if you just wanna feel better about yourself, you get a haircut and it changes your whole day, changes your whole week even,"" said Micah Henry, 24, one of Robertson’s ten-odd daily customers. Henry, who uses Trim-It about once a month, said it was the ""most convenient"" hairdresser he had come across. Appointments are made via a mobile phone app, summoning a van to where the client is. The start-up’s founder, 24-year-old Darren Tenkorang, said the intimate setting of a van helped forge close relationships between hairdressers and their clients. ""The relationship that you have with your barber is a very special one and I feel like this barber shop actually intensifies that because it’s so one-on-one so you can use your barber as a therapist,"" he told AFP. ""You can talk to him about everything from your girlfriend issues to football to business."" Born to Ghanaian parents, Tenkorang was accustomed as a boy to visiting Brixton’s barber shops regularly with his father. He said the business idea came to him after enduring many long waits. Tenkorang now wants to offer a faster service more adapted to the lifestyles of young people. ""We thought it was a good idea to put a barber shop in the back of a van and for an app to be able to book a barber shop to a location,"" he said. ""For us, it’s all about making sure that the service is completely convenient and we sprinkle a little bit of premium (treatment) as well."" The first van launched in February 2018 and the start-up now employs nine people and boasts five mobile salons covering most of London. ""I am just really surprised at how much it has actually taken off,"" said the young entrepreneur. ""We’re definitely going to try to conquer London but our goal is to actually just take over the whole of the UK and thereafter, as everybody is saying, world domination!"""
"“Distribution can renew the perfumery landscape,” Jeanne Doré","Premium Beauty News - What changes has the selective network undergone over the past few years? Jeanne Doré - There have been few changes in perfumes intended for the general public, except for the faster pace at which flankers are launched. Due to consumer tests dictating final choices, sweet notes largely prevail, and creations are less original and more interchangeable. New launches come and go, and one is very much like the next, except for unexpected successes, like Gucci Bloom, which was developed without standardized tests. The perfume is beautiful, and the brand focused its communication strategy on Instagram to reach a younger target. On the one hand, we are trapped in a cycle, on the other, this example offers a glimmer of hope. Premium Beauty News - How is niche perfumery evolving? Jeanne Doré - I will not surprise anyone if I say that the number of brands changes at an extremely fast pace. The landscape is saturated, and niche perfumery is reshaping itself into several categories. On the one hand, many of its greatest names are purchased by groups. On the other, independent brands manage to survive, more or less. And then, small, very alternative, sometimes rather “DIY” houses are quite trendy in the US, where the system is not as academic as in France. If these creations can lack structure, some of them do infuse freshness into this saturated market. Another trend was recently observed: that of perfume experts (perfumers, artistic directors…) who launch their own brand, like Chantal Roos, Sylvaine Delacourte, or Alberto Morillas. These personalities are well-established in the industry. They know their job by heart. And then, there are brands emerging that transcend the niche/selective antinomy to focus on digital technologies, as can be seen with Sillages Paris, who want to democratize perfumery, by using niche perfumery’s basic codes and digitalizing them through an online and sample purchasing system. Premium Beauty News - How does the selective network react to the boom of niche perfumery? Jeanne Doré - Sales have been declining in this sector, just like in traditional distribution channels, whose model is gradually becoming obsolete as customers change. Customers look for differentiation and leave this channel, because the offering is getting too standardized. As a response, most major brands have been developing exclusive lines using niche codes (communication on raw materials, refined bottles…). And yet, creativity is not always obvious, although there are indeed pretty things. In addition, major groups keep purchasing small brands they deem promising. Premium Beauty News - What are niche brands’ advantages to last within this context? Jeanne Doré - Coherence between marketing communication and what the olfactory creation conveys is essential to last. So is patience. And of course, brands should bank on digital technologies, not only because social media have become a key driver, but also to avoid traditional distribution channels. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, and what can be said about distribution? Jeanne Doré - Maybe that is where there are real opportunities to innovate. Distribution as we know it today is obsolete: there are too many go-betweens, too little visibility, and not enough counselling and recommendations, given the teeming offering. Consumers feel lost, which is why I believe in our Box [1]: it turns the spotlight on creators that are very little known or distributed, and it is focused on the exclusive collections of major brands willing to reach a discerning, trend-setting public. It is a way for them to reach customers they would not have attracted otherwise, within an ideal discovery context, but also to educate the public through curation, a role that has become fundamental in this saturated landscape. Perfume reviewing is also essential. I have this dream that one day, people will naturally read a perfume review, just like they do for films or books. I would love to see other initiatives like ours emerge, because it is fundamental to change the market."
Spain: Four years of uninterrupted growth for the cosmetics market,"After a +3.5% rise in 2016, followed by a +2.15% rise in 2017, the Spanish perfume and cosmetics market continues to perform very well. According to figures recently published by the Spanish Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (STANPA), sales of perfumes and cosmetics grew by +2% in 2018. The Spanish market has reached the EUR 6,954 million mark and thus ranking as the fifth European market for beauty products, with a per capita consumption of EUR 150 per year, far above the European average of EUR 137 per person and per year. Exports of perfumes, cosmetics and essential oils are increasing too and have reached EUR 4,680 million in 2018. Export perfumes and cosmetics (excluding essential oils) reached EUR 4,260 million euros in 2018, representing an increase of +10% compared to 2017. Spain has thus established itself as the second largest exporter of perfumes, only lagging behind France, but ahead of Germany and the United States. Exports of this product category have reached 1,820 million euros, which represents 39% of the total. However, Spain also strengthened its position as an exporter of essences and aromas. Exports of essential oils have grown by +8.4% in 2018 to 420 million euros. Citrus oils such as grapefruit, lemon or orange leading the way of the country’s exports in this category. Personal hygiene and skincare products are the main categories of the Spanish personal care market. According to STANPA, these categories represent 52% of the country’s consumption of personal acre products. Thus, sales of face care products increased by +4% in the past year. A total of 97 million units of these products were sold during 2018 in Spain. The consumption of perfumes represents 20% of the total of the beauty industry and has grown by 4.6% during 2018, with a good performance of men’s perfumes (+5% in 2018). The importance of one’s image is becoming increasingly important in a hyperconnected world, as reflected by the growth in colour cosmetics sales (+5%), now reaching a market share of almost 10%. Eye makeup grew by +7% in 2018, facial makeup by +5.5% and lipstick by +4.7%."
Three British trends that could shape the future of beauty around the world,"A new research from Mintel highlights the trends driving innovation in skincare, colour cosmetics and haircare in the UK beauty market that could shape the future of beauty across the world. Skin microbiome As consumers around the world are getting increasingly aware of the importance the skin’s ecosystem diversity for their health, the UK is leading the way globally for facial skincare launches targeting the skin microbiome. Over 37% of the world’s launches in 2018 were in the UK, followed by the US (25%) and France (15%) - according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD). “British skincare brands have been among the first to understand the importance of the microbiome, the natural bacteria found in and on the body which can be balanced through skincare,” commented Jane Henderson, Global President - Beauty and Personal Care Division at Mintel. Beyond the skin microbiome, consumers in the UK are embracing a ’treat yourself’ mindset, prestige/luxury facial skincare accounted for 71% of launches in the UK in 2018, compared to 54% 10 years ago (in 2008). In contrast, budget and mass facial skincare launches are losing out, slightly declining from 14% of all UK launches in 2008 to just 10% in 2018. Clean colour cosmetics Make-up is a serious business in the UK!  The country is the 4th biggest colour cosmetics market globally, valued at an estimated GBP 2.1 billion (EUR 2,45 billion or USD 2.77 billion) in 2018, following beauty powerhouses US, Japan and China. Brits are also the 4th biggest colour cosmetics spenders, with an average per capita spend of GBP 32 per year. In this context, being transparent and “toxin free” has never been greater for colour cosmetics brands. According to Mintel, the UK is the European leader for so-called “clean colour cosmetics” launches, and second globally only to the US.  The market research firm defines clean colour cosmetics as those carrying ’free-from’, ’natural’ and ’ethical and environmental’ claims. According to Mintel, the country accounted for 21% of all global ‘clean’ colour cosmetics launches in 2018. ""The clean beauty movement started out in skincare and is now quickly moving into colour cosmetics, with the UK leading the way. Consumers are holistically looking to clean up their lifestyles, so clean makeup will become increasingly important in the coming years. Clean beauty is more than a trend, it’s a lifestyle, and as such brands must adapt to the changing landscape to secure their place in the future market,"" explained Henderson. The rise of vegan and gluten-free haircare In the wake of the clean beauty trend, British consumers are more broadly embracing beauty with a conscience. Vegan claims, for instance, trebled in haircare between 2014-18 in the UK, rising from 6% of all launches in 2014 to an impressive one in five (20%) in 2018. In comparison, only 10% of haircare launches across the globe carried a vegan claim. Meanwhile, gluten-free claims trebled in haircare between 2016-18 in the UK, rising from 3% of all launches in 2016 to 9% in 2018. In comparison, just 4% of haircare launches across the globe carried a gluten-free claim. ""The UK is a hotbed of beauty innovation, with major global trends emerging and developing. In the next 5-10 years, the skincare industry will expand from simply focusing on the microbiome to also include the exposome, i.e. external environmental factors like pathogens, fungi, pollution and plants that interact with our DNA and affect our health. This will inspire NPD that takes a bespoke and holistic approach to skincare and health, such as exposome-measuring wearable devices, bespoke ingestibles, personalised DNA nutrition, and products that boost skin health and personal air quality,” concluded Jane Henderson."
"""The trend will be for a more measured consumption,"" Mathilde Lion, The NPD Group","Premium Beauty News - How do you explain this decline, putting aside this year’s particular social and economic background? Mathilde Lion - The yellow jackets movement in France and its consequences are not the only reasons for this situation, since we were already last year on a -1% trend. The overall context is no help to favour an upturn in consumption recovery, particularly in the Prestige segment, and this trend can be observed across other sectors. Cosmetic products and fragrances are not basic necessities, allowing consumers to make choices in their budget allocation. Overall, for budgetary or ecological reasons, the trend is towards a more careful or rational consumption. Premium Beauty News - Is there a transfer of selective sales to other channels? Mathilde Lion - Our study covers sales of prestige brands in selective, excluding Private Labels and exclusive brands, as well as on-line sales through e-retail sales of perfumeries and department stores and of some pure players. It is true that on-line sales are continuing to progress with a 17% increase in 2018, it is a significant growth driver but which does not compensate losses in outlets. There are also more and more online players who offer Prestige brands, be they specialists like Notino or Look Fantastic, discounters like Beauté Privée or generalists like Amazon. This offers new alternatives to consumers. To this must be added the development of own sales by brands via their websites or the expansion of their network of owned outlets. All this represents as many possibilities versus purchases performed in perfumeries and department stores. Premium Beauty News - These figures do not take into account retail brands or exclusive brands, does that change the picture? Mathilde Lion - Indeed, by looking at the results for other countries where we also introduce these brand profiles, we noticed a strong development of these specific brands in the medium term. In that regard, we could therefore consider that Prestige finally, is doing pretty well. However, in the UK for example, where exclusive sales and Private Labels acted as a major growth engine, this was no longer the case this year either. Premium Beauty News - What are the most impacted categories? Mathilde Lion - Make-up is at -4%, perfume at -2% and personal care at -1%. Overall, there is a cross-over trend between make-up and personal care with a strong slowdown for make-up with sales estimated to 440 million euros for 2018. It is the smallest category in terms of sales in the selective circuit dominated to the two thirds by perfumes. However, it concerns Prestige traditional brands and not exclusive house brands, very popular in this category. Moreover, the emergent category of applicators for the face, and the lips, is recording good results. Premium Beauty News - Is this decline in selective specific to France? Mathilde Lion - Our studies cover Europe, the UK, Spain, Italy and very soon Germany. Overall, the French market is indeed the one where sales in value were down the most. UK was an important growth driver, but for other reasons, it slowed down significantly in 2018 with less than 1% in value. Conversely, Southern Europe continues to perform well with +4% in Spain and +3% in Italy. Premium Beauty News - How did end of year sales do? Mathilde Lion - The Black Friday week was very positive, but then the momentum slowed down significantly for the reasons we know. The last few months of the year have weighed significantly in the overall drop because they are the busiest months of the year, yet sales did not stall that much during that period. For example, the Paris region managed to stay afloat better than other regions despite store closings every Saturday. Parisians organized themselves differently. Premium Beauty News - What are your forecasts for 2019? Mathilde Lion - The trend will continue, we expect a similar drop of around 2%, more or less for the same reasons. There is no major restructuring underway that could change the game play and it is true that household confidence is currently at its lowest level."
"""In an increasingly competitive market, niche perfume brands must reinvent themselves,"" François Hénin","Premium Beauty News - Today, what are the expectations of buyers of niche perfumes? François Hénin - It’s no secret that the proliferation of brands is thoroughly changing market rules. As a result, buyers select brands according to their sales potential, particularly for in the Middle East or Russia, that remain the largest consumer markets for this type of perfumes. This phenomenon is particularly visible in London, at Harrods or Selfridges. The Agarwood note has lost some of its popularity, which doesn’t mean it’s a has been, and ranges built around this note still remain attractive. Moreover, buyers are also expecting brands to innovate and reinvent themselves to attract a new target: young people and millennials. Premium Beauty News - What are the consumer expectations like today? François Hénin - Brands, for example, must adapt to the wishes and wants of millennials, who have different consumption habits than older age groups, like the Histoires de Parfums brand which proposes small sizes (15 ml), miniature replicas of its perfume bottles. They are cute, market-trendy, and they suit young people’s lifestyle. It could be referred to as a 3.0 niche, undergoing major changes. More generally, the public is looking for exclusivity and personalization; this is why customer experience has become essential. So much so that Amazon, for example, is about to open brick and mortar outlets to diversify the buying experience. And the other point is that due to the fact selective perfumery brands have now also made theirs the discourses and codes of the niche, with their exclusive ranges, niche perfume brands must renew themselves to come up with something different to offer customers. Customers have also become more eco-conscious, and sensitive to the use of recyclable materials, a new challenge for brands. Premium Beauty News - Finally, how do retailers adapt to this new game play? What are your expectations, your projects? François Hénin - We are evolving too! As an example, at Jovoy, we had, sadly, to end our partnership with some twenty brands, the ones who did not succeed in attracting their customer base in our outlets, but this decision has nothing to do with the quality of their products... Concerning my customer base, brands who failed to find their place are often those who are still cultivating an obsolete vintage style. The mushrooming of brands forces us to be more selective, even if criteria may vary from one concept store to another. At Jovoy, we are in favour of the ""new wave"", ""new school"" side, to surprise consumers; original concepts such as L’Orchestre Parfum, or the Australian brand Gold Fields and Banks, a line of beautiful fragrances with a simple design. Another of our favourite perfume house is Domaine Privé, which offers perfumes at affordable prices (100ml for 88 euros). This is another good example of brands having to adapt to an ever younger customer base. Quite a challenge for a retail brand like ours!"
Germany: Natural and organic cosmetics gained more than a million new customers in 2018,"The German market for natural and organic cosmetics recorded a 5.9% growth rate in 2018, while the entire cosmetics market was mostly stagnating, unveiled market research and consulting firm Naturkosmetik Konzepte [1]. Sales of natural and organic cosmetics reached 1.26 billion euros. While drugstore remain the main shopping channel for these products, many consumers are purchasing new products online. ""In 2018 alone, more than 1 million additional customers purchased natural and organic cosmetics, with 40 % purchasing this category for the first time,"" highlights Naturkosmetik Konzepte. Foremost younger shoppers are looking for new, trustworthy products. According to Naturkosmetik Konzepte, new shoppers are questioning raw materials and the claims of the cosmetics industry and prefer smaller brands that reflect their own ethic principles by adapting quickly to new trends. “Climate protection, mindfulness for the own body as well as nature, zero waste and nature-friendly products are on the winning side,” notes Naturkosmetik Konzepte."
"“One of the main challenges for niche perfumery is to renew the customer experience”,  Sylvaine Delacourte","Premium Beauty News - What is your view on the evolution of the perfume market? Sylvaine Delacourte - I think customers feel a little lost today, with the multiplication of flankers in the selective network and the proliferation of brands in niche perfumery. If the latter used to offer a creative revival, in turn, most of what it now produces is déjà vu – or unwearable products. If it has become difficult for the public to know where to start, brands are also struggling to stand out in this saturated landscape. In fact, they need to innovate and differentiate themselves by offering this little extra, like gifts, or hosting workshops or conferences, which help raise consumer awareness through a new experience. The more you educate customers, the better they can identify quality. To me, that is where niche perfumery can play a role. It needs to recreate emotion, before reviving a name. Premium Beauty News - What are consumer expectations today? Sylvaine Delacourte - Just like in the food industry, the public is more and more eager to know what ingredients are used in perfumes. It is not a new phenomenon, as such, but it is intensified by the vegan movement. The advent of apps like Yuka exacerbates this trend. Given this increasingly demanding public, the industry will definitely be compelled to change formulation over the next few years. Cosmetics should be clean, in particular as regards animal well-being. Perfumes cannot escape the rule. If, tomorrow, a brand like mine wants to enrich its range with a perfumed milk, for example, it will have to be clean. We did not have to deal with this issue when I started, 22 years ago. It also highlights a certain curiosity for what lies behind the perfumery scene, especially since this sector was long surrounded with mystery. As soon as I started my blog (espritdeparfum.com), ten years ago, I chose an educational approach focused on raw materials. I am still developing it with my brand’s website. We need to communicate and educate people to the essences of perfumery as a way to renew the customer experience. Premium Beauty News - What about distributors? Sylvaine Delacourte - Distributors want us to be present for more closeness with the public. We need to be out there on the field: we are permanently contacted to host workshops and conferences in order to renew the customer experience. Then, ecology is another major challenge to which I already paid much attention when I created my brand in 2016. This issue has become essential to distributors: for example, they require recyclable packaging. Lastly, I would add that, generally speaking, we should now offer a service, beyond a mere product. Premium Beauty News - How do you benefit from your experience in the industry? Sylvaine Delacourte - I have a certain credibility, mainly with distributors, but also with the public, to a lesser extent. It is reassuring to come from one of the greatest perfume houses, like Guerlain. This experience also sharpened my perception, and being demanding is an advantage when you launch your own range."
Online sales boost the British prestige beauty market,"The sale of prestige beauty products online in the UK reported an increase of 13% in the 12 months to the end of 2018 according to The NPD Group. Total beauty sales declined 1% compared to 2017, of which 100% of the losses came from the makeup category which declined 7% compared to 2017. On the other hand, fragrance and skincare finished positively for the year driven by double-digit growth online. The total value of the prestige beauty market in the UK was valued at £2.7 billion in 2018 (vs. £3 billion in 2017). The market for online beauty products continues to grow with a wider range of businesses offering Click & Collect, next day and sometimes same day delivery. Amazon Now through its Prime subscription service offers a two-hour delivery service for a capsule range of beauty products in select postcodes. Ecommerce now accounts for 20% of all sales value in the prestige beauty market, while Bricks and Mortar represents 80% of the market, a decrease of 4% compared to 2017. “The high street market for prestige beauty has faced many challenges in 2018 from low consumer confidence, a decline in foot fall, businesses falling into administration and Brexit which have all compounded the financial woes on the high street. There are many positives here; Ecommerce is growing, and the high street has responded too, adapting its model to offer more experiential retail opportunities for customers,” says June Jensen, Director, NPD UK Beauty. The high street remains central to the prestige beauty market accounting for 80% of sales in 2018. High street sales of fragrance increased 1% in December 2018 vs December 2017 helped by a late surge during the week of Christmas Week (week 52) where Bricks and Mortar over performed 51% year-on-year. According to The NPD Group, this demonstrates the continued importance of high street outlets and department stores, as prestige beauty relies on a hands-on, consultant-led approach with demonstrations, sampling, gift with purchase and make-up lessons all part of the retail mix. “2018 certainly has been a year of upheaval on the high street, but prestige beauty retailers are resilient and are responding accordingly. Strong growth from fragrance late in the year demonstrates that there remains a significant demand for perfume on the high street. Sales were also helped by a late surge in last minute present shopping on Sunday and Monday pre-Christmas Day, and by consumers stocking up on their favourite scent in the Boxing Day sales. Naturally, strong growth online is good news for beauty brands, who are focusing on a multi-channel approach to reach their customer,” concludes Jensen."
"France: the beauty market remained stable in 2018, according to Kantar Worldpanel","This annual event is the most eagerly awaited by beauty players. Last February 14th, CEW and Kantar WorldPanel unveiled the 2018 figures of the French beauty market in front of a packed audience. To Laurence Moulin, General Manager of CEW France, “the Beauty Business event provides a mapping of the market to make an update on the previous year and confirm objectives for the next.” In France, the hygiene-beauty category has been “deprioritized” for several years in household budgets. “There is a decline in the beauty budget, which leads to an overall 0.8% market drop in volume (compared to -1.3% in 2017), and a 0.2% drop in value,” explains Anaïs Dupuy, Business Development Manager of Kantar WorldPanel. Consumers buy fewer products, but these have a higher monetary value. This can be explained by a routine change, as consumers increasingly turn to organic, selective, or new products. As the population rises by 0.4% per year, mechanically, there should be at least a similar rise of the market… which means the 0.2% drop is significant! Although every French person purchased at least one hygiene-beauty product in 2018 (penetration rate of 98.2%), buying acts declined by 0.5 point in three years, and hygiene-beauty opportunities dropped by six per week in six years (51.4 in 2013, 45.2 in 2018). The market has turned to face skincare, the category that recruited the highest number of buyers in 2018. For the first year, the “face toiletries” category receded, although it had remained stable until then, thanks to the success of micellar waters over the past years. The “less is more” trend, the will to turn to natural skincare, the rise of societal and environmental concerns, with the vegan and zero waste movements, the impact of icons and influencers taking a stand for the no-make-up or deo-free practices… all these factors contribute to simplifying routines. In addition, the market seems to be divided into two. Consumers aged under 50 tend to purchase fewer hygiene-beauty products, while those aged 50+ buy more of them. As a result, it is important to make young consumers reengage in hygiene-beauty, because if they de-consume now and change their routines, they are likely to maintain this behaviour in the future. Hygiene-beauty remains the most “multichannel” category of consumer goods: 46% of the money spent in this sector goes to specialized channels (i.e. +1.4 point, compared to 2014). “The year 2018 highlights a change in the choice of buying channels. French people buy their products using 3.3 channels (3.1 in 2014), which emphasizes the fact that consumers switch back and forth between the various distribution channels,” explains Anaïs Dupuy. Supermarkets have been losing ground, although 60 units out of 100 are still purchased through mass distribution. However, for the first time, pharmacies have been losing ground, contrary to discount shops (Gifi, Stokomani, Action, etc.), which are continuing their progression. Ultimately, pure players on the web keep growing on the beauty market, with 1.3 million new buyers over a year. Almost one French person out of three purchased hygiene-beauty products online with a budget of about 100 euros per year in 2018. Out of 100 euros spent in e-commerce, 17.90 concern this category, compared to 9 in the traditional channel. It certainly deserves close attention… Despite the weakness of its internal market, the French cosmetics industry remains healthy, thanks to its high export performance. According to the French Federation of Beauty Companies (FEBEA), the year 2018 was actually marked by a new record: export sales exceeded 14.5 billion euros – a 6.3% rise, compared to 2017. “Beauty Business is aimed to become one of the three main CEW annual events, with the Journée de la Beauté and the Achiever Awards. It is organized in partnership with the industry’s leaders, who do us the honour to accept our invitation,” emphasizes Laurence Moulin, General Manager of CEW France. Next CEW France events: - March 25: Joël Palix, Success story FeelUnique
As his professional career is taking a new direction, Joël Palix will think back on the five years he spent as the head of FeelUnique, which became the first European beauty e-shop with him as a Director.

New export sales record for the French cosmetics industry,"French exports of perfumes and cosmetics broke the 14.5 billion euro mark in 2018 according to figures published by the French trade association representing cosmetic manufacturers (FEBEA). A +6.3% increase compared to 13.6 billion euros in 2017. While the French market itself is still struggling (-0.2% in value in 2018, according to Kantar Worldpanel), exports remain more than ever the main driver of French manufacturers in the sector. Logically, export sales in value exceeded this year again the turnover achieved by the manufacturers on the French market and the trade balance remains largely in surplus (11.2 billion euros, i.e., an increase of nearly 6.6% over 2017). The French cosmetics industry, thus secures its place on the podium of French export champions just behind aeronautics and wines and spirits. Despite the slowing down of the global economy, which hampered the rise of exports (they had increased by +12% between 2016 and 2017), this new record confirms the attractiveness for French cosmetics. ""French cosmetics continue to play a leading role across the world. Admired for its excellence, it innovates constantly to meet the new quests of consumers for well-being: quality and safety of formulations, personalisation of products and environmental commitment,"" enthused Patrick O’Quin, President of the FEBEA. Despite a slowdown, exports to Asia have remained strong, with a 16.6% increase in 2018, and increases of more than 20% in China (+ 22.7%) and Singapore (+24%). Today, more than 20% of French products are exported to Asia, representing more than 2.6 billion euros in value. Meanwhile, exports to North America posted an increase of 6.8%, including a rise in sales of 5.7% in the U.S. This country is the second largest market for French exports. While sales in South America and Central America remained stable. The leading destination for French exports, the European Union is also experiencing sustained growth with a 4.5% rise in sales of Made in France products. The highest increases occurring in Spain (+8.5%) and Italy (+7.2%), two markets that are continuing to close the gap. French manufacturers are watching closely the outcome of Brexit negotiations, as the United Kingdom is the second EU country (after Germany) for French exports of perfumes and cosmetics (more than 1 billion euros, up 3% in 2018). Outside the EU, a strong growth of Russia (+17.8%) is observed. The picture is more contrasted in the Africa zone, with a +16.8% rise in West Africa, but a drop of 6.8% in Central and Southern Africa. North Africa is also declining (-3.7%), mainly due to the ban on imports in Algeria. Finally, a slight drop (-2.1%) in exports can be observed in Near and Middle East markets (Saudi Arabia, down 6.2%), closely linked to oil price variations. Personal care products and perfumes still account for three-quarters of French cosmetic exports: 45% for personal care and 22% for perfumes. Among other leading categories, make-up continues its momentum with exports up (by 4.8% for lip make-up and 3.7% for eye make-up), while haircare preparations and shampoos are not lagging behind with increases of respectively 7.5% and 5.8%."
How is Muslim beauty redefining the Asian cosmetic market?,"Premium Beauty News - How is Muslim beauty redefining the Asian cosmetic market? Florence Bernardin - The majority of Malaysia and Indonesia inhabitants are Muslims (respectively 60% and 87% of the population), and Indonesia is the biggest Muslim country in the world with 225 million Muslims. In these countries, Muslim women are highly observant of their religion and it has a strong impact on their relationship to beauty. Premium Beauty News - Social media also play a role? Florence Bernardin - Young Muslim modern women are redefining the fashion and beauty landscape, by creating modest fashion empires (Fashion Valet by Vivy Yusof, Hijup by Diajeng Lestari) or new halal beauty platforms (Pretty Succi). Muslimah are the new social media influencers, they share their beauty tips, their faith testimonials and their family moments, creating a strong bound with their community of followers. Premium Beauty News - A huge opportunity for Halal beauty? Florence Bernardin - Halal beauty is booming as Halal certification becomes a requirement in Indonesia for every product in 2019, making the 4th most populated country in the world a huge market for Halal beauty and innovation. In parallel, Malaysia appears as an expert in halal certification, attracting foreign companies, like Amore Pacific who plans to open a new manufacturing plant in Malaysia by 2020 to tap into the Halal beauty market. Premium Beauty News - Is Halal the new black in these countries? Florence Bernardin - Halal now goes beyond religious concerns as halal certification requires a strict, clean process of fabrication. By nature, it’s free from most animal components and cruelty-free, which makes it appealing to the vegetarian/vegan public and consumers concerned with ethics and safety. Actually, Halal is becoming an equivalent of clean and safe beauty. Premium Beauty News - Is it also an opportunity for indie brands? Florence Bernardin - The past three years saw the emergence of a huge number of local indie brands, who not only introduce make-up that can compete with international brands in terms of quality and colour palette but also advocate local pride and diversity in skin tones and beauty features. Indie brands have also totally submerged the market by promoting their products through influencers like Tara Farysia or Khainina Khalil, and addressing their fans through feminine and edgy Instagram accounts (Dear Me Beauty, Mad for Make Up, dUck Cosmetics).

The homemade trend in the spotlight,"Aroma-Zone, one of the pioneers of this concept and an expert in “homemade” aromatherapy, has been leading the market for 18 years as a real reference brand. President and Co-Founder Anne Vausselin has observed an assertion of behaviours and of the market itself over the past few years. “At first, we were seen as UFOs. Today, our offering is in line with a basic trend that has more to do with society than business. For consumers, it corresponds to a need to reappropriate knowledge about the products they consume. It is a need to control things,” she explains. Initially created in 2000 as an e-shop dedicated to essential oils, Aroma-Zone decided to focus on DIY as soon as 2005, as they gave access to over 1,000 cosmetics recipes to do yourself, thanks to a broad catalogue of raw materials, containers, utensils, and then finished products. A first store opened in 2009, before being extended in 2014 to offer a 500 m2 space, including a workshop and a spa. The year 2018 was marked by the opening of two new points of sale in Paris and Lyon, and 2019 promises an expansion of the network across France, as well as towards bordering countries. As it is gaining ground on conventional cosmetics in terms of market shares, the DIY dynamics has been attracting new players. “And it is not about to stop, because the offering will get broader,” predicts Nelly Pitt, creator of the Beautymix brand, whose concept consists in associating ingredients and recipes with a robot for the homemade manufacturing of all bathroom products. “After cooking and sewing, cosmetics is one of the latest in the homemade field to which consumers increasingly turn. I think it is the future of cosmetics. There should be something for every taste, and this one is not completely satisfied,” she adds. The homemade trend echoes the expectations of consumers with a greater ethnic, social, age, and sex diversity. “It has become a fundamental need to take care of yourself and of your close environment with natural products. The purchasing power should also be taken into account: customers want fair prices compared to the value of their products,” says the President of Aroma-Zone. If the first bloggers and YouTubers rivalled with complex formulas composed of a long list of ingredients, today, the trend is moving towards more simplicity. “Over the past five years, in particular with the slow and moderate consumption movements, we have found out that consumers want formulas composed of maximum five or six ingredients, and which are easy to make, cheap, and above all, very efficient. We are going back to basics, with a business objective that is far above what it was ten years ago,” explains Anne Vausselin. This minimalist approach is also the basis of the Beautymix concept: in its catalogue, the brand deliberately offers only 28 multifunctional ingredients, with which the 14 recipes offered can be done. “Consumers can easily get lost in the huge diversity of raw materials available. The idea is to simplify the approach for beginners and focus on quality ingredients that can fulfil several functions,” explains the founder. For those that follow the trend, making a cosmetic product themselves, meaning they control its composition, is also a safety guarantee. But to actually ensure the product safety, users should be aware of a number of good hygiene practices and learn how to respect doses and preserve formulas. “Obviously, the safety of cosmetics requires a dose of good sense as well as raising public awareness, just like it does for cooking,” explains Anne Vausselin. However, health authorities and the main players have committed to setting up stricter regulations and ensuring safety homogeneously, through all the entities involved. Aroma-Zone has carefully answered all requests from ANSM (French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety): the company made tremendous efforts to demonstrate the safety of its offering, over two years, and by means of considerable investments. “Today, all our recipes are assessed by toxicologists under the same conditions as cosmetic products placed on the market. All our workshops are also evaluated. We worked extremely hard on all the bases to be personalized: combined with actives or perfume extracts, they represent millions of potential combinations. And we secured these millions of possibilities by developing algorithms,” explains Anne Vausselin. Same arguments for Beautymix: they have their ingredients and recipes tested by toxicologists to validate their safety. “We did everything to guarantee comprehensive solutions that support people from the first to the last manufacturing step, by ensuring both safety and traceability throughout the process.” Users register the products manufactured on their mobile Beautymix app, which provides the expiry date and the traceability of the raw materials used. “It replaces the product label,” explains Nelly Pitt. “Initially, the objective was to control market players’ practices, and it was commendable, because everyone benefits from a regulatory framework, and the market keeps developing. But, obviously, authorities are less demanding with those that do not play by the rules. We need to follow consumers: they show a real need for freedom, they have expectations. But, of course, it needs to be secured, if only for the concept to last,” concludes Anne Vausselin."
"Beauty trends: Green, clean… what’s next?","Over the past two years, countless other requirements have added up to “green” and “clean”: vegan, halal, cruelty-free, local, seasonal, DIY, handcrafted, small batches, and zero waste - and of course, “organic” is at the source of this widespread green movement (we had almost forgotten about it!). In addition to these leading trends, today’s consumers want evidence that their products are environmentally friendly: what the product contains is no longer the main issue, nor is efficacy. Instead: where do the ingredients come from? How were they and farmers taken care of? What are the materials contained in the packaging? How are products transported? Etc. All this raises many other questions brands and suppliers need or will need to answer, like: is it meaningful to have ingredients come from the other side of the world? Is it ethical and coherent to boast about using a plant from Amazonia or Okinawa? At least, certainly not without offsetting the carbon emissions produced or ensuring the sustainability of the said ingredient (“giving back to the Earth”). Given the many discussions available online, in public hearings, in focus groups, or in the written press, it will no longer be acceptable. The search for transparency has no limits: the corresponding term is “Radical Transparency” (the economic model of DNVBs). Indeed, it is now packaging’s turn to be in the spotlight, with the following questions to answer: is the pack used recyclable? Recycled? Biobased? How? Why has the brand chosen to use this material instead of another? What country does it come from? What about transport? The use of single-use plastic is despised, and the era of post-plastic is coming, as can be seen with Lush’s Naked range and their three zero plastic stores, and the success of solid cosmetics (Lamazuna have seen their sales boom since COP21), of new bulk cosmetics models, like CoZie, or of DIY, such as the new Typology brand – the first competitor to Aroma-Zone? They use plastic, but they say they have been working hard to get rid of it. Traceability is being implemented throughout the supply chain, because users want and will want to know everything. Hence this key position for brands: state, explain, provide information upstream (before any potential bad buzz)… even if everything is not perfect. Indie brands do that particularly well: “We are not perfect, but we are working on it!” To conclude, the equation of 100% virtuous brands is hard to solve, but many initiatives give reason for confidence, as they help manage this huge change – for the planet, which also means for us. Both the main players in the cosmetics and food industries and Indie brands give priority to sustainable development and CSR. And it is getting cross-disciplinary, just like digital technologies were, ten years ago. The fact that a giant like Danone achieves the feat of meeting the B Corp Certification requirements is incredibly inspirational! (In Canada and the US, Emmanuel Faber aims to have Danone Monde get B Corp-certified in the years to come: see the film Après Demain. In the cosmetics industry, Laboratoires Expanscience already have this certificate). The new Loop “zero waste” platform to be launched next spring is also an amazing initiative: this e-commerce website federates 25 multinationals and involves a deposit system for flagship consumer products in order to reduce waste. And of course, it is easy-to-use for consumers. As for ADEME (French Agency for the Environment and Energy Management), they have launched the “Circular economy” label as the ultimate guarantee. Everyone is active on their own level. “Be part of it!”, as Stella McCartney exclaimed as she announced the creation of a Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. This article provides a synthesis of the already available study “Green, what’s next?” conducted by Florence Bernardin, Laurence Caisey, and Hugo Willemin.

"Intelligence is the common thread of top 10 global consumer trends in 2019, finds Euromonitor","“The world feels out of control as we move into 2019. There is much political upheaval in developed markets and fast, totally unprecedented change in developing economies,” say Euromonitor analysts. In such a context, many of the global consumer trends to watch in 2019 are about taking back control and asserting oneself. “We need to feel just a bit more powerful amidst the chaos,” highlights Euromonitor. The top 10 global consumer trends chosen by Euromonitor in 2019 are: – Age Agnostic. Boundaries of old age are shifting. As people live longer and take better care of themselves, older consumers feel and want to be treated as younger.
– Back to Basics for Status. Shoppers are searching for authentic products and experiences, moving away from overt materialism to simplicity as well as from generic to higher quality products.
– Conscious Consumer. What used to be the domain of ethically-positioned, niche producers is now being embraced by conventional companies.
– Digitally Together. High-speed internet and mobile internet are driving live interactive experiences online and facilitating instant collaboration.
– Everyone’s an Expert. Whereas previously shoppers relied on a certain brand or information source, now companies must constantly innovate to entice more inquisitive shoppers.
– Finding My JOMO. The Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) has now given place to the Joy Of Missing Out (JOMO). Consumers want to protect their mental wellbeing, disconnecting from technology and prioritizing what they truly want and enjoy doing.
– I Can Look After Myself. As people become more self-sufficient, they take preventative measures against illness, unhappiness and discomfort without consulting a professional.
– I Want a Plastic-free World. The push for a plastic-waste-free society has gained momentum.
– I Want it Now! Consumers seek instant gratification and frictionless experiences that mesh with their lifestyles, allowing them to dedicate more time to their professional or social lives.
– Loner Living. More people – especially older consumers - across the world break the stigma of living alone and embrace their independent lifestyles. “Intelligence is the common thread linking all trends in 2019. How we live is so centrally dependent on the choices available that the biggest issue is how se make sense of it all. Simplifying your options, having smooth purchasing experiences, being mindful and ultimately opting out altogether are all intrinsic,” comments Gina Westbrook, Director of Consumer Trends at Euromonitor International. A free copy of the full report is available here: Top 10 Global Consumer Trends 2019."

Organic and natural beauty trends for 2019,"Global demand for natural and organic cosmetics. Initially stemming from Europe and North America, demand for natural and organic cosmetics is becoming increasingly global. Asia’s share of the international natural cosmetics market is expected to continue to rise, as its consumers seek products without contentious synthetic chemicals. More natural and organic product launches are likely to be in the Asia-Pacific, as well as other regions. Multinationals launching natural & ethical lines. In the last twelve months, Unilever launched Love, Beauty & Planet, Henkel introduced Nature Box and N.A.E., and L’Oréal launched Seed Phytonutrients and La Provençale Bio. On the launch pad are P&G’s Pure by Gillette and Garnier’s new organic skin care line. More such product launches are likely as multinationals continue to chase the ‘ethical dollar’. Investments and acquisitions. Ecovia expects to see more investments and acquisitions involving natural and organic cosmetic firms in 2019. Some of the notable acquisitions in the last twelve months were Logocos Naturkosmetik by L’Oréal, The Organic Pharmacy by Istituto Ganassini, and Natural Products Group by Groupe Rocher. Reducing packaging impacts. Consumer concerns about plastic pollution in the oceans and landfill is making cosmetic and personal care companies address their packaging impacts. A growing number of companies are looking at sustainable materials and / or eco-design approach. Sustainable sourcing. Cosmetic and ingredient firms will continue to invest in sustainable sourcing of raw materials. More sustainability schemes are likely to be introduced for single ingredients, as well as general sourcing practices. Ethical labels. Ecovia also expects to see more ethical labels on cosmetic & personal care products in 2019. In the last few months, Herbal Essences got Environmental Working Group (EWG) Verification label and Natura Brasil products received Leaping Bunny certification. Other labels making headway include Vegan, Halal, Non-GMO, as well as COSMOS and Natrue (natural & organic labels). Clean beauty retailing. Credo Beauty has already made its mark in the US as a clean beauty retailer. More such retailers are likely to open their doors in North America and Europe. At the same time, more conventional beauty retailers are having ‘clean beauty’ sections. Sephora and Space NK are two such retailers devoting shelf-space to beauty products without contentious chemicals. Indie brands will continue to gain popularity; Douglas recently announced plans to expand its range of small niche brands in its European retail network. Growing power of millennials. The millennials are already some of the most avid buyers of natural & organic products; they will wield greater influence as their spending power continues to rise. As they buy more from online platforms, Amazon and other eretailers will gain market share for natural & ethical products. Ecovia Intelligence will cover such developments at the following events: – Sustainable Cosmetics Summit North America  (8-10 May, New York)
– Natural Cosmetics Masterclass: Future Directions  (22 May, Paris)"

Beauty trends: Skincare gets personal for 2019,"As we head into 2019, it is becoming increasingly clear that the world of skincare is about to get very personal indeed. New digital technologies and scientific advances mark the advent of a hyper-personalized era. This paradigm shift is transforming the industry and the way cosmetic products are designed: ingredients can be selected to fits to one’s specific skin type, to the local environment, the genetic heritage, or the needs or desires of each. Forget the one-size-fits-all approach to beauty: the products of the future are all about tweaking formulas to work for individual clients. Clinique is leading the way, following the launch of ‘Clinique iD’, a custom-blend hydrating system that allows shoppers to pick and choose from a range of moisturizing options tailored to their needs. The concept features three ‘Dramatically Different’ hydration bases that come in the form of a jelly, lotion and gel, into which users then insert one of five active cartridges that focus on the issue of pores, irritation, fatigue, uneven skin tone, and lines and wrinkles. The two ingredients are delivered together in a ratio of 90 percent base to 10 percent cartridge ingredient for a product that better suit each shopper in terms of texture and results. This month, Neutrogena made the headlines at the 2019 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) when it unveiled its ‘Neutrogena MaskiD’ concept; essentially an app that allows users to order fully customized 3D-printed face masks, by getting them to take a selfie and providing an accurate assessment of their skincare needs and facial measurements. The masks are divided into six different zones that can be imbued with five different ingredients, will be designed to fit each individual face. It isn’t just products that are getting smarter — beauty apps are now offering users tailored advice at the tap of a screen. Back in October Avon unveiled its ’Personalized Beauty App,’ which lets its six million representatives deliver a more bespoke level of service to clients by helping them perfectly match foundation shades to skin tones, while skincare heavyweight Olay recently unveiled a ‘Skin Advisor’ platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to offer users personal skincare consultations and advice. And while there are still hardly any smart mirrors in individual bathrooms, they should spread quickly in beauty and hair salons, in spas and in beauty retails. Indeed, the customization trend has also made its way into the beauty aisles: Perfect Corp, the developer behind YouCam, revealed plans for its ‘Beauty 3.0’ concept at CES 2019 this month, featuring AI and augmented reality (AR) solutions that aim to transform the in-store beauty shopping experience. Some of the concept’s features — which include an ‘AI Smart Shade Finder’ that gives users recommended foundation shades and an ‘AI Skin Diagnostic’ that tracks dermatological concerns over time — are set to be tested out in select Ulta Beauty retail stores over the course of this year. For its part, Japanese skincare brand SK-II has also been hard at work on a ‘Future X Smart Store’ that relies on ‘phygital’ retail experiences incorporating AI technologies to take shoppers on a digital in-store journey, offering individual facial analysis and product recommendation."
Beauty must-haves for the new year,"If customization is the secret garden of natural and niche brands, Clinique has just restored balance with a real innovation and new packaging for its iconic product DDML (Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion) accompanied with a digital app Clinical Reality: an individualized questionnaire to help women customize their beauty regime. This launch will be the biggest since Even Better in 2010. You choose a base - three choices are offered (Hydrating Jelly, Lotion, or Oil-control gel), that you combine with one of five colored cartridges of booster serum that treat five problems: irritation, large pores, skin irregularities, tired skin, and lines and wrinkles. You place the booster serum cartridge in the center of the vial.  The two formulas are distributed at the same time by a pump, which produces a blend of 90% base and 10% active ingredient. To respond to the expectations of generation Y, the Clinical Reality digital app will soon be launched. It consists of a questionnaire that will enable women to customize their beauty regime. Right now, Clinique’s beauty advisors are analyzing skin and ask dermatological questions about customers’ needs. By the end of 2019, other products will be added to the franchise. Clarins launches My Clarins, a new brand of ethical and healthy skin cares, for the great satisfaction of women ages 18 to 29, the target group for this new Eco/vegan-friendly line. Fruit and floral waters and plant extract with a host of benefits: this is the healthy cocktail offered by Clarins for its new beauty brand that it calls “the new generation of skincare”. With Made with Care, we’re taking another step towards Cosmetics 2.0. Created by Jean Michel Karam who made Ioma. M/C is a young, urban, fun brand that targets young women who want skincare but are also health conscious. This new line corrects certain skin problems and helps avoid the first signs of aging. A particular mention is attributed to its engagement in the fight against pollution and especially the dangers of high energy visible or blue light (H.E.V.), a main cause of aging. In 2017, we saw the retirement of our mothers’ night creams in favor of Sleeping Masks... and today they’re back! Remember, in 2013, Prescriptives launched a super product, Good in Bed Skin Restoring Night Moisturizer, an efficient night cream that was ideal for winter and lightly colored skin tone with a hint of self-tan. Today, Glamglow offers Good in Bed, a real night cream with passion fruit. Its formula is rich and generous. As soon as you open the jar, you are overwhelmed by the scent of passion fruit oil, which does not take away from the effectiveness of its AHA / BHA / PHA formula associated with hyaluronic acid."
10 key trends in natural and organic beauty,"Move from linear to circular design models A number of speakers called for a sea change in design thinking of cosmetic products. According to them, cosmetic and personal care products should be created so that packaging materials can be re-used or upcycled at the end of their lives. Eric Kawabata from TerraCycle said the issue is that most fast-moving consumer goods were designed for single-use, with packaging ending in landfill or incineration. His company aims to eliminate the idea of waste by collecting waste materials and using it to create new products. His organization has already partnered with cosmetic companies such as Garnier, Colgate-Palmolive, and P&G. Growing array of natural ingredients According to Alain Khaiat from Seers Consulting, a range of functional ingredients are now available for natural skin care products; they include humectants, rheology modifiers, emulsifiers, surfactants and emollients. However, according to Barbara Olioso of The Green Chemist Consultancy, the use of such natural ingredients brings formulation issues like stability and performance. Classification of natural and organic ingredients remains a thorny issue. Because of this, DSM has compared popular certification schemes and the ISO 16128 guidelines to come up with three simplified categories: certified organic, verified natural, and natural origin. Sustainable sourcing Greater questions are being asked about the origins, extraction and processing methods of cosmetic raw materials. There is already pressure for agricultural-based materials like palm oil to be sustainably sourced. Case studies were given on how improve the sustainability of supply chains: – Kurt L Nübling, CEO and Founder of PrimaveraLife, gave details of its ethical sourcing projects for organic essential oils.
– Temuulen Murun from Shiseido raised the issue about the mineral mica: 75% of global supply comes from north-east India where there are concerns about health risks and child labour. Although just 18% of mica goes to the cosmetics industry, about 20 companies have signed up to the Responsible Mica Initiative.  Traceability and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Matthias Lergenmüller from Merck showed how supply chains of cosmetic ingredients can be linked to the SDGs. According to Matthias, traceability can help companies minimise environmental, social and health risks in their supply chains. Plethora of ethical labels Sustainability schemes and ethical standards continue to gain popularity, with a growing number of products brandishing symbols and logos. Amarjit Sahota, Founder and President of Ecovia Intelligence, said the cosmetics industry is going the same way as the food industry where there are over 200 different ethical labelling schemes. As far as the Halal label is concerned, Fabrice Guillemard from DSM believes most prospects are in Asia, considering the region houses 1.5 billion Muslims. Indeed, three-quarters of Halal cosmetic launches last year were in the Asia-Pacific. Indonesia and India are adjudged to have most potential. Product innovations Steven Ko, Founder and President of the Taiwanese brand Hair O’ Right showed how the company is formulating products using food side stream ingredients, such as coffee husks and goji berry roots. Matthieu Erre gave insights into how Yves Rocher is integrating sustainability and innovation. The brand has introduced concentrated shower gels, concentrated shampoos, and eco-designed cosmetics. While, Slovenian company Hemptouch gave details on the therapeutic qualities of its cannabis-based skin care products. Resource efficiency to zero-waste Most personal care companies have put resource efficiency into their sustainability programmes. Some like P&G have gone further to set zero-waste targets. Jacques Euler, Sustainability Program Leader from the Beauty Manufacturing Division, says the company is set to reach its target of 100% zero manufacturing waste to landfill from its operations by 2020. Regulations and findings suitable waste partners were cited as major challenges for the company in meeting this target internationally. Tackling ocean plastic The issue of ocean plastic came up several times at the summits. Kenny Harmel, Co-Founder of Galileo Watermark, said his company was compelled to find a solution when it discovered that a third of all plastic packaging ended up in the ocean. Galileo Watermark was the first company to launch a cosmetic product with packaging made from reclaimed ocean plastic. Since the launch of its OCN Cosmetics in December 2017, several companies have started using ocean plastic; these include P&G (Head & Shoulders beach plastic bottle), REN Clean Skincare, and Henkel. Novel green materials Many innovative green ingredients for cosmetic and personal care products were presented at the summits. Clariant gave details of its Genadvance material for sustainable hair conditioning. Covestro introduced Baycusan, used as a sustainable polyurethane for personal care products. DuPont showed how its GENENCARE OSMS BA material is derived from side stream of sugar beet production. Roelmi HPC presented Celus-Bi as a sustainable alternative to polyethylene beads.  Plant cell technology Novel actives are being developed for cosmetic & personal care applications according to this new technology. Elodie Mauger from Mibelle Biochemistry thus showed how it has created MossCellTec from biotechnologically produced moss. According to Anna Holefors, Founder and CEO of In Vitro Plant-Tech, plant cell cultivation enables the production of tailor-made actives for the cosmetics industry. There are also sustainability benefits since the technology does not deplete the plant population.

Pink clay masks: the hottest skincare trend in 2019?,"Dior Beauty’s version of the pink clay mask doubles up as a cleanser; the mask goes on as clay and then turns into an impurity-removing foam upon contact with water. It is enriched with Jojoba extracts and aims to minimize the appearance of pores in just three minutes. Draw out impurities and exfoliate your complexion at the same time with Herbivore Botanicals’ pink clay mask, which contains French pink clay and organic rosehip powder to soften and soothe the skin. Sand & Sky’s ‘Australian Pink Clay’ mask claims to eliminate toxins at the same time as stimulating collagen, for a naturally glowing and healthy-looking complexion. What’s more; it comes with its own miniature brush for a mess-free application. Not only does Generation Clay’s ‘Urban Defence Mask’ claim to purify the complexion and reduce the appearance of pores; it also contains aloe vera to calm any redness, and kakadu plum to protect against free radicals. Milk Makeup’s brand new ‘Watermelon Brightening Face Mask’ comes in tube packaging, meaning it can be rolled onto the skin without making the mess often associated with traditional clay masks. The addition of watermelon fruit extract is designed to leave the skin feeling soft and hydrated."
The fashion brands that went big on beauty in 2018,"Spanish fashion stalwart Zara stepped into the beauty arena this month with the launch of a 20-piece lipstick collection in the UK. The series included 12 lipsticks and eight liquid lipsticks, with shades ranging from plums and pinks to deep reds and offering a velvety, matte finish.  New | Zara lipsticks. Discover our selection of debut products: 12 velvety, highly pigmented and very comfortable matte lipsticks; 8 unstoppable, one stroke application, full matte liquid lipsticks; a set of the selection of three ULTIMATTE lipstick shades and our very special limited edition lip kit from the behind the scenes at the AW’18 ZARA WOMAN shooting Une publication partagée par  ZARA Official (@zara) le 5 Déc. 2018 à 11 :31 PST British fashion chain Topshop brought back its ‘Topshop Beauty’ brand this fall, to the delight of fans. The new-and-improved line hit the shelves in November, offering eyeshadows, lip products, eyeliners, primers, blushes, bronzers, brushes and much more. Urban Outfitters made a play for the beauty market back in September, when it unveiled ’Ohii’, an in-house series spanning skincare, bodycare and colour cosmetics products. The Instagrammable line is packaged simply in minimalist white containers with dashes of baby blue, yellow and pink. Italian label GCDS (an acronym for ’God Can’t Destroy Streetwear’) made waves with a four-piece lipstick collection that came out in November. The four bullet lip products include two bold lipsticks in matte red and sparkling pink, a clear lip balm and a pH-reactive green colour that transforms into a natural cherry tone when applied complete the lineup.  HYPE LIP BALM, @POSTER.BOY by @CHRISTINEHAHN 2018 // transparent menthol treatment for deep hydration. #gcdsbeauty Une publication partagée par  GCDS (@gcdswear) le 3 Nov. 2018 à 9 :50 PDT US label Charlotte Russe made its move on the beauty sector back in April, with the launch of a 19-piece colour cosmetics line for eyes, lips and face. Colourful mascara, pastel nail polishes and sunset-hued palettes made this one thoroughly irresistible collection."
How inclusive foundation stole the show in 2018,"The movement was arguably kick-started by Rihanna, whose Fenty Beauty debut collection was lauded for its inclusive 40-shade foundation range upon its launch back in September 2017. It didn’t take long for other brands to sit up and take notice: in May 2018, Tarte Cosmetics announced that it was expanding its ’Amazonian Clay’ foundation range to include 40 different skin tone shades, up from 25, with 10 of the new shades falling into the ""tan to deep"" range. June saw the cult brand Too Faced unveil the results of its collaboration with blogger and influencer Jackie Aina in the form of an expansion of its ‘Born This Way’ foundation by 11 shades, bringing the total to 35, while Estée Lauder boosted its ’Double Wear’ foundation range from 42 to 56 different hues over the summer. There were also plenty of newcomers to the foundation sector that focused on diversity - Marc Jacobs Beauty launched its new ""Shameless Youthful-look 24-h Longwear Foundation"" in February with 29 different shades, with the brand proclaiming that the product ""never appears chalky on camera or ashy on any skin tone."" Natural beauty brand Lush Cosmetics tested out a foundation release in June, with a limited-edition 40-shade strong ’Slap Stick’ foundation collection, and NYX Cosmetics unveiled its 45-shade-strong ’Can’t Stop Won’t Stop’ line in August, featuring a precise decimal labelling system that allows shoppers to choose both the perfect shade and undertone for their complexions. Revlon, meanwhile, upped its beauty game with the launch of a new prestige makeup brand, ’Flesh,’ over the summer, offering 40 shades of foundation. So has the beauty industry resolved its diversity issues? Not quite, but this year has shown that brands are at least learning fast that, in this day and age, inclusivity sells. When Beautyblender made its first foray into the makeup industry in July with a 32-piece foundation line titled ’Bounce’, it was criticized for being too limited in terms of shade ranges. This month, the brand added a further eight shades to its repertoire. Here’s to a beautiful - and inclusive - 2019. "
’Sub-Zero Waste’ is 2019’s key beauty and personal care trend,"“If brands don’t change their approach now, they won’t exist in the future. Beauty and personal care businesses must switch to a whole new paradigm in terms of sustainability and zero waste. Some companies are already discussing totally circumventing packaging. This is not just a trend, it is a movement,” states Mintel in the introduction of its new report, Sub-Zero Waste’ 2019 Global Beauty and Personal Care Trend. According to the market intelligence agency: “Over the next five years, the focus on sustainability will reach new heights as environmentally conscious consumers look for ways to reduce waste in all aspects of their lives, including their beauty and personal care routines.” All around the world, consumers are already paying a lot more attention to their impact on the planet. For instance: – 44% of US natural/organic personal care consumers, who buy a mix of mainstream and natural/organic brands, say they live sustainably;
– 74% of beauty and personal care consumers in Spain are concerned that the ingredients used in natural products are not sustainable;
– 54% of Brazilians who are potential buyers of green/ethical products say they purchase sustainable/ environmentally friendly goods because they don’t like to waste. The zero waste philosophy is gaining momentum.  “Better informed consumers will no longer tolerate egregious waste like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a direct consequence of years of indiscriminate abuse of single-use plastics,” states Mintel. Brands that purposely create limited shelf life products or encourage overconsumption run the risk of consumer backlash. Consumers will demand that brands be more environmentally responsible and take accountability for their actions. In such a context, “focussing efforts on reducing packaging is not enough”. Consumers will expect more ambitious endeavours and ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking from manufacturers and brands at every stage of the beauty supply chain. “’Sub-Zero Waste’ is not just a trend; it’s a movement towards a ground-shaking new archetype for the beauty and personal care industry. Some companies are already discussing completely removing packaging from the equation. Whether reducing or eliminating waste altogether, if brands don’t change their approach now, they will become insignificant. Brands that place current profits ahead of making the necessary investment in zero waste and sustainability will not be around in the future,” says Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst, Mintel Beauty and Personal Care. Some indie brands have built their business practices around ethics and environmentally friendly products.  For instance, French colour cosmetics brand La Bouche Rouge Paris, features reusable / refillable luxury lipstick packaging made from leather.  But the brand wants to go further and is working to find a viable vegan plastic-free and luxurious alternative to leather to meet all its clients’ expectations. And several more established brands have already joined the movement.  For its debut foundation range, Lush Cosmetics has launched a 100% plastic-free product.  From L’Oréal, to Henkel and Unilever, multinationals are massively jumping on the natural cosmetics bandwagon, simultaneously paying increased attention to the impact of their packaging. In the meantime, suppliers are multiplying eco-friendly options, from recycled glass to post-consumer plastics, and accelerate their investments in ecofriendly processes and products.  To support the development of these alternatives, major beauty brands do not hesitate to invest in innovative start-ups. Last week, Finnish producer of wood-based resins Sulapac, announced that Chanel took stake in the company. “There’s no doubt that ‘Sub-Zero Waste’ will transform the beauty and personal care industry over the next five years and will evolve in ways even we can’t predict over the next decade,” concludes Mintel."
Russia: A fast-changing perfume market,"Specialized distributors still dominate the Russian perfume and cosmetics market (63.2% of sales). In 2018, the country counted 450 perfume, cosmetics, and drugstore chains, i.e. 16,000 points of sale [1]. The number of stores owned by the ten main players rose by about 20% over the past two years – a sign that the sector has recovered. New leader Magnit Cosmetics recorded the most spectacular growth, ahead of L’Etoile. Sales in physical stores have grown again, with a 16% increase, compared to 2014 [2].  As for online sales, they are booming, with a bigger average basket online than in physical stores. E-shops benefit from their ability to deliver products everywhere, across a territory characterized by its immensity and low density. Consumers also enjoy the wealth of information and tips available on the web. Still, the crisis that followed the fall of the rouble did change the game. Within a context of contraction of purchases, specialized chains strengthened their positions with large-scale promotional offers and loyalty programmes. Many of them banked on the development of their private labels to offer more affordable ranges, and opened their counters to local brands that managed to take advantage of this revived competitiveness after the rouble was devaluated. To maintain this sales level, major chains like L’Etoile, Rive Gauche, or Ile de Beauté, started to launch a series of promotional offers, in particular as part of their loyalty programmes, and asked their suppliers to make efforts. This trend significantly affected the premium segment, whose turnover stagnated in 2017. Several middle-range brands suffered a lot from these years of crisis: some of them disappeared from regional distribution channels, where European brands face the competition of Asia. By contrast, the luxury segment was relatively little affected by the crisis. Less present in points of sale owned by major chains, these products are usually distributed by department stores, like Tsum in Moscow, niche brands, or stores owned by the brands themselves. Perfumery remains a flagship category on the Russian market. The 2014 crisis was also overcome in this sector, but it did restructure the market. Today, Russian consumers prefer small sizes (30 ml and 50 ml), and the dividing line between men and women tends to become less marked, as women aspire to other olfactory worlds and are seduced by very trendy mixed perfumes – this trend mainly comes from niche brands. Layering is also on a roll. If consumers mostly shop in physical stores to be able to test products (64%), have an exchange (38%), or because they are used to it (24%), the Internet is attractive because it offers low prices (57%). [3] The public is better and better-informed and shows a real curiosity for the niche segment, a promise of exceptional products. If the niche perfume clientele is rather wealthy, this segment tends to open itself to middle class customers, who do not hesitate to save to be able to buy something qualitative. Consumers are very fond of rarity and novelty, but they mainly search for olfactory diversity. Beyond floral and fruity, and/or gourmand fragrances, very popular in Russia, customers have been opening to other olfactory territories. Fresh and Hesperidia notes remain timeless, but more heady perfumes, like Chypre, woody, and oriental scents have been more and more successful. The public is expecting a more complex perfume offering. To meet these demanding expectations, professionals are also getting more and more technical and rigorous. Again, local brands have managed to seize opportunities. Given the boom of niche stores, chains have been diversifying their offerings. They adapt by creating affordable, but qualitative perfumes, and they do not hesitate to collaborate with renowned perfumers, like Bertrand Duchaufour. Russian assessors, but also perfumers, more and more of whom have been launching their own independent brand, are ready to come study in France, at the GIP in Grasse, or for a two-day training in Paris, to improve and develop know-how.  “There is this will to offer the best quality possible from all perspectives. There is still freedom and curiosity in Russia,” explains Bertrand Duchaufour. As for niche brands, they had to create alliances to withstand big chain competition, as explains the Director of label SuperCosmetics, which distributes brands like État Libre d’Orange, Olfactive Studio, and Histoires de Parfum, in particular via the Cosmotheca store network. The La Niche project works in a similar way: every year, at the InterCHARM show, it gathers a selection of brands, like Miller Harris, Micaleff, Urban Scents, The Harmonist, Profumi Del Forte, Neemah, Comptoir Sud Pacifique, Mauboussin, and, starting from this year, small Russian perfume houses, to offer them better visibility among distributors. The crisis effects are gradually fading, losing ground to an enthusiastic market which tends to follow Europe in terms of tastes and practices, and where the niche segment has a bright future ahead."

An agreement was reached between BolognaFiere Cosmoprof, the organizer of the Cosmoprof events in the world, and Beauty Fair - Feira Internacional de Beleza Profissional, the organizer of the event in Sao Paulo, Brazil, dedicated to local cosmetic professionals and distributors. Beauty Fair is the reference event for the beauty sector not only for Brazil, but also for the entire South American continent. Founded in 2005, the event involves professionals and distributors in the South American markets. More than 500 companies are present, with more than 2,000 brands represented over an exhibition area of 80,000 sqm. In 2017, 165,000 visitors had made the trip to São Paulo to discover or get an update on the main local brands, and the latest trends. A rich programme of conferences, with over 100 scheduled seminars, allowed attendees to focus on the main issues concerning the South American market. The synergy between the two events will be an opportunity, at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2019, (scheduled from March 14), to open a pavilion dedicated to Brazil, thus facilitating the visibility of buyers, distributors and retailers from South America. At Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, selected key players from Brazil and neighbouring countries will be able to meet the main players in the global cosmetics industry, to evaluate the new products and services serving their local markets.

The new alliance will be aimed at developing the business of players in the central European cosmetic markets, thus increasing growth opportunities for more than 500,000 professional operators and 9,000 exhibitors participating in the events offered by the two platforms."
Multinationals jump on natural cosmetics bandwagon,"Clearly, the cosmetics and toiletries market is not meeting current consumer expectations regarding natural and organic products.  The gap does fully explain why sales remain flat but certainly significantly contribute to the trend. “Consumers are turning to natural and organic products as they wish to avoid contentious synthetic chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries. The primary motive is avoidance of parabens, SLS / SLES, and chemicals with associated health risks,” explains Ecovia Intelligence, a research and consulting company that focuses on the natural and sustainable product industries. As a consequence, giant cosmetics makers are trying to jump on the natural cosmetics bandwagon launching their own natural ranges. With Seed Phytonutrients, which launched in the United States on Earth Day in April 2018, L’Oréal aims to “plant the seeds of health, well-being, and sustainability for future generations” thanks to a harmonious balance between the environment, beauty, agriculture, and sustainable business. In Europe, the multinational has bought, in August 2018, Germany’s Logocos Naturkosmetik and has launched a new organic cosmetic brand dubbed La Provençale.  The group also announced that a new Garnier organic range would hit shelves in France and Western Europe as of early 2019. In a similar move to capitalize on consumer demand for ‘clean beauty’ products, Unilever has launched the Love, Beauty and Planet brand, while Henkel, known for brands like Schwarzkopf and Dial, is doubling down on vegan beauty with the launch of a new brand dubbed Nature Box. Even more launches of natural products are expected from multinationals, however all may not be successful. “Prior to the natural product launches route, the favoured mode of entry of multinationals was acquisitions. Yet, not all have provided dividends. In 2007, L’Oreal purchased The Body Shop and the organic cosmetics brand Sanoflore. The former brand was sold off to Natura Brasil last year, whilst Sanoflore remains a ‘marginalised’ brand. Critics argue that L’Oreal’s recent purchase of the Logona and Sante brands will suffer the same fate. Since purchasing the Logocos business in August, some organic food retailers in Germany are considering delisting,” highlights Ecovia Intelligence. The market research firm sees consumer acceptance as a major challenge for multinationals. According to a recent research consumers identify small / indie brands with green values. “The same consumers will shun green products of large corporations,” forecasts Ecovia. The way forward maybe integration whilst differentiation: acquire natural or organic brands yet maintain their independence and core values. Nevertheless, as ethical consumerism becomes mainstream and natural and organic products continue to make inroads in conventional channels, the multinationals cannot ignore this important trend. According to Ecovia Intelligence, global retail sales of natural and organic cosmetics have grown from almost nothing to USD 10.2 billion between 2002 and 2017. “Large companies like L’Oréal and Unilever will continue to hedge their bets between developing green products and outright acquisitions. Market winners will be those who can successfully align brand values to consumer expectations. Others are likely to underperform as they find the green road is littered with obstacles,” concludes the market research firm."
"UK shaving and hair removal market lacks innovation, says Mintel","Over the last two years, the popularity of body hair removal has shot up among the British men; in 2018, as many as 46% of all men removed hair from their bodies, up from just over a third (36%) in 2016. Actually, Mintel research reveals that young men aged 16-24 are removing body hair almost as much as young women of the same age, with similar proportions of both (29% of men versus 34% of women) removing hair more frequently in the last 12 months [1]. Young men shave, wax and laser almost all of their body. According to Mintel, a plucky 57% of young males aged 16-24 say they have removed hair from their pubic region, compared to 40% in 2016. Meanwhile, 42% of males aged 16-24 remove hair from their underarms, up from 16% in 2016. Hair removal from the chest has risen from 15% in 2016, doubling to 30% in 2018; while hair removal from the back has increased from 10% in 2016 to 12% in 2018. In comparison, the top three hair removal areas for women aged 16-24 are underarms (90%), legs (90%) and the pubic region (75%). “Consumers today are feeling the pressure to be hair-free. However, whilst the pressure on women remains higher, we’re seeing more and more young men in particular feeling the need to be hair-free too. This year has also seen new product development in the male body hair removal category, notably Nivea’s Men’s Body Hair Removal range, as well as launches from Veet and Nad’s targeting men,” said Roshida Khanom, Associate Director, Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. It’s not just the body that is receiving the hair-free treatment, as facial hair removal among Brits has risen from 73% in 2016 to 80% in 2018. According to Mintel, the number of Brits removing hair from their eyebrows has risen from 33% in 2016 to over four in ten (42%) in 2018. Meanwhile, the number of Brits removing hair from their nose has risen from 11% in 2016 to 20% in 2018. “While older men have traditionally been less concerned with hair removal (just 12% of men aged over 65 removed hair from their nose in 2016), modern times have seen a shift,” said the market research firm. In 2018, 31% of men aged over 65 removed hair from their nose, with 32% removing hair from their eyebrows and 34% removing hair from their ears. “Whilst young men are leading the trend of body hair removal, older men are driving facial hair removal, highlighting that older men are also feeling the pressure to keep up with appearances,” adds Roshida. However, despite increased grooming around the face, the beard trend shows no evidence of waning. According to Mintel, 44% of men have some stubble, 20% a closely trimmed beard and 7% a thick/full beard. The majority (76%) of adults agree that beards should be well groomed. Finally, while Brits are reaching for their blades, Mintel research reveals a decline in the value of the shaving and hair removal products sector. Sales of shaving and hair removal products declined 4% in 2018 to reach £558 million, from £579 million in 2017. “As both genders feel the pressure to be hair-free, facial and body hair removal rates have seen a rise; however, the category continues to show a decline in value, with little activity in product innovation encouraging consumers to trade up. The beard trend shows no evidence of waning in 2018, with the razors and blades segment reflecting the impact; whilst savvy shopping behaviours, discounting and the rise in low-cost subscription services have resulted in a more scrupulous shopper,” concludes Roshida."
Cosmoprof Asia: A first successful try for the new duo Informa / Bologna Fiere,"Premium Beauty News: When the number 3 on the list of global organizers of trade shows buys the number 2, the information does not go unnoticed! David Bondi - It could go unnoticed, because it won’t change anything to the future of the different events organized by Informa and Bologna Fiere in Asia, as each of them have their autonomy and life of their own. Of course, exhibitors and visitors will both benefit from certain geographical synergies existing within the portfolio. Because this deal clearly reinforces our mutual presence in Asia. Don’t forget that Informa now weighs around GBP 1.4 billion in exhibitions only and that its net margin exceeds 30%. This group is mainly specialized in the production of academic publications, business intelligence, knowledge& networks and exhibitions with 500 b to b events taking place in the world. Our JV with our Italian partner, Bologna Fiere, allows us to expand our influence all over Asia with specialized trade shows dedicated to the Beauty sector in China, Thailand, Japan, India with the launch this year of Cosmoprof India, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, etc. Premium Beauty News - Informa is the owner of the huge China Beauty Expo trade show. Will this new partnership have an impact on Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong? David Bondi - In fact, these two events have little in common except of course of focusing on the beauty sector. Because the first one, China Beauty Expo, is very national-focused, on the world’s fastest growing beauty market, while Cosmoprof Asia is very international. We welcome 5% of foreign visitors in Shanghai, while they account for 72 % in Hong Kong. China Beauty Expo is a super-platform to conquer the domestic Chinese market, Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong is the place where brands and suppliers have the opportunity to approach and concentrate on the entire Asian distribution and beyond. Both events are also very strong in the supply chain with Cosmetech in Shanghai and Cosmopack Asia in Hong Kong. In terms of floor space, differences are significant since Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong totals 113,000 m2 and China Beauty Expo in Shanghai 240,000 m2! Yet there is a common point to both events, the growth of the number of exhibitors, between 8% and 10% each year. Premium Beauty News - Your partnership with Bologna Fiere also includes India, where a Cosmoprof event was held for the first time in Mumbai. What was the outcome? David Bondi - And this first edition of Cosmoprof India was a real success, with all the credit going to the teams of Bologna Fiere and to the former UBM Group. Designed as a preview of a larger-scale launch next year, this two-day event hosted 107 exhibiting companies - Indian and international - from 15 countries and was visited by 3,898 professionals from the beauty sector, including importers, exporters, distributors and owners of beauty salons and spas, retailers, manufacturers of packaging and finished products, contract manufacturers and equipment manufacturers. Premium Beauty News - What are your other projects for the future? David Bondi - Of course, we have other projects in the pipeline! And not just in Asia."
Trend: Makeup takes hold of the notion of freedom,"Premium Beauty News - What does the American market tell about this tendency to express our desire for freedom with makeup? Leïla Rochet - This market evolves very fast, driven by the emergence of microniches and indie brands that change the game rules. In the currently pretty tense American society, makeup has never been such a significant source of self-expression, enhanced self-confidence, and empowerment. But it is also a source of asserted freedom through social media, brand positioning, and the product types created. Premium Beauty News - What best illustrates this movement? Leïla Rochet - In our Freedom Beauty report [1], we closely examine six trends related to colours or emotions, for example. One of them, in particular, entitled World’s Changers, evokes the brands that really take a stand for or against a change, in tune with consumer involvement. Today, there is an air of freedom on social media, and a few brands have been positioning themselves as real spokespersons for a societal or political choice. We can mention lipsticks, like F*ck Donald Trump, by Lipslut: 50% of its profits are donated to organizations that fight against the current politics. The Lipstick Lobby brand is another example: when they launched their new Fire shade, they staged school shooting survivors in their communications to join the gun control movement. There is a movement that aims to reclaim the African-American culture, with the rise of black empowerment and brands praising a more inclusive representation of femininity. Premium Beauty News - What is the most striking observation you have made? Leïla Rochet - The “Small is the New Big” notion, which is visible on different levels. In terms of retail, online sales are still behind sales in physical stores in market share, yet they do drive the market’s growth. As for brands, indie (niche) brands are those that best stimulate the market. The same goes for small segments, like primers, glosses, or applicators, which used to be considered secondary and are now key players in this growth. Lastly, the American market is driven by the need to go for diversity, even inclusiveness, as can be seen with the multiplication of shades reflecting the existing diversity. Some brands now offer 50 shades, or even 60, like MAC Cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - How does makeup grow in the US? Leïla Rochet - During the second quarter 2018, the prestige beauty growth rate reached more than 6%, according to NPD, boosted by the +12% growth, while makeup remained stable. This growth reversal shows the market is turning towards more naturalness, and that grooming follows the notion of “skin deep” rather than “skin surface”. The Instagrammer phenomenon in makeup is now reproducing in skincare. It is driven by the wellness movement, which is particularly strong in the US and involves a holistic, rather than superficial vision of beauty. Premium Beauty News - What would be your conclusion for brands? Leïla Rochet - This study shows that consumers try to express a certain freedom through makeup, whether it be related to naturalness, self-expression, or societal choices. It is now important for brands to become partners of this new momentum, by offering products in tune with the search for freedom of expression."
Asia Pacific leads the way in relaxation-focused beauty products,"Beauty buffs in the Asia Pacific region are countering their fast-paced lives with personal care products aimed at reducing stress. According to new research from market intelligence agency Mintel, Asia Pacific accounted for a third (33%) of global beauty and personal care products, launched between January-September 2018, that claim to aid with de-stressing and relaxation [1]. The figure is a significant increase from 2015, when the region was responsible for 26 percent of new global launches. [2] ""The rapid urbanisation and increased speed of life in Asia have left consumers feeling tired and emotionally drained,"" said Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel, speaking at the recent in-cosmetics Asia event, which was held on October 30-31 and November 01, 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand. ""For Asian female consumers, in particular, it is becoming common knowledge that daily lifestyle habits can have an impact on skin. Increasingly, beauty brands and companies are taking notice and are introducing beauty and personal care products that aid in emotional wellbeing. In the years ahead, beauty brands and companies in the region will stand to benefit from launching innovative products that address consumers’ mental wellness."" The research found that 30 percent of urban Chinese consumers aged 20-49 are concerned about stress at work in 2018 — up from 25 percent in 2013. Additionally, some 60 percent of urban Indonesians and 5 percent of urban Thais plan to reduce their stress levels for personal health and wellness reasons. A huge 87 percent of urban Chinese females aged 20-49 said that using beauty services was a way of relaxing — paving the way for a booming wellness industry."
Cosmoprof Asia is set to mark new record numbers in Hong Kong,"With around 3,000 exhibitors covering a total exhibition area of up to 113,800 sqm and more than 83,700 expected visitors, the 2018 edition of the show is set to mark new record numbers. This year again, the show will be held on two venues, with a one-day lag in the opening of the two sessions. From 13 to 15 November, Cosmopack Asia at the AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE) will host exhibitors from the supply chain: raw materials and ingredients, machinery and automation, primary and secondary packaging, contract manufacturing and private labels. From 14 to 16 November, Cosmoprof Asia will put the spotlight on finished goods at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) showcasing products across all main cosmetic sectors: perfumery and cosmetics, beauty salon and spa, hair, nail and accessories. New this year, Cosmoprof Asia 2018 will dedicate an entire hall to natural and organic beauty products. Green and eco-friendly companies creating sustainable businesses around natural and organic skincare, cosmetics, beauty products and supplements, will be at the centre of attention in the Natural & Organic zone (Hall 3G, HKCEC). The selection includes brands such as Lovekins, Éminence Organic Skin Care, Pestle & Mortar, Essentiq, Alkemie, Snow White, EPS White PA, Real Saboaria. Created in partnership with international trend agency Beautystreams, the Cosmoprof Asia And Cosmopack Asia Awards will recognise the most outstanding beauty products in each exhibition venue. This year, 529 submissions from 274 companies were received, marking a record-breaking edition: – The Cosmopack Asia Awards celebrates innovation, creativity and design for the supply chain according to 5 categories: Make-Up Formula, Make-Up Packaging Technology and Design, Skincare Formula, Skincare Packaging Technology and Design, Green Packaging and Formula. Winners will be selected by a jury consisting of international experts and key players in the cosmetic industry [1]. – The Cosmoprof Asia Awards recognises the best strategies to build brand awareness and marketability according to 5 categories: Make-up Product, Skincare Product, Nail Product, Hair Product, Natural & Organic. [2]"
Genderless trend clashes with Brazilian preference for men’s fragrances,"Born out of cultural changes, genderless products targeting both male and female customers are a hot trend in the cosmetics industry. However, unisex products still do not meet the expectations of Brazilian consumers when it comes to fragrances. A recent survey conducted by Mintel revealed three out of four (76%) Brazilian men say they wear gender-specific fragrances. Similarly, 71% of men say they wear gender-specific deodorant, while 31% buy unisex deodorant. Yet the landscape is demonstrably different in personal care categories, including shampoo and conditioner. Mintel’s survey reveals that 58% of men use gender-neutral shampoo and conditioner, while 56% buy unisex soap or body wash. A possible explanation for such disparate consumer buying behavior is that the scents used in shampoos and conditioners are less assertive than those used in fragrances, says Juliana Martins, senior Beauty and Personal Care analyst at Mintel. Additionally, men are generally more likely to use gender-specific products. “Several different surveys show that men are more likely to use gender-specific products than women. Men’s fragrances may appeal to some women, but women’s fragrances do not appeal to most men,” she says. A 2017 Mintel study revealed that 52% of men prefer fragrances with woody notes. Fragrances with fresh notes placed second, with 37%. Renata Abelin, marketing director at Drom Fragrances, says consumers are directed towards gender-specific fragrances at the point of sale. “They find products in a labeled, predetermined universe. Brazilian men still subscribe to the notion that fougère and/or woody notes are masculine, whereas floral and gourmand tones are seen as feminine,” she says. Gender categorization is likewise observed in the market for personal care products. However, the difference here is that they are usually purchased with the whole family in mind. “That is why their notes and scents usually highlight the products’ ingredients and benefits,” says Abelin. Nevertheless, the Brazilian market still has plenty of untapped potential. Martins says one way companies could explore this potential is by creating deodorants that target men and women alike, thus adding value to their brands and winning over consumers who already see them as unisex products. In this case, it would be useful to highlight the use of gender-neutral ingredients, such as charcoal, when marketing these products. On the other hand, companies that wish to continue to produce deodorants that target men could boost their portfolio by adding on to their current product lines. Martins provides the example of a line of shampoo and soap for men that can also add a deodorant, all with the same scent. To get men interested in genderless fragrances, she says companies should develop products with “masculine” notes and create marketing campaigns that highlight this feature, since it seems to be extremely important to men. “Companies could try different angles, such as fragrances that can be shared with one’s partner (regardless of their gender), or even fragrances with more neutral tones,” she says. Martins believes that, in the short term, genderless fragrances will continue to be a niche market in Brazil, appealing only to a small number of individuals. This is the case with the fine fragrances category, says Abelin, where there is still a clear distinction between “feminine” and “masculine” notes. However, she also stresses that genderless fragrances are poised to receive a boost from two fronts: generation Z individuals, who tend to reject labels of any kind, and niche fragrances, which explore olfactory creations per se. A transition to a predominantly genderless fragrance market is likely to happen only in the long term, if at all. “In Brazil, where over 90% of fragrances are sold in the mass market, behavioral changes take a long time,” concludes Abelin."
"USA: For their hair, Black women embrace the natural beauty trend","Black women in the U.S. are increasingly opting for chemical-free with no-heat hair styling (40%) and for natural (no chemicals) with heat styling (33%).  With the majority (87%) of Black women agreeing that health is the ultimate beauty accessory, more and more consumers today are just as concerned with what’s not in their beauty and personal care products as what is included. In fact, 70% of Black women say they prefer to read ingredient labels in haircare products so they can avoid certain chemicals. Increased consumer interest in avoiding damage to their hair has resulted in damaging effects to the category. In fact, total haircare expenditure among Black consumers overall is estimated to reach $2.51 billion in 2018 in the U.S., a -2.3% decrease since 2016, as a result of at-home relaxer sales declining 22.7% over the same period. However, shampoo and conditioner are soaking up sales as Black women prefer caring for and styling their natural hair on their own. As such, spending on shampoo has grown 12.2% in the last two years, while conditioner has grown 7.3%. Actually, the penetration rate of hair care products is much higher among Black women than among any other demographic in the U.S. With regimens and maintenance systems for nearly every hair type and concern, Black women are most likely to say they use five or more haircare products at home (43%). Today, a wide collection of haircare products with specific benefits is commonplace, especially among younger Black women, as those aged 18-34 are the most likely to say they use haircare products such as deep conditioning treatments (59% of 18-24-year-old Black women vs 37% of Black women overall) and edge control (58% vs 26% overall). However, Mintel research indicates women are eager to streamline and personalize their routines with multifunctional options. Looking ahead, the option Black women are most interested in is haircare products for multiple uses (57%). “Black consumers are more interested in product innovation that addresses their concerns rather than new haircare methods,” said Toya Mitchell, Multicultural Analyst at Mintel. When it comes to purchasing new products, online shopping is on the rise. Beyond learning about styles, it seems social media is where Black consumers are doing their shopping as well. One third (32%) of Black consumers purchase haircare products online, including one quarter (24%) who shop for haircare products via online-only retailers - a nine percentage point increase over those who did so in 2016. Black consumers are looking for products formulated specifically for their needs and they are more likely to find them online. While mainstream retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Target have expanded their product selection, smaller brands are often offered as online-only exclusives."
Asia and younger generations drive travel retail trends,"Global duty-free and travel retail sales will reach USD 120 billion in 2025, according to a report conducted by research group Generation Research and the European Travel Retail Confederation (ETRC), the industry association for the duty-free and travel retail industry. Perfume and cosmetics is scoring more and more space in airports worldwide, and continues to be an important category in terms of both growth and profit contribution, notes René Weber, Managing Director and Analyst Luxury Goods / Food & Beverage at Zurich-headquartered investment bank Vontobel. For Dufry, for example, the world’s leading travel retail company (with 13% market share in the overall market and 20% in airport travel retail), perfume and cosmetics currently represents the highest market share, and has risen from 27.1% in 2012, to 30.7% in 2017. This growth is set to continue, says Weber. According to the ACI World Airport Traffic Forecast for the 2017 – 2024 period, Asia Pacific will continue to host the lion’s share of global growth with 52%, ahead of Europe (16 %), North America (11%), the Middle East (11%), Latin American Caribbean (10%) and Africa (2%). “The Asian market will continue to outperform other markets, and increase its number of passengers for the coming years,” agrees Vontobel’s Weber, adding that the region has experienced double-digit or high single-digit growth every year for the last few years. This could lead to more consolidation in Asia in the near future, predicts the analyst. Along with France and the U.S., China will be one of the main beneficiaries of international arrivals, according to the Euromonitor data. We will also start to see retailers move away from Western European brands, toward Korean brands, in a bid to woo Chinese travellers, Notes Vontobel’s Weber. “Young and urban consumers are seeking out new travel experiences, driving travel and tourism trends along with more targeted services and products than ever,” notes Nadejda Popova travel industry manager at Euromonitor International. Retailers are also striving to become “more consumer-oriented,” observes Weber. “They will try to understand what kind of consumers are coming in... and when a plane for China is landing, they will try to do all of the advertisements in Chinese.” This move toward a more personalized travel retail experience is pushing retailers in this area to invest in digital marketing strategies in order to connect with their target consumer groups. By 2023, travel intermediaries are forecast to exceed USD2 trillion stimulated by digital advances and the shift to mobile sales representing 70% of travel agents’ sales in 2017, according to the Euromonitor data. More and more travellers are doing the whole journey digitally, from researching the trip and checking, browsing and, ultimately, purchasing products, says the group. Unsurprisingly, for these ultra-connected consumers, the airport traditional billboards are no longer cutting it, explains Vontobel’s Weber. “Retailers will need screens which can change every five or ten minutes, in order to attract consumers coming in, and bringing them to the right spots.” “The sharing economy and digitalization are bringing new business models with consumers becoming more sophisticated and demanding,” adds Euromonitor’s Popova. “Providing a seamless travel experience is critical for competitive advantage, from the inspiration stage, through search and booking to in-destination services. Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data and cloud computing all help power the drive for personalized and frictionless travel experiences,” she concludes."
Show review: Pitti Fragranze unveils trends in contemporary fragrance,"La Città delle Fragranze (The City of Fragrances), a calendar of exhibitor-organized events, was new for this edition, and saw the city’s museums, gardens, concept stores and boutiques open their doors to fragrance enthusiasts from all over the world, with the goal of increasing awareness of olfactory culture. “The calendar of events related to olfactory culture, which is increasingly rich and multi-faceted, turns Pitti Fragranze into an observatory on the most topical trends in the world of essences,” commented Agostino Poletto, General Manager of Pitti Immagine. One such event was the talk, “Olfactory Culture: A Contemporary Overlook through Insiders’ Eyes”. Chaired by Premium Beauty News, the talk welcomed speakers Saskia Wilson-Brown (The Institute for Art and Olfaction), Roberto Drago (PerFumum) and Dominique Brunel (Nez - the Olfactory Magazine). Another highlight was an economic study analysing the market in Italy and Europe. A new initiative, this study was conducted by consulting and economic analysis firm HermesLab, in collaboration with the Centro ModaCult of the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Milano. The first results show that in a context of rapid growth, independent fragrance businesses are called upon to face the difficult challenge of exceeding the boundaries of a niche market. The exhibiting brands on show seemed to share a common desire to explore the relationship between contemporary fragrance, art, music and fashion. In the Spring space (an area dedicated to newcomers), Polish brand Bohoboco Perfume exhibited at the Pitti Fragranze for the first time.  Founded in 2016, Bohoboco Perfume is the fragrance arm of its namesake fashion brand, and both are created by designers and Michael Gilbert Lach and Kamil Owczarek. Bohoboco Perfume currently has eight scents, which are all said to be inspired by culinary art and emotions. The composition process plays with contrasts, purposefully using opposing notes such as sea salt and caramel. Italian independent brand Meo Fusciuni aims to create fragrances based on memories. The brand’s latest scent, Little Song, blends notes of coffee, Turkish rose and tobacco and is designed to evoke a man’s solitude. According to the brand, fragrances must be “a means to identify an artistic expression.” Pitti Fragranze also showcases some indie brands from the skincare sector. Flying the flag for men’s skin care was the Rotterdam-based brand The Grey Men’s Skincare. Its founder, professional menswear and lifestyle buyer Gregor Jaspers, created the brand having spotted a gap in the market for a compact men’s skincare range with a clean and contemporary aesthetic. It currently has six products which use trendy ingredients such as caffeine and charcoal powder. Day, night and eye care products are combined into one, targeting those who like to travel light."
"“Demand surges for natural cosmetics and for those that are made in Australia”, Cory Watson, Beauty Expo Australia","Premium Beauty News - What are the main features of the Australian beauty market? Cory Watson - Industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized 0.8% over the five years through 2018-19, to $6.5 billion. This includes an expected revenue growth of 0.2% in the current year.  The growth is expected to accelerate over the next years and industry revenue is forecast to grow at an annualized 2.6% over the five years through 2023-24, to $7.4 billion. We get about 7,000 beauty industry professionals visiting Beauty Expo Australia each year (over two days). It’s a trade-only event, which is important so that our visitors and exhibitors have an environment that’s conducive to business. Premium Beauty News - What about Beauty Expo Australia? Cory Watson - The show has grown exponentially! We’ve experienced a 45 per cent increase in the number of exhibitors at Beauty Expo Australia to reach 260 exhibitors this year, which is exciting. We had a strong year in 2017 too, with a 37 per cent increase in exhibitors from 2016, which suggests our industry continues to thrive. Premium Beauty News - What are the brands that you see emerging and booming? Cory Watson -  We have seen a real upturn in the skincare and anti-ageing sectors in recent years. For instance, at Beauty Expo Australia 2017, we had a huge 60 per cent increase in skincare exhibitors from the previous year, which I think is illustrative of how big that area of the beauty industry is growing year-on-year. In terms of brands, we’re very excited to have MAC Cosmetics on board for the first time at Beauty Expo Australia this year. Australia skincare brand Ultraceuticals, and technology distributors France Medical and The Global Beauty Group continue to take larger stands at Beauty Expo each year. There’s also Lük Beautifood, which is a natural lipstick company founded by food scientist Cindy Lüken, who is joining us at Beauty Expo Australia after exhibiting at Beauty Expo Melbourne 2018 and also the recent Indie Beauty Expo (IBE) in New York. Premium Beauty News - Do you plan to expand to other shows? Cory Watson - We run four events within the Hair & Beauty portfolio at Reed Exhibitions Australia, including Beauty Melbourne, a boutique annual event for the local professional industry that takes place in March; Hair Expo Australia, our three-day event for the hairdressing industry which takes place each June; the Hair Expo Awards, which has been running for over 30 years; and Beauty Expo Australia, which is our national beauty event that takes place annually in Sydney. We get a fair number of visitors travelling interstate, particularly for Hair Expo and Beauty Expo Australia so at this stage there are no plans to expand - but never say never! Premium Beauty News - What are the trends that you have seen growing? Cory Watson - We’ve seen a shift toward embracing natural and organic products, as well as those that are Australian-made or produced by home-grown companies. This seems to be reflective of a growing consumer preference for products containing natural ingredients, as well as those that are made here in Australia. To address this, we introduced a new initiative at Beauty Expo Australia to offer relevant exhibitors the opportunity to highlight that their products or brands were either “Proudly Natural” or “Proudly Australian” on their stands. Our exhibitors loved that there was a visual signifier of their alignment with these values, and it made seeking out natural and locally-made products a really gratifying experience for our visitors at the event. We’ve now implemented this initiative at all our hair and beauty industry events. Premium Beauty News - Could you tell us about the evolution of the different categories in Australia? Cory Watson - Sun care is very important to the Australian market given the strength of the sun here and the associated risk of skin damage. The overall tanning services market has declined, in part due to regulatory changes banning the commercial use of solarium tanning beds. However, the spray tanning services sector has increased in demand over the past five years as consumers seek alternatives for their tanning needs. We are seeing an increase in both makeup and skincare companies that are emphasising natural and/or organic ingredients in their products, as the clean beauty movement continues to gain traction. In saying that, there’s also a lot of growth in the anti-ageing sector, as more consumers seek products and technologies that promise a more youthful appearance (which is also mirrored in the proliferation of injectables and other cosmeceuticals). Premium Beauty News - And what are the most successful distribution circuits in Australia for beauty in general? Cory Watson - As we focus on professional distributors, I wouldn’t be able to confidently assess the success of distribution circuits for beauty and cosmetics generally. From what I’ve noticed personally, I would say that the prominence of premium beauty retailers like Mecca and Sephora is growing as more stores open across Australia. Pharmacy chains like Priceline and Chemist Warehouse also provide a vast range of cosmetics for consumers in Australia. And other outlets like Lush, The Body Shop and L’Occitane are also key players in the market. In the professional sphere, some of our exhibitors have marked themselves as very successful distributors for the beauty industry. Professional Beauty Solutions (PBS), for instance, has a portfolio of 12 brands covering everything from LED masks to beauty supplements, to premium skincare products and makeup. MakeupNet is another successful wholesale distributor in Australia selling some of the popular indie makeup brands like Lime Crime and Gerard Cosmetics. Beauty Expo Australia will return in 2019 for another weekend dedicated to everything beauty from 24-25 August at the ICC Sydney. Victorian beauty professionals can look forward to the next state’s dedicated boutique event, Beauty Melbourne, which will take place at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC) from 23-24 March 2019. www.beautyexpoaustralia.com.au"
Bold and glowing filtered looks top makeup trends in the US,"While the natural look is a go-to for the majority of women across the US, as current social media trends are influencing women to try their hand at bold makeup looks.  According to Mintel, a strong percentage of women who use color cosmetics have tried or are interested in trying more adventurous makeup looks, including a smokey eye (69%), bold lip (55%), winged eyeliner (48%) and strobing (45%). With more than two in five (44%) US women aged 18-34 visiting four or more social media sites every day, the way consumers learn about and master new makeup trends has changed. “In fact, a trendy one in five (22%) female color cosmetics users agree that social media helps them learn about beauty trends, increasing to nearly half (47%) of those aged 18-24,” said Mintel. What’s more, nearly one quarter (24%) of female color cosmetics users say they watch online video tutorials on YouTube to learn about makeup looks, including the majority (53%) of women aged 18-24. “Social media influencers and video tutorials are inspiring American women to go for two contradictory makeup looks. While the natural look continues to reign supreme, many women are interested in trying out bold and adventurous makeup looks, such as winged eyeliner and strobing, as a result of what they’re seeing online,” said Alison Gaither, Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. In this context, brands that will develop accessory tools to simplify makeup application will help women to achieve the coveted looks. “For example, recent eyeliner launches have included tools that claim to make eyeliner application faster and less intimidating and we predict that going forward, other color cosmetics segments will follow suit,” added Gaither. With HD cameras showing every possible flaw, the obsession with poreless, lineless, glowing skin is leading some consumers to seek out products that imitate the filters they see and use on social media. Young women in particular are driving usage of products that are essential to the ‘flawless face’ makeup look, including highlighter / illuminator (51% women aged 18-24 vs 23% women overall), which adds a healthy glow to skin, and primer (49% vs 25% overall), which creates a smooth surface for makeup. According to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD), new launches of face makeup in the US with the word ‘glow’ in the product name grew 115% from 2013-17. “We predict that highlighters, illuminators and any product that promotes radiance will continue to grow in popularity. There are opportunities to develop color cosmetics products that incorporate skincare ingredients into formulations to give the wearer a long-lasting, glowing complexion and mimic the desired effects of glowing, poreless filters beloved by consumers,” continued Gaither. While brands are making a conscious effort to introduce more inclusive products, many women of color are still struggling to find their shade. In fact, although 79% of Black women who use facial makeup say that finding a face makeup product that matches their skin tone is an important purchase influencer, nearly three in 10 (29%) struggle to find a shade that matches their skin tone. “As consumers continue to demand products that promote inclusivity, brands that offer expanded shade ranges and colors are finding more success among women of color. This has ultimately helped brands see their efforts equate to sales success as they encourage product trial among consumers who are typically less likely to use face makeup products due to a lack of inclusivity. Brands that promote a message of inclusivity illustrate how the industry is beginning to recognize and develop new products and shades specifically formulated for multicultural consumers,” concluded Gaither."
"“Online or offline, every channel has its own place”, William Koeberlé, President of FFPS","For 92% of the people surveyed, stores remain their favourite shopping place for makeup, perfume, body and skincare alike. Among them, 43% of respondents praise the advice, services, and animations they are offered at points of sale, compared to 34% in 2016, when the previous study was conducted. In the same proportions, 44% enjoy the sensorial experience provided: you can see, smell, touch, and test products. “Compared to the 2016 study, this need to see the products is increasing. It was pointed out by 62% of customers two years ago, compared to 71% today. That is almost 10 points more,” comments William Koeberlé, President of FFPS. “Interestingly, it is for the people under 35 that the figure rises the most. They clearly express a renewal of this need,” he adds. This growing appetite for contact and non-virtual interactions is actually shared by all generations - even the most connected. Thus, 68% of the under 35 say they prefer to visit stores to see the products and actually make a purchase, compared to 61% for the people over 35. Besides, 49% of them appreciate the fact that they can test products and get some tips. At the same time, the practical advantages of online shopping make it competitive. “Sales are gradually rising online. They represent 8% of total sales, compared to 6% two years ago,” highlights William Koeberlé. Among web enthusiasts, 47% of the people surveyed, i.e. 8% more than in 2016, praise the convenience of this medium, which makes it possible to do your shopping anytime. In addition, 60% of respondents use the Internet channel for the interesting prices it offers. For 49% of them, it also helps compare prices, in particular when they need to buy products they already have. “People get informed about prices on the web. So, if a network has no website, they will not be able to make customers come visit their stores,” analyzes William Koeberlé. Lastly, the Click & Collect system, which combines online shopping and in-store collection, seduces 31% of the people surveyed. “It is an important point that is clearly related to the boom of mobile phones,” explains the President of the Federation. “In 2016, we could have thought these channels competed against each other. Today, this study shows that every channel has its own place, and, more importantly, that they complete each other. Customers search for information online, but they favour the store experience, because they think their needs will be better understood at points of sale,” he concludes."
Italy: A vigorous cosmetics industry,"While the Italian cosmetics market ranks fourth in Europe after Germany, France and the United Kingdom, the country is the third European exporter (after France and Germany). Make-up is undoubtedly the main asset of the Italian cosmetics industry.  “About 60% of the make-up distributed throughout the world is produced in Italy,” claims Cosmetica Italia, the trade association representing the peninsula’s beauty industry.  However, alcoholic perfumery represents an even larger share of Italian exports, in value, while hair products are the third leading category of the Italian cosmetics industry. In 2017, for the eighth consecutive year, exports recorded a substantial increase, exceeding 4.6 billion euros, increasing by 7.1% compared to 2016. According to estimates by Cosmetica Italia, the overall growth of the sector should be 4.5% in 2018, allowing the industry to achieve a global turnover of 11.5 billion euros. Exports should continue to play a key role as export sales are expected to grow by 8% to reach about 5 billion euros. The figures are all the more remarkable as the internal market remains fragile with a growth forecast of 1.9% in 2018. ""Thanks to the quality and efficacy of its offer, the Italian cosmetics industry responds with competitiveness to a domestic and international scenario that is dramatically changing, as regard as the consumer demand and the retail structure,"" said Renato Ancorotti, president of Cosmetica Italia. ""The companies in the sector confirm their capacity to invest in research and innovation, key factors of success in the markets,"" he concluded."
What happened this summer?,"The relatively slow progression of the European cosmetics market encourages brands to find new sources of growth around the world. However, under the presidency of Donald Trump, the United States are apparently determined to give up their traditional role of global growth driver, at least if they do not get economic counterparts from it. Several categories of cosmetics are already impacted by the trade war launched against China and the European Union.  This summer, politic and commercial tensions have spread to Turkey, which has imposed 60% customs duties on cosmetics originating from the USA. Despite this tense climate, many market segments remain very dynamic. Taking advantage of the increasing porosity between the two categories, several makeup brands are making forays into the dynamic skin care market.  Driven by the growing diversity of beauty markets, foundation was the star category of the summer. In general, Asia continues to offer a steady pace of growth. The boom of the men’s beauty market in Korea and China prompted Chanel to launch its very first make-up line dedicated to male consumers.  In China, L’Oréal and A.S. Watson are joining forces to roll-out a concept store dedicated to make-up. In parallel, Switzerland’s Mibelle announced its entry into the South Korean market with the purchase of dermocosmetics brand Dr. G. It remains to be seen which area would be likely to take over from Asia? With its young and growing population, Africa seems ideal, despite a still massive poverty and poorly regulated markets. As far as trends are concerned, let’s note the respective attempts from H&M and Shiseido to transform market codes of the perfumery and makeup markets, respectively. On the acquisitions front, L’Oréal has acquired the German organic beauty brand Logona and the La Roche Posay thermal station in France, while Beiersdorf tapped into the skin microbiome trend through an investment in S-Biomedic. On the supplier side, Arcade Beauty purchased the fragrance business of K Fragrance, while Amcor and Bemis announced their merger. Also noteworthy is the strategic partnership between Givaudan and the Indian company Synthite. Eventually, with regard to brands, let’s mention the partnership between L’Oréal and Facebook to develop the virtual make-up tests, or the opening of a L’Occitane en Provence experiential boutique on New York’s 5th Avenue."
Is Africa the next Asia?,"In a recent report, Euromonitor International found that Africa will be home to some of the world’s fastest-growing economies in the coming years. [1]  According to the market research firm: “Africa’s two largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, account for nearly 50% of the continent’s GDP in 2017. However, by 2030 these two countries will represent just 37% of Africa’s total GDP, demonstrating the rising economic importance of Africa’s emerging markets.” In the years to come, the continent’s consumer spending will grow faster than the global average.  However, this does not mean that all problems will suddenly disappear in the continent: poverty will not be eradicated and consumption levels will remain well below the global average. Data from the World Bank show that Africa’s middle class is growing everywhere in the continent.  It already represents 26M of the population in Ivory Coast, but only 1% in Ethiopia. “Given the continent’s large population and strongly increasing GDP, Africa is set to be the most dynamic region for various industries, which include packaged food, consumer electronics, and beauty and personal care,” says Euromonitor. As shown by Jean-Paul Dechesne, Worldwide Director Regulatory Affairs at Colgate Palmolive, during Cosmetics Europe’s annual conference, held on June 13 and 14, 2018 in Brussels, the rise in the cosmetics consumption has prompted many African states to adopt regulations aiming at controlling these products, or to consider doing so. While big global beauty brands such as L’Oréal, Unilever, PZ Cussons, Beiersdorf and Procter & Gamble have led the way across the continent, expanding from the two most important African economies (South Africa and Nigeria) to other promising markets such as Kenya, Tanzania, Ivory Coast and Ghana, other international brands are now making significant inroads too."
Skin bleaching in Africa: An ’addiction’ with risks,"""It’s a mindset that has eaten into society. For a lot of people, it’s the path to getting a good job, having a relationship,"" said Dr. Isima Sobande, a 27-year-old Nigerian physician who was immediately confronted with the health problems linked to these practices when she started working at a health centre in Lagos. For many Nigerians, it is a ""standard procedure,"" a gateway to beauty and success, she said. Skin lightening is popular in many parts of the world, including South Asia and the Middle East. But medical experts say that in Africa - a continent where regulations are often lax or scorned - the widening phenomenon is laden with health risks. Cultural watchdogs, for their part, see it as the toxic legacy of colonialism. Where statistics about Africa’s skin-bleaching industry exist, they are often old or unreliable. But evidence from the range of products, suppliers and services points to a continent-wide market that may number tens of millions of people and possibly more. Africa is experiencing a ""massive trend of increased use (of skin bleaching), particularly in teenagers and young adults,"" said Lester Davids, a physiology professor at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. ""The older generation used creams - the new generation uses pills and injectables. The horror is that we do not know what these things do in high concentrations over time in the body."" In Nigeria alone, 77 per cent of women - by extrapolation, more than 60 million people - are using lightening products on a ""regular basis"", the World Health Organization (WHO) said in 2011.   A market of high interest for major cosmetic and beauty brands. ""More clients want insight on the lightening market,"" said Rubab Abdoolla, a beauty analyst at market researchers Euromonitor International. The rich tend to opt for pricier registered products which are available in standard doses. Others are likely to buy creams, often bootleg concoctions mixed in the back streets, that may be dangerous and are blatantly sold in defiance of official bans or constraints. Ingredients may include hydroquinone, steroids, mercury and lead - the same element that, at high doses, poisoned Elizabethan courtiers who powdered their faces ivory white. In spite of the risks, authorities are struggling to control the market. They have difficulties with the latest bleaching innovations, which include a compound called glutathione, taken as injections or pills. Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya have all banned skin bleaching products with high amounts of hydroquinone and mercury, with the province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa urging people to ""reject all colonial notions of beauty"". In July, Ghana’s Food and Drugs Authority issued a statement telling pregnant women not to take glutathione pills to bleach their unborn babies saying that there may be ""serious toxic side effects"" such as ""asthma, renal failure and chest pains."" The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stresses that it has not given approval for any of the injections on the market today. ""These products are potentially unsafe and ineffective, and might contain unknown harmful ingredients or contaminants."" In Africa, however, products remain easily available to most consumers through local markets, the web or specialised clinics. Those who start using skin lightening say they invariably stay with the practice. ""Before you know it, it has become some sort of an addiction where you want to maintain that look,"" said Dabota Lawson, a Lagos socialite and cosmetics entrepreneur. ""Just like with plastic surgery, it begins to feel like it’s never enough."" Instagram skincare star Pela Okiemute’s Russian White body cream claims to give ""firmness, intense beauty and a mixed race complexion"". His Cleopatra Royal cream, whose label features Elizabeth Taylor in her famous role as the Egyptian queen, promises to ""lighten and radiate"" skin’s tone within two weeks. Okiemute says his creams, which include collagen, kojic acid and ""anti-ageing"" snail slime are safe, though he declined to divulge his formula. ""We have a lot of customers who have used a lot of wrong products, they come to us and we give solutions,"" he adds. Intravenous injections and pills of glutathione — an antioxidant naturally found in the body that has a lightening side effect — are the new frontiers of skin bleaching. At his clinic on the outskirts of Lagos, beside an abandoned Chinese restaurant, plastic surgeon Aranmolate Ayobami charges clients 150,000 naira ($415, 350 euros) for a five-week course of glutathione injections. Known as the ""Buttmaster"" for helping patients seeking an hourglass figure, Ayobami buys the injections from companies he trusts in the United Arab Emirates or the United States. He only gives certain dosages for a limited amount of time, he said. But sometimes clients will bring in their own cheaper product that they bought online and urge him to inject them. ""We try to discourage that,"" he said. If many millions of Africans lighten their skin without regret, others are dismayed. ""Skin bleaching is one manifestation of folks trying to get power and privilege aligned with whiteness,"" said Yaba Blay, a researcher at North Carolina Central University. ""We’re seeing folks attempt to be perceived as having more value because of their complexion."" Beyond the influent of colonialism, having a whiter skin tone also means having a job not exposed to sun light and of higher social status. Recent black movements are trying to challenge that perception. #Melaninpoppin, a hashtag celebrating black skin, and the smash-hit movie ""Black Panther,"" which featured an almost all-black cast wearing African-inspired outfits and natural hair, are held up as testaments to a shift away from longstanding Eurocentric standards of beauty. But whether the tide of opinion is turning in Africa itself is another question. ""The truth for me was that my beauty was more accepted abroad than at home,"" said Ajuma Nasenyana, a model from northern Kenya, who has walked for Victoria’s Secret and Vivienne Westwood. ""In the African industry the lighter your skin tone the more beautiful you are. Hopefully the industry is changing and starting to appreciate darker skin."" Sobande, the doctor, said, ""We’re living in a more positive environment than a few years before. But it’s going to take a lot of effort to change the mindset."""
British beauty buffs are driving a booming skincare industry in the UK,"A report from market research company Mintel has found that British women spent a whopping £1.15 billion (approximately US$ 1.46 billion) on facial skincare in 2017, a figure that is expected to climb to £1.18 billion for 2018. By 2023, Mintel expects the industry to increase by 15 percent to reach a value of £1.36 billion (approximately US$ 1.73 billion or EUR 1.52 billion). Cleansing appears to be one of the main product categories driving the growth. About 92 percent of British women currently use facial cleansers, be it face wash (55 percent) wipes (54 percent) or micellar water (27 percent). The proportion of women using day cream has also increased over the past year, rising from 59 percent in 2017 to 66 percent in 2018, with night creams also increasing in popularity, from 39 percent to 48 percent in the same timeframe. ""As beauty trends continue to be inspired by Korean facial skincare routines, which can reach as many as 10 steps, British women are adopting multiple cleansing routines and even using different cleansers for different occasions,"" said Roshida Khanom, Associate Director, Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. ""Facial wipes remain popular due to their convenience and are sometimes used instead of a facial cleanser; however, with government plans to eliminate single use products like facial cleansing wipes, the category could be affected.” However, when it comes to sun protection, the report found British beauty buffs to be less enthusiastic, with only 47 percent of the 1,008 women surveyed saying they used facial skincare products containing SPF. Some 40 percent of respondents said they were confused about appropriate levels of daily sun protection. Paradoxically, when questioned about factors that can take a toll on the complexion, 72 percent of skincare users cited sun exposure as having the biggest impact, followed by pollution (41 percent) and cold weather (39 percent). Sleep was considered the biggest internal influencer for 62 percent of participants, followed by diet (54 percent) and water consumption (46 percent). However, only 5 percent were aware of the possibility of damage caused by the blue light and HEVL (high-energy visible light) emitted by mobiles and other electronic devices. “Exposure to heavy blue light/high energy visible light (HEVL) from electronic devices such as computers and smartphones has become a daily occurrence for many consumers. While there is currently little definitive proof that HEVL exposure can impact the appearance of skin, scientific studies as recent as this year suggest such exposure may accelerate pigmentation changes and add fine lines and wrinkles. It is clear from our research that most consumers are unaware of the damage HEVL is capable of doing to our skin. Brands have an opportunity to rewrite the traditional anti-ageing narrative, and advocate a new set of pro-health skin solutions that are driven by blue light protection,” concludes Roshida."
Foundation is the beauty hit of summer 2018,"Vegan beauty brand Milk Makeup announced plans last month to add eight new hues to its ’Blur Foundation’ series, bringing the total number of foundation shades in the range to 24. The new hues range from the very pale through to the very deep, with plenty of fair, medium and dark hues in between. The new additions are now available at milkmakeup.com and sephora.com, and will launch in-store at Sephora from August 15. Beautyblender made its first foray into the makeup industry in July, with the launch of a 32-piece foundation line titled ’Bounce’. The foundation, which is cruelty-free and formulated without the use of parabens, phthalates, sulfates, and oils, is infused with hyaluronic acid and birch extract, and has been designed to offer a ""velveteen matte finish"" and 24-hour coverage. NYX Cosmetics is also launching a brand new foundation this summer. Dubbed ’Can’t Stop Won’t Stop,’ the 45-shade series is set to release on August 16. Developed in collaboration with the beauty influencer Alissa Ashley, it promises 24-hour coverage and comes with a precise decimal labelling system that allows shoppers to choose both the perfect shade and undertone for their complexions. Natural beauty brand Lush Cosmetics tested out a foundation release in June, when the company’s Lush Labs division unveiled a 40-shade strong ’Slap Stick’ foundation range for a limited time only. The Slap Sticks, which offered three different undertone hues, contained 45 percent Indonesian coconut oil to hydrate and soften the skin with every application. They also featured a peelable wax skin that meant the foundation could be applied directly to the complexion, or using a brush or fingers, thus avoiding excess packaging. After months of teasing, TooFaced finally unveiled the results of its collaboration with blogger and influencer Jackie Aina in June. The project consisted of expanding the shade range of the label’s ’Born This Way’ foundation, in order for it to suit a wider variety of dark skin tones. Aina created nine new shades, with an additional two new hues designed by the brand, bringing the total number of colors offered to 35."
China’s new online cosmetics stars: men,"When Jiang Cheng first tried a bit of concealer during his first year of university in China it gave him self-confidence and he was instantly hooked. Now he is among hundreds of Chinese men sharing beauty tips online and cashing in on the booming male cosmetics industry.  ""I found that putting on make-up is actually quite easy,"" the 24-year-old said as he gently brushed his face with some foundation. ""Women may not fully grasp the concept of male make-up. If a girl puts on my make-up, they may not be able to achieve the effect that I really want,"" Jiang said. Every weekend, Jiang spends a couple of hours in front of his iPhone at his cosy makeshift studio in Beijing trying on the latest balms and blush for hundreds of live viewers, who can simultaneously buy the products he reviews. Online beauty stars form an enormous industry in China, with internet celebrities known as ""wang hong"", or online stars, blurring the line between entertainment and e-commerce. Companies like Alibaba and JD.com have launched live-streaming platforms that allow viewers to purchase on the go while watching videos. The male beauty market is expected to grow 15.2 percent in the next five years in China compared to an 11 percent global increase over the same period, according to research firm Euromonitor. Increasingly, foreign firms like La Mer and Aesop work with video bloggers such as Lan Haoyi, known as Lan Pu Lan online, to promote their products to his nearly 1.4 million followers. The 27-year-old spends up to 10,000 yuan ($1,460) a month on beauty products and says China’s ""Little Fresh Meat"" - a term referring to young good-looking men - is spearheading this trend. ""We’re seeing more men in the media wearing make-up. This will naturally become the norm,"" Lan said. Beauty and masculinity criteria have thus been transformed among young Chinese men. Despite what appears to be social progress in many of the country’s cosmopolitan cities, the video blogger says he still receives hate messages and criticism for appearing in smoky red eyeshadow. ""’Why would a man look like that? Why does a man need to wear make-up?’ These are some of messages I get,"" Lan says. But Mo Fei, the executive director for Chetti Rouge, a Chinese cosmetics company targeting men exclusively, says that will change over time.  ""There will be more and more men who take more care in how they look and the demands will increase. Men in the East are more accepting,"" Mo told AFP. He opened Chetti Rouge in 2005 with few products. Now the beauty company sells a wide variety of cosmetics ranging from foundation to lipstick solely for men and has moved the entire business online. Furthermore, the company expanded to Thailand three years ago. ""We saw potential in the market very early on,"" Mo added. ""It might be that men have accepted make-up. For men to browse products in shopping malls, may be for some men a little intimidating, hence the best way for them to buy is online, which is why our sales strategy is mainly on the internet."""
Three skincare brands making a move on the makeup industry,"Japanese skincare brand Shiseido is launching an entirely reimagined makeup line this month, putting it firmly back on the beauty map. The refresh, which will launch globally on August 15, comprises 21 new products in 125 different shades, with the series classified into ’Gels’, ’Inks’, ’Powders’ and ’Dews’. ""We are taking an innovative approach to makeup that no other brand has ever done before,"" said Jill Scalamandre, President, bareMinerals, BUXOM and Global Development Shiseido Makeup, of the project, in a statement. Cult skincare brand GlamGlow, which is known for its glittery face masks, put its stamp on the makeup industry earlier this summer. The company unveiled its debut hybrid beauty product, a trio of highlighters dubbed ’GlowPowder’, back in June. The GlowPowders will allow beauty fans to improve their complexions while adding a warm glow to their look, thanks to the addition of hyaluronic acid and golden clay, which the brand claims will ""smooth, refine, and enhance"" the skin. Although not a skincare brand, Beautyblender’s sponge makeup applicators have reached cult status around the globe. This July, the company made its first foray into the makeup sector, with the launch of a 32-piece foundation line titled ’Bounce’. The brand is also reportedly cooking up new color cosmetics releases for the near future, so watch this space."
YouCam Makeup unveils the favourite lipstick colours around the world,"In honour of #NationalLipstickDay to be celebrated on July 29 in the USA, Perfect Corp., takes a closer look at global user lipstick preferences within the award-winning YouCam Makeup app [1]. Perfect Corp thus took a deep dive into the lipstick preferences of the users of YouCam MakeUp, its flagship app, to reveal the next big lipstick trends and created three exclusive styles for users to experience for themselves. The top five Pantone lip colours of the year, with classic pinks and reds holding their position at the top of the charts, are: #1 Rose Fandango #2 Carmin #3 Rose profond #4 Amarante #5 Cerise Furthermore, according to the data collected by Perfect Corp, a matte finish continues to dominate as the favourite lipstick finish across the globe making up nearly 50% of all lipstick try-ons. The exception: Japan. Japanese user data shows 50% preferred a sheer lipstick finish, as compared to only 18% choosing matte. A closer look at lipstick preferences made by users in New York City and Los Angeles revealed that east coast beauties favoured pink lip colours while west coast beauties opted for reds. Always on the occasion of #NationalLipstickDay, the virtual reality firm is also launching exclusive top trending lipstick styles to experience virtually. With over 10.8 billion global lipstick try-ons in 2017 alone - and nearly 500 million recorded in the US - lipstick remains the most tested item on the app."
USA: The prestige skincare category drives beauty industry growth,"According to recent findings from The NPD Group’s 2018 Makeup In-Depth Consumer Report, nearly all U.S. women using makeup, or 90 percent, reported using makeup with skincare benefits. However, the usage of these products does not appear to be replacing or cannibalizing consumers’ skincare routines.  Indeed, according to the market research firm, two-thirds of women stated they use these makeup products in addition to separate skincare offering the same benefits. “Makeup continues to perform well, as our study found that more women are using it and they are also using more products, on average, in a typical day compared to two years ago. At the same time, the consumer mindset today places greater emphasis on taking care of the skin in order to prevent flaws, rather than covering up flaws as they appear,” said Larissa Jensen, executive director, beauty industry analyst at The NPD Group. “Consumer expectations of makeup products have heightened as a result of skincare’s influence on format and efficacy.” A continuation of the trend that began in 2017, the prestige skincare category is driving U.S. beauty industry growth so far this year. Year-to-date through May 2018, skincare sales grew by 13 percent, with segments including facial moisturizer, age specialists, and eye treatments contributing the most dollars gained. Makeup, which continues to be beauty’s largest category, experienced a 1 percent increase in sales during these months, driven by concealer, mascara, and foundation. [1] “Skincare has created a winning story around ingredients, innovation, wellness, and great skin at any age. Makeup brands and manufacturers are tearing a page from skincare’s playbook by leveraging skincare positioning in their own product offerings. This is a step in the right direction, as I expect the interaction and shared learning’s between these two emotional categories will prove mutually beneficial,” concluded Jensen."
New formats and e-commerce drive sales of home fragrances in the U.S.,"“This market, especially the candles category, continues to perform well as consumers remain attracted to these products for their beautiful designs, sensory experiences, and giftable aesthetic,” comments Dana Kreutzer, Senior Analyst in Kline’s Consumer Products Practice. “Moreover, e-commerce and technology are transforming this segment with new user experiences, where luxury brands and small start-ups alike are racing to embrace e-commerce, making this channel even stronger.” In terms of retail distribution, the market continues to see a dynamic shift among brands. Yankee Candle further penetrates the mass market throughout the year, entering Walmart’s doors in the spring, and the brand’s parent company, Newell Brands, opens it first ever experiential pop-up shop during the holiday season as consumers increasingly crave unique and exclusive shopping experiences. The competition among the large market players and emerging brands continues to strengthen in 2017. Newell Brands quickly becomes the market giant, adding WoodWick and Chesapeake Bay Candle brands to its home fragrance portfolio in 2017, and Bath & Body Works, one of the largest prestige brands, continues to see excellent performance. However, the smaller, luxury players are the market movers, and Voluspa, Nest, Illume, and Paddywax are among the strongest performers with double-digit gains in 2017. The direct sales channel advances at a rate of 10% in 2017, while candle sales through the channel grow above the rate. Candles remain the largest product category in 2017, contributing more than 41% to overall market sales. Driven by luxury candle marketers that record double the category growth, candles are also the fastest growing product form in the market. Several new luxury marketers enter the segment in 2017, such as Gibson & Dehn and HomeWorx by Harry Slatkin, selling its products through another popular direct-selling retailer - home shopping network - QVC. Despite new entrants and strong growth of several prestige brands, Yankee Candle remains the category’s market leader. Another segment enjoying consumers’ favour is the diffusers category. This category is particularly innovative with the fragrance meeting technology and new smart scent diffusers from brands like Moodo and Aera, giving consumers the ability to control and customize their home scent experiences. New formats, such as the launch of liquidless reed diffusers by Nest and Diptyque, add additional attractivity to the segment."
France: Asian-made beauty products boost prestige skincare sales,"Cushions, BB creams, fabric or rubber masks: for some years now, the K-beauty has invaded the daily beauty rituals of French women, attracting more and more followers every year. Actually, the success of Asian-made beauty products is having a positive impact on the market as sales of prestige face care beauty products have increased by 1% year-on-year on over the period between May 2017 and April 2018, announced The NPD Group on July 4th. According to the market research company, this growth can be partly attributed to the popularity of Korean-inspired beauty products (K-beauty) on the French market. Unsurprisingly, face care masks - one of the Asia’s latest innovations - continue to rise in the skincare segment with sales growing by 8% between May 2017 and April 2018 compared to the same period last year. Beyond the traditional cream masks, new product proposals inspired from Asia are driving growth: fabric and paper masks and skincare patches are the best performers with a 78% increase in sales, while sales of clay or mud masks increased by 43%. As far as gel masks are concerned, sales grew by 14%, over the same périod. At the same time, sales of BB cream have decreased by 10% while those of CC creams remained flat. According to The NPD Group, these textures that sparkled the popularity of K-beauty in France, have been losing their popularity over the years. However, other innovations have taken over, including ""cushion"" foundations, with sales increasing by 13% during the period. Sales of lotions and tonics, which are key elements of the Korean beauty routine, jumped by 12% in value. ""Consumers have quickly adopted the new gestures inspired from Asia beauty routines and this is good news! The rise of K-beauty in recent years has broadened skin care routines in France and popularized new textures by diversifying product lines through masks, serums and cushions. Social networks, prestige brands and brands have also supported this trend. Beauty retailers such as Sephora and FeelUnique have recently launched a section dedicated to Korean products,"" explains Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. Major Japanese brands have seized the opportunity of the Asian wave sparkled by the K-beauty to give a new impetus to their products in Europe. While Shiseido, Shu Uemura, SK-II, Sensai or Kanebo have been established in the French beauty market for a long time, brands with a wider audience - such as Uniqlo and Muji - have helped to increase the visibility of the Japanese culture. More recently, Japanese-influenced beauty trends have been buzzing on social media, particularly on Instagram, YouTube and among beauty bloggers and influencers. ""The J-beauty trend perfectly fits with new consumer expectations such as simplicity, naturalness and holistic beauty. With a focus on ingredients and long-term care rather than on more ephemeral products, the J-Beauty offers a successful mix of tradition and innovation. In the coming years, we anticipate the entry of more niche Japanese brands into the French beauty market,"" concludes Mathilde Lion. According to The NPD Group, the interest of French women in Asian beauty routines is here to stay!"
The European cosmetics market grew by 1.3% in 2017,"In 2017, the European cosmetics market was valued at 77.6 billion euros, which makes Europe remain the largest market for cosmetic and personal care products in the world. According to Cosmetics Europe, the industry supports over 2 million jobs across the European value chain. Despite the return to a more dynamic growth, the European market remained impacted by low performance of some key markets, in particular: the United Kingdom (-6.8%), The Netherlands (-1.9%) and France (-0.5%). As far as products are concerned, all categories are up from 2016, with the exception of perfumes (-0.4%) and makeup (-0.1%). Skin care and toiletries remain the most important product categories in Europe, followed by hair care and fragrances. In this context of moderate growth, international trade remains a key driver for the European industry. More than 20.2 billion euros of cosmetic products were exported by European countries in 2017 (compared to 18.2 billion in 2016).  Total imports amounted to only 5.935 million euros, mainly from the United States, China and Japan (compared to 5.633 million euros in 2016).  More than ever, exports appear as the real propeller of the European cosmetics industry’s growth."
Show review: MakeUp in Paris 2018 embraces skincare,"The 2018 edition featured 160 exhibitors, flat compared to 2017, 45 of which were new. Visitor numbers were up 2% from last year to 4051 visitors from 57 countries. 2,796 of these visitors came from France, while 1,255 were international. This year, MakeUp in Paris teamed up with trend intelligence group Beautystreams to launch the ColorWave space, providing insight into the shades that we can expect to see influencing the colour palettes of future makeup launches. The show also played host to conferences on hot topics of the moment, such as phygital (physical and digital) retail and the makeup market in the Middle East. Shanghai-headquartered cosmetics manufacturer Thai Ho Group showed its Instagram-friendly, heart-shaped Dual Core Lipstick. The product is comprised of a colour lipstick core, encased by a transparent, glittery outer layer of lip balm. The lipstick is PH sensitive and the colour is gradually revealed after application. It also changes shade according to the skin’s PH levels. The group also showed its Hot Pour Powder Eye Shadow, which has a cream-powder consistency and claims to provide highly-pigmented colour. Korea-based manufacturer World Sponge presented its playful Merry-go-round Applicator Container. The applicator rotates 360 degrees and can be manipulated like a games console controller to pick up the formula inside. Malta-based Toly was one exhibitor cashing in on the pearl makeup trend with its new Solar Stars product. Its container is filled with pearls in three different colours, all made with avocado oil. Once released, they mix to form a humid powder which is said to hydrate the skin and illuminate the complexion. American manufacturer of cosmetic brushes and accessories Anisa International, which was attending MakeUp in Paris for the first time, debuted its Heritage collection, which features the group’s SQ+ fibres - a synthetic alternative to squirrel hair. It also showed its Buffing collection, comprised of brushes with a curved shape to avoid harsh and visible lines, which aims to cater to those who usually use sponges. Anisa International also presented its Emollient Wing collection, an offshoot of its Wing collection. The Emollient Wing brushes feature slightly smaller heads, designed for the effective and precise application of emollient and cream formulas. As ever, digital was a buzzword this year. For the third year in a row, the show featured the MakeUp in Digital space, which is dedicated to technology in the industry. French connected skincare company Feeligold introduced two of its revamped skincare patches, which have now been boosted with new active ingredients. Its Anti Imperfections patch, which now features cutipure and niacinamide, aims to reduce the overproduction of sebum. Its Anti Dark Spots Patch, which now includes mandelic acid, intends to reduce the size and colour of dark spots. LF Beauty, a division of Fung Group, showed its digital mirrors including its digital frame, which it operates for skincare brand Kiehls, and its My Rouge G mirror which it operates for French brand Guerlain. The My Rouge G allows users to digitally try on the brand’s makeup products and offers over 450 combinations from the brand’s range. The user can then take a selfie of their favorite makeup look and print it off as a polaroid. The photo can also be sent by email, as can links to shop the products in the photo.  LF Beauty’s mirrors collect data such as (such as age, sex, the time spent in front of the mirror per consumer and the most popular products and shades). This data can be used to adapt the brand’s stock replenishment accordingly. The interactive mirror frame is currently present in eight Kiehls store in Hong Kong. The My Rouge G mirror is currently present in five doors and LF Beauty is planning to test the innovation in some twenty further stores. Keys trends at the show included brushes and applicators geared toward powder-based products, highly-pigmented colour, glitter, gel textures, pearls and playful products which change colour or texture upon application."
Is it time to ban the term ’anti-aging’ from the beauty industry?,"Dubbed ""That Age Old Question,"" the report, which was carried out by Great Britain’s Royal Society for Public Health in partnership with the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation [1], states that ""anti-ageing narratives"" encourage unrealistic body norms and poor body image that can have a negative effect on women. ""We have seen just how valuable a positive and optimistic outlook on ageing can be to personal health and wellbeing, and yet many everyday conversations, informed by the media, are rife with examples of language that either trivialise, vilify, or catastrophise the ageing process,"" it reads. ""Chief among these is the persistent use of the term ‘anti-ageing’ within the cosmetics and beauty industry."" As highlighted by The Independent, the report calls on major beauty retailers and the media to eschew the term ""anti-aging,"" emphasizing that: ""the explicit presumption that ageing is something undesirable and to be battled at every turn is as nonsensical as it is dangerous."" While the term remains highly prevalent within the beauty industry, there are signs that attitudes towards ageism are changing. Last December, actress Thandie Newton teamed up with RoC Skincare to shine the spotlight on the problem of ageism. The ""Westworld"" star fronted a social media campaign for the brand, called ‘For Your Age,’ that drew attention to the potentially negative language and phrasing commonly used in reference to age. Makeup brand CoverGirl also caused a stir when it flouted convention and unveiled 69-year-old model Maye Musk as an ambassador back in September, while L’Oréal Paris’s October 2017 fashion week saw brand ambassador Dame Helen Mirren, 72, and Jane Fonda, 79, take to the catwalk in the French capital. Trends experts claim that today, a majority of women over 60 are more in the mood for a well ageing, slow aging or pro aging approach... In short, it is all about supporting the aging process rather than fighting the signs of aging, with skincare products supporting a ’pro-longevity’, life enhancers.  “The first positive consequence of this acceptance can be seen in the rehabilitation of some signs of ageing such as bright wrinkles or silver / white hair,” explains Pascale Brousse, founder of prospective agency Trend Sourcing.  “Women are aware that they have wrinkles and that these won’t go away, and like Millennials, they do not want any more over-promises,” she adds."
"The global cosmetics industry must address digital challenges, but the context remains promising","The strength of the market is also reflected in major global cosmetic and perfume companies’ margins over the last five years. The vast majority have seen double-digit average operating margins over the 2013 to 2017 period. According to the market research firm number of factors have allowed perfume and cosmetic groups to ride out the post-crisis with relative ease and many will remain growth drivers in the years to come. Firstly, emerging markets have been behind a large part of global growth over the past few years. Despite their current slowdown, the mere size of the populations combined with growing income means these markets remain extremely valuable. Secondly, as the past has demonstrated, the cosmetic and perfume market benefits from the “lipstick effect”, meaning that even during belt-tightening periods, consumers often choose to indulge in beauty products over other larger discretionary items, buffering the industry somewhat from economic lows. Demand is additionally spurred by innovation allowing the creation of new or reformulated products. Niche segments such as men’s cosmetics, natural cosmetics, or cosmeceuticals, a combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, have particularly seen major growth and are expected to continue to surge, according to Xerfi. An ageing population in many countries with high disposable income is also pushing up demand for anti-ageing products. Last but far from least, digital has opened up new marketing and distribution channels. Indeed, digital is playing an increasingly important role in the industry. Marketing and brand image has always been a major focus of the industry and groups are increasingly recognising the power of digital this regard. “Cosmetic and perfume groups are therefore generally shifting away from big-spend traditional media campaigns and towards smaller, but more varied and more dynamic digital or multi-channel communication. Such communication is often two-way, involving direct, or semi-direct, interaction with customers, fostering closer relationships, but also allowing data collection and, as a result, advanced behavioural segmentation and personalised promotional campaigns. However, with the ris of digital and, more particularly social media, also comes the challenge of catering to increasingly product-educated customers in a context in which other consumers’ opinions and social networks are increasingly integrated into the decision process,” explains Xerfi."
"Colour cosmetics, skincare, Japan and Southern Asia to drive global beauty sales in 2018, according to Euromonitor","According to Euromonitor International one of the main lessons to be learned from last year’s global market evolution is the dynamism of the premium segment, which outpaced its mass counterpart and the overall industry in terms of growth for a third consecutive year. Skin care and colour cosmetics offer the most lucrative prospects within the premium space (7% and 9% growth in 2017, respectively). “Benefitting from further social media appeal, desire for self-expression and technologically-enabled make-over experiences, colour cosmetics outperformed all other categories globally,” said Euromonitor.  Global sales of make-up products grew by 7% in 2017, the highest on record over the past decade.  The trend is expected to continue, with the digital side of the business and the fast-fashion approach to innovation to become always more important for the category. According to Euromonitor, China will be one of the most important boosts to the premium colour cosmetics market. The premium make-up segment was up by 50% in China last year, thanks especially to lipstick products. Despite its much underdeveloped per-capita spend at present, China is set to replace Japan as the second largest colour cosmetics market after the US by 2022. After a few years of subdued results, 2017 saw a resurgence of skin care sales, growing by 6% in value, the highest increase since pre-recession years. The category’s expansion is fuelled by a shift towards prevention and prioritisation of healthy skin maintenance, as well as a softer pro-age and health-aligned narrative in anti-agers, which in turn doubled their premium sales growth to an impressive 10% globally. The trend is also spurring innovation around microbiome-inspired product development, clean and pure formulations, and skin protection features (eg air or digital pollution. Total beauty sales in South Korea 2017 grew by a lacklustre 0.9%i n value. By contrast, Japan benefits from a more healthy domestic consumption, the growth in Chinese tourists, following limits imposed on travel to Korea by the Chinese government, and mounting anticipation in the run up to the Olympics in 2020. The surge in popularity for Japanese brands comes on the back of their long-standing credibility with Shiro, Decorté, Three Cosmetics, Tatcha and DHC spreading their influence beyond their home market. “With a steady pace of strong year-on-year expansion, the markets of India and Indonesia will be among the top 10 absolute growth contributors in the years to 2022,” wrote Irina Barbalova, Global Lead, Beauty and Personal Care at Euromonitor International.  India is set to topple Germany, UK and France to become the fifth largest beauty market by 2022, while Indonesia will be among the top three contributors to actual revenues in skin care in the next five years, only surpassed by US and China. The growth of local brands like Himalaya, Patanjali and Emami in India, as well as Wardah in Indonesia, will reinforce the global potential of traditional local concepts such as Ayurveda, herbal and plant-based ingredients, and halal beauty."
The future of the US beauty industry will be multicultural,"“It’s an exciting time for multicultural beauty in America as more and more brands are developing products to fit the unique interests and needs of multicultural consumers. The increasing diversity of the country bodes well for the beauty industry. With new launches from brands like Fenty Beauty, Kylie Cosmetics and FORM that offer more options for varying skin tones and hair types, there is opportunity for product usage to grow. Custom-blended beauty products is one area in particular that shows promise as these products resonate with women who may find it difficult to match their skin color and undertones or find the right products for their hair texture,” said Toya Mitchell, Multicultural Analyst at Mintel. For instance, two thirds (66%) of Hispanic women say they create complex makeup looks, compared to 51% of US women overall. Hispanic women who perform a beauty routine are also more likely to be interested in multi-purpose beauty products (49% vs 41% women overall), in-shower body products (36% vs 27% women overall) and online beauty tools (31% vs 16% women overall). Meanwhile, Black women are more likely to be interested in trends surrounding natural beauty products (64% vs 45% women overall). A recent Mintel research shows that certain trends are ripe for growth in the US market. One in 10 (9%) women thus say they are interested in following the K-beauty (Korean beauty) trend, with interest rising to 13% of those aged 18-24 and 18% of those aged 25-34. Although half (49%) of US women overall follow a one- or two-step skincare regimen, a dedicated three in 10 (29%) say they have a three or more step skincare routine, indicating multi-step K-beauty regimens have potential to resonate with consumers. Eventually, Mintel observes that beauty devices [1] are the fastest growing segment in the US beauty industry. In fact, despite making up just 4% of the market, total retail sales of beauty devices grew 7.6% between 2016-2017 to reach an estimated $1.6 billion. “This is the fastest rate of sales growth the category has seen in the last five years (since 2013),” notes the market research firm. Elsewhere in the category, sales of beauty staples such as colour cosmetics (29% market share) and hair products (28% market share) grew 2.2% in the same timeframe, while skincare (25% market share) grew 1.4%. While skincare device usage is limited, interest is strong. Although just over one third (35%) of women say they use any skincare device, 41% of women say they are interested in trying one, with laser hair removal devices garnering the most interest (46%). “Future growth is expected to come from new product innovation and the availability of lower-priced skincare devices. We’re seeing customization evolve to include tech tools that diagnose hair and skin issues, with brands making it easier for consumers to bring this trend home,"" concluded Alison Gaither, Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel."
Spain: Sales of perfumes and cosmetics still on the rise,"Sales of perfumes and cosmetics grew by 2.15% in 2017 in Spain to reach EUR 6.82 billion. This is the third consecutive year of growth for the country, according to the Spanish Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (STANPA). All product categories have grown, but sales of perfumes and colour cosmetics recorded the most impressive rates: +5.42% and +3.24% respectively.  Sales of lipsticks, for instance, have grown by +7.4% in value (+13.5% in volume) in 2017. The per capita consumption is 147 euros per year, more than the European average (137 euros per year) but less than those of France (171 euros per year) and Italy (163 euros per year). The mass market channel, which represents 47% of sales, is the one which increased the most in 2017, rising by 2.9%. The selective channel (prestige) grew by 2.5%. According to STANPA, the Spanish perfume and cosmetics industry also achieved record export sales in 2017 with growth of +10.5% over the previous year to reach 3.9 billion euros. Export sales are growing for all product categories. The sales of fragrance, which account for 40% of the sector’s exports, have increased by 11.2% in 2017."
China Beauty Expo continues to move upmarket with the French Touch,"For Jean-Luc Ansel, chief executive of Cosmetic Valley and Franckie Bechereau, export and communication director, ""the links between China and France in the beauty sector began in 2008. Cosmetic Valley has been invited by China to come to the country’s largest exhibition, China Beauty Expo. In 2010, the Cosmetic Valley decides to be present for the first time on CBE. Since then, she has renewed the experience every year, in order to promote the France Brand”. From this adventure, many partnerships and projects were born, including the famous BeautéVille, a Chinese clone of the Cosmetic Valley. In 2017, the French cosmetics export market signed a new record at 13.6 billion euros (+12% over one year). French exports of cosmetic products to Asia soared by 25% over one year, with a growth rate of over 30% in China in particular. One out of 5 French cosmetic products now leaves for Asia, according to FEBEA. Care and perfumes still account for 3/4 of French exports in the sector (44.3% for care and 31% for perfumes). The Chinese market is evolving and moving upmarket, as confirmed by the figures published by L’Oréal, where the Luxury Goods and Active Cosmetics divisions are posting solid sales. But China is also a volatile market. The Chinese consumer is increasingly aware and brands that want to succeed in China must create links with their interlocutors; working over the long term remains difficult. Especially since local brands want to assert themselves.  The French manufacturers have a real role to play in the development of value creation, in particular through the country’s fields of excellence such as lipo chemistry with the ITERG (Institut des Corps Gras) in Bordeaux or the research of bioactive peptides (with the PENERE European project in Caen). “Our objective is to forge lasting links with companies targeted at different sites in China, including Beauté Ville and Fengxian,"" continues Jean-Luc Ansel. “France is the country of cosmetic research, our R&D budget is 350 million euros, divided into 300 innovative projects. Throughout France, we have territories of expertise by regions grouped within the Domains of Strategic Territorial Excellence (DEST). The France brand is a symbol of performance, safety and know-how. The quality of French products is recognized throughout the world; we deliver healthy, validated and safe products. Another asset is training: we have an important card to play in China. France is a country where training is well developed and of high quality. Our know-how in this field is undeniable thanks to our engineering schools, our aesthetic training... China is in demand, it is up to us to respond.” This year, for the first time, the Cosmetic Valley has two pavilions at China Beauty Expo: one 420 m2 in hall E2 and the other 104 m2 in hall N4 which groups together the entire supply chain for the cosmetics sector COSMETECH (packaging, formulations, ingredients, accessories and services), i.e. a third of the total exhibition space with over 1000 exhibitors. COSMETECH is representing the largest Beauty Factory in the world with 7 halls dedicated to supply chain. According to Claudia Bonfiglioli - General Manager of Informa Beauty “COSMETECH give the largest opportunity ever to brands to search new qualified suppliers in each category. Since two years COSMETECH has an ingredient advanced science in beauty project in Collaboration with IFSCC to bring R&D expert to the platform.” This N4 supply chain hall now includes these companies specializing in fields as varied as knowledge of skin physiology used for efficacy tests as know-how in glassware or R&D in formulation with Roval Cosmétiques, full service and custom solutions. The Pochet Group, an independent family business for over four centuries, French leader in luxury packaging will exhibit its latest creations. This company aims to become a world leader in multi-material luxury packaging for the beauty sector. To its credit, the last bottle of Chanel’s Gabrielle perfume or the ""stiletto"" of Louboutin nail polish. For Franckie Bechereau, ""France has a varied choice of subcontracting companies, each with their often unique specialities, for the Chinese market. Among them, present under CV flag, VTA France represents the know-how of the French glassworks, specialist manufacturer of the glass bottle in tube drawn to measure, of caps type roll-on, capsule, dropper, pump...and of decorations (on glass in metallization, frosting, screen printing enamel or organic). It also manufactures and packages, in full service, samples of perfumes. Another field is testing with Bioalternatives, a company specializing in the evaluation of cosmetics, which offers more than 300 in vitro and ex vivo efficacy tests.” The ""premiumisation"" of the market is forcing Chinese brands to look for cutting-edge know-how, both in the technical and creative fields.  “Our expertise in French brand creation fascinates the Chinese,” Françoise Barthélémy from the Carlin Paris agency, who has been supporting Chinese brands in the lingerie sector for over 25 years. “The Occitane brand is the ultimate model for the Chinese. Even if trends in China differ from those in the West, the search for naturality, ecology and the weight of labels and references remain a foundation on which brands can be built. Cosmetics is a relatively young market in China. The care habits are still summary, with the exception of body care where rituals are more developed with the use of oils. As for skin care, the Chinese mainly seek to act on the color of their complexion by making it less yellow.” The other important point is regulatory. The CFDA (China Food and Drug Administration) has revised its cosmetic regulations, adopted since 2016. China is willing to adapt to European regulations, even if specificities remain, such as the compulsory approval for a new ingredient or the long and complex registration allowing cosmetics to be exported to China. This being the case, French companies that depend on European legislation are already well established during the year. China Beauty Expo

China: Meitu wants to impose itself as a brand partner,"Founded in 2008 in Xiamen, Fujian Province, Meitu (美图, ""beautiful image"") has enjoyed staggering growth with its photo editing application. ""53.5% of photos shared on mainstream China social media are processed by Meitu,"" emphasized Jade Zhou. The Group which is listed at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has changed to ""a Beauty ecosystem"" by developing child applications such as BeautyCam (improved selfies), Meipai (sharing of short videos and live-streaming) and MakeupPlus. The latter uses artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) to offer skin diagnostics as well as the online virtual testing of make-up products from different brands. ""So far, Meitu has already cooperated with more than 100 of the top makeup brands such as L’Oréal Paris, Guerlain, Lancôme, Maybelline New York, Clinique, Estée Lauder, and Shiseido to name a few. These brands have helped to offer more than 2,000 makeup products on MakeupPlus,"" said Jade Zhou, who added that the app did not sell products directly but linked back to e-commerce platforms such as Tmall. Urban Decay is not established in China but the L’Oréal’s make-up brand has managed to take advantage of MakeupPlus to raise its profile in the country, which according to US estimates is expected to become the leading market for skincare and cosmetics products in 5 to 10 years. Urban Decay worked with the MakeupPlus app inside which we created 3 Urban Decay look filters so that the user could try on the looks virtually. Urban Decay also worked with Meipai for content marketing, so that influencers who are active on Meipai, talk about Urban Decay products organically. ""Make up look virtual try on in MakeupPlus APP - Makeup look filters were downloaded about 23 million times. Both collaborations worked well and the Urban Decay NAKED HEAT palette was sold out in key travel retail channels in APAC,"" said Jade Zhou. The collaboration can also take place in brick and mortar shops, like with Lancôme who installed in January 2017 in its flagship store in Canton, six ""magic mirrors"" incorporating the virtual makeup technology of the MakeupPlus app. ""It was also MakeupPlus app first AI attempt to be implemented in brand stores,"" highlighted Jade Zhou. These virtual makeup test screens were also used by the Nars brand at its launch press conference in China last year. The other applications of the Group are also put to use. ""At the beginning of 2018, our flagship and first app, Meitu, worked with GUCCI to jointly launch a series of 7 exclusive AR filters, to bring a luxurious makeover experience to them"", continued Jade Zhou. Additionally, before the eve of Valentine’s Day, one of our popular selfie apps, BeautyCam, made a special promotion with Dior, to roll out a new customized user interface (UI) design, ""Miss Dior"", where a pink perfume bottle icon became the instant camera button. ""The new UI has driven a surge of exposure outreach to nearly 250 million audience and gained about 2.5 million clicks in just the first 2 days,"" detailed Jade Zhou. By choosing the Valentine’s Day, an originally Western celebration, Meitu stakes its ambitions, which are not limited to the Chinese market. Out of 1.5 billion unique users announced - including 481.3 million active users each month - the Group claims a third - 500 million - are located outside China and thus intends to deploy localization strategies implemented by its teams based in India, Brazil, the United States, Singapore and Japan, to continue its global expansion."
UAE perfumers carve their niche in US$50 billion global fragrance industry,"Two UAE perfumers with a passion for fine fragrances are carving their own niche in a US$50 billion global fragrance industry, with their latest creations on show at the Middle East’s largest beauty and wellness trade fair this May in Dubai.  Abduljabar Al Harthi, the CEO and ‘Nose’ of Jealous Group, will launch two collections of niche perfumes that both pay homage to his country of birth, and also articulate the ""common human qualities amongst nations"". Abdulla Saleh Al Hammadi, Brand Owner and brainchild of The Code Voyage, meanwhile will unveil his brand concept, inspired from his childhood fascination for collecting exquisite perfume bottles and their potions within, during his numerous family vacations around the world. The two collections are among more than 20 brands that will be on display at Quintessence - an exclusive showcase of niche perfumes at Beautyworld Middle East, which runs from 8-10 May 2018 at Dubai International Convention and Exhibition Centre. Al Harthi said his Jealous Eau de Parfum Collection of four fragrances was designed to commemorate the UAE: “It was born out of immense admiration for a nation that has given so much to its citizens,” said Al Harthi.  “I wanted to create a product that would mirror my country’s history and long record of milestones.” His other Eter Story Collection of five perfumes called Peace, Salam, Hipeng, Mir, and Erini wave various stories around the message of love, understanding and communication between different races and cultures. “Eter Story is not a story of a fragrance as much as it is a message that gives people a common space for rapprochement and mutual understanding through a shared experience and a unique diversity that distinguishes them,” said Al Harthi. Al Harthi’s passion for niche fragrances and the stories behind his creations are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, who’re seeking more personalisation than what mass-produced perfumes bearing the names of global fashion houses appear to offer. The rise of niche perfumes - distinguished by the raw ingredients that go into creating a scent, combined with the vivid stories of the perfumers behind them - has been borne out by the popularity of Quintessence, which was first introduced at Beautyworld Middle East in 2016. Code Voyage is participating for the first time at the exclusive showcase in 2018. Al Hammadi said he wants to share the brand’s concept with potential ‘co-voyagers’: “Code Voyage Perfumes celebrate the generosity, hospitality, unity and victories that we all share and experience in our daily lives. Everybody loves having something special, no matter where you come from, and niche brands offer that ‘something special’, whether in the concept and creativity, the packaging or the juice itself. And, particularly in the Middle East, there’s a customer base with a high disposable income, a desire to be unique, and most of all, it’s a customer that has for many centuries been surrounded by fragrances and incense.” Al Hammadi added his brand is rooted in traditional values, reflected in classic shapes used in the packaging: “Although the brand’s values are based on the traditions and way of life of ancient Arab tribes and their experiences, human values and success remain universal and alive: resonating with every human being.” Al Harthi said Middle East consumers have always searched for the highest quality and most unique items, with fragrances being no exception: “The art of perfumery has been in the region since before the creation of perfume as we know it today and it has always been an important part of this region’s cultural heritage. Over the next few years, niche fragrance trends will continue to focus on personalisation. Brands will try to stand out from the crowd by using more unique, rare ingredients that can become their own signature.” Quintessence - the Art of Perfume Quintessence is one of more than eight value-added features at the 23rd edition of Beautyworld Middle East in 2018. Ahmed Pauwels, CEO of the exhibition’s organiser Messe Frankfurt Middle East, said the UAE has a long association with fragrances, with the niche element becoming increasingly popular: “UAE consumers spent US$2.2 billion on beauty and personal care in 2017, of which US$674 million went towards fragrances, an increase of nearly six percent over 2016. The Gulf country is one of the highest per-capita spenders in the world on perfumes and has always traditionally been a very strong perfume market.  Now what we’re seeing is a major shift whereby consumers want to know more about the artistry, creativity, and inspiration behind their favourite fragrances. They want to learn about the nuances of perfume families such as Amber, Gourmand, Fougere, or Chypre, or how oriental scents mix with Oud.   The niche segment answers this demand, and customers are now very sensitive about the perfumer behind the brands they purchase.” Other niche brands at Quintessence in 2018 include Antonio Croce, Coquillete, and Teaology from Italy; the Art of Scent from Switzerland; Poland’s Bohoboca; Dofta from Sweden; House of Potentia, Odin, and Ulrich Lang from the USA; Rebatchi Prive from France; Germany’s The Oriental Perfumery; and Areej Le Dore from Thailand. Aside from Quintessence, Beautyworld Middle East 2018 returns with other popular highlights that attract thousands of professionals every year, such as Centre Stage by Nazih Group; Nail It! by Artistic Nail Design & OPI; and the Battle of the Barbers.  New this year is the Innovation Zone, Blend it! in collaboration with centdegres, and the Advanced Aesthetic Therapist Conference and Workshop. The annual three-day event will feature more than 1,600 exhibitors from 60 countries covering the five product groups of Hair, Nails & Salon Supplies; Cosmetics & Skincare; Machinery, Packaging, Raw Materials & Contract Manufacturing; Fragrance Compounds & Finished Fragrances; Personal Care & Hygiene, and for the first time in 2018, Natural and Organic. Its strong international flavour will be highlighted by 21 country pavilions from Argentina, Bulgaria, Brazil, China, Japan, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, the USA, and for the first time in 2018, Russia, and Peru.

Middle East: The rise of local brands is transforming the beauty market,"The beauty industry in the Middle East is undergoing huge changes: the end of a cycle of domination by international brands, now challenged by emerging independent players. These companies, refocusing on traditional and cultural values, are adapting to new consumers: an ultra-connected and demanding young consumer groups. A public looking for a personalized, targeted and sophisticated offer. Very active on social networks where some real experts have emerged, this age group takes advice from beautystas, who enjoy strong media clout, like the female blogger Huda Katan, now at the head the makeup brand Huda Beauty. This new landscape benefits to independent local players, digitally very present, (e-commerce platforms, social networks) who are able to meet these expectations combining tradition, innovation and personalization. ""Digital and e-commerce have thoroughly modified the beauty world of GCC. [..] New local beauty players have understood the essence of needs of Gulf customers and are challenging traditional businesses. By shaking up the industry, forcing it to think outside the box and be more consumer-centric, they have a significant and very positive impact. The Chalhoub Group is opening to these independent beauty brands which the region needs and welcomes them. We are very proud to have contributed to their international expansion and to see them succeed today,"" said Anthony Chalhoub, co-CEO of Chalhoub Group. To adapt to this new landscape, the Chalhoub Group recommends several strategies. Design personalized products, develop digital strategies, renew the authentic link with this new generation through a unique shopping experience and enrich the online offering. But also support these new local players, mostly present on the web, by offering them visibility in brick and mortar shops. A key evolution, considering that the beauty market in Gulf countries has dropped by 5%, with sales totaling USD 1.9 billion in 2016 against 1.8 bn last year. In a difficult macroeconomic context, international groups have reduced their marketing budgets. Institutional brands are struggling to adapt, thus contributing to the success of local small-scale designers who fully embrace the needs of a new generation looking for a customer centric offer, via digital and social networks. Hence the Chalhoub Group is seeking to revisit shopping experiences with new retail concepts and own brands. An all the more relevant bias in these Gulf countries where beauty rituals, like perfuming but also making-up, punctuate every moment of life. In a context where women are veiled, it is essential in particular, to design a wide range of eye makeup products (eye shadows, kohl, mascaras, false eyelashes, pencils, gels, brow powders...). Between tradition and modernity, local brands are developing ancestral rituals (perfumes built around oud and incense, kohl for the eyes) to adapt them to the current needs of modern and connected young people. ""GCC consumers have evolved. They have now become more assertive, curious, determined, and particularly influenced by their relatives and friends on social networks. In terms of beauty, they focus on makeup and look for originality, fun and color. [...] An increasing number of local entrepreneurs are undertaking relevant initiatives for their own community. They are changing the beauty scene of GCC and creating a new momentum. They are challenging established players and forcing them to rethink their strategy,"" added Patrick Chalhoub, co-CEO of Chalhoub Group. In a region where makeup and olfactory rituals have always been closely linked to women’s culture, the Chalhoub Group supports many cosmetic niche brands to better identify, renew and welcome today’s beauty."
"Global colour cosmetics sales to grow 6% in 2018, forecasts Mintel","Global sales of colour cosmetics are expected to reach US$ 48.3 billion in 2018, up 6% from US$ 45.5 billion in 2017, according to new research from Mintel. The US (US$ 12.1 billion), Japan (US$ 6.4 billion), China (US$ 5.1 billion), the UK (US$ 2.7 billion) and South Korea (US$ 2.2 billion) are forecast to be the top five colour cosmetics markets in 2018. Mintel has identified four macro-trends in the category: social media, sustainability, transparency, and hybridisation. Social media As the success of influencers has shown that people buy personality, and not simply the products, it has become more important for brands to have a personality. – 41% of Chinese colour cosmetics users are influenced by celebrity beauty bloggers and vloggers to buy products
– 31% of German make-up users aged 16-24 wear make-up to feel trendy
– 66% of UK women aged 16-24 say it’s easy to learn new beauty techniques from the internet
 Social media gives brands a way to build a more intimate relation with consumers. They also encourage makeup users to adopt new habits. “As fashions change, new ’selfie-friendly’ zones of the face are receiving more attention,” says Charlotte Libby, Mintel’s Global Colour Cosmetics Analyst. Sustainability The whole beauty industry is shifting towards natural and organic products.  Colour cosmetics makes no exception with an increased attention on product origin and quality of ingredients. In such a context, brands will be expected to demonstrate their ethical policies and consideration of resources and alternatives. – 66% of UK female beauty buyers aged 16-24 want retailers to give them more information about which beauty products are environmentally-friendly
– 24% of Italian women have bought natural and organic make-up in the past year
 “Consumers are drawn to brands that act responsibly. Attempting to reduce the carbon footprint by tackling waste is an area in which colour cosmetics brands can innovate. Alternative materials like bamboo, coconut husk and rice bran have been a growing trend in packaging,” says Charlotte Libby. Transparency Young consumers want to be sure the companies and brands they buy from align with their personal views. – 34% of Brazilian Millennials aged 19-35 say they prefer to buy from brands that support social causes
– 39% of US women aged 18-34 think brands that support charities are trying to make themselves look better
 Brands need to convince consumers their positioning is genuine.  “A strategy involving charitable donations needs to be long term and treated appropriately, becoming part of the core business of the company,” adds Charlotte. Hybridisation As consumer demand for make-up with skincare benefits increases, there is more opportunity for brands to develop hybridisation between categories. – 67% of Chinese women want to minimise make-up steps
– 41% of US female beauty buyers would be interested in multi-purpose beauty products
– 41% of French women think that the environment (eg pollution, cold weather) affects the appearance of the skin
 “As part of growing concerns around pollution, face make-up can act as another layer of protection. Hence, it is important that colour cosmetics incorporate skincare benefits such as hydration and UV protection. Probiotics also have a chance to grow; a prominent trend in skincare, connecting good bacteria to healthy skin, they are increasingly being used in colour cosmetics too,” concludes Charlotte Libby."
"Pro ageing: ""Let me be me!""","Apart from some interventionists, a minority of consumers looking for immediate results provided by aesthetic medicine or surgery, the out-and-out youth-cultivating era is over. Most women choose this beautification attitude and look for natural alternatives. The first positive consequence of this acceptance can be seen in the rehabilitation of some signs of ageing such as bright wrinkles or silver / white hair. Worn by the journalist Sophie Fontanel, assumed white hair is trendy and currently making the buzz on Instagram. New muses are making the headlines like May Musk, mother of the founder of Tesla, who at 69 was walking down the runways during the New York Fashion Week and posed for Covergirl. Not to speak of models like the popular Iris Apfel with her asserted bold free and unique style, despite her 96 years of age. Another finding, the taboos of illness and menopause are becoming more and more conspicuous. The Même Cosmetics brand, dedicated to women affected by cancer, was recently approached by Laboratoires Pierre Fabre. In the United States, Hynt products boast a carcinoma free criterion, with no endocrine disruptors. According to the 2015 Deloitte Ifop barometer, 75% of French people would be interested in a coaching proposed by their health insurance and dedicated to well-ageing. Today our perception of seniors is different. It is at the age of 68 that, with no particular reason, the feeling of being a senior takes hold of us, but the paradox is that we always see ourselves younger than we are and this feeling increases with age. Recently, the media coverage on Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French President, has stirred things up, and will possibly change the way we look at women this age. Finally, if the cult of appearance is still very present in the media, we are moving towards the notion of ‘age to enhance’, what Americans call life enhancing. The representation of women in cosmetics is also changing. There are also more products proposed for women over 50 or even over 60. Asserted products and described as such. The Japanese brands were the first to offer products specifically dedicated to women aged 60+, L’Oréal also focused on the subject. Today, Lisa Eldridge, Lancôme makeup artist successfully enhances  mature skins in her Youtube makeup tutorials. The site Look Fabulous Forever, which fights against the dictates of age, will roll out its make up brand in 24 countries. Things are changing with more adapted claims coming from brands. There is an intergenerational influence. Juniors, which are always show-offing on the Internet are whetting the appetite of the older generations. Beauty then becomes more integrative, it will globalize well-being, the silhouette, the lifestyle, our sleep or relaxing practices... resulting in a freer feminine look expecting new codes and expressions. Aging women no longer want to epitomize a set beauty, like Linda Rodin creator of Olio Lusso, described as the chic emblem of aging well. Women are aware that they have wrinkles and that these won’t go away, and like Millennials, they do not want any more over-promises. ""No bullshit marketing!"" They are going to take action to preserve their tonicity, elegance, silhouette. The silhouette is more important than facial features; attention is focused on nutrition, a regular activity, slenderness. Mobility and tonicity prevail. In this quest for mindful beauty radiance, what mature women expect from cosmetics is emotional pleasure, sensoriality but with new and smart products. For this reason, we can anticipate a true coming back of cosmetics targeting this population. After targeting Millennials, brands will now focus on the 60+ again. First because they have a real purchasing power but also and mostly because sensoriality and lucidity are also areas to develop for them.

China Beauty Expo 2018 to put Japan and perfumes under the spotlights,"Japan will be the country of honour at this year’s China Beauty Expo (CBE). In order to support this initiative, Japanese brands will be highlighted and the Japanese cosmetics knowhow shared to the visitors. “Though Chinese brands are starting to focus on technology, they are still at a disadvantage compared with Japanese brands,” says Dr. Yang Jianzhong, President of the Japan-China Cosmetic Exchange Association. In cooperation with the organisers of CBE 2018, Dr. Yang Jianzhong, a noted skincare expert, is inviting 25 top scientists, including Dr. Ronald Marks, a 38-year Shiseido veteran who specializes in anti-aging and skin whitening research. They will share their latest research results and trends in their respective fields. “During CBE 2018, we will also organize a new product-matching event that focuses on popular Japanese and Korean imported brands. CBE will also create opportunities for Japan’s top retailers to meet with Chinese channels and retail groups during its China Cosmetics Retail Summit,” emphasis Mrs Ying Sang, Deputy General Manager at CBE. Another focus will be staged in Hall N5, where are gathered major international make-up brands, such as Maybelline, Max Factor, Red Earth, Can Make, Tony Moly, Memebox or City color.  The hall will host the Perfume Village organized in collaboration with Cent Degrès China. The Village will comprise an exhibition held with the International Perfume Museum of Grasse, France, and a showcase of premium beauty Chinese and international fragrance brands. The idea is to promote perfumes and to highlight their emotional values and ingredients specific to the Chinese culture connected to ancestral Chinese medicinal techniques and values. “The section is designed as a district with a garden, where you will find high-end perfume brands. The N5 fashion district’s sensory garden is likely to be a surprise winner at CBE 2018. This display of perfume innovation comes at a time when the global perfume market is expected to reach US$5.6billions, according to GIA. China and other Asian markets also offer huge potential,” says Matthieu Rochette, General Manager of Cent Degrés China. To further celebrate the art of perfumer, Nez La Revue will also collaborate with Cent Degrés and CBE and will print a special issue in Chinese (5000 copies) in order to support the development of the local fragrance market.  “Chinese consumers are more and more knowledgeable about perfume and are looking for qualitative content on perfume practices, history and general knowledge but also on raw materials and new creative trends. The aim of this special issue is to compare the Chinese culture related to smell, perfume gesture and local tradition with the occidental contemporary culture of perfume,” says Dominique Brunel, publisher of Nez La Revue. CBE in figures For the 2018 edition, CBE is expecting 3,500 exhibitors on over 260,000 sqm of exhibition space and more than 450,000 visitors.  Exhibitors will include more than 1,200 international brands from 26 countries and regions (increased by 90% over last two years), including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, UK and USA to name a few. The supply chain representing one third of the exhibition’s space will gather over 1,000 exhibitors in 2018 with packaging, formulation, ingredients, accessories and services to Beauty Brands. To support the growth of this sector, CBE will feature the Beauty Ingredient Formulation Forum in its 3rd edition, with a program designed in partnership with IFSCC led by Claudie Willemin, physics-chemistry and formulation expert in skin care applied research in R&D. It will consists in a whole day conference with scientific R&D experts from Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, Shiseido, Amorepacific, Sunjin, Ashland, Pola, Merck, Greentech and BioAlternatives to demonstrate the latest beauty and science topics."

Chinese consumers need to be better informed about dermocosmetics,"New research from Mintel [1] reveals that two-thirds (66%) of urban Chinese consumers aged 20-49 who experience skin conditions say lifestyle is a top factor causing their facial skin conditions, followed by an endocrine disorder (47%) and environmental pollution (45%). According to Mintel, Chinese consumers are more likely to modify their lifestyle (72%) and pay more attention to daily facial skincare (71%) before taking any extra measures to treat their skin conditions. However, while 86% of male skin condition sufferers claim they don’t take any measures, allowing it to heal on its own, only just 3% of female skin condition sufferers do the same. The most common skin conditions are not all the same for men as for women. Acne is the main concern of Chinese males (45% vs 38% among females), while they are less likely to report dark spots/pigments (24% vs 36% among females). Products designed to manage specific skin issues have a long history of development in China, but the dermocosmetics industry (usually referred as the cosmeceuticals industry in China) only started gaining momentum over the past few years. So far, only 38% of urban Chinese consumers use cosmeceuticals to improve their skin conditions. “Minor skin conditions seem to be no big deal for Chinese consumers. The majority of them don’t bother to use specialised products or take medicines to treat their skin conditions. In order to broaden the consumer base and usage frequencies, cosmeceuticals need to promote more preventative usage by positioning the products as a holistic approach to maintaining healthy skin, or address lifestyle factors, such as stress or lack of sleep, which is regarded as the number one cause of skin conditions in China, according to our research,” commented Alice Li, research analyst at Mintel. In China, the number of skincare products claiming to be dermatologically tested, grew from 3.3% of new product launches in 2015 to 8.9% in 2017, according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD); meanwhile, the ‘for sensitive skin’ claim is also on the rise as it was featured in 12% of new product launches in 2017, even exceeding similar launches in Japan in 2017 (10.4%). “As Chinese consumers highly value scientific data and endorsement from professional institutes to support product quality, dermatologically tested claims could help local brands build a professional and effective image,” Li added. Furthermore, 74% of Chinese consumers agree it’s essential that cosmeceuticals contain enough active ingredients. While 60% agree cosmeceuticals formulated with fewer ingredients are safer, nearly the same percentage (62%) of respondents are concerned that long-term usage of cosmeceuticals may result in dependence."
The UK prestige beauty market gets vegan and natural boosts,"The sale of vegan prestige beauty products in the UK reported an increase of 38% in the 12-month period February 2017 to end of January 2018 according to The NPD Group. The total market for natural prestige beauty products (of which vegan is a category) was valued at £124 million in 2017 and accounts for 26% of prestige women’s face skincare. Driven by social media and campaigns like Veganuary, the popularity of a vegan lifestyle has grown as consumers embrace a more wellness-oriented lifestyle. The NPD Group has seen an increase in the number of vegan brands in the prestige beauty market but notes that most of these are in limited distribution. Vegan beauty brands only account for 1% of women’s face skincare, but growth is well above the category at 38%. “There has certainly been a rise in the number of vegan brands in prestige beauty and this coincides with consumers adopting a more conscientious approach when purchasing products, looking closely at the underlying philosophies and actions of the brands. They not only investigate ingredients and efficacy, they want to know about traceability, and how animal friendly they are. Vegan and cruelty-free are two of the big issues for customers in 2018, but still remains a niche segment of the skincare market,” explained Helen Duxbury, Senior Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. The prestige beauty market has also been boosted by the growth of natural beauty. Natural brands (including organic, naturally-derived and vegan) are growing at 16%, ahead of the market growth which is at 7% in the 12-month period to the end of January 2018. The top five product sectors for naturals are anti-ageing, cleansers, moisturisers, eye treatment and masks. The biggest contribution to growth from natural beauty products is with anti-ageing (18%), cleansers (14%) and masks (39%) which are all ahead of the category. Natural cleansers in particular perform well, accounting for 18% of sales, compared to all cleansers which is 11%. According to The NPD Group, as consumers become more aware of the ingredients used in beauty products, ethics are now becoming a more important issue to individual brands. While the European Union has banned animal testing for cosmetic products, more consumers are aware that if a brand is selling in China then their products need to be tested on animals.  “Having a clear stance on these ethical issues can provide a valuable boost to sales,” says The NPD Group. For instance, beauty brands with cruelty-free certification account for 20% of the women’s face skincare and are grew by 18% compared to the overall category which grew only 7%. According to The NPD Group, the top five cruelty-free brands in the UK are (in alphabetical order): Charlotte Tilbury, Decleor, Elemis, La Prairie and Liz Earle. “The popularity of vegan is undeniable and brands are now capitalising on the movement. In the past year we have seen solid growth and a stream of new launches in this sector. Whilst most of these are in limited distribution, we are also seeing an increase in mainstream brands offering a vegan range or who are fully vegan, such as the launch of Super Food Skincare by Elemis, which is not only vegan, it meets consumer demand for super food ingredients. We believe the trend for beauty products that not only help consumers look good but feel good about their purchase too is set to grow in 2018,” concluded Duxbury."
Cosmoprof Bologna breaks records amid digital transformation of the beauty industry,"“Cosmoprof 2018 registered astonishing results. The number of professionals attending the exhibition exceeded the 250,000 visitors of the 2017 edition; we recorded a growth by 11% in the presence of foreign operators. Record numbers also for exhibitors, 2,822, from 70 countries; they attracted an international audience,” said says Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. This year, the Cosmoprof Bologna show adopted a new format designed to better address the expectations of visitors and exhibitors.  Hence, most of the show’s sectors were opened from Thursday 15 to Sunday 18 March 2018 (Cosmopack and all the sectors working in the retail channel, for perfumery and cosmetics, green beauty and the international pavilions).  The sectors dedicated to the professional beauty channels (hair, nail and aesthetics & spa segments, with the country pavilions of China and Taiwan) were the only ones opened from Friday 16 to Monday 19 March 2018. Almost entirely dedicated to the impact of digitalization on the beauty market, the show’s inaugural conference, which was organized by Cosmetica Italia, the federation of the Italian cosmetics industry, set the tone of the whole edition. ""Our daily habits and thus our consumption choices are being rapidly influenced and changed by the ceaseless move towards digitisation”, said Fabio Rossello, President of Cosmetica Italia.  “For cosmetics companies, it is crucial to be able to transmit and consolidate our reputation and values in the world of digital information, social value included: indeed, this is increasingly considered to be one of the trademarks of our industry."" A transformation that the exhibitors already integrated into their strategies. ""Business models are changing with the rise of digital and the process goes very fast, especially in China. We have no choice but to adapt. It is increasingly difficult to get customer loyalty, even for big brands. We must be in constant contact with customers, we are entering an era of co-development,"" explains Simon Menard, CEO of the perfumery and cosmetics brand Gellé Frères. The sound is the same from the suppliers’ side where the operators are organizing themselves to meet the new flexibility, agility and reactivity requirements of the market.  For instance, Brivaplast, the Italian specialist of mascaras, eyeliners and lip-gloss packaging, presented its Ready2Go service to meet the consumers’ new flexibility needs. Ready2Go is not a full service offer, but rather a catalogue of formulas developed by partners and previously tested with Brivaplast packaging. Eventually, this year again, the show honoured the most significant innovations from both brands and suppliers, as well as a personality that has marked the industry.  This year, the career Award honoured Jean-Claude Ellena, the famous ""nose"" of the Maison Hermes that attracted new attention to high-end perfumery. Next rendez-vous for the Cosmoprof community: Cosmoprof North America in Las Vegas (from 29 to 31 July), Cosmoprof India in Mumbai (10 and 11 September) and Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong (from 13 to 15 November with Cosmopack Asia and from 14 to 16 November with Cosmoprof Asia)."
Beauty Tech: Augmented reality applications take center stage in brands’ multi-channel strategies,"The gone through road in just a few years is impressive! YouCam’s photo editing and virtual reality suite of applications (YouCam Makeup, YouCam Perfect, YouCam Fun and YouCam Nails) has established itself as the global leader in virtual reality makeup, with more than 550 million downloads [1] and collaborations with the biggest names in beauty: Estée Lauder, Yves Saint Laurent, L’Oréal Paris, MAC Cosmetics or Macy’s, to name a few. ""Last year, we signed a global framework agreement with the L’Oréal Group, which allows all of the Group’s brands to use the Youcam MakeUp app,"" explains Sylvain Delteil, Director Business Development of Business Corp. A resounding success, enabling Perfect Corp, the Taiwanese Company that develops the apps, to raise more than US$ 25 million last October 2017. It cannot be denied that the Company has given itself the means to succeed. The spin-off of Cyberlink, a Company specializing in digital imaging, could rely from its inception, on a team of about 100 developers. YouCam and similar non-specialized platforms (Perfect 365 or, more particularly in China, Meitoo) have thus almost overridden proprietary apps developed by brands, by imposing an ongoing pace of innovation. After having made inroads in skincare, YouCam recently added an extension dedicated to hair colouring to its suite. But most of all, these platforms are now increasingly becoming essential tools to support multichannel strategies. ""At first we operated as a mobile platform for consumers and very quickly, at the request of brands and retailers, we started developing in-store applications. Today we are developing ourselves as a service platform dedicated to brands,"" continues Sylvain Delteil. ""Augmented reality is a convincing tool to win over consumers and facilitate sales, but we are now also offering a Full Service multichannel marketing management."" In practical terms, once the SKUs are loaded on the steering console, made available to them, brands can use them as they wish: YouCam Makeup application, virtual tests on in-store terminals, or even for their own websites or mobiles. Custom developed services can even be added to the platform, especially for the training of sales forces. The console also aggregates all the data collected by the applications on consumer behaviors: number of likes for the brand, number of tests done per SKU, and most of all, data on the saved and/or shared looks. ""The list of solutions currently available to brands is actually quite impressive: YouCam Makeup, in Store Brand Makeup & Skincare Consultation Mode, Exclusive Online Consultation Mode, Webpage Consultation Mode, Beauty Live Training, Live Streaming for Brands, In Store Barcode Try on, and so on,"" explains Sylvain Delteil. Brands can therefore rely on various and efficient tools to test their product in a user-friendly and fun way, train their consultants remotely, or educate their consumers. ""This involves investing a little in some human resources, but then the brand has access to a multiservice platform designed from the outset to meet all the needs of a multi-channel strategy."" In a nutshell, Perfect Corp promises effective results. ""A study we commissioned in Japan [2] with a panel of 25,000 smartphone users showed that YouCam Makeup users are 60% more likely than standard users to buy makeup products. For brands, being present on the app increases by 30% their sales opportunities,"" concludes Sylvain Delteil."
"From the kitchen to the cosmetic counter, food-inspired cosmetics gain popularity in Brazil","Going to a pharmacy and coming across products such as mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, chocolate syrup or creamy vegetable soup might come as a surprise to customers, but it is becoming increasingly common to find cosmetics that seem more like food than beauty products in Brazil. This is not a new trend. Butters, mousses and fruit-based formulas have been part of the beauty routine of thousands of customers for decades. However, this new concept of ’gourmet cosmetics’ goes beyond the textures and ingredients – it also plays an important role in the packaging and branding of the products. “We are seeing more and more food-inspired cosmetics in Brazil with a wide range of textures and appeals. They are products that arouse the curiosity of customers and create a whole new experience when applied to the hair or skin,” says Christine Botto, Marketing Manager for Personal Care at BASF South America. BASF manufacture polymers that allow for different types of textures, meeting the current customer demand for gourmet cosmetics with formulas such as Marshmallow and Fruit Jelly, suitable for skin moisturizers, and Maria Mole (a popular Brazilian dessert), used in curl defining creams. “This trend gained momentum with homemade mixtures that digital influencers began sharing on social networks. As an alternative to salon services, given the country’s harsh economic climate, a huge new movement towards homemade recipes to smooth, moisturize and care for the hair using easily accessible ingredients - including food products - gained strength,” says Andressa Neves, PR and Digital Media Manager at Muriel Cosméticos. The boom in videos showing women how to straighten their hair at home using corn starch inspired Muriel to launch the Alisena product line. Its name, formula and packaging resemble the most popular corn starch brand in Brazil: Maizena. “With mayonnaise it was no different. Even celebrities started promoting the use of mayonnaise to moisturize their hair, making the procedure very popular among women with curly hair”, says Neves. This prompted Muriel to launch the Hair Mayonnaise line, with hair masks made from egg protein and natural oils. However, if these homemade recipes are so successful, why did the industry decide to invest in developing products to recreate them? “Homemade mixtures require a certain amount of work and create a lot of mess, which makes our products a more convenient alternative. Moreover, despite being inspired by food ingredients, all our products are carefully developed using high technology and quality raw materials,” claims Neves. Although these cosmetics look a lot like their food counterparts, she states customers don’t get confused. “The Mayonnaise features an ‘inedible’ sign on its packaging and such products are only available in the cosmetics aisle.” For The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), it’s not as simple as it looks. In a statement to Brazil Beauty News, the health surveillance agency said that “this matter has been addressed by the board and it should be regulated soon.” From shower jelly to ketchup and soy sauce hair masks – there seems to be no limit to the creativity in the Brazilian beauty market.  “The trend should hold up. New homemade recipes are always emerging and spreading widely on social media. There are many ingredients yet to be explored,” concludes Andressa Neves."
Pakistan: Male grooming booms as social media set new beauty standards,"Deeply conservative Pakistan has strict notions of masculinity where men are often expected to be austere and flamboyant styling is to be avoided. But savvy entrepreneurs in urban centres have latched on to a new metrosexual trend: male beauty salons. While women in urban Pakistan have long enjoyed access to the care of beauticians and stylists, expensive facials and mani-pedis for men are becoming more common as disposable incomes in the nation’s swelling middle class grow — per capita income jumped by 6.4 percent in 2017. A vibrant social media culture has also fuelled the desire to be selfie-ready at any time, with influencers like Adnan Malik and Osman Khalid Butt attracting hundreds of thousands of followers online with their fashion-conscious posts. At Tauseeq Haider’s ""Men’s"" salon, customers usually fork out a minimum of 1,400 rupees (US$12.60) for a visit — a far cry from the 200 rupees spent at traditional barber shops. ""Men have equal right to be groomed and times have changed. It’s no more just getting your haircut,"" says Haider. ""Senior citizens, bureaucrats, they don’t feel ashamed of saying that I need a facial, massage, my nails need to be done, please suggest what should I get,"" he adds. In rural Pakistan, men have traditionally taken their fashion tips from Islamic dictates, with the Koran specifying the length of beard and moustache along with hygiene guidelines. And in the cities, Bollywood and Western entertainment have long driven fashion trends for conscientious groomers.  But times are changing fast in the rapidly developing South Asian nation, with social media setting and wrecking trends in urban centres at the speed of a swipe. According to Lebanese salon owner Michael Kanaan, who has been based in Pakistan for more than a decade, rising wages and greater exposure to global culture is fanning the burgeoning demand. ""The Pakistan male is becoming more metrosexual. It is all due to the internet and the age of satellites and TVs,"" says Kanaan. Economist Minhajul Haque agrees, saying Pakistani men are also subjected to a new slew of online advertising campaigns that have reinforced the trend. ""There is this whole lot of clever marketing of male beauty products which is spurring demand,"" he explains. Humayun Khan, 49, says he is fine with spending more money to look good and his wife is supportive of the new passion.  ""I... get my nails done, get my haircut, get my facial and I am done for the day and after two weeks I come again,"" he says.  ""If I don’t look good, my wife wouldn’t like me,"" he laughs. Stylist Ghulfam Ghori says Pakistani men are also now more concerned with skincare, opting for blackhead removal, acne treatments and even the occasional brush with makeup before major events like weddings. ""Men are very conscious about their skin now... and consider it essential to get facials. Previously it was not common, but now the trend is increasing among men to get themselves groomed,"" says Ghori. But it’s not just the salons that are cashing in on Pakistani men’s blossoming cosmopolitan predilections. Zafar Bakhtawari, chairman of the D. Watson Group, one of Pakistan’s biggest pharmacy chains, explains: ""I can say there is a revolution coming up in Pakistan in the male psyche that they are becoming very much conscious about their beauty, about their face, about their hair, about their dress and it’s a great revolution."""
France: Exports of perfumes and cosmetics drive industry growth,"Exports of French perfumes and cosmetics broke a new record in 2017, passing the 13 billion euro mark (13.6 billion euros according to figures published by FEBEA, up +12% compared to 2016). While the French domestic market is struggling with low sales, the dynamism of exports drives the growth of the French industry in a sector boasting a trade surplus of 10.5 billion euros (up +14% compared to 2016). ""The 2017 figures confirm France’s leading position in the international market. It is heartening to see that, thanks to their good reputation, French cosmetics that are still appealing to foreign consumers,"" said Patrick O’Quin, President of the FEBEA. In the mature European Union market, growth of French exports remained strong with a rise of 6.2%.  The growth was driven by Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain, four countries remaining in the top 5 of France exports. Exports to Asia are skyrocketing, with a 25% year-on-year and growth. Sales to China and Singapore even grew by more than 30%. Exports towards the continent returned to growth after flat figures in 2015 and a timid recovery (+9%) in 2016. Now, 20% of French beauty and personal care exports are shipped to Asia, representing more than 2.6 billion euros. North America is another growth booster.  French exports to the region increased by +19% last year, including a +20% increase in sales to the United States. Exports to the Middle East have increased by +13.1% o, driven by UAE and Saudi Arabia. Eventually, North Africa was the only zone to record a decline in 2017, with exports down by -14%, despite a recovery in Egypt (+17%). The good export figures of perfumes and cosmetics are exception in the context of a French trade balance that showed a global deficit of 62.3 billion euros in 2017. ""There is a real impact of the French know-how in cosmetics perfumes. These products are part of the French way of life. For many years, French companies have demonstrated their ability to address the demands of global markets, in all segments, not just for premium products. For a long time, French companies in the personal care and cosmetics sectors have been thinking globally and have adapted themselves in order to offer attractive products to the whole world,"" explains Patrick O’Quin. Skin care and fragrances still account for three quarters of French cosmetics exports (44.3% for care and 31% for perfumes), but the make-up category has shown a real dynamism in 2017, with exports up +28% for lip products, +14.5% for eye products and +25% for makeup powders. According to Patrick O’Quin, the growth French exports is at least equivalent to those of its main competitors, in particular the United States and Italy. However, according to the FEBEA President, there is a strong progression of Korea, which is now exporting beyond the Asian continent.  Brazil is also emerging as a new major player, driven by the natural trend. But for the moment, France is brilliantly facing competition!"
Tradeshows: MakeUp & Luxe Pack take the beauty industry by storm in Los Angeles,"Taking advantage of the momentum initiated three years ago by of MakeUp in LosAngeles, the first edition of Luxe Pack in Los Angeles was held last week at the Barker Hangar, jointly to the MakeUp in trade show. The result: Two complementary two-day events dedicated to the premium and beauty sectors that have welcomed more than 3,900 visitors, according to the organizers.  An impressive progression compared to the 1,650 visitors announced last year for the MakeUp in event alone. “It was difficult at certain hours of the day to make your way in the crowded aisles ..., very difficult also to try meeting without any appointment exhibitors often overwhelmed by requests..., and certainly easier to see the satisfaction on the faces of all participants,” commented the organisers. The simultaneity of the two events widened the range of solutions proposed to visitors. As usual, MakeUp in LosAngeles has gathered some of the leading global makeup subcontractors - ranging from colour cosmetics formulators to suppliers of make-up packaging and accessories.  In total: more than 80 exhibitors, more than double last year.  The Luxe Pack section added about fifty exhibitors from the luxury packaging sector (perfumes, skincare, spirits ...). The interest of makeup brands for full-service solutions was cleraly confirmed on the show-floor. Fusion Packaging, for instance, presented Accelerate by Fusion Packaging, a turnkey solutions package launched last year at Cosmoprof North America in Las Vegas. “Turnkey solutions are in big demand,” said Kelly Kopa, Head of Marketing at Fusion Packaging.  “We we have our own in house R&D team and we develop the formulas with partner laboratories.  It’s a way to be sure packaging matches with formula and to accelerate time to market.” The evolution has been similar at Roberts Beauty. In just a few years, the company evolved from being a makeup packaging supplier to being a provider of full and customized solutions. Albéa, for its part, presented the Black Box concept, a smart selection of packaging, formulas and trendy accessories from Albéa Beauty Solutions, the group’s turnkey solution offering, specially design for brands seeking to launch their products on the beauty market without delay.  The first edition of Albéa’s Black Box groups together a selection of accessories and packs with artistic and musical inspirations. Following the same way towards more service and innovation,Canada’s KDC presented its new identity KDC/One.  The new branding has been designed to unify the offering of the group’s ten production sites around one single innovation centre, which will open its doors next June in New Jersey. However, we should remember this warning from Aïmara Coupet, who presented Asquan’s first steps in turnkey makeup solutions: ""Full-service is not just putting a formula into a packaging. It requires a real concept with a story and a product ready to put on the market."" The next edition is announced to take place next year, at the same dates in the same place."
CosmeTokyo rides the J-Beauty wave: The next big beauty trend?,"From 24 to 26th January, CosmeTokyo gathered beauty industry professionals on its 8th edition at a new venue, the Makhuari Messe exhibitions centre. The trade show hosted a new area this year with Inner Beauty Tokyo dedicated to beauty and health foods.  As usual, the event was held in conjunction with CosmeTech - an exhibition focusing on suppliers of the beauty industry (ranging from ingredients and formulation to pack and services, when CosmeTokyo is devoted to finished products. Gathered under the “Beauty and Health Week Tokyo” umbrella, the events gathered 709 exhibitors from 30 countries (including 33% international companies) and 22,114 visitors with international visitors mainly coming from South East Asia (China, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.) but also from middle east. To support the growing trend for the Asia-made products with consumers, the organizers invited 100 social influencers and micro influencers to create a Beauty Buzz Talk around the show. “Marketing is as much important with micro influencers as with the other target consumers … We have to be present on social networks to support our exhibitors,” says Megumi Yanai, International Sales Director. Japan’s taste for High Tech was confirmed at this year’s show with a number of stem cell-based beauty brands as well as nano ingredients or hydrogen water, and also an eclectic presence of beauty devices with ion technology or hydrogen-rich water diffusor for anti-ageing benefits. In the same time, the boom of natural/organic beauty products in Japan was confirmed through a wide section of the show dedicated to a greened offer.  The section also included products with traditional Japanese ingredients (soybean, seaweed, black yeast, etc.) and also local brands with organic cocoa, water from Mont Fuji or organic avocado or olive oil. Confirming Japan’s ancestral know-how in the sector, the show also hosted manufacturers of traditional brushes were present (Chikuho-do, or Koyudo to name a few). To help international businesses, the organizers of CosmeTokyo offered workshops and online webinars to help navigate the Japanese market and understand the local customs.  They also held an international buyers’ program with a matchmaking service setting up over 500 meetings with buyers and exhibitors. All these actions certainly contributed to a general feeling among exhibitors that this edition of the show was marked by an increased internationalization. The Japanese market is opening up recently and CosmeTokyo reinforces the idea with more exhibitors from the international scene but also visitors coming from Middle East, Russia, Europe or America. The market is quickly evolving and beauty products are no longer limited to a category of people. Make-up has attracted younger consumers for a while and the spending power of Japanese women has increased which has opened to market to foreign brands. Imports have increased in the recent years with the example of the success of specialised retailers such as CosmeKitchen or @Cosme sourcing Japanese but also international beauty brands … Mixing tradition and modernism and renowned for their uncompromising attitude towards quality, Japanese beauty products are a strong competitor of South Korea, which have been flying high recently. They offer the perfect mix of performing products and strong cultural codes, thus addressing the quest for authenticity of increasingly sophisticated Asian consumers. So, watch out for Japanese brands!"
U.S.A: Sales of prestige beauty brands rise 6 percent in 2017,"The U.S. prestige beauty industry reached USD 17.7 billion in 2017, a 6 percent increase over 2016, according to market research firm The NPD Group. At the forefront, the skincare category grew its sales by 9 percent and contributed 45 percent of the industry’s total gains; makeup followed with a 6 percent increase in sales, and fragrance closed the year up 4 percent. [1] After several years of soft performance, skincare was revitalized in 2017. Reaching USD 5.6 billion in sales, growth has stemmed from smaller segments including masks (+32 percent), facial exfoliators (+12 percent) and cleansers (+6 percent), and other face products (+39 percent) which, among other items, includes emerging formats, essences, and facial sprays. Larger segments such as facial moisturizers (+7 percent), skincare’s largest by dollar volume, and age specialists (+7 percent) also fared well in 2017. The body, sun, and hair care segments of skincare all experienced growth as well. Though makeup’s growth rate slowed in 2017, it remains beauty’s largest category, bringing the most dollar volume to the industry and USD 8.1 billion in 2017. Growth was driven by high volume segments including foundation (+7 percent) and eye shadow (+13 percent), as well as other face products such as bronzers, highlighters, and glow products. Sales were also positive for other key segments like face primers (+17 percent), concealer (+10 percent), eye brow makeup (+7 percent), and lip colour (+2 percent). In fragrance, where sales totalled USD 4.0 billion in 2017, juices grew by 4 percent. Niche areas of the market including natural and artisanal fragrances grew their sales by 32 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Beyond the body, the home scents market is booming. It has added USD 44.4 million in sales since 2014. Sales reached $80.4 million in 2017, up 59 percent. This is building off of 18 percent growth the segment saw in 2016. Growth drivers for the market in 2017 included candles (+56 percent) and the smaller segment of home ancillary gift sets (+165 percent) which include candle and reed diffuser gift sets. The prestige beauty industry had a good fourth quarter in 2017, with sales consistently strong throughout the holiday season. Across the industries tracked weekly by NPD throughout the season, beauty was the growth leader during various weeks including Thanksgiving/Black Friday week. Some of its hottest holiday sellers were false eyelashes, lip gloss, skincare sets and kits, and home ancillary gift sets. Overall, fragrance juices brought in the most dollars for the entire holiday season driven entirely by Christmas week, followed by makeup and skincare face products, which showed consistent growth throughout the holiday season. “As beauty brands and retailers look to understand ‘what’s next’ to keep the momentum going, their focus should be on developing new and alternative ways to engage with consumers. Amidst the news headlines around store closures and challenges facing traditional department stores, it’s important to remember that brick-and-mortar is a critical component to driving growth,” said Larissa Jensen, executive director and beauty industry analyst at The NPD Group. “We’re seeing more brands enhance their in-store interaction with consumers through pop-up, pop-in, and other experience stores, and we expect this will accelerate in this new year.”"
On-the-go skincare formats make a splash with US women,"Whether throwing it in a gym bag or using during the commute, travel-friendly skincare formats are making a splash with US women, reveals Mintel.  According to one the firm’s latest research [1], the skincare formats that US female skincare users are most likely to have tried or are interested in trying include on-the-go products, such as exfoliating wipes (81 percent), waterless facial cleansers (69 percent) and sunscreen sticks (68 percent). As value remains a top priority when it comes to skincare routines, consumers are willing to pay more for products that give them the best bang for their buck. Three in 10 female skincare users are willing to pay more for products with built-in applicators, dual packaging, i.e. contains multiple products (30 percent) or that are refillable (29 percent). “Consumer focus on health and wellness is inspiring a burgeoning trend in beauty with innovative, on-the-go formats. In addition to wanting skincare that satisfies their specific needs, convenience enables skincare consumers to streamline their routines, a benefit they are willing to spend for. Brands that offer quick and easy-to-use formats that make the most out of beauty routines while traveling, such as waterless facial cleansers and portable sunscreen sticks, will do well with consumers as they seek out more convenient products,” said Alison Gaither, Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Furthermore, as the line between facial makeup and facial skincare blurs and skincare staples address multiple concerns, specialty skincare products are being put back on the shelves. Mintel research [2] shows that sales of facial anti-aging products (16 percent market share) are estimated to decline 3 percent in 2017 to reach US $1.8 billion, while acne treatments (8 percent market share) are estimated to decline 1.5 percent to reach US $9.1 million. While demanding high value multifunctional products, US women also favour the most simple and easy-to-use products.  According to Mintel, “when it comes to purchasing skincare products, back to basics is best as simple usage instructions (58 percent) and short ingredient lists (53 percent) rank as the most important packaging features for female skincare users.”  This is especially true among older women as those aged 55+ are more likely than their younger counterparts to prioritize simple usage instructions (66 percent vs 46 percent of 18-34s) and short ingredient lists (58 percent vs 49 percent of 18-34s). Formulating skincare products with natural ingredients is also a good way to help them standing out from the mass.  For instance, more than two in five skincare users are interested in skincare products that contain clay (42 percent) or apple cider vinegar (41 percent). “The familiarity of food-based ingredients in skincare is appealing to consumers who want to understand what exactly is in the products they use,” continued Gaither. Mintel also noted a growing interest for the skincare benefits of probiotics (38 percent of female skincare consumers).  This interest is reflected in new product development in recent years, as the use of the probiotic Lactobacillus in skincare products in the US grew 98 percent from 2013-17. “The skincare market is highly saturated, and brands are challenged by consumer demand for simplicity, as well as routine shopping behaviour which is limiting product trial. Focusing on unique offerings to capture the attention of consumers, such as Korean skincare trends and on-the-go formats, could nurture category growth. Eco-ethical claims will also continue to rise, and familiar, food-inspired ingredients such as apple cider vinegar and Manuka honey will support the natural trend. The movement to embrace aging will continue to give multi-benefit products an advantage over specialty products, while no-rinse options, such as micellar waters, will encourage consumers to use a larger repertoire of cleansing products, further boosting segment growth,” concluded Gaither."
Sales of prestige beauty products up 4% in the UK,"Sales of luxury beauty products in the UK reported an increase of 4% in 2017, hitting the £3 billion mark (EUR 3.4 billion), unveiled The NPD Group.  According to the market research firm, the growth was largely driven by strong performance in fragrance, make-up and skincare and by the interest from overseas shoppers. “The growth we have seen in the UK prestige beauty market is impressive, given the uncertainty with Brexit and the weak pound. British customers continue to purchase prestige beauty with great passion, and we also believe that an increase in global shoppers is a contributing factor to this growth, especially in super premium skincare and fragrance,” commented Helen Duxbury, Senior Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. The prestige fragrance market was valued at £1 billion in 2017. Fragrance ended the year with a solid performance, increasing 3%, with both classic and new launches contributing to this growth. Consumers continue to choose juices over gift sets with the sale of gift sets remaining flat in 2017, with juices growing 4%. Skincare grew 6% in 2017 and this growth has been driven by classic and super premium brands. Although small at present, natural and vegan brands are demonstrating their importance to the skincare market’s growth. As far as make-up are concerned, sales increased by 6% compared to last year, but this slowed from the double-digit growth of 10% reported in 2016. Within the make-up sector, foundation and lip colour remain the star performing categories reporting healthy growth throughout 2017. “From the figures we have seen in 2017 there is a definite boom in the prestige beauty market. Make-up and super premium skincare are a real attraction for overseas visitors as they include many designer brands. Retailers confirm they have seen an increase in global shoppers in store. Whilst the weak pound confirms our thoughts that the global shopper is boosting the prestige beauty market, UK shoppers continue their love affair with prestige beauty in all categories,” concluded Helen Duxbury."
Shanghai and Seoul: A winning duo for the MakeUp In shows in Asia?,"Premium Beauty News - ""MakeUp In"" is a concept that adapts to the diversity of markets and cultures in Asia! Adriana Rodriguez - That’s true! It’s not only to be able to adapt, but it mostly about doing it quickly! Seoul remains one of the most important spot in Asia when it comes to Fashion and Beauty but meanwhile China continues to develop its domestic market for cosmetics. New Brands are growing fast. Chinese women are more and more adepts of make-up. China is ""finally"" becoming this great beauty market coveted by the entire industrial world. Requirements and needs are very different in Korea and in China. The first country has reached an unprecedented level of quality, challenging its Japanese neighbour but the second country is catching up. Premium Beauty News - Which explains why you chose to be present for the first time both in Seoul and Shanghai? Adriana Rodriguez - Yes and for a simple reason... Some of our exhibitors - who follow us around the world, often three or four times a year -, wanted to stay in Seoul while others were more tempted to enter the Chinese market. If you recall, the creators of MakeUp In trade shows, Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, had already expressed themselves on this point a few months ago: with their size, specificity, excellence and exclusivity the concept of these events suits this international network particularly well. And given the diversity and economic weight of major countries like Korea, China and..., undoubtedly one day Japan, it was only logical for us to be present the same year on these different theatres of operation. Regarding Shanghai, the opportunity was all the more interesting given the fact we now belong to the InfoPro Group, the organizer of Luxe Pack Shanghai, a event with a ten-year proven track record in Shanghai, which gives even more assets to this first MakeUp in Shanghai. Premium Beauty News - You said exhibitors were not the same? Adriana Rodriguez - Not quite! But for these two events, we have the confidence of the biggest subcontractors in the make-up sector at MakeUp in Shanghai (where we are with Luxe Pack Shanghai) and at MakeUp in Seoul with companies like Intercos, Cosmax, Strand Cosmetics Europe, LF Beauty, BKolorMakeUp, FS Korea, Weckerle Cosmetics, Nippon Shikizai, Kolmar, Geka, MS Swiss Cosmetics, Zignago Vetro, Pennelifaro, Baralan, Elcos, Libo Cosmetics, Arcade Beauty, Du Pont de Nemours, C & C International, Bormioli Luigi, Eisen, Anomatic, Yonwoo, Toly, Schwan Cosmetics, Regi, Hana, Fiabila, Coson, Cosmecca, Albéa, Englewood, Bonne, Chemicos, SGD Asia, Sleever etc. Premium Beauty News - It is often said that Asian people prefer ""big events"" to the expense of smaller targeted events! Adriana Rodriguez - That’s not true! A proof is the number of Asian companies exhibiting at MakeUp in Paris, MakeUp in New York and, now, MakeUp in Los Angeles. Many of them prefer our targeted events with no loss of visitors. They understood that our events bring together the top of of make-up leaders in the world. ""Quality"" before ""Quantity""! We met so many of these exhibitors complaining about these big events where they were lost in the middle of nowhere and meeting uninteresting visitors during long endless days. ""Quality"" also means the service offered. A Premium service where everything is included...: the booth, the furniture, the participation to conferences, the meals, the coffees etc. We have definitely banned impersonal and cold venues to organize our events in upscale and fashionable places! Premium Beauty News - You are certainly the trade shows organizer who created the biggest number of planetary events in such a short time! Adriana Rodriguez - The credit should go to the Beauteam team that I joined a few months ago! But it was indeed a perfect bet! Figures are there to prove it. In total each year, our events bring together 400 exhibitors, 12,000 visitors, 58% of whom are top Managers / Marketers, which is quite a performance when you think about it. In nine years, the team organized no less than 29 trade shows! A winning concept that is now conquering Asia!  So, see you in April in Shanghai and then in Seoul."
Are these the beauty trends that will dominate in 2018?,"The social media platform has shared its trend predictions for the coming year based on the activity of its 48 million beauty ‘Pinners’, and, when it comes to beauty, there are a few surprises in store. Facial rollers are set to be big business, with ‘pins’ for the ‘derma roller’ skincare tool up by 345% in the last year, despite controversies regarding this somewhat aggressive instrument. Jade, quartz, and even ice rollers are also set to increase in popularity. Another skincare trend prediction is oil, with saves for ’cleansing oil’ up by 555% over the past 12 months. When it comes to makeup, it looks like eyelashes will be getting their moment in the spotlight, while graphic nail design will also remain popular, particularly geometric designs. In keeping with the beauty looks seen on the catwalk during the Spring/Summer 2018 fashion shows, bright, vibrant eye makeup will also be on trend, judging by a 63% increase in searches for ‘bright eyeshadow’. Another major trend will see consumers embracing the increasingly wide range of foundation shades available on the cosmetics market, with ‘complexion matching’ saves up by 378%. The trendiest beauty followers will be wearing their hair slicked back or wavy, if the 166% increase in searches for both of those terms is to be trusted. Wet-look, slicked back hair has been a major catwalk and red-carpet beauty trend for the fashion world throughout 2017, but only time will tell whether or not the concept makes it to everyday life. However, it seems that another celebrity hair trend from this year might be about to die — saves for ‘long hair’ and ‘pixie’ were up by 130%, suggesting that the bob has had its 15 minutes of fame for now.

Kline reveals beauty’s cyber month winners,"The results for November - also known as Cyber Month - have just been posted in Amalgam [1], Kline’s digital tracking service. As it is a big month for online gift purchases, we naturally saw many gift sets moving up the ranks. Here are the top scoring items in the makeup kits category: Topping the list is Physicians Formula Shimmer Strips Custom Eye Enhancing Kit, which moved up 36 spots in makeup overall. This item is consistently among Amazon’s top sellers in eye makeup. Several Birchbox exclusives are among the top scored items, including Arrow 5 Minute Beauty Kit and The Maid Up & Ready Kit, its curated collection of items from such brands as Jouer, Benefit, and Livingproof. Too Faced Boss Lady Beauty Agenda, a limited-edition Sephora exclusive, debuted in Amalgam in October, securing the #13 spot in the category. In November, it jumped to the #3 slot. Tarte Limited-Edition Treasure Box Collector’s Set, another Sephora exclusive that debuted on our charts in October, shares the #3 spot.

The nail product industry on track for growth,"The global nail polish market is set to grow at a compound annual rate of 9.5% to reach a value of US $15.55 billion by 2024, a new report by Research and Markets alleges. The report attributes the forecasted surge in demand to the increasing numbers of young beauty fans investing in nail designs, as well as innovation in terms of textures and effects.  The number of professional salons providing nail care services is also on the increase, making it easier than ever to invest in manicure and nail treatments, while collaborations between manufacturers and salons are also expected to have a positive impact on market growth. When it comes to choosing polishes, gel formulas are performing well, accounting for 10.1% of nail polish sales in 2015. A demand for long-lasting nail colours is predicted to fuel further growth in the near future. Meanwhile, the liquid polish market is set to grow at a yearly rate of 9.4% from 2016 to 2024, due to affordability and the vast range of colours available. Geographically, Europe remains one of the biggest markets, with Latin America pegged to drive growth in the nail industry over the coming years, due to the rising trend for long and polished nails and nail art among young women and increasing disposable income among consumers. A slew of recent high-profile collaborations between manicure brands and the fashion and entertainment world could also be contributing to the fact that nail products are hotter than ever. Earlier this month, designer Christian Siriano teamed up with manicure brand ImPress to create a limited edition press-on nail collection that comprises seven different designs, all inspired by the creative’s luxury fashion pieces, while Emmy-nominated actress Laverne Cox launched a limited-edition collection of polishes back in September, in partnership with Orly Nails."
Men are changing their attitudes regarding beauty treatments,"Almost half (47%) of young men in the UK have enjoyed a spa, in-store or beauty salon treatment in the past 12 months, according to new research from market intelligence agency Mintel - a marked increase from 2015, when the number was just 33%. [1] The most popular treatments appear to be massages, which 18% of men aged 16-24 polled had partaken in, and facial hair removal or shaping, which also attracted 18% of participants. Meanwhile, 17% had visited the spa for body hair removal. The mental benefits of beauty and grooming treatments were cited as one of the main reasons behind the trend, with 76% of those who had visited a spa or salon over the last 12 months saying that it helped to promote their mental well-being. Sixty-four percent said that such appointments were an important part of their health routine. Overall, 36% of the men had booked their last appointment as a treat for themselves, while 20% did so for a special occasion and 19% said it was a regular grooming appointment. ""The high proportion of men showing engagement in spa and salon treatments highlights that consumers are moving away from gender stereotypes while embracing gender neutrality,"" said Roshida Khanom, Associate Director, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel, in a statement. The findings are in line with the general shift in attitudes regarding the topic of male beauty, and it isn’t just in the UK that men are upping their grooming game. Back in August, the ’Dove Men+Care 2017 Men’s Hair Census’ found that men take their hair very seriously indeed, with eight out of 10 men in the US seeing their crowning glory as a reflection of their personal style, and as something that helps them look both masculine and professional. Brands are increasingly tapping into the trend for male self-care with multiple new product lines aimed at men, with Clinique’s Sonic System Deep Cleansing Brush, brewery Carlsberg’s shampoo, conditioner and body lotion trio, and Dove Men+Care’s beauty bars just some of the high-profile launches that have helped drive the market over the last few years. Meanwhile, the news can only be a good thing for the beauty industry - UK consumers are estimated to spend £7.6 billion (approximately US $10.1 billion) on treatments in spa, salons and in-store treatment areas in 2017, surpassing £8 billion (approximately US $10.7 billion) by 2021."
Skyrocketing indie brands are reinventing the beauty market,"""In the digital era, make-up brands have been confronted with a paradigm shift,"" said Nicolas Cordier, CEO of Make Up For Ever in a speech at the inauguration of Strand Cosmetics Europe’s new production site. ""These new brands have successfully established a more direct link with consumers, and the revolution continues with the rise of DTC Brands – such as Kylie Cosmetics - which sell directly and only to consumers."" Newly-launched brands, such as Kylie Cosmetics and Huda Beauty, gain momentum by recording triple-digit and quadruple-digit growth rates, confirms market research firm Kline in the recently published second edition of the Beauty’s Most Buyable Brands: Analysis of Booming Independent Brands in the United States report.  Indeed, Kylie Cosmetics is expected to make more than US$ 400 million in sales only through its website. Brands focusing on makeup, such as ColourPop, Gerard Cosmetics, and Dose of Colors, lead the rankings of social popularity due to the aesthetically-pleasing content they provide and their unique product offerings.  However, indies make waves across various categories from natural concepts from Tata Harper and Coola Suncare, to male grooming provided by Brickell and Bevel, to gender-free makeup provided by Milk Makeup. “Millennials and Generation Z are a crucial marketing demographic for the indies,” comments Naira Aslanian, Project Manager at Kline. “These innovators resonate with experimental consumers who are searching for the next best product or ingredient to bring out their individualism and uniqueness. With so many choices out there, the tech-savvy generations look for tutorials, tips, and reviews to help them make decisions about trends, brands, and even ingredients. Indies’ digital prowess, combined with the fine-tuned focus from beauty products that cater to consumers’ personalized needs, results in some of them growing three to five times the rate of the market.” To build close connections with their consumers, these brands utilize innovative and often low cost strategies.  For instance, they transform their admirers into stars: Say Hello To Sexy Legs regularly reposts content from its fans who feature its products in photos. Some go as far as asking consumers to create products alongside the company, such as ColourPop, which virtually invites millions of fans into its lab as product development specialists to inspire the creation of new products. Several trend-setting retailers, including Sephora, Ulta, Bluemercury, Target, and Urban Outfitters, take notice of the heightened consumer interest and give these brands a louder voice and broader reach by bringing them to their shelves and websites. In 2016, a brand like Say Hello To Sexy Legs launched in the market and entered QVC and Sephora in the same year. According to Kline, these disruptors are expected to continue innovating with their products, packaging, and design, appealing to the generations that are open and receptive to new ideas and concepts. While they innovate, they are expected to remain the targets of growth-seeking beauty giants."
Aptar unveils the secrets of perfume routine in Brazil,"In Brazil, the relationship with perfume is influenced by the climate, among others. “It is very hot in most regions, in particular in the North, and this has an impact on perfume conception. All Brazilians pay particular attention to the perception of being clean and fresh,” explains Carla Amado. She describes an almost ancestral cultural behaviour inherited from the indigenous populations that would have a bath four or five times a day, and then adopted by the Portuguese. “Today, people still have a bath or shower two to three times a day, mainly in the north-eastern part of the country. All across the country, it is cultural to be clean, fresh, and smell good despite the heat. It not only has an impact on the perfume market, but also on deodorants, soap, body milk, oils, shampoos…” she explains. Given this climate, most Brazilians turn to fresh fragrances and light perfumes like eaux de toilette or Eaux de Cologne, which they regularly reapply throughout the day. “It is in Brazil and the Middle East that the frequency of perfume application is the highest, compared to the rest of the world. For example, in France, people put on perfume once or twice a day on average, whereas in Brazil, they do it three to four times a day, at least,” adds Sabine Bouillet-Lubot. Perfume application is very specific: it is always done with the hands. “In the North-East, in particular, Brazilians put Eau de Cologne in their hands, and then they spread it on their bodies, necks, torsos, hair, and arms. No other culture involves applying perfume mainly with the hands,” claims Carla Amado. In the Ritual Codex, this gesture is named Hakaressing. It corresponds to a succession of manly slaps on the body, the forearms, or the torso, in a regular, ritualized rhythm. “This routine helps feel fresh, but it also stimulates self-confidence,” reveals Carla Amado. In Brazil, perfume application starts as soon as early childhood, through manual contact. The mother usually shares her Eau de Cologne with her children and rubs their bodies with it. In the Codex, this gesture is called frescanizing: apply a fragrance by friction with vigour and freshness, with the hands, as an expression of tender loving when done onto someone else. Although this very cultural tradition is deeply anchored in the culture and still widespread, today, Brazilian consumers prefer sprays for their convenience and more even product distribution. As a result, Aptar’s strategy consists in offering solutions adapted to everyone’s practices. As regards Brazilian consumers, who like putting on perfume all over their bodies in quite a sensorial manner, Aptar suggests two complementary solutions: – The Essencia Colonia spray, a system screwed on the bottle so the user can remove it if they want to, in order to get back to the traditional gesture
– The Precious spray, a “longtime” spray which covers the whole body with a mist effect and has the advantage of providing a more generous dose every time the valve is activated for an easier perfume application on the whole body, for those interested “In the long run, the spray is likely to completely replace manual application. We can feel this need on the market, as we saw it on European markets before. We tested both solutions in Brazil, and they were both immediately successful, because they are perfectly adapted to the traditional gesture. So, we have come up with two answers, Essencia Colonia, an accessible product, and Precious, for a more premium market,” explains Sabine Bouillet-Lubot. The second market change might come from the interest in the more concentrated perfumes developed by global brands, but also major local brands well-established on this segment. The gesture will be impacted and might evolve towards a more targeted and accurate application, like that described by Scentango in the Codex. Aptar already offers several solutions to this gesture."
Cosmoprof Asia 2017: Five key trends of the Asian beauty market,"Tradition and nature Sustainable, natural and organic beauty was a big trend at Cosmoprof Asia 2017 with a brand-new hall dedicated to Natural & Organic brands. Consumer demand for natural cosmetics is growing strongly in the Asia Pacific region. Many of the numerous Australian and New Zealand brands exhibiting at Cosmoprof Asia build on naturalness as a key factor of success, particularly in the baby care, sun care and skin care segments. Thai exhibitors are trying to play the same game.. In China, in a context of fast industrialization and urbanization, but also because of the succession of health scandals, the interest in natural products - which are perceived as healthier - is coupled with a certain nostalgia vis-à-vis ancestral wisdom thus benefiting to products claiming inspiration from the traditional Chinese medicine and / or pharmacopoeia. Let’s also note that the development of hallal beauty products in the region is partially linked to the search for products perceived as more natural, haowever the weight of Muslim countries - such as Indonesia - also contributes to the development of this offer. Masks According to a recent Mintel research, Asia Pacific accounted for 76% of all global sheet mask launches in 2016, followed by Europe (16%) and the US (8%).  The product is now a frequent feature in many consumers’ skincare routine. At Cosmoprof Asia, beauty masks were everywhere and of every type (hydrogel, sheet mask, bio cellulose, fil patch). The Korean brand The Oozoo, for instance, showcased its new Fresh Capsule Masks, which keep the sensitive active ingredients in an airtight capsule protecting their integrity until consumer use.  Beauty masks are available to address the need of any specific area of the face (nose, chin, cheeks, eyes, lips).  The men’s masks offering, especially from Korean brands, is also growing fastly. Prestige brands Their desire for “flawless skin” led Asian women to grow as the world’s best “self-educating” consumers, believing in product efficacy and the importance of investing in skin care and beauty products.  According to Euromonitor International, this resulted in the skin care routine expansion in the region, with the number of items reaching to as many as 10 and boosted the premium skin care segment. In China, this trend has largely benefited to prestige brands imported from Japan, Korea, France or the United States.  The trend has been amplified by the importance of e-commerce which has facilitated the access to products. Urban pollution Since the beginning of the 2010s, the number of skincare products with anti-pollution claims has augmented constantly in Asia, where the trend emerged before spreading all around the world. “Consumers are increasingly in search of healthier, happier and more balanced lives. They want antidotes to urban congestion and environmental pollution, and greener, more people-friendly cities,” said Matthew Crabbe, Director of Research, Asia Pacific at Mintel. Men’s competition The importance of the men’s health care market is another eye-catcher when visiting a show such as Cosmoprof Asia. According to a recent survey by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, 63 per cent of Chinese male beauty consumers report using cleansing milk, lotion or face cream.  Demographic data also show that the one-child policy combined with the preference of Chinese parents for boys has led to the birth of 25 to 30 million more men than women in the last 30 years. Many Chinese men will never get married!  The consequence is an increased attention of men to their appearance.  For other reasons (the length of military service delaying entry into the labour market) the same phenomenon is observed in Korea. The next edition of Cosmoprof Asia will take place from 13 to 15 November 2018 with Cosmopack Asia at AsiaWorld-Expo and from 14 to 16 November 2018 at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre."
"Nature, inclusivity, personality and customization set to drive the beauty industry next year","The importance of environmental issues, the interest of consumers in broader definitions of beauty - beyond age, gender, and body type - and their search for strong ethical behaviours, and customization opportunities opened by digital technologies, will be the major forces set to influence the beauty and personal care sector worldwide in 2018, according to Mintel. With evolving consumer demands and climatic changes around the world, the beauty and personal care industry’s approach to natural and sustainable ingredients must adapt.  According to Mintel, advances in biotechnologies will help brands to address these challenges. “In the coming year, the possibilities for creating safe, allergen-free, pure, and efficacious ingredients through science could replace the harvesting of natural ingredients,” stresses Sarah Jindal, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst, Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. The move to become more ’local’ will also create opportunities. According to Mintel, local sourcing and production of ingredients will become essential in the years ahead. “Brands will stop targeting consumers based on their age, gender, or body type as consumers increasingly demand personalized beauty defined on their terms,” states Sarah Jindal. Perceptions of beauty based on age, gender, skin, hair, and body type are changing as today’s consumers take control of how beauty is defined.  “In 2018 and beyond, beauty consumers will demand that their individual needs are answered with options or customizable beauty. Brands will embrace inclusivity and address individual beauty concerns which will result in more customization and personalization of products.” “Simply selling a great beauty product will no longer be enough; brands must have personality and purpose that align with consumers’ own beliefs in order to win them over,” explains Sarah Jindal. The onus is now on brands to impress consumers with a human-like personality that’s relatable, personable, and sincere.  According to Mintel, in 2018 and beyond, educational projects, and environmental and ethical issues will be at the forefront. Digital technology will make shopping more personal in 2018. Beauty brands will be watching consumers’ every move, as digital technology drives unprecedented customization of the shopping experience. ""Mintel predicts that the beauty and personal care market will experience a fundamental shift during 2018,” concludes Sarah Jindal."
Asia Pacific drives the beauty sheet masks global market,"When considering which Asian market is the most innovative, according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD) most of these launches came from the North Asian region, with China accounting for 28% of all global sheet mask introductions, followed by Taiwan (12%), South Korea (10%), Hong Kong (7%) and Japan (6%).  Meanwhile, data from Mintel Market Sizes (MMS) found that China and Japan are currently among the world’s largest facial care markets, estimated to reach a retail market value of US$15.8 billion and US$13.5 billion respectively in 2017. Rounding out the top three facial care markets is South Korea, with a retail market value that is expected to hit US$6.6 billion in 2017. The product is now a frequent feature in many consumers’ skincare routine. Three in four (75%) consumers in China use sleep masks in the evening; while 69% use sheet masks at the same time of day. Additionally, over half (53%) agree that facial masks are the best first-aid skincare products and three in five (59%) Chinese women aged 30-39 say they feel happy after using a sheet mask. Furthermore, two in five (40%) Thai women have used a face mask in the last 12 months. Despite growing popularity in Asia, it appears that European and American consumers are lagging behind in usage. Mintel research shows that just 12% of women in the UK have used a sheet or leave-on mask in the last 12 months [1]. Meanwhile, in the US, just 8% of consumers use facial masks as part of their evening routine and 29% use facial masks on an ‘as-needed’ basis. Furthermore, Mintel data shows that around one in 10 women in France (10%), Germany (10%) and Spain (8%) have used sheet masks in the last 12 months. However, it does seem that there is appetite for sheet mask innovation in the UK moving forward. Over a third (35%) of UK consumers aged 16-24 say they are using more skincare treatments, such as masks. “The facial mask trend will continue to gain strength in the West, as it becomes part of a regular beauty routine for consumers,” says Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. As to which benefits consumers are looking for in facial masks, hydration is key for consumers in China. Three in four (76%) Chinese women aged 20-49 who use facial masks say they look for the products to provide hydration, followed by 59% who look for whitening and 47% for pore refining. Meanwhile, among US consumers who have used facial masks and peels, the top four skin concerns users are looking to treat are acne or blemishes (29%), followed by signs of aging (27%), fine lines and wrinkles (27%), and pore size (27%). “Consumers curate their own facial mask routines according to skin type, lifestyle and product offering. In the future, this will drive new product development with different positioning claims and ingredients will be chosen to match different facial mask formats which deliver maximum efficacy. Brands can look to include local ingredients to appeal to consumers who don’t currently use facial masks, and can slowly introduce Asian ingredients that are increasingly of interest to consumers in the global market,” Sharon concludes."
Kanebo decodes makeup habits of Millennial women,"The Japanese cosmetics maker tried to connect differences in lifestyles and environment with the differences in makeup habits among women in big Asian cities and in New York.  “With the emergence of the internet and social media, women all over the world have instant access to the same kinds of information. In spite of this ubiquity of information, there are still great differences in the ways women from different regions and countries use makeup,” explains the Tokyo-based company. According to Kanebo, Japan and Korea are prominent examples. While sharing many features as geographic neighbours and a strong global influence in cosmetics, their ways of using makeup are very different. At work, for instance, women in Tokyo and Seoul tend to think of makeup as a duty rather than a matter of choice. Women from both cities spend more time on makeup than women from other cities, but they enjoy the experience less.  In Tokyo, makeup is synonymous with social etiquette (a tool for blending smoothly into the group), while in Seoul it is seen as a way to conceal blemishes (a tool for winning out in a competitive social environment). As far as makeup at work is concerned, Kanebo’s survey shows that dress codes are clearest in Beijing, Bangkok, and New York. In all three cities there are clear prescriptions on the use of makeup in the workplace.  However, if companies in Seoul and Tokyo do not formulate specific dress codes it is also because women in these cities usually pay careful attention to their business outfits. However, the survey also found that women take pleasure in makeup in cities where dress codes are important. When dress codes are stricter, makeup at work also tends to be more strongly linked to self-confidence and a sense of professionalism. According to the survey, it is in Bangkok and Beijing that women make the most effort with their makeup when “going to work,” while women in Seoul do so when going out “on a date.” Compared with other cities, women in Tokyo make the most effort with their makeup when “going out with female friends.”  Furthermore, it is in Seoul that women spend the most time on makeup and use the largest number of items. “Women in Seoul clearly place great importance on personal growth and career advancement. In contrast, Tokyo women are only interested in career advancement when no trade-offs are required in their private lives. Women in New York believe in a work-life balance. Women in Bangkok are concerned mainly about earning a high income and tend to have highly positive attitudes towards work. Women in Taipei seek a sense of achievement and satisfaction in their work but are far less concerned about income than their peers in Bangkok,” concludes Kanebo."
Skincare masks take the Asia-Pacific beauty market by storm,"At the in-cosmetic Asia tradeshow, which was held in Bangkok last month, global market intelligence company Euromonitor International revealed that the Asia Pacific (APAC) beauty market has achieved a 6% growth rate over the past years (Compound Annual Growth Rate - CAGR) and 51% of global sales come from the region. While face moisturisers continue to command the biggest share of the Asian beauty products market, with a value of almost US$19bn, face masks have been the source of much of the growth, achieving CAGR of over 13% (2012-2017) - accounting for US$5bn of sales. In Asia, mass skincare grew at 6% CAGR over the same time period, eroding the premium skincare category’s market share.  “South Korean brands, such as The Face Shop, Etude House and Innisfree, fuelled the mass cosmetics boom by fulfilling Asian consumers’ need for self-indulgence and affordability through creative brand storytelling, eye-catching packaging, diverse product ranges and low-price points,” said Sunny Um, Beauty & Fashion Analyst at Euromonitor International. However, contrary to this trend, in China, demand for mass products has been less than that of premium, despite mass skincare generating value sales 250% larger than premium skincare. Touching on the rapid growth of the colour cosmetics segment, Euromonitor revealed that Asia is also leading the global market with a value of US$15bn last year. In the APAC region, foundations and concealers are the largest category in the segment, with a worth of almost US$5bn, but BB and CC achieved a CAGR of 25% (2011-2016) despite modest sales of US$1bn - showing the huge potential in this area. The global market intelligence company also unveiled a number of growing trends from ‘genderless’ beauty. Across Asia, more men experiment with products that have traditionally been used exclusively by females, while there is a growing number of consumers looking to ‘personalise’ products to their individual tastes. Eventually, in the context of an ageing population in Asia, in particular in Japan, South Korea and China, Euromonitor also shared insights into the use of cosmetics by the over-50s global population. It noted that half of women aged over 60 used foundation at least once a week, while 59% of the same demographic used lipstick and 52% wore eye make-up to the same frequency."
COSME Tokyo 2018 is taking on a new dimension within Beauty & Health Week Tokyo,"As on previous years, COSME Tokyo will be held conjointly with COSME Tech, the trade show dedicated to the cosmetics industry supply chain, including ingredients, contract manufacturing / private label, containers / packaging, tools / accessories and all other products and services required for the development of cosmetic products. New in 2018, the two shows will be held together with INNER BEAUTY Tokyo 2018, an event focused on beauty and health foods, and the first edition of Health & Beauty Goods Expo, which will focus on beauty care goods, to form the Beauty & Health Week Tokyo 2018. Based on the foundation that COSME Tokyo and COSME Tech have been setting up over years, those four jointly held shows will cover not only cosmetics but the whole beauty industry with the aim to attract a wider range of visitors. “Thanks to the synergy between these different events, COSME Tokyo 2018 will be much larger and more international.  Visitors of the Beauty & Health Week Tokyo 2018 will have the possibility to get information about all aspects of the beauty industry at once. This will be the most attractive venue for those who are looking for beauty products from Japan and Asia,” explain the show organizers. One of the most attractive feature of the show is its impressive line-up of Japanese cosmetic brands.  Most Japanese cosmetics to be exhibited at COSME Tokyo 2018 cannot be found at any other exhibitions in the world.  It is therefore a unique occasion to find new innovative and high quality brands, concepts and technologies. “Generally, Japanese cosmetics are popular around the world for their high quality, their reliability, cost performance, etc. However, there are much more products which are yet to be known outside Japan, especially products made by small-and-medium sized manufacturers. As the number of exhibitors including small-and-medium sized companies will increase from the last edition, COSME Tokyo 2018 is the must-visit exhibition for international visitors looking for high quality Japanese cosmetics,” conclude the organizers."
French presence reinforced at Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Asia 2017,"Why does the French Pavilion grow every year? Caroline Escudier - Thanks to the high vitality and diversity that characterise the French cosmetics industry, we will be present at two exhibitions this year. The French cosmetics industry is stimulated by perpetual changes, as even the newest companies are ready to meet the demands of the Asian market. The Pavilion France at Cosmoprof Asia welcomes 27 new exhibitors which make up more than a third of the delegation. Some regular exhibitors have even enlarged their exhibition area. In a niche market, where products are ultra-segmented and of very high quality, French companies possess a high-end know-how expertise that covers the whole production process: from ingredient to the finished products, through the private label, hair products, spa and packaging services dedicated to cosmetics. Therefore, a block of 7 French companies will be established for the first time, on a space of 112 m2 at Cosmopack Asia 2017. The French Cosmetics Awards will be in its 3rd consecutive year in 2017. Has it been a success? Caroline Escudier - It has been, thanks to the team effort! We are lucky to be supported by highly motivated sponsors: La Boutique France (La Poste), Hengcheng, PinGuan and our media partners. This year, the French Cosmetics Awards will be awarded by a jury of Chinese professionals. Three French brands among the 14 finalists will be rewarded for their innovation and creativity adapted to the Chinese market. Thanks to the support of our French sponsor La Boutique France (La Poste), one of the three winning brands will benefit from a six-month online release of its product on “La Boutique France”, an e-boutique reserved for French brands at the three largest Chinese B2C cross-border market places: Tmall Global, JD worldwide and Kaola. This award is very much supported by the press and the bloggers. Over the past two years (2015-2016), we have seen more than 70 publications in professional magazines and fashion and lifestyle magazines, nearly 300,000 views on YouTube, and not to mention success on social networks (over 500,000 views on the Facebook and Instagram posts). Beyond the prize-winners, this wide range media coverage benefits all exhibitors in the Pavilion, who are in great demand due to the resurgence of visitors on their stands. Do you also rely on the support of your regional partners?   Caroline Escudier - As a longtime leader in the cosmetics sector, France has about 1,000 leading companies. Present in more than 200 countries, they represent a quarter of the world market for exports. If Made in France is a guarantee of quality and reliability, this success deserves to deploy energy throughout the French territory. Local and specialised organisations add up to the nation effort: BCI supports 10 Breton companies, Cosmed and Dev’up / Cosmetic Valley supports 8 companies each. Their support is essential to help Business France detect the rising stars for the French Buzz space. A showcase of the dynamism of the research and the creativity of the sector, 11 entities exhibit not only their latest technological innovations but also their creativity in terms of concepts, textures, images, targets, bottling, etc. They rely on the subtle alliance between traditional beauty rituals, the choice of local natural resources for their ingredients and a very high research expertise. The Pavillon France, sponsored by Air France, Accor and La boutique France (La Poste / Colissimo) is deployed on the two exhibition sites: – Cosmopack Asia, 14-16 November 2017 at AsiaWorld Expo (Hall 6G)
– Cosmoprof Asia, 15-17 November 2017 at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (Halls 1F & 3E). The 7 exhibitors of Cosmopack are: ABC Texture, Coverpla, Distimex, Laboratoire Rosier Davenne, Lessonia, PB Group et Technature."
"U.K.: Health & beauty to drive Christmas retail sales, says GlobalData","Non-food retailers will continue to struggle this Christmas with sales expected to show year-on-year growth of only 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Volumes are forecast to fall by 0.1% as price rises, which came into play as result of the weakened pound, will discourage cash strapped consumers from shopping over the seasonal period. According to GlobalData, weak sales in early Q4 may entice more retailers to take part in Black Friday this year, although this runs the risk of bringing forward sales that would have otherwise been made at full price.  The market research firm forecasts volumes to decrease by 0.6% on Q4 2017 compared to Q4 2017 in the clothing & footwear sector, as well as for furniture.  While food & grocery remain more resilient than discretionary spend sectors, inflation has helped discounters to increase their reach ever further over the past year. In contrast, the health & beauty market will be the strongest performing sector in Q4, with spend up 3.4% and volume growth positive - despite easing marginally on last year. Fragrance and make-up new releases such as Chanel Gabrielle perfume and Fenty and Victoria Beckham x Estée Lauder cosmetics ranges will fuel gifting spend, as will innovation-led skincare items which tap into the ‘clean’ trend and wellness revolution. Department stores face increased competition this year from ASOS and the online beauty pureplays which are incredibly fierce on price and fulfilment. Actually, online pure-players such as ASOS and Amazon are set to be the winners this Christmas, drawing consumers online with their vast product offer alongside market leading, fast and low cost delivery propositions. “The online channel will continue to outperform physical sales growth,” says GlobalData.  “The increased availability of delivery saver schemes this year, alongside express delivery options being widely accessible, will encourage shoppers to leave online purchases later, having the confidence to purchase right up until the last few days before Christmas,” the firm concludes."
"The male grooming market is undergoing a dramatic change, sees Kline","“The taboos are slowly dropping, and a growing number of men are using anti-aging serums and masks, beauty devices, and even makeup,” says Naira Aslanian, the report’s manager. “While makeup for men is a trend now and brands such as Covergirl and Maybelline are debuting their first male ambassadors, it is categories like skin care and personal cleansing that see the most innovation and progression. Traditional male-oriented categories, such as deodorants and antiperspirants, also post strong gains driven by innovations like anti-mark antiperspirant technology.” In addition, the increased purchasing power of millennial men, who follow trends set by look-conscious celebrities, take the notion of self-care to a different level. The desire to associate themselves with a lifestyle synonymous with success and well-being turns male consumers to barbershops and male-centric salons offering personalized services and pampering. “Men are moving to specialized, often luxury barbershops, not only because they are increasingly accepting the notion of pampering, but they also see the immediate results when their surroundings take a notice of a change. In this newly accepted environment men are groomed to put their best face forward and be trendy,” comments Agnieszka Saintemarie, Industry Manager for Kline’s recently published Barbershops: Global Market Brief. Beard-wearing trends are also fuelling the barbershop market with, for example, over 60% of Italians wearing a beard these days. This is among the reasons why the barbershops markets in Europe and the United States grow at over 10%. The robust growth within the professional hair care segment for men, however, did not offset the decline of the overall haircare category caused by lack of innovation and competition from unisex products. Shaving products, the second fastest growing category after skin care with over 6% growth, is driven by direct selling brands, such as Bevel, Harry’s, and Dollar Shave Club, which have recorded phenomenal, triple-digit growth rates, paving the way for a new category of subscription box providers. Direct sales, along with specialty stores, are the most vibrant retail channels for cosmetics and toiletries for men. The convenience of online shopping and sampling through subscription boxes fuels the rise of the direct sales channel. Besides digital advertising, smaller, niche brands find an audience for their products by posting videos on YouTube, many of which often go viral. Large companies lead the market, with Unilever being the undisputed number one through brands like Dove Men+Care, Axe, and Degree and placing an even stronger foot in the male grooming market through the acquisition of the market innovator Dollar Shave Club. However, finds Kline, a number of new, smaller, indie brands, such as Brickell, Bevel, and Anthony, are popping up, making this market truly innovative. According to Kline, the increased acceptance of personal care and spending on it is anticipated to offer more business opportunities in this booming segment. A number of the new players that have entered the category will gain increasing shelf space at stores and salons alike. Brands will continue to explore new product categories, shifting to offerings of technologies men are becoming familiar with. Note that Kline will hold a webinar on November 7 to take an A to Z look into the male grooming boom: register here."
Western beauty brands successfully use ecommerce to sell to China,"With a total sales value estimated to USD 800 billion in 2017, China’s ecommerce market is the world’s number one. “China is one of the most lucrative markets for global consumer brands to tap, but it’s also one of the toughest.  With more internet users than any other country, China is the world’s largest and fastest-growing ecommerce market – driven by the rapid pace of mobile adoption,” says Angela Liu, director of strategy & insight for China, at Profitero, one of the world’s leading ecommerce analytics companies. “Huge opportunities await brands prepared to win over Chinese consumers, adapt to local market nuances, and put strategies in place which effectively adjust to a dynamic - and mobile-centric - ecommerce environment,” she adds. E-commerce is therefore an effective way to gain market share in China. But it is a very concentrated sector, dominated by two major platforms: Alibaba’s Tmall and JD.com. Together, these e-tailers capture 83% of China’s ecommerce sales.  Strict rules and regulations in place on Tmall and JD are intended to prevent fraud and fake product distribution. As a consequence, both platforms enjoy a high level of confidence from Chinese consumers bruised by the experience by bad experiences with fake products bought on the sites that pioneered the ecommerce sector in the country. Furthermore, according to Profitero, consumer-generated ratings and reviews carry extraordinary weight in China and have become an integral part of purchase decisions and about 80% of Chinese shoppers leave reviews online.  “For brand marketers, this high level of ratings and review activity, and the importance of sentiment analysis over star ratings, is all the more critical when doing business in China,” explains Profitero in a white paper “China Mobile Commerce - How to Expand Reach and Effectiveness in the World’s Biggest eCommerce Market”. With its particularities compared to Europe and North America, the Chinese ecommerce is a real challenge for western brands, however, many of them are successfully competing with local and Asian brands.  This is particularly true in the make-up remover category, where products from French brand Bioderma and US brand Maybelline account for three of the top four best-selling products on China’s biggest online retail site Tmall. However, in the toothpaste category, only one western brand - Colgate - has a product among the five best-sellers. This success often involves an ultra-personalized purchasing experience the principle of which is pushed to the extreme in China.  “Basically, every single eCommerce interaction is effectively personalized for individual consumers with content that is relevant and resonates with them based on past experiences and through the use of cookies,” highlights Profitero."
"“Cosmetics companies need data and multi-channel strategies to win the race,” Amaury Martin, Emarsys","Premium Beauty News - How can you define your business and the nature of the solutions you offer? Amaury Martin - Emarsys is an Austrian company that has established itself as a pioneer in Machine Learning and the application of artificial intelligence to digital marketing (AIM – Artificial Intelligence Marketing), also called marketing cloud. Based on the customer data we collect and centralize, our software calculates aggregates according to which the platform itself decides to launch marketing actions: the best incentive, depending on the customer status, the best time to send emails, text messages, push notifications on applications… For companies, the information collection points are either physical (stores), or digital (websites or applications), or they can even use the phone. Premium Beauty News - Why is the omnichannel strategy so crucial?  Amaury Martin -  Buyer behaviours are changing. Consumers and companies used to work in silos: stores and websites were separate, and sometimes you could even ask your network of friends for some advice. Today, with smartphones and constant connectivity, mobile applications, comparative websites, etc., people are much more cross-channel-oriented: they ask their friends what they think, they compare what their friends say with what they find online, and they buy products in stores because they want to test them. They have “un-siloted” the way they act, buy, compare, and interact with brands. And yet, many brands are still structured in silos, which means they have store managers/network managers with their own way to solve problems, web managers and social media, and customer service managers. Most often, they do not get all customer information and feedback, because they can only focus on their own work or field. For example, only the web manager will hear about a dissatisfied customer who chose Facebook to express himself. Companies are still very compartmentalized, while customers have changed: they expect a unified experience, whatever the channel they use to interact with the brand. Premium Beauty News - Technologically speaking, it seems easier to grab information on digital channels than in stores: how can you optimize fluidity between the various channels? Amaury Martin - It is definitely easier to collect digital information. Online, you always leave a trace, which is not always true in a store. At a point of sale, there are two ways to collect information: either on the cash register software, through the loyalty card – that is what happens in 90% cases – or via the shop assistant, on a tablet or smartphone. Of course, it is more difficult when there is a distributor in-between. Be it as it may, globalized companies like L’Oréal have been adapting to the customer knowledge trend and are becoming Customer-Centric, as they collect navigational or declarative data. Asia is a good incubator: its population comprises 50% young people under 20, digital adoption is very strong, and consumers are prone to provide personal data. Premium Beauty News - Once you have collected the data, what are the aggregates that determine the marketing action? Amaury Martin - Engagement is taken into account. When someone opens and clicks on such or such e-mail, then we send them an e-mail. And if they have also downloaded the app, then we provide e-mails and push notifications, etc. The idea is to simplify Marketers’ lives as much as possible. We let the machine calculate the aggregates on a large scale (left brain), and the Marketer makes a decision about the content and strategy (right brain). The combination of the two makes it possible for the platform to interact depending on the customer’s engagement and decide which channel is best to contact them. We can even go farther if we record the history in a database. The machine can choose the most timely day and time to send the message, depending on the individual, i.e. the time when, statistically, we will have the best opening rate. That is called send time optimization. Among our French customers, we have already achieved an opening rate 3% to 15% higher than with a standard campaign! Lastly, it is the platform that decides which offer is the best (incentive recommendation). Among a whole range of offers of 10, 15, or 0 euros, or a free delivery, the platform itself decides what it needs to transform the message into a purchase, according to customer engagement. We have realized it tends to spend 20% to 30% less than a human being. Premium Beauty News - Has the cosmetics industry made any progress on this new relationship with customers? Amaury Martin - The cosmetics industry is starting to understand that you win the race with declarative and transactional customer data more than with the product. A few companies have started to adapt, others still have quite outdated a vision, due to their disconnection with final customers because of the filter of distributors. There is a reconnection digital change coming, but everyone is not moving at the same pace. The machine is running."
Cosmetic 360 focuses on digital innovation,"The third edition of the Cosmetic 360 trade show hosted 200 exhibitors and welcomed about 4,400 visitors (an 11% increase compared to last year).  Organized by the Cosmetic Valley - the French Competitiveness Cluster dedicated to the cosmetics sector, which concentrates 800 companies and extends over an area covering the metropolitan and suburban areas of Tours, Rouen, Orleans, Chartres and Versailles - this event aims to ""promote the innovative players from the beauty sector.” An 800 m2 area was entirely dedicated to some 30 beauty start-ups such as Aryballe Technology (which showcased an electronic odour identification device), Oxiproteomics (presenting a technique to determine the skin’s aging from protein oxidation), Zéo (a 100% natural absorbent powder that provides ultra-fast hair drying and winner of the Cosmetic Victories 2017 competition), Exhalia (an interactive fragrance bar), Saralon GmbH (electronic packaging inks), Waw (a mobile app for delving into cosmetics bags around the world). This area was conceived as a full business incubation area, where entrepreneurs had a chance to present their projects to a committee of experts including Business Angels and banks. As in previous years, Cosmetic 360 also offered a series of meetings dedicated to Open Innovation.  For the third edition, some 150 appointments were scheduled between project leaders from around twenty countries, selected from the 253 start-ups, and five leading multinationals: Chanel, Johnson & Johnson, L’Oréal, LVMH Research, Shiseido. Another highlight of the show was the debut edition of the Hackaton C360. The event gathered 50 international students - including marketers, designers, programmers, creators, developers, engineers and designers - from 22 French schools (Mines, Chimie Paris Tech, ENSTA Paris Tech, ISIPCA, Telecom Paris Tech, Neoma Business School, International Fashion Academy, etc.), grouped into seven teams, to brainstorm on the theme Reveal Your Perception, with the support of LVMH teams. The U Scent concept (“How to test and choose the right fragrance online?”) won the competition over the various projects presented (perfume samples available in Uber cars, use of Big Data, skin tone photo-measurements, personal assistant to help with the choice of cosmetics, beauty routine tutorials, etc.). In the wake of this test edition, the Cosmetic Valley intends the Hackathon C360 to transform into an annual and bigger and more ambitious event within the Cosmetic 360 show. ""Innovation is the hallmark of the Cosmetic Valley. The actions the cluster has been conducting for 20 years to multiply industrial and collaborative research projects, to pool resources, have made the sector stronger, more enterprising and more visible.  However, they would not have any future if the cluster would not be able to foster the agility and capacity of its members to face competition and to remain disruptive within a changing world and the context of the digital revolution,"" said Marc-Antoine Jamet, President of the Cosmetic Valley."
Make-up: The MakeUp In shows are stating their ambitions for 2018,"Premium Beauty News - Looking at it, 2017 was a particularly flattering year for you! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Indeed, who would have imagined, eight years earlier, such a track record! The success is a quantitative one first. During the year 2017 alone, MakeUp In trade shows welcomed a total of nearly 400 exhibitors and almost 10 000 visitors. And this, only in the make-up category... The concept is now well established. There was a real need on the side of exhibitors and visitors. But on the other hand it is also and above all qualitative: more than half of visitors attend conferences, one third of exhibitors submit innovations at each edition, more than 50% of them attend at least three out of four MakeUp In events, - and some of them and not the least, even exhibit at each edition whatever the location in the world. Premium Beauty News - Have market developments helped you? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Unquestionably the concept emerged at the right time and events were favourable! The make-up sector has never been so dynamic across the world. Nor have subcontractors in the sector been so much called upon. And never before has the entire industrial chain experienced so many rapid changes with newcomers, market launches and so many different requests coming from everywhere. MakeUp In trade shows have indeed become unavoidable appointments for the whole industry. Premium Beauty News - 2017 was also marked by your integration in the InfoPro Digital Group, who is also the organizer of the Luxe Pack exhibition... Sandra Maguarian - You already gave us the opportunity to express ourselves here a few weeks ago. There are real synergies between the two Companies and in some parts of the world, we bring them to being with new events: a new Luxe Pack Los Angeles, which will be held concomitantly to MakeUp in Los Angeles and a new MakeUp in Shanghai at the same time as Luxe Pack Shanghai. The first event of the series in Los Angeles, which already looks extremely promising will be the first one set up by the two Companies. It will welcome some 150 exhibitors in total. Furthermore, we are delighted to have in our team since September, Irene Yanhua Gu, Asia Sales Manager and Adriana Rodriguez who joined us as Commercial Director and who will be in charge of the commercial development of MakeUp In events in the world alongside Jean- Yves Bourgeois. Adriana, of Mexican origin, has a long international professional experience in many different areas. Premium Beauty News - What are your prospects for 2018? Sandra Maguarian - We’re still on an upward trend. MakeUp in Seoul and the first edition of MakeUp in Shanghai will be held next April and will undoubtedly stand as leading events in the make-up and skincare sector in Asia. As for MakeUp in Paris, in June, and MakeUp in New York, in September, it will certainly be a full house for both. Premium Beauty News - Other projects?   Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Of course, we are already working on them..."
"European and North American consumers in search for transparency and trust, Mintel unveils","Trust and transparency appear in the top 4 trends that are set to impact consumer markets in North America and Europe in 2018, according to Mintel. There is in fact a general lack of confidence between consumers and many governmental or private organizations.  Generally speaking, distrust in governments and media is spreading to companies and brands, Mintel points out. According to the market research firm, only 18% of American consumers agree that “most Americans share my values,” and just 5% of Canadians say they trust the news stories they read on social media sites.  As far as European are concerned, Mintel reveals that “just 25% of those who have used a device to access national newspapers online say that the content on these websites is trustworthy.” In such a context, many consumers - especially at the younger end of the spectrum - expect companies to take a more proactive, high-tech approach when it comes to increasing transparency.  For instance, one in five 20-24-yearold Brits would like online retailers to have videos showing how clothes and shoes are made. In an effort to increase transparency SC Johnson recently announced that it will list the presence of 368 potential skin allergens that may occur in its products. As consumers reprioritize who and what they believe in, companies will have to take a stand, speak out and prove that they’re trustworthy.  “Today, trust has become one of the strongest drivers in how consumers choose products, services, and which organizations and politicians to support”, explains Carli Gernot, Manager of Trends, North America at Mintel. In the coming years, brands will have to court consumers with transparency, honesty and facts and, at the same time, they will need to find new ways to prove their positions. “Product innovation that meets the changing needs of apprehensive consumers can build or redeem trust, including adding more information to packaging or incorporating livestreams of production methods,” adds Carli Gernot. As greater transparency will become standard, companies must be ready to provide consumers with quantified and qualified facts, whether this is related to manufacturing processes or how efficacious a product is.  “In terms of marketing, there will be a push for greater authenticity,” says Mintel. “Consumers are set to see behind-the-scenes revealed through creative campaigns that put employees to the fore and capitalise on their years of expertise.” “With consumers more able to question and query the actions of brands, radical transparency will be the watchword for 2018 as they try and show they can be relied upon as trustworthy,” concludes Catherine Cottney, Manager of Trends at Mintel. While consumers of both sides of the Atlantic share this common concern for transparency, other areas of interest vary widely. As far as North America is concerned, Mintel unveils the following four key trends: 1. Trust Funding. In a post-truth world, consumers are putting their dollars where their trust remains intact.
2. The Value Equation. Budget-minded consumers are weighing a variety of value factors for each purchase decision, and brands are making these individuals a priority.
3. Health Yourself. In an uncertain and seemingly unstable world, self-care and preventative health are becoming essential for consumers across demographics.
4. Life in Sinc. Voices & Visuals. As the line between online and offline blurs, smart systems are delivering seamless convenience - with voice control and image recognition at the helm. And for Europe: 1. Sea Change. Ocean plastic fashion and recycled packaging launches, ingredient bans and activism are focusing consumer and government attention on maritime conservation.
2. Shareholders. Hacks and data disclosure legislation form a new breed of consumers who will hold on tight to their data and demand something in return before sharing it.
3. Teenaiders. Teens are increasingly defined by anxieties around image, health and work, and are looking for brands to alleviate the pressure and help them build both their confidence and prospects.
4. Accountants. In a world of post-truth politics and unsubstantiated media, consumers are looking for brands to court them with transparency, simplicity and evidence."
Sales of natural & organic cosmetics continue to grow in Germany,"According to Elfriede Dambacher (Naturkosmetik Konzepte), industry expert and program chairwoman, “natural and organic cosmetics have brought a breath of fresh air to the saturated cosmetics market, doubling the market volume over the last decade.” With a market share of 8.5% (16.5% including nature inspired cosmetics) and a value of 1.150 billion euros in 2016, the natural and organic cosmetics market in Germany has become the strongest market in Europe. Today, approximately 9 million consumers purchase natural and organic cosmetics several times a year, revealed Elfriede Dambacher during the conference. Furthermore, demand continues to be strong and sales grew by approximately 2% during the first six months of 2017. However, the conference was also looking at the future with the aim to address challenges of the future. “To meet the challenges of the future, we need to look beyond our current vantage point and take the major societal changes into consideration. They are affecting the entire market and changing not only the purchasing behaviour,” stated Elfriede Dambacher added. “There are two forces that the industry needs to stand up to: the global increase of demand and digitalization,” she added. In its keynote presentation, futurologist and theologian Michael Carl, from 2b AHEAD ThinkTank GmbH, focused on the core topic of digitalization with a thought-provoking presentation. He impressively depicted the power of digitalization and its effects: throughout all industries, digitalization is putting production processes, supply chains and communication on a new foundation, creating a shift in the balance of power and changing every aspect of the customers´ living environment. The expert called for more communication and to start talking to people. His recommendation to the industry: individuality instead of standards, being open-minded, integrate new forms of communication, flexibility, courage, credibility, identity, responsibility, and a positive outlook on the future. Keynote speaker Dr. Kay Hafner (Hafner & Cie.) provided insights on the topic of digital change from the corporate perspective, casting a critical glance at brand policies. According to his experience, many brands underestimate the gradual process of digital change. His message: digital change is a cultural change. Companies have to be committed to implement digitalization throughout all corporate processes. For Dr. Hafner, this also includes a distinct focus on customer needs. The conference also featured an informative presentation on Packaging Trends as well as two internationally oriented panels Booming Markets in Asia and From Fairtrade to Realtrade. As far as Asia is concerned, experts provided insights onto the development of natural and organic cosmetics in Japan, China and South Korea.   After Europe, the Asia-Pacific region is the second largest market for personal care products with consumer preferences gradually shifting towards more natural and organic products."
"Europe needs to step it up on anti-pollution beauty, Mintel says","As far as air pollution is concerned, the situation in European urban areas may be better than in big Asian cities.  However, air pollution is a public health concern here too and public campaigns about the dangers of pollution are clearly having an effect on consumer awareness.  According to Mintel, “only 4-7% of consumers in France, Germany and Italy believe pollution is not an issue in their country”. Despite the high level of concern, anti-pollution new product development (NPD) in Europe’s beauty and personal care market is stagnating, Mintel finds.  Data from Mintel Global New Products Database show that anti-pollution products accounted for 1.3% of European beauty and personal care launches in both 2015 and 2016, and fell slightly to 1.2% of launches in January-May 2017. In contrast, Asia Pacific saw anti-pollution launches grow from 1.2% in 2015 to 1.7% in 2016; in North America, the share rose from 1.3% to 1.4% over the same period. This situation may be linked to a lack of credibility of the benefits of anti-pollution in cosmetic products.  “A third of German consumers say anti-pollution skincare products are of no use, and a quarter of French consumers don’t believe anti-pollution haircare has any validity,” points Mintel. However, new data are now available, as testing agencies have worked on protocols that can evaluate anti-pollution protection.  According to Vivienne Rudd, beauty brands now have valuable scientific tools to convince sceptical consumers.  Another useful innovation would be to move towards an on-pack anti-pollution index mimicking SPF ratings. “Beauty brands need to step up their launch activity, creating targeted formulations backed with compelling and meaningful marketing,” explains Vivienne Rudd. While Mintel also sees potential growth in the anti-pollution haircare category, the market research firm notes that only few brands have created an anti-pollution haircare regimen.  “Although NPD and category share doubled in Europe in 2016, anti-pollution products still represented just 1.1% of total haircare launches,” Vivienne Rudd writes. Brands that launched anti-pollution haircare innovations includes Aveda, with the Pramasana range, Shu Uemura, with the Urban Moisture shampoo, conditioner, treatment and serum and Shea Moisture, one of the very few to add a styling component. With the development of beauty products designed to combat pollution, there have been accusations that beauty brands are merely seeking to profit from pollution rather than help alleviate it. According to Vivienne Rudd, this creates “an opportunity for beauty brands to step up and take action” in this area.  Recent initiatives from Shiseido or The Body Shop in order to emphasises their actions to reduce or eliminate emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants thus contribute to change the image of the industry. Mintel will present latest trends and product innovations related to environmental stress on the “Trend Zone” at the Cosmetic 360 trade show. Cosmetic 360

Social networks: can we do without them?,"Premium Beauty News - Why are social networks a key lever for the BtoB sector today? Séverine Boutry -  It is true that recent figures on the staggering growth of Internet traffic are quite enough to make the head of B2B players spin. In one minute in the world, Google processes over 3.5 million search queries; Facebook records 900,000 connections; Youtube broadcasts 4.1 million videos; Twitter 452,000 tweets and SnapChat 1.8 million new images! And when companies are not trying to reach their end consumer, but instead their corporate clients, journalists, distributors, trend firms... they are also all very active on all networks. Not using social networks would be like putting a black curtain on its shop window! When you look at it, the web has offered a mouthpiece to everyone, and it’s a shame not to care for its ""owned-media"" and its ""shared-media"" represented by one’s website, newsletters and social networks. It is the image and reputation of the company that can benefit from it in the medium term, and even in the short term, ROI can be immediate: a press article triggered by a properly devised tweet, a new distributor contacted via LinkedIn, a partner won over by an event pushed on Instagram... Premium Beauty News - So, for example, what is your assessment of the recent MakeUp in New York trade show? Séverine Boutry - For MakeUp in New York, we chose to work on the four traditional networks (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram) and to stick to the timetable of newsletters sent by the show organisers. Upstream, the recruitment of visitors was pushed on LinkedIn and Twitter, with excellent reach on LinkedIn in particular. During the show, Twitter and Instagram were used for their very ""hot now"" side, which enabled to put forward exhibitors, teams, partners... and after the show had closed its doors, we continued to send thanks and review the outcome, to prepare MakeUp in Los Angeles next February! Twitter is the key to touch reporters, LinkedIn is perfect to maintain ties with clients and nurture the hiring brand and Instagram to touch the beauty sphere, while Facebook, by nature, is more BtoC but so powerful... Overall, results are real: on Twitter more than 29,000 impressions, with + 113% on profile visitors and + 280% on mentions, on LinkedIn more than 15,000 impressions for the period, on Instagram + 36% subscribers and on Facebook the scope of publications increased by 29% and commitments by 110%... I believe the show achieved its goals, a success ""in real life"" and on social networks too! Premium Beauty News - What would be you recommendations for BtoB brands wanting to stand out on social networks? Séverine Boutry - The first basic rule is to be true and generous! Because on social networks, you must give to receive. Don’t hesitate to follow and congratulate your competitors, and avoid inflating your figures by ""buying"" fans and likes. It’s better to be followed by a small community of true fans, instead of robots in Thailand! Then find your narrative territory and don’t only talk about yourself, it’s like during a first date, if you only talk about yourself at the first diner, there will not be others! And finally, our philosophy for each product content is the ""3 S"" for Surprise, Service, Social. Indeed, you must be able to surprise to catch attention, be helpful by being pedagogical, funny or useful, and finally stimulate the desire to share to push virality... and – Google recently announced it–, without forgetting to propose a responsive and pleasant website on mobiles, because mobile search has now exceeded in France computer searches..."
Latin America: Sales of men’s grooming to grow by 27 percent by 2021,"According to the report, men’s grooming will grow the fastest in emerging regions. Latin America, in particular, will become a key market for men’s beauty. Valued at USD 10 billion in 2016 and forecasted to grow over 27 percent until 2021, Latin America will lead men’s grooming sales growth in the world. Men’s Grooming: Growth Rate per Region (2016-2021) – Latin America: +27,4 percent
– Asia Pacific: +20,5 percent
– Middle East and Africa: +19,4 percent
– North America: +9,9 percent
– Eastern Europe: 9,7 percent
– Western Europe: 5,1 percent
– Australasia: 4,4 percent Source: Euromonitor International
Note: Data refers to retail value and is expressed in USD million, fixed 2016 exchange rate, constant 2016 prices. “Men’s grooming has presented sustained growth in Latin America, positioned as the second fastest growing segment between 2011 and 2016. Holding a ‘men’s zone’ in stores has shown to be a successful strategy as it provides men a place to go for all their beauty needs. Previously, men had to sort through shelves full of products targeting women in order to find products tailored to them,” said Elton Morimitsu, Senior Research Analyst at Euromonitor. According to the report, while men’s grooming sales are still highly dominated by the most traditional categories, such as fragrances, deodorants, and shaving products, which together accounts for 96 percent of total men’s grooming sales, Latin American men are slowly increasing their consumption of esthetics products. “The regional challenge lies on breaking stereotypes. Skin care, for example, is still very much associated with femininity. For this reason, men’s skin care launches are now exploring claims that focus on the product’s features, such as sunscreen or post shave. The objective is to gradually get men to experiment with multifunctional products as a first step to explore their vanity,” concludes Morimitsu.

"“Still too little R&D for dark skins,” Aïmara Coupet","Premium Beauty News - Why does the makeup offering still not correspond to what women expect? Aïmara Coupet - Actually, it should be said that there is a will to open to everyone today. The market has changed a lot as regards coloured skins, compared to about twenty years ago. There are more shades available. But if you really want to meet mixed to dark skins’ makeup needs, you need to go much farther and try and innovate, rather than just add a few shades. That is not enough. Generally speaking, there is very little Research & Development going on for these skin types, although they are very specific and different from Caucasian skins. They are still little-known. For example, there are very few documented actives available for phototypes 5 or 6. Besides, if you take a look at the skincare market segmentation, half is dedicated to anti-wrinkle products, which definitely does not correspond to a dark skin need. Premium Beauty News - What are dark skins’ specificities? Aïmara Coupet - There are several, but the main specificities are hyperpigmentation and dyschromia, i.e. a more or less pigmented skin depending on the face or body area. There is a lack of evenness, as certain areas are very dark, others lighter. There are also differences in how they heal - the process usually leaves spots. Lastly, they tend to be combination to oily skins, which does not mean they are not dehydrated, quite the contrary. The unbalance between sebum production and dehydration is a significant element to be taken into account. Dehydrated dark skins often look dull and lack radiance. These specificities directly impact the makeup result. On the positive side, the epidermis is more resistant, firmer, and less likely to have wrinkles and suffer from photoaging - it has a lower risk to develop a skin cancer. That is one of the reasons why I recommend not adding an SPF to a foundation, especially if it prevents the product from providing a bright complexion. The skin should not look grey or dull. A protective sun care product may replace it if needed, but to me, results prevail as far as makeup is concerned: the first mission of a foundation is to provide a beautiful complexion. Physiological differences should also be taken into account, like those of lips, which are thicker, often bicoloured, and sometimes much textured. It is important when it comes to designing a lipstick. Premium Beauty News - How can companies develop ranges with new, better-adapted shades? Aïmara Coupet - The first question is, “is this formula efficient at providing dark skins with a beautiful complexion?” Certain textures are much too oily and shiny for them, and the makeup result is not satisfactory, while other formulas do not accept enough pigments. As a matter of fact, making a darker shade does not come up to just increasing the black content, it also means working on the other pigments. In addition, certain pigments do not create a nice result on dark skins: certain brown shades can turn pink, for example, or yellow colours may become grey or greenish. So, the pigments added to the formula are very important, they need to be worked according to the formula. There are better-adapted ingredients available, but they are still not properly identified for an application on black skins. Researchers are still learning, testing and making mistakes… Premium Beauty News - What do you recommend for brands to improve their offering? Aïmara Coupet - As regards makeup, the idea is to think of the result first: think like a makeup artist rather than a marketer. Brands need to change the way they see things. Instead of copying/pasting formulas intended for Caucasian skins, they should strengthen their R&D and focus research on these specific skins. Why not do things the other way round? Why could a dark-skin-suited innovation not be adapted to light skins? Brands should think differently. It is the industry’s mission to open to mixed skins. Mixed skins represent the majority of tomorrow’s consumers."
Brazil: Premium products on the rise despite economy uncertainties,"According to data by market research firm Euromonitor, mass beauty brands grew by 4.4% in 2016 in Brazil whereas luxury products rose 9.1%. The figures follow last year’s trend, when sales of luxury beauty products increased by 16.6%, compared to a drop of 1.3% in mass cosmetic sales. There are some reasons behind this category’s positive performance despite the challenging scenario. Most luxury product purchases were previously made overseas, but with the dollar on the rise and the drop in international travel, consumers have shifted to local stores. Customer loyalty and an improved perception of value for money are also key factors. “Most consumers of luxury beauty products are from a social-economic demographic that is less affected by economic cycles. We have also seen several new brands entering the market and the expansion of prestigious beauty retailers,” says Andrea Olim, Manager of the Brazilian branch of Japanese-based cosmetic company Shiseido, which has been operating locally for over 20 years. A good example of this market’s boom in Brazil is French cosmetics chain Sephora. The beauty retail giant landed in Brazil in 2012 and today has 30 stores in 11 different states. Sephora began to feel the effects of the recession in mid-2016, with the trend towards declining mall foot traffic. However, General Manager at Sephora Brasil, Flavia Bittencourt, says “the crisis has not affected us in the same way as other sectors. I often say that Sephora was not impacted because it does not only sell beauty products, but rather a unique experience for our customers.”  With around 90% of its products coming from overseas, the beauty chain was able to maintain its growth plan in Brazil.  “We did not come for a 100-meter sprint, but for a marathon. By the time the crisis was knocking on our door, we were ready to face it,” says Bittencourt. The strategy of expanding the business model with the launch of beauty kiosks has given Sephora the ability to reach new areas of interest yet also serve as a trial. “If the kiosks are successful, it is a sign that we can go head with a full store,” says Bittencourt.  She also attributes Sephora’s success to the number of exclusive brands sold through the chain, consistent new product launches and its attractive pricing policy. “We have items to suit all tastes and budgets. There are face masks available in store for only R$ 10. We need to create a perception that premium cosmetics do not necessarily have to be expensive.” Offering less affordable prices (a 100ml fragrance can exceed R$ 600), Jo Malone is another beauty chain that recently settled in Brazil. The UK-based fragrance brand opened its first store in the luxury shopping destination Iguatemi Shopping in early 2016 and has already opened its second store in São Paulo and another one in Rio. However, even customers who are willing to pay more for quality products and are loyal to a particular brand may adjust their buying habits in times of recession. “We noticed changes in the behaviour of the Shiseido customer, including a shift towards lines with more attractive pricing, as well as an increased demand for offers,” says Olim. She reveals that a number of strategies and product launches, such as the new LiftDynamic instant lifting effect moisturizers, have been sustaining the company’s double-digit growth. Revlon has also reviewed its price point in Brazil. To become more competitive in the face of the crisis, the US beauty giant has cut prices for its products in Brazil. Revlon’s creamy lipstick now sells for R$ 30 and the ColorStay liquid foundation, which has released new shades for darker skin and higher FPS, was reduced from R$ 89.90 to R$ 69.90."
Concerns over pollution stimulate sales in the UK prestige skincare sales,"Sales of anti-pollution prestige skincare products are skyrocketing in the UK.  Sales of have were up by 30% in the six-month period January 2017 to end of June 2017 according to The NPD Group.  “As the market develops we are seeing more brands introducing products that are specifically designed to protect the skin from pollution,” explains June Jensen, Director, NPD UK Beauty. However, despite these impressive growth rates, anti-pollution remains an emerging category in the women’s skincare sector.  According to The NPD Group, the market for these products is valued at £3.1 million. Sales of anti-pollution face masks reported the strongest growth, increasing 112% in the six months to the end of June 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. Anti-pollution moisturiser was also a star performer, reporting 62% growth in the same period. Cleansers and eye creams, designed specifically to tackle the issues relating to pollution also reported double digit growth. The trend for anti-pollution skincare, which emerged a couple of years ago, benefits from consumers’ concerns about air quality, in particular in big cities.  Today, over half (52%) of Londoners say they are concerned about pollution levels, compared to a national average of 34%.  According to Mintel, this trend also boosts sales of air care products as UK consumers are estimated to spend £502 million on these products in 2017, up from £499 million in 2016. More and more products that protect and defend the skin with antioxidants and SPF are marketed as anti-pollution and often feature terms like ‘urban’, ‘city skin’, ‘shield’, ‘protector’, ‘defence’ and ‘environment’ in their names. Cleanse and protect More widely in the prestige beauty market, products which support a healthy skin regime have also reported a rise in sales. Face masks and cleansers in particular, which are regarded as essential for detoxing the skin have reported impressive growth in the six-month period January 2017 to end of June 2017. According to The NPD Group, face cleansers grew 7% to £1.6 million and skincare face masks (not specific to pollution) grew 42% to £2.2 million. Within that category, clay and mud face masks, regarded as the most effective deep cleansing and detoxifying of products, grew by 102%. SPF Protection Make-up products that protect the skin have also reported an increase. Sales of foundations formulated with an SPF have increased by 11% in the year to date June 2017. Foundations with SFP of 20 and above have reported double digit growth, whilst foundation formulated with SPF 50, often seen as the gold standard for pollution defence, has increased by 350%. “The popularity of products which protect against pollution have had a big impact on the prestige beauty market. We have witnessed the emergence of a niche skincare segment that has proved hugely popular with consumers. Brands like Murad in particular have created innovative products to protect the skin from pollution and blue light which is emitted from digital devices. We expect to see more products like those in the Murad City Skin range in the future as people aim to protect their skin from the harmful damage of pollution and city life,” concludes June Jensen."
Brazil remains one of the world’s leading fragrance markets,"With both mass and premium products, Brazilian fragrances are leading the Latin American market by far. In 2016, Brazil accounted for more than half (US$ 6.4 billion) of total sales in the region, which totaled US$ 11.2 billion according to a Beauty and Personal Care survey by international consultancy firm Euromonitor. Brazil currently holds second position on the global fragrance market, just behind the U.S., whose performance generated US$ 7.9 billion last year. The third place in the global ranking goes to the UK, who recorded a total of US$ 2.4 billion in sales. In 2021, Euromonitor predicts that the Brazilian fragrance market will reach R$ 30.8 billion (approximately US$ 9.6 billion) in sales revenue, exclusive of inflation. According to Euromonitor, Natura was the second-largest fragrance maker in Brazil last year. O Boticário was at the top of the ranking with third place going to Avon. “We have taken the lead in the fragrance market in Argentina and have gained relevant positions in strategic markets such as Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. In Brazil we are leaders in men’s fragrances, with iconic brands such as Natura Homem and Kaiak. We have also seen significant growth in women’s fragrances,” says Natura’s Global Fragrance Director, Denise Coutinho. The positive performance is linked to expansion initiatives, such as the plan to open 17 new physical stores in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and the revamp of sales practices by the consultants. According to Coutinho, perfumery is one of the strategic focuses of the company. “Natura is always investing in new product launches and innovation in this category, which is traditionally very dynamic. In recent years, we have launched new brands such as Una and Luna, and relaunched popular classics such as Kriska, Biografia and Natura Homem,” she says. “We also invest heavily in the quality of fragrances as well as the packaging, with the goal of building a prestige and unique image of Brazilian perfumery, all in our own factory in Cajamar.” In the masstige market, Natura’s signature brand is Kaiak, inspired by the connection with nature, followed by the Humor line, which encourages customers to live a lighter life. The category with more attractive pricing contains mainly eau de colognes from brands such as Águas and Tododia, designed at prolonging the after-bath sensation. The company’s communication strategy is anchored in a direct relationship between Natura’s fragrances and their Brazilian origins. To create varied fragrances and a unique scent identity, Coutinho explains that Natura’s Perfumer for the past eleven years, Veronica Kato, has combined 2,500 ingredients of world perfumery with 20 exclusive essential oils extracted from the Brazilian biodiversity. “Another unique aspect is that all fragrances use 100% organic alcohol extracted from sugar cane, which is grown without being affected by pesticides or burning,” she adds. The use of recycled glass adds to Natura’s sustainability strategies. “In brands like Kaiak and Humor, the packaging has 20% recycled post-consumer glass, and we are expanding that concept to the rest of the portfolio”, says Coutinho."
What did happen this summer?,"While the growth of the European cosmetics and personal care industry was much slower in 2016 than in 2015, according to Cosmetics Europe’s figures, due in particular to a fall in the UK market, several market segments are driving sales.  That is case of luxury lipsticks in France, and more generally of make-up in the UK.  Beauty brands therefore have good reasons to look at consumers’ preferences about make-up shades. In the USA, the overall colour cosmetics market is experiencing moderate growth, around two percent slower than last year. Nevertheless, skincare-inspired benefits are still in high demand among colour cosmetics users. In parallel, American consumers are also seduced by the mildness of an alternative anti-aging method: face yoga. The successes of gelatinous formulas, vegan makeup, and beauty masks were also highlighted during the summer. In the absence of major exhibitions, few packaging innovations were presented during the summer, let’s note however the ambitions of Saverglass in the perfumery market or those of Mosaico in the cardboard business. As far as decoration is concerned, RPC highlighted its lacquering and metallizing capabilities, while Quadpack, in the wake of the MakeUp in Paris tradeshow, showed the extent of possibilities offered by wood when ingeniously processed. The life of the companies was marked by numerous acquisitions on the part of the ingredients suppliers, the sector continuing to consolidate. Let’s also note the acquisition of BCM, a leading European designer and manufacturer of skincare and make-up formulations, by the Fareva group. As for brands, let’s note L’Occitane’s decision to invest in the building of its first plant in Brazil for the production of the L’Occitane au Brésil lines and, regarding retailers, the acquisition of the Spanish beauty chain Perfumerias If by Douglas, which becomes the number one prestige beauty retailer in this market. Enjoy the coming fall season!"
Creation of desire: an e-Beauty essential,"The generation of “tech-babyfed” Millennials is questioning conventional marketing, asserts journalist Nicolas Jaimes. According to a study conducted by the Global Data Institute, 64% of Millennials believe it is important to spend time on social media. Today, on YouTube, 100 creators count over two million subscribers in France. Beyond the very notion of share of attention on social networks, it is the notion of influence that is being questioned. To Nicolas Jaimes, 63% of Millennials trust influencers’ posts more easily than messages posted by brands. To Alexiane Dérail, founder of the Subleem agency, new influencers are spreading beyond the target of Millennials by capillary action. Right now, her agency is working with a community of influencing women aged up to 68. However, as more and more mega-influencers are gaining importance, micro-influencers have been emerging as a new target. “Web users buy products used by people similar to them. An influencer with 5,000 followers is actually very important, because she is usually very close to her community,” explains Alexiane Dérail, founder of Subleem. Since sincerity and authenticity are at the core of the relationship of trust, micro-influencers offer the advantage of enjoying more intimate closeness with their followers, which is why they have become a new target to seduce. For example, Sephora has never used any icon: instead, they work with influencers. Micro-influencers are strategic for retailers, explains Théo Julien, Head of Social Media Sephora EMEA. Most inspirational creators on YouTube count less than 100,000 followers, which explains why retailers aim to reach as many as possible, but following a real targeted marketing strategy of influence – a relationship that grows in time and is adapted to the influencer’s style. From sales to customer experience as a primary focus, at Sephora, they do it all to make customers feel like testing products. Retailers work according to the principle of consolidated basket. Products should not systematically be sold in-store, but also online – beauty advisors are actually equipped with iPads to make the synergy easier. This approach is at the core of the customer experience, but it is also necessary for space reasons, because there is not always enough room in-store to display a complete assortment with all the shades available (necessary to satisfy all types of complexions). Birchbox has also decided to focus their strategy on pampering testers, since product testing is the cornerstone of the beauty box forerunner: they are now widening their presence from the web to physical stores. “Birchbox counts 1 million subscribers in the world, including 200,000 in France,” explains Quentin Reygrobollet, Birchbox General Manager France. “What is crucial is to sell the right product to the right person, thanks to accurate targeting, to maximize the conversion rate.” Today, Birchbox boasts a conversion rate of 50% (buying rate on the website after purchasing the box), and asserts a leading position in France. The quality of key targeting depends on perfect mastery of the new, ultimate data weapon, not only to best personalize the box, but also to find the right tone when exchanging with the community. The beauty industry is experiencing a real revolution. Influencers, data, augmented reality… the new seduction tools deployed by beauty addicts are available to brands – and the latter will definitely know how to best use them."
Skincare: Europe and Asia-Pacific lead the way in anti-ageing innovation,"Asia’s ageing population continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, and the beauty industry has taken notice of this shift in demographics. New research from global market intelligence agency Mintel reveals that, in 2016, over one third (37%) of global beauty and personal care launches with anti-ageing claims were launched in Asia Pacific (APAC), up from 28% in 2014. This makes APAC the second most active region for anti-ageing BPC innovation after Europe (40%), according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD). In APAC, South Korea and Japan are leading the charge in anti-ageing beauty and personal care launches, each country accounting for 23% of APAC anti-ageing BPC launches respectively between 2014 and 2016, according to Mintel GNPD. Ranking third for anti-ageing BPC products is China at 22%; Thailand comes in fourth at 7%, and finally, India at 6% - rounding up the list of top five Asian markets for anti-ageing BPC innovation. Globally, the United Kingdom takes up the largest share of the pie, accounting for 16% of the world’s beauty and personal care innovation with anti-ageing claims between 2014 and 2016.  Comparatively, in the same time period, South Korea and Japan each account for 8% of all global anti-ageing BPC launches respectively, and China at 7%.  While the UK leads globally, Mintel GNPD reveals that anti-ageing BPC innovation in the country has seen a year-on-year dip: 19% in 2014; 17% in 2015; and 12% in 2016. “Ageing is a global issue, particularly in South Korea, Japan and China - countries that are most affected by a rapidly greying population. As such, it makes sense that these North Asian markets are at the forefront of anti-ageing beauty within Asia Pacific. The region’s growing silver generation is opening up opportunities for beauty and personal care brands looking to capitalise on the ‘grey wave’,” explains Sharon Kwek, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Innovation and Insights Analyst at Mintel. Meanwhile, it seems that the concept of ageing has infiltrated the younger population. This has given rise to the ‘early anti-ageing’ trend where younger consumers are starting to use anti-ageing beauty and personal care products that act as a preventive measure against early signs of ageing. Indeed, research from Mintel reveals that as many as 30% of urban Chinese consumers aged 20-49 describe their current skin condition as showing early signs of wrinkles or lines, while 39% of Chinese females aged 20-24 report using anti-ageing skincare products. In Thailand, 45% and 48% of metro male consumers aged 18 and over are concerned about the appearance of wrinkles and age spots respectively. Finally, Mintel research reveals that over half (55%) of urban females in Thailand think that the environment - including pollution - plays a part in the appearance of skin. What’s more, environmental concerns have led to the addition of new protection claims within the anti-ageing beauty and personal care products space, particularly against pollution. According to Mintel GNPD, launches of anti-ageing facial skincare products with an anti-pollution claim increased from 20% in 2015 to 35% in 2016 in APAC."
MakeUp In and Luxe Pack: “The winning pair!”,"Premium Beauty News - First question on everyone’s lips: What are the changes exactly in terms of countries and dates? Nathalie Grosdidier - The answer is quite clear! In general, both events are perfectly complementary and don’t compete with one another! Therefore there is no reason to merge them! On the other hand, this doesn’t mean that we cannot have common strategies in some parts of the world, where one of the events can take draw on the successful implementation of the other. In Europe, there are no changes. MakeUp in Paris will still take place in June, and Luxe Pack Monaco in October. Complementarity and efficiency. In the United States, there are no changes either, on the East Coast. Luxe Pack New York will still be held in May, and MakeUp in New York in September. There again, complementarity and efficiency.  But on the West Coast, the success of MakeUp in Los Angeles is a fantastic opportunity to launch a first Luxe Pack Los Angeles event, which we had always intended to do. And I can tell you that these two events that will take place at the same time in the same venue, but with two separate show entrances, already promise to be extremely successful. In Asia, the picture is unchanged. MakeUp in Seoul will take place next April 25th and 26th and Luxe Pack Shanghai will also be held in April, but two weeks earlier, on April 11th and 12th. MakeUp in Seoul is the Asian make-up industry’s favourite event. South Korea remains one of the flagship countries in the make-up sector in the region. Conversely, this time, it is the MakeUp In team that will draw on the historical success of Luxe Pack Shanghai by setting up for the first time, on April 11th and 12th, an area dedicated to make-up. There too, we expect a big success... We have already received a lot of registration requests. Premium Beauty News - Therefore in Asia, you will have two events organized a few weeks apart. Is it a problem? Sandra Maguarian - Not at all! In fact, manufacturers are divided into two categories. Those who want to exhibit in Seoul and those who want to be present in Shanghai. For most of them, they are not the same! They have different strategies. Which actually show the first registration requests received. We will launch the MakeUp in trade show in Shanghai the same way we do with all our other trade shows, with carefully selected exhibitors who have strong ambitions in the Chinese market. Premium Beauty News - Concerning Los Angeles and, Shanghai, how are the events organized in concrete terms? Danielle Rousseau - The general philosophy is: everyone keeps his identity! There will therefore be different entrances and a different show scenery. Concerning Los Angeles, and because the venue makes it possible, there will be a buffer zone between the two events, enabling visitors to make the link and in which will be present manufacturers who have a dual offer, both in make-up and perfume but also cosmetics.  For Shanghai, the idea is the same. Premium Beauty News - What about MakeUp in Sao Paulo? Sandra Maguarian - We have decided ""to let go"" the 2017 edition. As you know, the country is in deep economic crisis. Foreign manufacturers are reluctant to invest in this Brazil. Import taxes have reached record levels and inflation is on the rise again. ""To let go"" does not mean abandon this country. We will consider the opportunity to be back again next year. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any other ideas for synergy? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Of course, we always have fresh ideas up our sleeves! But we always bear in mind that we are fortunate enough to have our customers/partners joining us every year in two, three, four and even five trade shows in a row. We cannot expand the list of events forever. New events have to respond to a real need. But it seems obvious that these two concepts, Luxe Pack and MakeUp In, have upset the world of trade shows. They are targeted, efficient, higher-end and perfectly fit current and above all, future demands."
The new face of the Japanese beauty market,"Despite many economic and demographic challenges Japan - the second largest market in Asia (behind China) for personal care products - remains a must. With some of the highest incomes in the Asia Pacific region, Japanese consumers continue to enjoy respectable purchasing power.  According to consultancy Bain & Company, the country logs some US$22.7 billion in annual spending on top-end goods, ranking it as the world’s number two luxury market behind the United States. ""You shouldn’t forget that a big portion of the luxury clientele is here in Japan,"" Sidney Toledano, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, told AFP last April at the opening of Ginza Six, a 241-store building fully dedicated to luxury brands. ""It remains a strategic market for luxury."" Japan’s luxury market also benefited from the growing number of foreign shoppers visiting the country, in particular from China and Japan is hoping to land 40 million visitors in 2020 [1], the year that Tokyo hosts the Olympics. Last year, some six million Chinese visited, compared with 2.4 million in 2014.  For Chinese shoppers, Tokyo remains an attractive alternative to Hong Kong. ""Historically, (Japan has) been a very insular luxury market where 90 to 95 percent of the spending was by locals,"" said Joëlle de Montgolfier, Paris-based director of consumer and luxury product research at Bain & Company. But now some 30 percent of sales are generated by foreign visitors owing to tourism, she added. Another major shift of the Japanese market is the growing interest for natural products. Indeed, Japan is no exception to the growing interest and demand for healthier, safer and more ethically conscious products.  In addition, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that severely hit the Tohoku region, has accelerated the transformation to a more environmentally-conscious lifestyle. As Japanese brands lagged to enter this segment, the growth in demand for natural cosmetics has mostly benefited international brands.  An illustration to this trend was the massive participation of international natural and organic cosmetic brands to the Cosme Tokyo tradeshow. [2] However, Yuiko Mitani, research analyst for beauty and fashion industries at Euromonitor International, wrote in a recent blog post that “Japanese consumers are not buying into such strict natural/organic claims. Rather, a more general feel around natural/organic brands and products seems to be key attraction.”  While Euromonitor anticipates the natural/organic beauty market in Japan to continue steady growth, Yuiko Mitani says the definition of these products is likely to remain vague and “the growth of the officially certified area is forecast to remain limited”.  Furthermore, natural/organic beauty brands and products may face intensifying competition from other beauty trends such as derma-cosmetics with “stronger scientific backing”, due to Japanese consumers’ persistent preference for efficacy. In the future, the Japanese market should still undergo many changes. While tourism-related consumption partially offsets demographic decline, it remains highly dependent on the Yen level. Furthermore, younger people don’t have the money or the same interest in luxury brands anymore, said Naoko Kuga, a consumer lifestyle analyst at Tokyo’s NLI Research Institute."
"Haircare is a serious business for men, study finds","According to the ’Dove Men+Care 2017 Men’s Hair Census’, eight out of 10 men in the US see their crowning glory as a reflection of their personal style, and as something that helps them look both masculine and professional. Six out of 10 wish they had healthier-looking hair, while one out of five men even admitted to feeling jealous of a friend’s hair. When it comes to style preferences, seven out of 10 of the men surveyed said they wished the controversial ’man bun’ would disappear for good, while a whopping 90 percent admitted to touching up their hairstyle in the mirror at least once a day. In terms of styling products, gel, pomade and even hair spray were revealed to be the tools of choice for 60 per cent of the respondents. But perhaps the most surprising revelation of all was that one in five men would give up drinking for a month if it meant having stronger and healthier hair. Men’s Hair Habits – 60% of men named frequent washing as the key to maintaining strong, healthy hair
– More than 60% of all men style their hair every day and prefer to use hair gel, hair spray or pomade
– 90% of guys look in the mirror to fix their hair at least once a day The survey saw the beauty giant Dove’s male-only line Dove Men+Care team up with comedian W. Kamau Bell to quiz men in all 50 US states about their relationship with their manes. ""Hair is a big part of my identity and the Census really proves how, as a culture, guys are putting an importance on the look and style of their hair,"" said Bell. ""I was surprised that men from all walks of life held hair in such a high regard, and yet reflect their identity through hair in many different ways."" The conversation around male grooming has become a hot topic recently, with an increased awareness and availability of speciality beauty products for men. Clinique’s Sonic System Deep Cleansing Brush, brewery Carlsberg’s shampoo, conditioner and body lotion trio, and Dove Men+Care’s beauty bars are just some of the high-profile launches that have helped drive the market over the last few years."
Vegan makeup brands in the spotlight this summer,"Dubai-based beauty brand Luscious Cosmetics caused great excitement earlier this month, thanks to its long-awaited launch in the US. The brand, which was founded in 2007, specialises in pigment-rich, long-lasting products that are designed to withstand hot climates and humidity, and are suitable for customers looking for both vegan and halal makeup. Bestsellers include its face contour kits and powder blushes. Website: www.iloveluscious.com Vegan makeup mogul Kat Von D has always been a vocal animal rights activist as well as a highly successful animal-free cosmetics entrepreneur, so it was no surprise when the star announced earlier this month that she had been hard at work on a vegan makeup brush collection. According to the star, the new brushes are made from ""the highest grade synthetic fibres that mimic the same product distribution you would get from animal-based bristles"". Website: www.katvondbeauty.com British cult hair dye brand Bleach London delighted fans earlier this summer with the launch of its inaugural makeup collection. Comprising pressed glitter pots, lip colors, eyeshadows, highlighters and brushes, the line is entirely vegan and cruelty-free, and even comes wrapped up in recycled packaging for extra green points.

“Face yoga”: the new anti-aging skincare trend?,"The concept involves using exercises to tone, lift and sculpt muscles in the face and counteract sagginess and puffiness for a rejuvenated appearance. Back in 2015, a pop-up called SkinGym Face Fitness established itself in New York offering a workout called ’Face Love’. Its UK equivalent, FaceGym, is still going strong, with a location in the London’s flagship Selfridges department store as well as a stand-alone studio in the British capital.  FaceGym describes itself as ""the UK’s only gym studio for the face and the original non-invasive face workout"", offering clients the chance to have their muscles stretched and sculpted by dedicated ’face trainers’. This year, the trend reached LA too, thanks to the city’s new Skin Fit Gym, which hosts dedicated face training classes for individuals and groups. ""Face workouts are the new facials,"" says FaceGym’s founder, Inge Theron. But what if you can’t get to a brick-and-mortar studio for a session? Luckily, facial workouts are also thriving online, giving rise to gurus like British ’Face Yoga Expert’ Danielle Collins, who guides followers through various facial exercises via a series of YouTube tutorials.  One of Collins’ most popular videos, published this March, is aimed at smoothing out frown lines. She suggests gently massaging the area between the eyebrows, as well as lightly tapping the forehead and gently pinching and pulling at the eyebrows to relieve tension and help stimulate the production of collagen. FaceGym also published an article this April detailing a series of DIY facial exercises that can aid lymphatic drainage and reduce the appearance of under-eye circles. Is face yoga set to become a mainstream beauty trend? It remains to be seen."
Skincare-inspired benefits in high demand among colour cosmetics users in the USA,"According to the market research firm, consumer desire for more simplified makeup routines is resulting in stalled growth across the individual colour cosmetics segments in the USA.  Mintel forecasts colour cosmetics sales to increase by two percent in 2017 to reach US$11.0 billion, with lip cosmetics, facial cosmetics and eye cosmetics each growing around two percentage points slower this year compared to 2016 [2]. Despite this drop in sales growth, Mintel research indicates skincare-inspired benefits are in high demand among colour cosmetics users as the lines between facial makeup and facial skincare continue to blur. Anti-aging and moisturizing claims (44 percent respectively) top the list of benefits female facial cosmetics users are interested in seeing from their facial makeup. Of course, age plays a significant role in the benefits consumers look for. Not surprising, female consumers aged 55+ are most likely to be interested in products with anti-aging claims (68 percent vs 18 percent of women aged 18-34), while those aged 18-34 are most likely to seek products that treat acne (24 percent vs 2 percent of women 55+), are for sensitive skin (23 percent vs 9 percent) or minimize pores (23 percent vs 11 percent). However, it appears that women of all ages show the same enthusiasm for makeup that creates the appearance of flawless skin as more than one quarter (28 percent) of facial cosmetics users say they’re interested in facial makeup that evens skin tone, including 28 percent of women 18-34 and 29 percent of women 55+. Interest in products that improve the skin’s appearance extends to new product innovation as well, as pore-minimizing products (29 percent) and colour-correcting palettes (24 percent) garner the strongest appeal from female colour cosmetics users. ""Overall, the colour cosmetics market experienced moderate growth in 2017. However, products which do not align with the current ‘natural look’ trend, such as lip gloss, bronzer and eye shadow, resulted in slower gains across the category segments. While the market is saturated and some women are turning to value brands to cut costs, facial makeup products that offer relevant skincare benefits present a bright spot that could reinvigorate sales,” said Shannon Romanowski, Director, Mintel Reports, Health, Household, Beauty and Personal Care.  “As consumers increasingly express interest in facial makeup that incorporates skincare-related claims, it’s likely these claims will continue expanding into the cosmetics category. Anti-aging and moisturizing claims are appealing to older women, and can be particularly successful in light of an aging population that is typically less engaged in the category.”"
Lipsticks: What are the preferences of consumers around the world?,"Perfect Corp, the editor of a suite of augmented reality makeup apps, has analysed the preferences of the 280 million users of its YouCam Makeup flagship app.  The data provide a large array of information on global and regional lipstick trends: – Millennial pink is the most preferred lip color globally. Millennial pink proves to be a trending favourite across the globe. Over 20% of lipstick try-ons in the United States and the UK are Millennial pink shades, and 15% of lip colour try-ons in China and Japan are Millennial pinks. – All shades of pink dominate in the West, while classic reds are favoured in Asia. Overall pink is the most preferred colour in the United States and the UK, with almost 50% of the top lip colours being pink shades, significantly higher than the other countries with pinks making up only 20% - 35% of all try-ons. China shows the most diverse lipstick colour trials overall YouCam Makeup’s Beauty AR Reveals Global Lipstick Trends in Celebration of National Lipstick Day (Graphic: Business Wire) with purples, oranges and lighter sheer shades taking the top spots. In contrast, Korean users prefer bold darker pinks, purples, and reds, playing off many of the K-Beauty trends that continue to surface. – Lip finishes matter, with matte ruling the West and sheer reigning in Asia. “Matte is a fact” in the United States and the UK, with over 40% matte lip try-ons monthly. Users in East Asia prefer sheer textures overall. China favours sheer (40%) and satin (28%) finishes. Users in Japan clearly favour sheer lip finishes, taking the top spot with over 50% of the total try-ons in a month. The K-Beauty fans in Korea favour matte (35%) and sheer (33%) lip finishes as their top choices. – The two-toned lip trend is the fastest growing globally. While ombré lips became popular last year, two-toned lips (different colours on top and bottom lips) are now the fastest growing trend. AR try-ons of two-toned lip colors have grown 74% this summer, indicating a huge interest in this new lip style. Two-tone lips were first noted on the New York Fashion Week runway in Jason Wu’s Fall 2017 collection, and now beauty brands such as Estée Lauder and Laneige have also released two-toned lipsticks in their collections."
Jelly: beauty’s latest obsession,"The trend was arguably sparked back in 2016, when millennial beauty brand Glossier debuted its crowd-sourced ’Milk Jelly Cleanser’, which promises to dissolve makeup and provide a deep but gentle cleanse suitable for everyday use. The gel-like product can be used on wet or dry skin and claims to reinforce the skin’s barrier to safeguard against dehydration. Fast forward to this summer, and jelly is going mainstream. The Japanese beauty brand Shiseido recently launched a ’Fresh Jelly Lotion’ as part of its brand-new ’Waso’ range, which is rooted in natural, organic ingredients. The name comes from the lotion’s gel-like texture, but also from its star ingredient: white jelly mushroom. The fungus is said to encourage a healthy, dewy complexion. Other brands getting in on the act include Estée Lauder, which recently released a ’Nutritious Micro-Algae Pore Purifying Cleansing Jelly’ that claims to lather into a silky foam in order to remove impurities via a combination of micro-algaes. And June saw the US brand Drunk Elephant, which focuses on non-toxic skincare solutions, unveil its ’Beste Jelly Cleanser’, which features virgin marula oil to nourish the skin and glycerin to hydrate it. But despite its sophisticated reinvention, jelly has retained its fun side. One of the quirkiest jellied skincare product launches this year comes courtesy of Boscia, which made waves earlier this summer with its new ‘Charcoal Jelly Ball Cleanser’. The squishy, balloon-shaped product that features activated black charcoal to extract impurities, proving that jelly can be a playful way to seriously step up your beauty routine."
Colour cosmetics continue to boost the UK beauty market,"Britain’s love of makeup products shows no signs of fading, as Mintel predicts the market to grow by 36% and reach £2.5 billion by 2021 (EUR2.85 billion). Today, as many as 83% of UK women wear make-up. The most purchased products within the last 12 months were classic make-up bag staples: mascara (57%), lipstick (49%) and liquid/cream foundation (46%). According to Mintel, the face and lip colour segments saw the biggest rise in sales in the colour cosmetics category in 2016, driven in part by the ‘no make-up make-up look’ and colour correction trends. While sales of face colour products rose by 10% to reach £580 million in 2016, sales of lip colour grew by 11% to £304 million. “The colour cosmetics category continues to show strong year-on-year growth, particularly driven by the fashion for the ‘no make-up make-up’ look, which requires more products, time and skill than the name might suggest,” said Roshida Khanom, Associate Director, Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. Actually, over a third (35%) of British women surveyed by Mintel say they use make-up to subtly enhance their natural features. When considering at why women turn towards the make-up box, tiredness is the leading motivator. As many as 41% of women say they wear make-up to look less tired, followed by 39% who use it to cover blemishes and 25% who use make-up to look more youthful.  Meanwhile, Mintel research highlights the emotional ties UK women have when ‘putting on their face’. Over three in five (64%) women who wear make-up say it makes them feel confident and 43% say it makes them feel attractive, compared to just 16% who feel more professional and 15% who feel empowered by wearing make-up. What’s more, it seems that being selfie-ready is also an important factor for younger make-up users in particular. Almost a quarter (22%) of women aged 16-24 wear make-up to create a camera-ready look, up from an average of 7%. As far as the prestige beauty market is concerned, makeup remains the main growth driver in the UK.  According to The NPD Group, “the most impressive growth both in store and online is from make-up which grew by 7% in store to reach £668 million. Online sales of prestige make-up increased by 45% to £120 million in 2016.”"
France: Sales of prestige lipsticks reach new records,"According to The NPD Group, one of the world leaders in market research, sales of prestige lipsticks have increased by 31% in value over the last two years in France. Today, more than one in five makeup products sold in the prestige retail channel in France is a lipstick. A total of 3.2 million lipsticks were sold in this channel during the 12 months of the survey period (May 2016 - April 2017). With a 22% market share, sales of lipsticks top the make-up category in volume.  However, they rank second in value, just behind foundations, with a total turnover of 90.3 million euros annually. Lipstick sales have recorded a double-digit growth for the second year in a row, with a 14% increase in value this year, representing an additional gain of 3.2 million euros (year-to-date to April 2017 vs. 2016). ""All indicators are green for lipsticks in France, with a strong contribution from new launches (39 products have been launched in less than one year compared with 28 last year) and also with a steady health of older products that remain on their double-digit growth path. The craze for lipsticks goes well beyond French borders: the segment is up 21% in Italy and Spain, and 38% in the United Kingdom,” said Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert for Europe at The NPD Group. According to analysts from The NPD Group, the success of lipsticks could be explained by their small size and small price. Small and packed in elegant and practical tubes, lipsticks are easily transportable, so women can take them anywhere and use them at any time of the day. Lipsticks are also the most affordable products sold by major prestige brands.  “For an average price of 28 euros in French perfumeries and department stores, women of all ages gain access to prestigious brands,” says The NPD Group. However, lipsticks are also an object of desire, which generates impulse purchases from consumers. Far from the basic usefulness of mascaras or foundations. For instance, according to The NPD Group, the choice of a lipstick is increasingly inspired by fashion and internet trends. ""Social networks and online tutorials played a key role in the success of lipsticks. Trends are multiplying and constantly changing, from lips jewellery to contouring or colour overlays: the playground has no limits and the market adapts almost in real time, offering new textures, such as liquid mats for instance, wider and bolder colour palettes and more and more product benefits,"" continues Mathilde Lion. While women continue to test colours and textures in stores (sales grew by +10% in beauty and department stores), The NPD Group also notes online lipstick sales are skyrocketing, with sales multiplied by 2.5 in one year. The online channel now accounts for 7% of sales, thanks to the attractiveness of the channel for young consumers and the power of recommendation of social media. Brands are also strong sales driver. Chanel, Christian Dior, Guerlain, Lancôme and Yves Saint Laurent, the five top prestige lipstick brands (in alphabetical order), share more than three-quarters of the market value."
The European cosmetics market slows down in 2016,"Europe remains the global flagship producer of cosmetic products. In 2016, the European cosmetics market was valued at EUR 77 billion, making Europe the largest market for cosmetic products in the world. However, growth in the European market has slowed significantly in 2016 compared to 2015, according to figures released by Cosmetics Europe. Several countries recorded a significant recession, in particular Denmark (-14.3%) and the United Kingdom (-11.4%). As far as products are concerned, all categories are down from 2015, with the exception of makeup (+ 0.8%). Skin care and toiletries remain the most important product categories in Europe, followed by hair care and fragrances. In the context, international trade is a critical component of the industry. Nearly EUR 18 billion worth of cosmetic products were exported from the European Union in 2016. Such exports are particularly important in countries strongly affected by the Euro crisis (such as Spain and Italy) where the cosmetics sector is helping to secure national economic recovery. France and Germany, followed by Italy and Spain are the main European exporters of cosmetic products."
Facial masks remain a coveted beauty item among urban Chinese consumers,"According to the global market intelligence agency, in 2016, the category saw a steady increase of 26% in growth, hitting a sales value of RMB 15,218 million, up from RMB 12,040 million in 2015. In comparison, the overall growth rate of China’s beauty and personal care market stood at 8% in 2016, making the facial mask category one of the most dynamic in the country’s beauty and personal care market. Mintel estimates China’s facial mask segment to grow at a CAGR of 15.8% in value over the next five years, reaching RMB 31,746 million by 2021. “In recent years, facial masks have successfully penetrated women’s facial skin care regimes in most parts of Asia, like China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, to name a few. The growing usage of facial masks in wider Asia is largely because of the beauty item’s ability to offer consumers different skin care benefits in a convenient manner and short turnaround time. Today, the usage of facial masks in China is commonplace, and the so-loved item will continue to be coveted among Chinese women,” said Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst of Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. Furthermore, it seems Chinese consumers love of facial masks is also causing them to turn to social media. Mintel research reveals as many as one in three (33%) surveyed urban Chinese female consumers who use facial masks [1] purchase the skin care product via the social application, WeChat. This purchase channel seems to have grown in popularity as only 10% of these female facial mask users reported purchasing facial masks via WeChat in 2016. “The success of online channels has contributed to the growth of China’s beauty and personal care market, and these portals will continue to bring momentum to the wider industry, and especially, the facial masks category in the years ahead. However, there is no strong brand loyalty in the facial masks category as our research shows that there is similar interest among female facial mask consumers to try out premium masks and new brands. Consumers’ growing demand for innovative products will require dynamic and vivid response from facial mask brands”, highlighted Jessica Jin, Beauty and Personal Care Associate Director at Mintel. According to Mintel, females in China, today, are increasingly accepting of the idea of premium facial masks, as Mintel research reveals just over half (54%) of female facial mask users surveyed [2] in urban China have purchased a facial mask priced RMB 30 or above (per sheet) in the six months to January 2017. Additionally, a similar proportion (52%) of these facial mask consumers have tried out new brands during the same time period. Research from Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD) reveals an increase in the number of new facial mask launches with masstige and prestige pricing in China from 2015 to 2016. The proportion of masstige and prestige launches in China’s facial mask market has risen from 14% and 3% in 2015, to 25% and 8% in 2016 (respectively). When it comes to usage occasions, Mintel data shows that seven in 10 (69%) surveyed urban Chinese females have used sheet masks in the evenings in the last six months [3], and only 17% have used the mask variant in the mornings. While evenings remain the major usage occasion of facial masks, it seems mornings still hold potential for brands. Mintel research shows that morning usage is gradually being accepted by facial mask consumers as 47% of surveyed urban Chinese females [4] have used at least one type of facial mask in the morning in the six months to January 2017. Bringing attention to morning usage, among all the different types of facial masks, rinse-off masks have the highest usage penetration among China’s urban female consumers, followed by sheet masks. One third (33%) of those surveyed who have an MPI (monthly personal income) of RMB 8,000 or above have used rinse-off masks in the morning, compared to 20% of all urban Chinese female respondents [5].  Generally speaking, Mintel’s study show that high earners consumers are more likely to use a larger variety of the product. When considering the types of facial masks brought to market across the Asia Pacific region in 2016, Mintel GNPD reveals that 40% and 50% of new facial mask launches in South Korea and Japan bear the anti-aging claim (respectively), while only 25% claim the same in China. Finally, as many as 47% of female facial mask users surveyed [6] have used facial masks with pore-refining purposes, while 39% have used facial masks that claim to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, according to findings from Mintel. “New product innovation is important to companies and brands looking to stand out in China’s facial masks market. Anti-aging is an expected avenue for facial mask brands to tap into as Chinese consumers’ skincare routines are highly influenced by neighbouring countries, such as South Korea and Japan, where early uptake of anti-aging products is now a trend,” Jessica concludes."
Beauty under the influence of the GenNext,"Premium Beauty News - To what extent does the GenNext relationship with digital technologies impact the beauty industry? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - As we have already highlighted, the reasons behind this beauty culture among the GenNext are education, first, since their mothers applied cream on their skins from a very early age, then their exposure to the media, which initiated them very early to the importance of beauty in our image-oriented society, their social bond, directly related to self-staging on social networks, and their information medium: they can access the Internet right in the hollow of their hands and get regularly informed of new launches or beauty looks. This “beauty addict” generation is constantly in search of the latest trends and good deals. Two years after our first report, it seemed obvious to us that we needed to follow the evolution of this generation, given the boom of social media and how deeply it changed our relationship with beauty, trends, and the buying journey. That is why we called our report GenNext - Connected Beauty. And to better understand these new shopping dynamics, we completed our study with a survey conducted among 200 young girls living in the biggest French and American cities, as well as interviews of about twenty of them in the streets. Premium Beauty News - What are the main implications for brands? Leïla Rochet-Podvin -  There are multiple implications for brands, so we have tackled this issue in detail. One of their essential drivers is to turn from a product brand to a lifestyle concept. For this generation, beauty is part of a real way of life, as can be seen with the study results. More than eight young girls out of ten in France and the USA like being complimented on their style, and beauty products play a significant role in asserting it. Beautification outmatches the notion of attractiveness to become a tool for assertiveness and empowerment, for stressing their own chosen personality shaped by beauty products. There is this new relationship of “intimacy” with brands, a complicity they like to share, since beauty is one of the main discussion topics on the web and social networks. The disruption of levers of influence is another consequence. Clearly, “indie” brands (alternative and independent brands) boast a powerful personality with strong values and excel in the art of social conversation and their ability to gather their community together – a community that is proud to follow them. These new brands no longer build up on a notion of expertise through fashion (1960s), Makeup Artists, or doctors (late 1980s), they draw their legitimacy from their unrestrained, disruptive creativity and skilfulness in controlling social media dynamics. For example, the Milk Makeup brand, launched in early 2016 in the USA, celebrates freedom of expression. It is an ode to the notion of acceptance of everyone, whatever the appearance, complexion, and style. They advocate universality throughout the world. Their almost political, activist stance makes them not only a makeup brand, but a tool to express one’s own personality. Premium Beauty News - What main transformations should they get ready for? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - First, boundaries are falling into pieces. Whether they be boundaries between segments or distribution channels, competitiveness is getting global, as products are increasingly available on the Internet. Consumers are freeing themselves from the notions of space and standard boundaries that had made up our industry. This phenomenon makes it necessary for brands to get more fluid, fast, and flexible, and question their customs. They need to show both bold and creative. Then, brands willing to target this generation should be able to create a bond with their customers and devise “relational” beauty products that will generate conversations, intimacy, exchange, and sharing. But beware, this target consists of connoisseurs, so products should be flawless and offer a real added value. On the other hand, there is a transformation in the shopping experience and in the new dynamics of influence when it comes to buying a cosmetic product. To a Beauty Native, purchasing a beauty product involves a lot and results from a real investigative work: peers’ or influencers’ opinions are essential in this. The study conducted by Poshly [1] in the USA had revealed that only 7% of Millennials consumers trusted shop assistants’ recommendations. So, there is a legitimacy to regain at the point of sale, and it is crucial for brands and distributors alike to make sure they are attractive to this target.

MakeUp in Paris preview: New trends are marked by pencils,"Alkos Cosmétiques will present the Tattoo Lip Contour, which was selected among other innovations for the show’s Innovation Tree. With its fluid texture and semi-permanent felt-tip fitted with moisturizing and emollient actives, it keeps the lip contour coloured for hours and replumps the lips, while preserving hydration. It can also be used as a colouring base to any gloss or lipstick for a long-lasting result. Schwan Cosmetics also banked on their know-how to develop a new, long-lasting, covering, and nourishing product: RetractMatic Divine Texture. Available both in matte and semi-matte versions, this lip liner and stick works precisely on lip contour and coverage for a perfect result up to six hours. Its waterproof, shea-butter-based formula is free from any mineral oil, preservative, paraffin, and animal derivatives. Faber-Castell Cosmetics will introduce two concepts with electric colours for a shiny, cheeky look. The Magnetic Electric plastic pencil range, with its Slim Plastic Magnetic eyeliner and lip liner, also counts on a long-lasting effect to highlight acid/pop colours. Its gel texture makes the application easier for a super long-lasting finish, up to 8 hours for the lips, and 16 for the eyeliner. This line with astonishing shades ranges from classic to electric colours and from matte to metallic effects. It can be easily personalized and is now available with a shiny, matte, pearly, or metallic finish. For pop lips day and night, Alkos will also spotlight their Moonlight Kiss Fluo, this time in a Jumbo Pencil version. The Jumbo plastic pencil can be sharpened to deliver the Moonlight Kiss formula, which looks like a sparkling lipstick with pure fluorescent colours during the day, and makes lips appear fluorescent under typical black or blue club lights at night. The product is available in orange and fluorescent pink. Urban Amazon, the other concept developed by Faber-Castell Cosmetics, draws conquering lines. This eye & lip liner concept contained in a gel formula offers vibrant colours and an accurate application. The formula dries in 40 seconds for a long-lasting finish and its marked pigmentation provides a strong colouring effect. The pencil is fitted with a retractable tip and is available in bright and transparent shades. The Color Block Eyeliner Marker range by Alkos Cosmétiques has been enriched with new shades: purple, green, brown, and bright shades – pretty rare on the eyeliner segment. Also in the Alkos Cosmétiques Eyeliner category, the Slim Metal’Eye plastic pencils deliver a formula with an ultra-sensorial application to create a film with a waterproof metallic effect as soon as the first line drawn. As for Schwan Cosmetics, they will showcase Dip Pen with Ebony Texture, a high-performance liquid eyeliner with a matte finish. The application gets ultra-fine or thicker, depending on the applicator, and draws a precise, intense black line. Waterproof Dip Pen with Ebony Texture quickly dries and promises to last all day – at least 17 hours – ideal for humid climates. Its formula is free from parabens and IPBC. The Alkos Cosmétiques Filling Brow Marker is a semi-permanent marker which gives the illusion of natural, denser brows. Other than its easy application and long-lasting performance, its colour is stable and does not turn while drying – obviously a “plus” for such a product. The Brow Pomade Pencil by Schwan Cosmetics also creates a natural effect. The ultra-fine pearls in the formula make the application more even and perfect the coverage. Thanks to its long-lasting effect, this new product based on organic synthetic waxes is adapted to the most humid climates. Lastly, also in the “pen makeup” peripheral world, it should be highlighted that the Alkos Cosmétiques company will also showcase the HD Cover Stick Jumbo Twist, a concealer with a powdered result, as well as travel size sticks: Exfoliating Charcoal Stick, a 2-in-1 mask which exfoliates and cleanses the skin’s pores, thanks to its natural charcoal extracts, while preserving hydration, and the Stick with me Travel Cleanser, a travel-size solid cleanser to be emulsified - ideal for travelling."

Is protection the future of nail care?,"Beauty consumers are becoming increasingly concerned over the negative effects of environmental stressors on their appearance and this trend is also impacting colour cosmetics.  “Nail brands are therefore exploring new treatment concepts: for instance, overnight nail products, reminiscent of night creams, were launched by Nails Inc in 2016 with the Overnight Detox Mask, and Sally Hansen recommends overnight use with the Moisture Rehab product,” writes Charlotte Libby, in a recent blog post. Furthermore, according to the market research firm, almost one third of US nail colour users are concerned about chemicals in the products they use.  Mintel expects protecting claims such as anti-pollution and UV protection to increase in 2017.  In 2016, Nails Inc has already released a range of nail polishes formulated with charcoal to protect nails against pollutants. However, other trends may also impact nail care in the future.  The search for healthy food, for instance, could lead to the apparition of new ingredients  inspired from green detox diets such as kale, turmeric, carrots, milk and almond. According to Mintel, there are opportunities for nail polish brands to further promote their superfood ingredients.  “Additionally, with the Pantone Colour of the Year 2017 being Greenery, brands can explore green vegetable polishes to match this shade.” Hot on the heels of this trend, in November 2016 French do-it-yourself cosmetics company Aroma-Zone announced the launch of a 100% vegan nail varnish range based on bio-sourced, plant-derived solvents and pigments. The anti-ageing claims remain relatively untapped in the nail area, Mintel points.  “Further innovation is needed in colour cosmetics to match the demand from older women. As the population of mature countries across the world ages, nail brands can do more to target senior consumers,” Charlotte Libby writes.  However, other claims such as hydrating, strengthening and smoothing may also help to attract both younger and older women while expanding the scope of nail protection. Last but not least, Mintel also identifies new opportunities in the improvement of nail varnish removal solutions. “Nail polish removal can be harsh on nails and cuticles, therefore innovation to increase nail care benefits of removal can appeal to nail polish users, and encourage more frequent application.”"
China Beauty Expo is taking the beauty world by storm,"China beauty Expo, which was acquired by Informa in 2014, has steadily grown from the main Chinese beauty event to major international fair.  “In just three years the trade show has added to new halls (about 100,000 sqm) taken the entire exhibition centre and now totals 250 000 sqm, making it the biggest B2B beauty trade show in the world,” explains Claudia Bonfiglioli, the show’s International Director. This year’s edition hosted more than 3,000 exhibitors including cosmetic ingredients suppliers, formulators, packaging suppliers, manufacturers of machinery and equipment, OEM/ODM/OBM and brands. The supply side was gathered under the CosmeTech banner, representing about 1,000 exhibitors, including 30% international companies such as Intercos, Fiabila, Albéa, Cosmax, HCT, etc. “Made in China packaging and machinery is attracting buyers from India, the USA and elsewhere as they have become more innovative and qualitative,” emphasizes Ying Sang, CBE’s Deputy General Manager. As far as finished products are concerned, the show hosted over 2,000 exhibitors with a Hall entirely dedicated to trends and innovation (N5) and another to E-Commerce and WeChat (E6).  This Cosmetics section gathered both products dedicated to the retail markets and products for the professional market.  Skin Care and Toiletries remain the biggest sectors of the show followed by Color Cosmetic, Hair Care and Accessories. Informa aims at bringing more international exhibitors and visitors to the Chinese show. “The Cosmetics sectors welcomed 20% international exhibitors with the biggest contingent coming from neighbouring Korea accounting for 302 companies. There are also new country pavilions, which were brought to the show in recent years with Spain, Germany, Italy, Japan for instance,” highlights Claudia Bonfiglioli. France, which is still considered by Chinese professionals as the initiator of innovations in Beauty, was the country of honour this year. In order to promote innovation, the organizers partnered with design agency Cent Degrès to create a Beauty District at the heart of the show, to host a museum (in partnership with Grasse Fragrance Museum), a library (Scent Library) and a beauty village. The aim was also to offer visitors a different feel, right next to innovative concepts/brands in Hall N5. CBE 2017 attracted 412,500 visitors from 80 regions and countries hailing from all buying networks, including department stores, shopping malls, supermarkets, specialty and chain stores, beauty salons, nail salons, SPA, hair salons, plastic surgery hospitals, e-commerce, manufactories, supply chain decision makers and purchasers, R&D researchers, packaging designers, design agencies, etc. “Recognised for its dynamic growth, China Beauty Expo offers opportunities to Chinese and International exhibitors to meet qualified local and international buyers. We have created a unique program of conferences and networking opportunities to federate the worldwide beauty industry. The mission of the show is to reaffirm every year its leadership in Asia and to federate global industry players from manufacturing to finish products and distribution,” states Ying Sang. China Beauty Expo has known a huge increase recently in quality and numbers and is the impressive demonstration that the Chinese market is moving fast and catching up with the rest of the world. Chinese companies are innovating and Chinese brands are coming into the global market with unlimited means in terms of people, money and willpower. Beauty and mobile devices The Chinese market is increasingly led by mobile devices with the boom of online/mobile transactions in the last 2 years (+62,2% in 2016). Chinese consumers were late adopters but jumped from cash to mobile payments. WeChat has become a dominent player with over 1.1 bilion users (as of January 2017) and offers features such as payments, shopping and exchange platform for users, on top of social media features. In practice, it means that an individual can become a cosmetic retailer in just a few clicks. Testifying of this phenonemon the Hall dedicated to E-Commerce and WeChat welcomed brands exclusively available on the platform with the example of Mageline being the biggest brand on WeChat today!"
Middle East: Luxury in the age of digitalisation,"""Internet is instrumental in transforming GCC luxury consumers who now are very aware of labels, prices, trends and products, and can find almost any item on the web. Faced with this level of volatility and exigence, we shouldn’t push these consumers, but instead let them pull,” explains Anthony Chalhoub, Co-CEO of the Chalhoub Group, one of the main distributors of luxury products in the region. Indeed, regional prospects are exciting: although e-commerce in the region has been lagging at 2.6% of total retail sales vs 7% globally in 2015, with luxury products’ online sales amounting to only US$200-US$230 million and 2.5% of the segment’s total sales in the GCC, the e-commerce contribution to the Gulf high-end market is expected to reach a total value of US$1.5 billion within four years, driven by young demographics, more value-conscious consumers and ambitious digital pure players. The GCC is at a demographic turning point. People under 30 - Generation Y (also known as millennials, born between 1975 and 2000) and Generation Z (born in 2000 and onwards) - now form half of the population.  However, despite their young age, GCC millennials and Gen-Zers have a high disposable income, and live in some of the world’s richest countries. These generations are extremely digital savvy, digital tools and media are part of their way of life.  Many young consumers have never known any other type of interaction with brands but through digital channels.  Mobile apps, websites and social media are their first and most important touchpoints. This digital inclination fuses with higher levels of education and frequent travels to give GCC millennials, in particular, sophistication, assurance and voice. Their knowledge of international trends, pricing and labels, allows them to pass quick and confident judgement - which they readily share. Like their peers all around the globe, Arab youth want to make an impact. For example, beyond quality, heritage or status, young Arabs now look at brands from different perspectives, such as social responsibility. “Regional luxury players have no choice but to affirm their presence, speak and interact with their audience in a very honest and transparent manner - and almost in real time. Modern Arab clients also expect us to have e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, and we have to give them what they are looking for. We all have a lot to do, from adapting our websites so that they are user-friendly and accessible, to training our teams to be fully involved in the omnichannel, as the store and the digital properties now must complement one another - all the while protecting the brand’s DNA. It’s a learning curve, but in one way or another, we are all moving forward in that direction,” adds Anthony Chalhoub. For the Chalhoub Group, the omnicanal seems to be the only alternative to satisfy the consumer. Retailers must offer a unique and extraordinary experience in the shop, allowing consumers to touch and test, exactly what the online media cannot offer. In parallel, they must redouble efforts on the net. For brands, full-fledged social media strategies, influencer marketing and content/context marketing should help offer customers the complete, seamless experience that they seek. “Our strategy is to get a better knowledge of our audience, avoiding the ‘spray and pay’ habit to rather initiate a real dialogue with them, both physically and digitally - because the future of luxury cannot be one of the two: consumers’ experience must seamlessly connect offline and online. To be truly omnichannel means to stop focusing on the way to deliver products and services, and to put customers at the centre instead. We are at the beginning of this digital disruption of the luxury retail industry.  To be truly omnichannel means to stop focusing on the way to deliver products and services, and to put customers at the centre instead. We are at the beginning of this digital disruption of the luxury retail industry. Tomorrow, there will be fewer flagship stores, offering a uniquew, outstanding, and better customer experience; and probably more community stores, offering simultaneously a personal contact with the consumers and a digital connection - which will allow the customer to access a broad choice and navigate solid, relevant e-commerce and m-commerce platforms,” concludes Patrick Chalhoub - Co-CEO, Chalhoub Group."
China Beauty Expo opens 22nd edition in Shanghai,"China Beauty Expo 2017 will host about 3,000 exhibitors (vs. 2,568 in 2016) on over 250,000 sqm of exhibition space, among those will be more than 1,200 international players from 26 countries and regions (increase of 90% in two years), including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK and USA.  International exhibitors include numerous renowned players such as Fiabila (France), Intercos (Italy), Cosmax (Korea), Kolmar (Korea), LG (Korea), Symrise (Germany), L’Oréal (France), and Shiseido (Japan). France has been chosen as the Country of Honour for this year’s edition.  “The appointment further cements the ongoing collaboration between CBE and France. French exhibitors will use CBE as an international platform to showcase the latest and best of beauty products, technology and services from France,” explain the organisers. French beauty brands are gathered in hall E2 under the Cosmetic Valley flagship and in hall E1 to hall E7 where more than 800 French brands are hosted in their distributors’ stands.

All that glitters: Japan ’nailists’ turn manicures into art,"The nail artist - whose designs are finding Internet fame - was one of the chief attractions at last week’s Tokyo Nail Forum, where catwalk models flashed their electric-pink digits and visitors dressed up their fingers in almost every imaginable way.  The event was held on 15-17 May 2017 within the Beautyworld Japan tradeshow in Tokyo. Glow-in-the-dark nails, glittery blue ones with red flames, nails with yellow smiley faces and unicorns were all on offer. Or how about turning your hands into a recreation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves?  ""People tell me my design is like a fusion of Japan and the US,"" said the manicurist, who moved to Los Angeles several years ago.  ""I say it’s Tokyo-meets-Hollywood."" Nail art is taking off in the US and is already popular in China and South Korea. But beauty-conscious Japan is ground-zero for the business.  The domestic market has doubled in a decade to 220 billion yen ($1.98 billion) annually, according to the Japan Nailist Association (JNA), which said there are nearly 25,000 nail salons across the country. It’s been growing since Japan was introduced to US-made artificial nails about four decades ago. “Japanese manicurists are very detail oriented and always want to improve their skills,"" said JNA board member Mihori Kinoshita on the sidelines of the three-day nail show. “That may be linked to the Japanese attention to craftsmanship.” But what really super-charged the sector was the introduction of a soft gel that lasts for up to two months, far longer than traditional manicures which start chipping in about a week, said Koji Kawamoto, president of an Osaka-based nail product manufacturer. Mr Kawamoto has participated in the Tokyo Nail Forum for two decades. ""At first there were just a few companies doing this but the market has grown a lot over the years,"" said the industry veteran.  ""The number of manicurists has skyrocketed,"" he added. Some 60 exhibitors had booths at the show, advertising nails adorned with stones, ribbons, flowers or ultra-long talons that appeal to visitors like Mizuho Mobu.  The 25-year-old manicurist sported aqua-green claws encrusted with fake diamonds that cost 12,000 yen and took three hours to apply. Many designs take several hours or more to complete and cost 10,000 yen and up. Most clients are women although nail art is also popular among some men who like to paint their nails the colour of favourite sports teams on special occasions. Hand-drawn paintings are also a big hit in Japan. But some people don’t have the patience, prompting Britney Tokyo to make some of her designs available in a quick and easy sticker format.  ""Painting was also popular in the US as well until last year but now fewer people want to spend such a long time waiting,"" she said. ""Customers don’t want to hang around for two or three hours."" In nail-art as in manga and animated movies, Japan influences the rest of Asia, from South Korea to China, explains Mihori Kinoshita. ""We built the industry.  I remember doing a seminar in Taiwan 25 years ago when this art was beginning to interest other Asian countries. Then I went to teach in Shanghai and Hong Kong (China). Students also come in Japan from other Asian countries to learn more aboit nail art."""
"Millennial beauty consumers embrace ’the natural look,’ finds Mintel","While Millennial consumers are slightly less likely to prefer the natural look, they are more likely (71 percent) to actually wear a natural makeup look than female consumers overall (68 percent). The majority of Millennial women report spending just 20 minutes or less (59 percent vs 68 percent overall) on their regular beauty routine and one-fifth (18 percent) say their beauty routine consists of four or less steps. Usage of cosmetics products that are essential to the natural makeup look have also been on the rise among younger consumers over the past five years*. Indeed, nearly half (46 percent) of women aged 22-39 use eyebrow pencils today, up 9 percent since 2011 (37 percent); four in five (79 percent) are using mascara compared to 73 percent five years ago; and 77 percent of these consumers say they use lip care products compared to 73 percent who said the same in 2011. But don’t confuse the natural look with the no-makeup trend as nearly half (46 percent) of Millennial women say they feel more confident when they spend time on their appearance. “Short beauty routines underscore that Millennials are strapped for time and emphasize efficiency, highlighting the importance of products that can be applied quickly and easily, as well as those that can multitask,” said Margie Nanninga, Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Mintel research indicates that Millennials are results-driven in their beauty routines as beauty consumers in this generation are most likely to prioritize products that provide good results (58 percent) and to purchase products based on their benefits (43 percent). Further highlighting trends toward simplicity, two in five (40 percent) Millennial beauty consumers also look for products that are easy to use. However, while one third (34 percent) of Millennial women look for products they usually use, nine percent are influenced by interesting packaging or design when purchasing beauty products. While ethical claims are further down on the list of concerns for Millennial beauty consumers, these claims are more important to Millennials than they are to other generations. Indeed, Millennial beauty consumers are more likely to look for products that have natural ingredients (25 percent vs 23 percent overall), are environmentally-friendly (12 percent vs nine percent overall), ethically-sourced (seven percent vs five percent overall) and those that donate a portion of proceeds to charity (six percent vs four percent overall). Younger adults also seem to be more experimental and adventurous when it comes to nature-based ingredients in their beauty and personal care products. Mintel research highlights that female skincare consumers aged 18-34 are more likely than female consumers overall to be interested in skincare products containing ingredients such as seaweed (52 percent vs 42 percent overall), ginseng (48 percent vs 37 percent overall), sandalwood (29 percent vs 23 percent overall) and fermented ingredients (28 percent vs 19 percent overall). “Beauty and personal care brands would do well to focus on natural offerings as a way to differentiate in a saturated market. Products that have clear, straightforward packaging that highlight the natural ingredients will help set the product apart and help push beauty and personal care consumers out of their comfort zones,” continued Nanninga."
Nail polish: tomorrow’s trends according to IL Cosmetics,"Premium Beauty News - After years of euphoria, the global market of nail polish really seems to be experimenting a serious slowdown. We have witnessed a 50% contraction in the last three years! How do you explain this phenomenon and what is your outlook for the future? Jean-François Harpes - Like any other market, it is also a cyclical market that undergoes increasing and decreasing phases. From our internal forecasting / market trend analysis we know how to quantify the time lapse between each cycle, and identify the different product types that consumers a looking for during each phase of the nail polish cycle. Hence we know that a consumer will look for long-lasting formulas, classic shades and that she won’t buy as many products during a declining phase. On the contrary, the growth phase trend is marked by an explosion of colours, special effects, and gimmicks. The consumer is seeking variety and wants to change products often. However, during a phase of a comeback of colour, it is necessary to be able to propose more convenient, easy-to-use systems, which do not compromise market standards for essential parameters such as gloss, long hold, freshness, and overall manicure durability. Premium Beauty News - So you believe that this current period of decline, will soon be followed by a sharp rise? Jean-François Harpes - Absolutely, confirmed signs of interest in colours and special effects are already on the market, and this rise advances the beginning of a recovery of the nail polish market. We are entering the increasing phase of a new cycle, driven by a wave of trend-setter brands in the market. It should be noted that, traditionally, trend-setter brands used to come from USA. Now, there is a shift in the market and trend-setter brands are coming from Europe, especially UK, which is driving new trends. Today IL Cosmetics is working with each of them. It is clear that we strongly believe in the market’s recovery, and that is why we are investing to expand our conditioning capacities. At the end of this year our capacity will be of 350 million units per year to reach 500 million units per year at the end of June 2018. Premium Beauty News - You are putting yourself in optimal conditions to have the best industrial and technical assets to meet market demand by helping trend-setters to make the right choices! Jean-François Harpes - A lot of brands want to impose themselves in the market and slowly rise into the trend-setter category as well.  However, becoming a trend-setter is not always that obvious and there are several variables that need to be considered and mastered to be successful at it. For example, it is essential to be able to rely on suppliers that have a good know how of the market and strong R&D capacities that can guide the launch of the right product at the right time. Because it is not just about having ""THE"" good idea. It’s about being able to materialize the idea from the concept to the final product in a very short time. This is one of the reasons why having the possibility of offering Full Service options is obviously more interesting for these trend-setters. A complete integration allows a faster go-to-market reducing time and effort between concept creation, product development, production and filling.

France: Online cosmetics sales grew by 21 percent in 2016,"While the French prestige beauty market declined in 2016, partly due to a sharp drop in tourist visits following terror attacks in the country, online sales have steadily increased since 2014. ""The strong growth of online beauty sales alone brought 1 point of growth to the whole sector. In a context of market downturn, this trend is particularly important since it is durable and robust enough to lean against the general tendency observed in 2016,"" commented Mathilde Lion, European Beauty Expert at The NPD Group. According to The NPD Group, online sales account for 5% of total prestige beauty sales in France, much lower than other markets, such as sports goods or toys.  It is also far from the UK, a much more connected market where online beauty sales represent 11.5% of total sales.  This fact suggests there still a huge room for growth in France, even though the country is far ahead of Spain (1.4%) and Italy (1.5%). Skincare is the segment that generates the largest share of online sales, before perfumes and makeup. According to The NPD Group, the most purchased product online (in units) is a skincare, while in physical stores the first skincare product only arrives in 25th position. However, when we look at growth rates, makeup products show the strongest momentum with sales growing by more than 30% in 2016. The Christmas season is the biggest driving force for online prestige beauty sales since 43% of the turnover of the internet channel is concentrated in the last quarter of the year while the Christmas season sales just account for a third in physical stores. Today, all major prestige beauty retailers run their own online shops. Prestige brands have also launched their own e-shops. According to The NPD Group, e-commerce allows for more aggressive marketing strategies. Far from competing with brick-and-mortar shops, ""flash"" and other online exclusive offers allow to better capture consumers in an omni-channel strategy. ""Brick-and-mortar retailers remain key points of sale for products such as fragrances or foundations. E-commerce helps maintain and improve the customer’s experience with a new, more comfortable, more flexible and often richer point of sale offering a wider choice and more promotions,"" concluded Mathilde Lion."
The makeup craze reaches young German women,"From a general point of view, the study shows that cosmetics help young people to have more control over themselves and their own bodies. 85 percent of adolescents and young adults say they use cosmetic products in order to feel more confident. It the same for colour cosmetics. Younger German women do not make any compromises when it comes to their appearance - everything has to be perfect and many of them won’t leave the house anymore without makeup. The study finds that 67 percent of 14- to 21-year-old women say that highlighting their eyes is very important and that mascara is an indispensable companion for them in daily life. They apply mascara every day, some of them even multiple times a day. Some of them even say the brush for their lashes is almost more important than a toothpaste or a deodorant. Many young consumers own several mascaras and decide which one to use depending on the occasion. A student participant said: “I have three types of mascaras - one for everyday, one waterproof, when we have sports, for example, and in the summer, and then another one, a large brush, for the big event”. For young women, eye makeup has more than just one function in the daily routine: on the one hand, it helps to improve someone’s aesthetics and to accentuate one’s own femininity, on the other hand, it acts as a deliberate eye-catcher, especially towards the other sex. While many young women use mascaras and nail polishes as a stepping stone into the world of cosmetics (first experiences are often made by 11-year-olds), the first use of lipsticks usually happens later in the transition to adulthood, the study finds. “Accentuating the lips makes many women at a young age uncomfortable, as they do not feel grown up enough. Red lips are seen as seductive, and are viewed by most young women as ‘over the top’ for a daily routine. The fear of looking ‘cheap’ also prevents especially young girls from intensively using lipstick,” says IKW. Wearing lipstick is therefore mainly popular on special occasions, or on a “bad hair day”, when attention should be drawn away from something that is not perfect. “Adolescents place a lot of importance on their outer image. 60 percent of them stated that they generally believe that it is possible to read a person by their appearance.  Puberty is a very unsettling phase in a person’s life which brings with it a feeling of loss of control and this is what the young adults are fighting against. Using cosmetics makes them feel more confident and deodorant and acne creams are seen as indispensable everyday essentials.” explains Ines Imdahl, owner and managing director of Rheingold Salon.  “As far as colour cosmetics are concerned, while adolescents often wear decorative products such as mascara and nail polish from quite an early age, other products such as lipsticks only become important a few years later, when emphasising femininity plays a more important role.”"
France: Perfumes and cosmetics exports pass the 12 billion euro mark,"The cosmetics industry remains a major pillar of French foreign trade. In 2016, the trade surplus in the cosmetics sector reached 9.2 billion euros, ranking cosmetics as the second most performant sector after the aeronautics. ""The French cosmetics industry continues to grow its international reputation by combining its strong assets, including innovation a reputation of high-quality,"" says Patrick O’Quin, President of the French Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA). However, French exports score very differently from one geographical area to the other. Dynamism in North America and Asia has offset the slowdown in other areas. While Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy remain among the top 5 countries where France exports the most, the total amount of exports in these four countries tends to slow down. French exports to European countries outside the European Union (-3.5%) continue to decline, mostly because of the drop of exports to Russia (-13%), which is linked to the rubble weakness that had a positive impact on local brands but not on foreign imports. However, sustained growth in North America offset the slowdown in Europe. Exports rose in all the three North American countries: United States (+8.5%), Canada (+4.5%) and Mexico (+4%). Exports to Asia grew by almost 10% in 2016, including China (+15%), Singapore (+13%), South Korea (+18%) and Japan (+4%). While Asia passed through some difficulties in 2015, last year marked a real recovery throughout the zone. ""The growth remains strong in China despite, regulations that are not adapted to the constant innovations in this product categories,"" explains the FEBEA.  Asia now accounts for 17% of French cosmetics exports. Exports to Latin America (-7.2%) and the Middle East (-5.9%) were down significantly. According to the FEBEA, declines in the Middle East (including Saudi Arabia, -18% and United Arab Emirates, -5.8%) are linked to the evolution and increasingly complexification of local regulations, but also the economic transition linked to lower oil prices. Exports to North Africa were also down (-3.6%), mainly due to a -27% drop of exports to Egypt, linked to the very bad economic situation in the country. Skin care and fragrances account for 3/4 of French exports in the beauty category (43.4% for skin care and 31.3% for perfumes). ""High-end prestige brands remain popular around the world, and pharmacy brands are accelerating their penetration,"" said Virginie d’Enfert, FEBEA’s Director of Economic, Environmental and International Affairs. However, figures published by the FEBEA do not tell anything about the evolution of France’s share of the global market. While French brands remain in high demand worldwide, they are facing increased competition, particularly in Asia with the rise of Korean brands, and in the makeup category, the world’s most dynamic beauty market, where new players are sky-rocketing based on innovative distribution and marketing methods. As far as competitiveness is concerned, the latest annual survey by Coe-Rexecode (September 2016), conducted among major European, American, Japanese and Chinese buyers about their perception of the characteristics of foreign products, found that the image of French hygiene and beauty products was declining in particular because of a very strong increase of perceived prices.  A problem that does not affect luxury brands but can impact the sales of the most common products."
Athleisure trend moves into make-up,"In the U.S., prestige makeup sales increased by 11 percent to $7.6 billion in the 12 months ending February 2017, accounting for over 80 percent of total industry gains [1], according to global information company The NPD Group. Growth in foundation, primers, eye brow, and lip colour products, as well as those formulated to be long-lasting and waterproof, are playing into the trend. “In today’s image-driven society, the bar has been raised to maintain a perfected ‘natural’ appearance virtually around the clock,” said Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. “With heightened focus on appearance, the door opens for manufacturers and retailers to fill the need for consumers seeking increased usage of beauty products that can hold up to the rigors of our active lives - including a workout - to look good before, during, and after working out.” Foundation sales grew by 8 percent in the US during this period, driven by long wear foundation and those with added benefits. Long wear foundation sales increased by 13 percent, while basic foundation saw a decline. Concealer sales increased by 17 percent and powder by 7 percent, the latter which has now surpassed blush sales. Completing the makeup package, growth in eye brow makeup accelerated to 31 percent and lip colour sales increased by 18 percent. According to The NPD Group, makeup has seen sales increases for products designed specifically to help makeup last; primer sales for the face (+16 percent), eyes (+6 percent), and even  lips  (+23 percent) have grown. Waterproof mascara (+16 percent) and eyeliner (+7 percent) led the gains in their respective categories. To freshen up after a workout, dry shampoo sales increased by 66 percent [2]."
Segmentation increases on US natural and organic personal care market,"“As the US natural and organic personal care products market is becoming increasingly competitive, brands are taking a segmented approach and / or investing in labels to differentiate their products in a crowded marketplace,” explains Ecovia Intelligence. According to the market research firm, “segmentation is occurring whereby natural and organic brands are targeting specific consumer segments.”  Dedicated ranges for baby care, expectant mothers and men are already established, however new brands are focusing on more targeted segments such as teenage girls and health enthusiasts. One such example is the Good For You Girls brand. Brands are also developing natural and organic ranges for specific applications. A number of such anti-ageing skincare products are now available. Brands like Tata Harper and REN have introduced anti-pollution skincare products that protect and heal skin from air pollutants. Another illustration: the Canadian company Novia Scotia Fisherman has developed natural skincare products for extreme weather conditions. Ethical labels are also becoming prominent in the personal care market. The butterfly logo of Non-GMO Project Verified, well-established in the food industry, is making headway on natural and organic personal care products. Almost 500 products are now certified, confirming no genetically modified ingredients are in product formulations. Andalou Naturals, Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps, and EO Products are some of the highest adopters of this scheme. Fairtrade, vegan and gluten-free labels - as well as the traditional natural and organic labels - are also becoming more visible on personal care products. “Thus, it is becoming increasingly common to see three or more labels on product packs,” said Ecovia Intelligence. “The question is how these trends will sustain themselves as the market evolves,” concludes Ecovia Intelligence who will enter more in details on this subject at the upcoming North American edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which be will be hosted at the Park Central New York on 3-5th May 2017."
Natural make-up is growing in popularity,"According to a recent survey by US beauty brand Kari Gran, 49% of US women say it is important to them the makeup products they purchase are all-natural (after hair care, 51%, and skin care, 57%).  Moreover, the survey found that 55% of women asked read product labels prior to purchases in order to avoid some specific ingredients, while this number was 62% amongst millennials. [1] This month Swiss natural cosmetics brand Weleda became the latest to branch out into make-up, with a range of three tinted lip balms. Containing organic shea butter and jojoba oil and mineral pigments, the balms are designed to smooth and soften lips, while providing sheer colour and a hint of gloss. While Weleda have just dipped their toes into the natural make-up market, there are many brands offering full ranges of products that claim to be natural, organic and/or eco-friendly. It is certainly for foundations that this type of claim is the most common. Mineral makeup brand bareMinerals, for instance, claims that its product is ""so pure you can sleep in it.""  The brand’s loose mineral powder contains just five ingredients and offers SPF 15 sun protection. However, mineral powders are not the only offer for this segment.  Dr. Hauschka, which recently expanded its makeup offering in celebration of the brand’s 50th year, now offers a liquid foundation in seven shades and a compact powder coming in three shades, silicone and mineral oil-free and NaTrue labelled. Concerns about substances applied around the mouth - especially with regard to lead contamination, even though it’s only a matter of miniscule quantities - is one of the driving forces behind the development of natural lipstick. Weleda’s tinted lip balms claim to provide a natural look, while German brand Lavera promises something more dramatic with its ""Beautiful Lips"" range. Dr. Hauschka’s new colour cosmetics range is consistent with a more general trend in natural make-up consisting in providing additional care benefits. Dr. Hauschka’s organic mascara thus contains rose petal wax to protect lashes, as well as black tea extract to soothe the delicate eye area. British makeup mineral brand Lily Lolo has developed ranges for all skin types with ingredients “proven to nourish and protect the skin”.  The brand’s eyeshadows feature 27 highly-pigmented colours with formulas promising not to irritate sensitive skin. Founded by make-up artist Rosie-Marie Swift, RMS Beauty offers a range of luxurious products, claiming to be non-toxic and nourishing. The ""Un-Cover-Up"" concealer is designed to hydrate the skin, while camouflaging imperfections and redness. Eventually, let’s mention Tata Harper’s Lip and Cheek tint, which combines two products in one. The range of three colours are designed to create a sheer, natural effect, and the ""volumising"" formula claims to plump the skin."
South Korea’s skin care and make-up trends decoded,"According to the market research firm, facial skincare accounts for more than half (51%) of the total market share with US$6.5 billion in retail sales and a projected 5.8% CAGR [1] over the next five years to reach US$7.2 billion by 2020. Much of the success of the facial skincare category is in part due to the abundance of new product development and the fact that more than two thirds (68%) of total skincare product launches in South Korea 2015-2016 [2] were facial skincare products, according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD). Following facial skincare, colour cosmetics makes up the second largest beauty category in the South Korean market, valued at US$2.3 billion in 2017. Mintel research indicates that the market is supported by an active and engaged consumer base with per capita spend on colour cosmetics in South Korea at US$45 in 2017, compared to US$43 in the UK and US$37 in the US [3], and more than double the global average per capita spend of US$21. With a projected CAGR of 8.1% over the next five years, the market is estimated to reach US$2.8 billion by 2020. According to Jane Jang, Senior Beauty Analyst at Mintel, 2017 will be the year of extreme segmentation for facial skincare and products will become increasingly targeted and multi-functional, responding to the needs of knowledgeable and demanding consumers. As lines are blurring in every possible way to deliver new experiences and create continuous excitement around skincare, Mintel expects hybrid concoctions - such as daily exfoliating moisturisers, anti-wrinkle whitening tone-up creams and lightweight nourishing oil serums - to emerge, as well as transformative textures, like powder-to-serum, oil-to-foam and water-to-cream. “A strong focus on quality and safety supports a fascination for natural ingredients, in line with ‘hanbang’, the ancient Korean herbal medicine,” adds Jane Jang.  According to Mintel GNPD, 69% of facial skincare launches in 2016 featured herbal/botanical claims in South Korea. Furthermore, the sheet mask craze does not seem to be slowing down.  Moving beyond basic hydrating benefits, sheet masks and patches are now designed for each part of the body and every member of the family, babies included, to target every possible need and to be used on the most specific occasions. As far as colour cosmetics are concerned, South Korea’s make-up rituals is focusing on lips and complexion.  According to Mintel GNPD, lip colour launches accounted for 30% of all colour cosmetics launches in South Korea in 2016, compared to a global average of 27%. This is followed by foundations and fluid illuminators, which accounted for 16% of colour cosmetics launches in South Korea. “ The boom of hybrid formats has spawned a variety of new lip products,  like lip syrups, lip crayons, lip-quids and gel sticks,” says Jane Jang. Furthermore, South Korean brands are increasingly focusing on gels, jellies, mousses and watery oils to enhance consumers’ sensorial experiences.  Actually, the trend for hybrid and transforming textures and formats is borrowed from skincare. Mintel, eventually notes that while cushion compacts have been a Korean success story for the past few years, they are increasingly becoming a trend in Western markets. From October 2013-September 2014, 80% of the global launches of cushion compacts took place in Asia Pacific, while 20% of launches occurred in Europe and the US. By October 2015-September 2016, the tables have turned and 46% of global cushion compacts launches were in Asia Pacific and 54% in Europe and the US. New launches in South Korea include multi-functional skincare claims (such as moisturising, anti-ageing, whitening and UV protection); foundation-like properties; and hygiene and application innovations. “The popularity of South Korean beauty products is due to their high performance combined with fun packaging and sensorial cues, as well as affordable prices. By gaining the attention of bloggers, vloggers and the media, the K-beauty wave is spreading to retailers outside of Asia. While colour cosmetics will be the active innovation area to cater to an increasing number of sophisticated beauty consumers, facial skincare remains the real powerhouse for K-beauty,” concluded Jane Jang."
"MakeUp in Asia welcomed nearly 2,800 visitors last week in Seoul","Rebranded MakeUp in Asia, the latest edition of the B2B event dedicated to the makeup industry in Asia took place on 05-06 April 2017 at the Conrad Hotel in Seoul.  With 55 exhibitors, from makers of make-up formulas to packaging and make-up accessories suppliers, the event was offering quite enough to suit all quests. “As of 10:00 am on Wednesday, April 5, we could clearly feel that this 4th edition was going to be an excellent vintage. At 09:00 am, several hundred people were already gathered and waiting in front the exhibition entrance and couldn’t wait for the doors to open,” said the organisers.  At the opening, a good part of visitors deciding to visit the show on both levels of the Conrad Hotel Seoul, while others rushed to the 6th floor of the venue to attend the first morning conferences. Over the two days, the event gathered nearly 2,800 people visitors, a rise of four hundred more people compared to 2016, thus coming down to an average of 44 visitors per exhibitor. “An all-time record for the show and, probably the best performance of all BtoB events dedicated to the beauty industry in Asia,” claimed the organisers. A total of 1,700 people took part to the 14 conferences and round tables bringing together some 25 speakers.  One of the most attended was undoubtedly the one dedicated to the cushions with a conference room packed with three hundred people.  According to the organisers, conferences focused on economic trends in the Asian make-up industry and across the world were also very successful, so as round tables on Australia and Halal products."
Trends: Perfumes are going green,"The creation team worked on different home fragrance, candle, and eaux de toilette compositions to illustrate this colour’s creative possibilities. The combination of ‘green’ and sweet notes nourishes the base of the Vert Gourmand, Pomme verte, and Figolu candles. Then, pine or sandalwood notes are used for the Canopée, Sève des sens, and Griffe de sorcières creations. Home fragrances for ceramic, wood chip, or polymer bead materials. Ultimately, the three women’s, men’s, and mixed perfumes, Nymphea Alba, Trèfle zesté, and Haldri, embody in turn fertility, with iris notes, the tonicity of morning dew with lemon and woody notes, or the mystery of an ancestral forest with pistacia. “Green is an active trend that is present in many fields. In perfumery, the note smells modern and is usually used by niche brands. Ex Nihilo has just released Viper Green for the Russian market, and Tom Ford has launched an evocative collection with Vert Bohème, Vert de fleur, Vert d’encens, and Vert des bois,” explains Isabelle Ferrand, Director of Cinquième Sens."
Halal cosmetics market expected to meet continuous growth,"Adoption of vegan, natural and organic products by younger consumers wing to the supposed risks associated with conventional beauty-care products is also expected to fuel demand for ethical products. Increasing number of Muslims gaining higher education level is another factor for the shifting trends and usage of products perceived as being safer and of higher-quality. These consumers are worried about the ingredients used in conventional personal care and beauty products and try to avoid substances they view as potentially harmful. Furthermore, some Muslims consumers are especially interested to shop for personal care and beauty-care brands that are sharia compliant and prefer not use products containing substances such as pork fat, non-halal animal derivatives, and alcohol. According to Grand View Research, this combination of factors would favour eco-ethical modern consuming behaviours and would drive the overall growth of the halal cosmetics market over the next nine years. “With the help of advertisements and promotion incentives offered by companies, the level of consumer consciousness has increased in the recent past and is fostering the growth of these segments in relatively smaller countries,” explains the market research firm. However, the halal certification is not another natural or environmentally friendly label.  Indeed, silicone-based polymers such as methicone and dimethicone are considered sharia compliant and are widely used as anti-foaming agents in skin care applications. Polyethylene glycol, hexylene glycol, butylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and ethoxydiglycol are some other ingredients that are considered to meet sharia prerequisites and may be used in halal beauty care formulations. The growth of the overall demand is also largely driven by a growing number of Muslim women trying to integrate religious observance with fashion developments along with rising purchasing power of these consumers. As far as product categories are concerned, Grand View Research forecasts skin care products to witness the highest CAGR [1] of 12% over the forecast period (2014-2025).  Actually, according to the market research firm, consumers are very sensitive about the quality of the substances they widely apply on their skin and they may consider safer to use sharia compliant beauty care items over their conventional counterparts. To date, the demand for halal certified items has witnessed the most significant increase in the skin care as well as in the hair care categories. In 2015, the hair care category accounted for over 15% of the overall halal beauty revenue share. The Asia Pacific region is expected to witness an estimated CAGR of 12.6% over the forecast period (2014-2025).  South East Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are expected to witness significant growth owing to rising Muslim population along with large untapped potential in developing economies. The Middle East & Africa region is anticipated to witness significant growth owing to the local domination of Islamic ethos. Lack of certification body in the region is expected to attract industry participants from developed regions such as the U.S., UK and Germany. The region accounted for over 17% of the overall halal beauty revenue in 2015."
Social networks: Chinese KOLs have become crucial for cosmetics brands,"Among the speakers at the conference, which focused on the theme “Crack the Codes”, there was Melilim Fu (real name傅沛 Fu Pei), a Chinese KOL who came from Beijing with her American boyfriend and associate, Elijah Whaley, who is specialized in marketing content, and with whom she created her makeup video platform. Since August 2015, Melilim Fu has posted about thirty makeup tutorials and a thousand pictures, and offered twelve live streaming sessions. With her blue or pink-dyed hair, coloured lenses, and strong makeup, Melilim Fu chose to stand out in a world of beauty videos dominated by light-skinned Koreans, and where Chinese women are still scarce, to her. “I am a makeup artist, and even if I may draw inspiration from the Western world and Japan, my top priority is to help and guide Chinese women discovering makeup, and make them feel self-confident,” Melilim Fu explains. If, when she started, her videos could shock Chinese web users more keen on lightness and discretion, they are now widely accepted by a fast-changing clientele. Contacts with her public are crucial, she emphasizes. “I answer all questions, and our exchanges can get very personal. My generation – I was born in 1991 – is made of people who grew up in one-child families and are eager for interactions.” On Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, Melilim Fu currently counts almost 175,000 fans. “From the beginning, we decided to use Weibo for Melilim’s content hub. This choice was a bit of a gamble, but it was a well-placed bet, as Weibo continues to gain popularity and WeChat [the most widely used mobile messaging service in China, which features many applications], remains a harsh environment for UGC [1] video distribution,” explains Elijah Whaley, who also highlights that “China’s online video ecosystem differs from the rest of the world’s, which relies heavily on Google and YouTube.” According to him, not a single video platform in China comes close to matching YouTube’s popularity or sophisticated search algorithms – LeTV, one of China’s most popular video sites, does not even accept UGC videos. Melilim Fu does use WeChat, although she has no official account, as well as Instagram and Snapchat, “to experience the playfulness of filters, without particularly trying to reach a Western public, but rather Chinese people abroad.” Melilim Fu states she has worked with “global brands like H&M, Nike, and Make Up For Ever, as well as with many small brands,” but few Chinese brands. “It seems consumers’ trust in Chinese products is a real issue,” she thinks. Elijah Whaley adds that “even if we have not achieved that yet, exclusive contracts with brands are the best way for them to capitalize on a KOL,” referring to the exclusive collaborations with global brands signed by Chinese Internet stars – whose number of fans exceeds 800,000 on Weibo – like that between humourist Papi Jiang and Shanghai-based cosmetics online retailer Lili&Beauty, or actress and singer Angelababy and Maybelline, of the L’Oréal group. The duo declares they usually work for a flat rate. “In addition, we have recently had the opportunity to try out our e-commerce skills. Someone who sells foreign products through WeChat and Weibo offered to redirect our traffic towards these two accounts. In only seven days, we made US$25,000 sales, of which we perceived 20%,” Elijah Whaley explains. To him, this type of collaboration can only work with brands with limited distribution channels. “Other collaborations mainly help us gain attention and reach more people,” Elijah Whaley continues. “With Yes, a brand that developed a live streaming to e-commerce application, we made a one-hour live video in a shopping mall that sold the brand’s products, generating a US$5,000 sales volume.” The experience, which allowed web users to react, was very positive, according to Melilim Fu. “People told me they had the impression they went shopping with me.” These live videos are on a roll: the trend spread across China last year, so much that Maybelline organized a giant live streaming event in Shanghai with many KOLs to launch a lipstick. It is believed that China counts 344 million live broadcast users, i.e. almost half the number of web users. Two thirds of them are men, and most are under 30, according to the iResearch institute quoted by French newspaper Les Échos. The number of platforms has literally boomed over the past two years, and it is said there are almost 200 of them today. “Just like China’s TV offering, most of the content of these videos is devoid of any interest, so we have the opportunity to catch people’s attention by producing quality, both live and in our recorded videos,” Elijah Whaley underlines. To him, a well-performing KOL “can guide a given social media platform public towards a shopping environment.” Kim Leitzes (ParkLU) shares this vision, so she recommends brands to invest time with their KOL and set up a content strategy."
Italy: Make-up and exports boost the cosmetics industry,"The Italian cosmetics market is the fourth largest in Europe, behind France, Germany and the UK.  According to Cosmetica Italia, domestic consumption grew by +0.5% in 2016, reaching 9.9 billion euros (compared to 9.85 in 2015).  Contrasting with this relative weak domestic demand, exports increased by more than 12.3% to reach 4.27 billion euros in 2016. Italian exports of cosmetics are mainly directed to the European Union (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom at the top) and to the United States. Looking at the various retail channels, sales in beauty salons grew by 2.1% in 2016, reaching 230 million euros, while hairdressing salons grew by 1% to reach 563 million euros. Perfume shops (which account for 20.4% of cosmetics sales in Italy) have shown signs of slight recovery (+9.0%) and the value of this channel now amounts to 2,018 million euros. Meanwhile, pharmacies appear to have reached a stalemate: cosmetics sales fell by -1%.  For their part, cosmetics sales in the mass market channel, which accounts for 40% of cosmetics sales in Italy, fell by 1.1% in 2016. Finally, data from Cosmetica Italia show that the dynamism of make-up sales with lip-glosses and lip glosses growing by +8.5%, and sales of foundations and tinted creams grew by + 5%. On the other hand, sales of body care products decreased by 2% compared to 2015 reaching 1,383 million euros and 16% of the total cosmetics market."
Spain: A vigorous personal care market!,"The demand for perfumes and cosmetics in Spain grew by 3.5% in 2016 compared to the previous year. The market is experiencing a second consecutive year of growth after the collapse that followed the 2008 crisis. According to Stanpa, the Spanish association of cosmetics and perfumes manufacturers, all the market categories are on the rise, with colour cosmetics growing by 8% and perfumes growing by more than 4% in value. As far as perfumes and fragrances are concerned, most of the growth came from the selective and luxury segments (+5%), with a stronger increase from women’s fragrances (+5%) than from the men’s ones (+3%). Within the skin care category, which is the main category in Spain (28% of the market), sun protection products recorded a very strong growth (+9%). All the traditional retail channels are growing, with the highest growth recorded by pharmacies (+5.5%). Mass retailers still hold the higher share of the market (47%), followed by pharmacies (22%) and selective retailers (21%). Other channels, such as direct retails, beauty salons and hairdressing salons, account for 10% of sales. According to the Stanpa, online sales are experiencing a sharp deceleration with an increase of +9% in 2015 compared to +57% previously. Exports of Spanish beauty products also had a good year, reaching 3,536 million euros (+6.4% compared to 2015). In total, exports of Spanish beauty products have increased by more than 1 billion euros since 2010. The trade balance has maintained a positive balance since 2006 with a coverage rate of 129% in 2016. The European countries, with Portugal and France in the lead, account for 60% of Spain’s beauty products exports, followed by the Americas (18%), in particular the United States, Mexico and Chile, then by the Middle East (6.5 per cent), Asia-Pacific (5.6 per cent) and Africa (5 per cent)."
Solid soap trendy again,"Long replaced by shower gels, solid soap is making a strong comeback in shopping baskets. This trend is revitalizing the segment. “There has recently been a renewed interest in soap for four reasons. Consumers are wary about the undesirable substances contained in shower gels, they feel like buying more authentic products, and there is also an economic parameter, because solid soap lasts longer. Besides, it has become an ideal gift,” explains Guillaume Fievet, Director of La Savonnerie du Midi, which gathers the La Corvette and Maitre Savon brands. In 2013, the entrepreneur purchased this company established in for several generations Marseille, France, as it was experiencing difficulties. He endeavoured to revive the two historic soap ranges of traditional Savons de Marseille: Maitre Savon, sold through mass distribution networks, and La Corvette, which had a more premium positioning and was sold in organic stores, pharmacies, and channels specialized in decoration. It has been only three years: the company grew by more than 25% in 2016, compared to 2015, and is expecting the same growth for 2017. France should gain 15 to 20%, and export 30 to 35%, to account for 12% of the revenue share, compared to 5% three years ago. “Things are doing well abroad, because the term Savon de Marseille Traditionnel is known all around the world now, and so is Provence,” M. Fievet explains. This global dimension might even be enhanced with INPI creating an IGPIA label (protected geographical indication for industrial and craft products), whose file is being examined. As he is very attached to the authenticity of the “Savon de Marseille Traditionnel” designation, M. Fievet has not waited for the label to be issued: in 2011, he contacted three other local soap factories, Marius Fabre, Sérail, and Fer à Cheval, to set up an association to defend and promote traditional Savon de Marseille. “We wrote a charter to define this soap according to three criteria: it should be manufactured in Marseille or its region, with a traditional cauldron, and contain vegetable oils, but no additive, perfume, or colourant. These three elements provide it with its specific characteristics, and that is what makes it successful in France and around the world,” he adds. The association has created a collective mark, Union des professionnels de savons de Marseille, which is affixed on their products, so that consumers are sure they are buying an authentic product. New solid soap users are keen on it for its economical and eco-friendly aspect (no plastic packaging), its naturalness, but also… its novelty! Indeed, many people have only ever known liquid gels. A great number of brands have already met these expectations, while new names have recently entered the market with a high-end positioning for a universal product. For example, Adduna and Daliane both rely on the same motivations, i.e. offering a range of premium natural hygiene products with cosmetic virtues made in France by craftsmen. “The choice to go back to basics is not made by default, it is actually very active,” asserts Codou Cissé, founder of Adduna Beauté. She could not find any satisfactory product for her fragile skin, so this young entrepreneur launched her own brand in 2014 with a range of soap made in France with the richness of the entire world (shea, olive, cocoa, coconut, sesame…). Adduna beauty soap results from cold saponification, which merely consists in mixing fats (vegetable butters and oils) with a base and transforming them into soap. The soap naturally contains glycerine, which preserves the skin’s hydrolipidic film. “Cold saponification is the best solution to preserve the moisturizing properties of our precious oil actives we select with such care,” adds Codou Cissé. If it is only sold online right now, the Adduna range should soon be added to beauty boxes and appear on online and concept stores. “Users are instantaneously seduced and ask me to start working on liquid, exfoliating, and shampoo versions,” the founder rejoices. The new era of soap has reached cosmetics. The Daliane she-ass milk range created by Sylvie Dalibard comprises exfoliating, purifying, protective, and relaxing products. “I wished to create healthy, organic, preservative-free products in synergy with she-ass milk, such an extraordinary ingredient,” she explains. Also derived from cold saponification, Daliane products contain 42% of this precious milk (an unequalled percentage in cosmetics), and natural essential oils. The range is available in pharmacies, organic stores, and abroad. “The attraction to quality, natural soap with beneficial actives is a well-established trend because it is related to the search of safe products,” Sylvie Dalibard asserts. Soap is trendy. The cosmetics industry has jumped on the bandwagon, making this basic hygiene product a real skincare treatment. Similarly, in the cleaning product industry, it has made a strong comeback as a natural alternative to chemical detergents."
Cosmoprof Bologna closes 50th edition with plans for international growth,"One of the main innovations of the 50th edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna was the creation of a new B2B area dedicated to cosmetic brands with a focus in retail channels.  The new Cosmoprime special area featured 151 exhibitors, 81% of them from foreign countries showcasing a large variety of cosmetic brands, from high-end mass market to prestige and niche segments. Niche and high-end brands have been presented in the Extraordinary Gallery, while the Tones of Beauty area gathered multi-ethnic beauty brands.  The area, which opened simultaneously to Cosmopack, one day before the rest of the show, also hosted the CosmoTalks round tables and presentations dedicated to insights on the world of retail and the future of the beauty market. Innovative suppliers were honoured on the occasion of Cosmopack, the B2B event which involves the international beauty supply chain.  The 4th edition of the Cosmopack Wall Awards contest was held on the theme “Let’s get emotional…urban poetry”, to highlight how the emotion arisen by original packaging design, by the texture of a cream or by a fragrance may drive the purchase process by final customers.  An international jury voted the winners among 24 finalists: – Gotha Cosmetics for “Bi-Metallic Eyes & Face Color Veil”, a lightweight and easy-to-apply cream for face and eyes (category Formula Make Up).
– MYC Packaging Innovation for “Transforming Eye Shadow Kajal” an innovative packaging line for eyes and lips products (category Packaging Make Up)
– Geka won the award in the category Technology for “Bottle in Bottle Marble Mascara”, the first mascara with a “marble-effect” packaging.
– Ancorotti Cosmetics won the award in Design category for its “Extruded Powder”
– Pink Frogs Cosmetics won the award in the Formula Skin Care category for “Sleeping Metallic Mask”, a facial mask rich in detox ingredients, nourishing and anti-age.
– Karza won the award for the Packaging Skin Care category thanks to “Helium”: an innovative dispenser for cosmetics, to protect the integrity of the products.
– O-Pac won the Inspiration award with its product “24h Urban Kits in Wipes”, thanks to the anti-pollution action of the micellar water.
– Chromavis won the Special Avant-Garde Award with the product “New vision eyes & lips”. Its technology combines two different textures to get different performances without any physical barriers in a single all-over product. The Cosmoprof show, which already has branches in Asia and North America, recently confirmed its partnership with Iran Beauty & Clean.  Cosmoprof Bologna will be exclusive international agent of the 24th edition of this exhibition, to be held at the Teheran International Fairground from April 25.  Furthermore, in September BolognaFiere Cosmoprof will start working with Feira Belleza y Salud in Bogota, Colombia, widening its reach to Latin America. “And then we are working to develop a project that in 2019 will cover India,"" said Franco Boni, President of Bologna Fiere."
"Health concerns drive the US natural and organic personal care market, says Mintel","A new research from Mintel [1] reveals that over one third (37 percent) of consumers agree that they were buying more natural and organic personal care products in 2016 than the year prior, including 34 percent of parents with children under 18 in the household. According to Mintel, parents are clearly more likely to purchase personal care products that are natural or organic than non-parents, including hand and body lotion (53 percent parents vs 34 percent non-parents), facial skincare (51 percent parents vs 32 percent non-parents), haircare (50 percent parents vs 34 percent non-parents) and body cleansing products (48 percent parents vs 34 percent non-parents). “Parents are information seekers when it comes to raising their kids and, therefore, could be more aware of ingredients to avoid in their children’s personal care products, as well as their own,” said Jana Vyleta, Health and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Furthermore, nearly seven in 10 (67 percent) natural and organic personal care consumers in the US agree they are trying to live a healthier lifestyle, compared to just over half (54 percent) of non-users.  It seems trends toward health and wellness aren’t just limited to diet and exercise and natural and organic personal care products could align with these ambitions as many consumers consider them safer than mainstream products (49 percent) and of higher quality (49 percent). “Similar to how consumers who are trying to live healthier opt for fresh produce over sweets or wear a fitness tracker to monitor their activity, many also view using natural and organic personal care products as a step toward greater health.  Mintel’s 2017 Global Beauty Trend, ‘Active Beauty,’ highlights this move toward overall health and wellness, discussing how beauty brands are formulating products to help consumers in their quest for health and fitness this year,” continued Vyleta. “For marketers, the opportunity lies in convincing non-users by proving that natural and organic personal care products have tangible health benefits.” According to Mintel, outside of certifications, the most common way consumers know a personal care product is natural or organic is whether or not the ingredients are simple and familiar. Specifically, consumers look at the types of ingredients used (55 percent), whether or not the ingredients are easy to understand (49 percent) and whether certain ingredients are excluded (49 percent). Consumers also seem to prioritize general ingredient statements when it comes to purchasing natural and organic personal care products as claims such as ‘made with all natural ingredients’ (88 percent), ‘no artificial ingredients’ (86 percent) and ‘contains organic ingredients’ (81 percent) rank as some of the most important claims to natural and organic personal care consumers. However, some consumers are skeptical as 43 percent of non-users think natural and organic personal care products are a marketing scheme. Nevertheless, the younger generations seem to be more open to the category. The iGeneration [2] is less likely to view natural claims as a way for companies to charge more money (20 percent) and is most likely to take the do-it-yourself approach. Indeed, nearly one-fifth (19 percent) of iGens say they prefer to make their own personal care products as compared to just 12 percent overall. “Consumers are more likely to consider general, simple ingredient statements as an indicator that a personal care product is natural than they are certifications. The belief that natural and organic personal care products are safe likely stems from the increasing conversations regarding potential harmful effects of ingredients used in mainstream brands,” concluded Vyleta."
Alternative perfumery: is the game changing?,"Premium Beauty News - Alternative perfumery is recording the fastest growth rate on the market: there were more launchings in this field than in selective perfumery in 2016. It seems Esxence will be successful… do you agree? Johann Vitrey - No, actually, the niche perfumery segment is not doing that well, especially in France, because there are too many brands, and most of them are empty. The most renowned names were purchased and are doing well, but many brands quickly entered the market although they were not solid enough, which explains why they are experiencing difficulties today. Italians know how to do business with craftsmanship, but in France, arrogance has prevailed over clear-sightedness. The Esxence show will be an opportunity to sort things out for French brands. Many of them have not focused on the right issues or have not identified the right reasons. Premium Beauty News - What should we expect? Johann Vitrey - The brands that will stay have a real base: most are heritage brands. But many others went too fast and ran on empty after three of five years, as they did not have that strong a positioning or enough financial support. However, new gems will soon get noticed: they are those that will have taken enough time to install their base with a real artistic concept, like Sabé Masson, who waited until they got mature enough to go to Esxence. These brands will really be able to do business. Premium Beauty News - Markets like Russia or Europe have known a slowdown. Are there other opportunities? Johann Vitrey - The nice surprise will come from the discovery of new, very dynamic markets like Pakistan or West Africa, although brands used to stay away from them. As a matter of fact, there are 1.5 million multimillionaire people in Karachi, as well as a network of top luxury points of sale. These new buyers will be all the rage, as they have taken their time to monitor the market. Today, brands need them, so now they will be demanding. Their requirements will focus on the product quality, depending on the climate and skin types, on the customer service, which will need to go much farther than simply distributing samples, and on the customs duties. Young people in these countries were often educated in Europe. They are really open to a new type of perfumery. Codes are going to change."
"Hairceuticals, the next big trend in Brazil?","The steady growth of the dermocosmetics market in the last decade seems to have spilled into what might be an upcoming trend in beauty and personal care in Brazil: hairceuticals. Global haircare analyst at Mintel, Andrew McDougall, believes this product category will gain momentum locally in the near future. As the name implies, hairceuticals reportedly combine pharmaceutical and cosmetic properties. These products claim to deliver high-performance results to scalp and hair problems including hair loss, hair thinning and hair dryness through state-of-the-art technology and a blend of natural and medicinal ingredients. McDougall says that although hairceuticals is a concept still in its infancy in the country, it is likely to appeal to Brazilian consumers given the widespread popularity of hair ampoules and boosters in the local market. “Our research shows that Brazilians already purchase a number of hair vitamins and supplements, indicating there is a potential audience for hairceuticals,” he says. A growing number of trichologists – hair and scalp specialists – working in beauty salons across the country is further evidence of this particular demand for a clinical approach to hair and scalp problems. Hairceuticals already account for a significant chunk of the global hair care market. Kérastase was one of the brands that started the conversation around hairceuticals with Aminexil Force R, a six-week program to counteract hair loss launched in the 1990s. Leave-in scalp and hair concentrate Initialiste and the Densifique line – targeted at improving hair density – are some of Kérastase’s latest launches in this field. Aveda’s Invati has a more natural approach and claims to reduce hair loss due to breakage by 33%. In Brazil, local cosmetics distribution channels can further boost the trend, says McDougall. “Inspired by the US and Europe, Brazilian pharmacies and drugstores are expanding their beauty and personal care offer, which might prove a powerful tool for hairceutical sales in the country.” He says economic uncertainty and price points could be sticking points initially. However, these can be overcome if the consumer is engaged and convinced by the health and beauty benefits. In the skincare market, clinically proven results and a shift towards natural ingredients have developed a loyal following in Brazil, he says: “37% of Brazilians from higher socioeconomic groups believe that dermocosmetics are cosmetics that have a formula that is scientifically proven to be effective.” McDougall says the popularity of dermocosmetics might work in favor of haiceuticals. “A total of 59% of Brazilian internet users look for ‘sun protection’ when buying dermocosmetic products. Given consumers’ high interest in hair – the second largest cosmetics category in Brazil –, hairceuticals are expected to follow the same path.” Anti-pollution active ingredients are also in demand, with 37% of Brazilian consumers saying the environment has an impact on the appearance of their hair. “Products that can tackle this problem, offer sun protection and anti-aging benefits are more likely to be successful in Brazil,” says McDougall. According to Euromonitor, the aging population and the consequent search for anti-aging products are also setting the tone for hair care products. The market research firm has yet to track the hairceuticals segment, but based on results for clinical shampoos to treat hair loss, psoriasis, seborrhea and acute dandruff, business is growing. Between 2010 and 2015, this product category saw a 37.9% growth in retail value in Brazil."
“Active Beauty” emerges as a key trend for 2017 and beyond,"As consumers are increasingly encouraged to exercise their bodies and brains, beauty brands can align themselves with this interest in fitness by offering products designed to meet the unique needs of active consumers. In a recently released report [1], Mintel observes that several beauty brands and products such as Sweat Cosmetics (a mineral makeup with SPF) or Eyeko’s Sport Waterproof Mascara and Sport Waterproof Eyeliner already address the athleisure and athbeauty trends and new consumer expectations. In December 2016, Tarte Cosmetics launched the Athleisure Skincare & Makeup line, described as “the yoga pants of skincare”. Mintel also points out that brands increasingly adapt their packaging to meet the new trend. Stowaway Cosmetics, for instance, describes its products as “right-sized make-up for travel, the gym and life”. The surge of outdoor sports is also ideal for protection positioning.  “In Asia, athbeauty is positioned as sun protection for active people rather than cosmetics products. This allows companies such as Kosé to extend their ultraviolet protection claims from the face to the body, while Western sun protection brands are focussing more closely on products that provide comfort as well as protection for people with active lifestyles. Brazilian beauty companies Pink Cheeks and Lola Cosmetics have introduced products for runners and swimmers to protect their hair before and after their activities.” For 2017 and beyond Mintel forecasts a surge of beauty products that shield the hair and skin from exposure to pollution, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) light, of make-up and gym bags filled with rubberised packaging that stays pristine and of exercise clothing that sends skin temperature and hydration levels to apps with instructions about which products to release into the skin. “Looking ahead, we will see more brands driving the ‘Active Beauty’ trend by launching a number of new and innovative products that not only prepare and support consumers before and during physical and mental activity, but aid in the recovery process as well. Expect to see beauty brands play with temperature and water-activated products, partner with DNA analysis to provide personalised beauty regimes and team up with retailers on athletic apparel with time-release product features,” said Vivienne Rudd, Director of Global Insights, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel."
Fragrances and cosmetics sales continue to surge in the Gulf countries,"The retail value of the GCC’s beauty and personal care market was US$9.3 billion in 2016, an increase of 10 per cent over 2015, unveiled Euromonitor International in a recent report. Strong growth is expected over the next four years, as consumers look to collectively spend US$13.6 billion on their personal well-being in 2020, defying any notion of a market readjustment. The figures include bath and shower products, colour cosmetics, fragrances, hair care, men’s grooming, skin care, and sun care, while regional growth is driven by a young and affluent population that has high awareness of fashion and beauty, boosted by media exposure. In the UAE, consumers spent US$2.1 billion on beauty and personal care in 2016 according to Euromonitor. The market is set to rise to US$2.7 billion by 2020. The top five categories are fragrances (US$642 million), colour cosmetics (US$400 million), skin care and men’s grooming (both US$300 million), and hair care (US$283 million). The dynamism of the regional market is a strong asset for Beautyworld Middle East, the region’s largest international trade fair for beauty products, hair, fragrances, and wellbeing, which take place from 14-16 May 2017 at the Dubai International Convention and Exhibition Centre.  The 22nd edition of the three-day event is expected to feature more than 1,500 exhibitors from 60 countries. While the UAE and GCC remain its main market focus, the show is attracting a growing number of visitors from neighbouring countries. “Beautyworld Middle East’s internationality is integral to the overall success of the show, which is why we’re seeing participating exhibitors and visitors from every corner of the world,” said Ahmed Pauwels, CEO of organiser Messe Frankfurt Middle East.  “While half of the 37,000-plus beauty professionals and trade buyers are from the GCC, more and more are coming from Iran, Africa, Europe, and as far away as Australia, and North and South America.” The show’s strong international flavour will also be underlined by 21 country pavilions from Argentina, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Brazil, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, UK, and the USA. Beautyworld Middle East 2017 returns after a spectacular run in 2016, when it featured 1,522 exhibitors from 60 countries, and attracted 37,184 visitors from 135 countries, 25 per cent up on the previous year."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna announces several new features for its 50th edition,"“The 50th edition is recording record numbers”, said Franco Boni, President of the BolognaFiere Group.  Actually, this new edition will host 2.604 exhibiting companies (94 more than 2016) coming from 69 countries in the world. Among the 2017 exhibitors, 73% of them come from outside Italy. The exhibition is growing up to 7%, and there are great expectations on the number of visitors participating, too, with a +10% increase of online purchases to date, compared to 2016. The landmark trade show, which is organized in collaboration with Cosmetica Italia, the Italian personal care association and with the support of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development and the Italian Trade Agency (ITA), has been recognized by the Italian Ministry of Economic Department as one of Italian fairs with the highest international appeal.  The next edition will confirm this leadership with 29 Country Pavilions involved in the exhibition, +16% compared to the previous edition. For the first time ever Argentina, Chile, Japan, Latvia and United Arab Emirates will exhibit. To celebrate its 50th edition, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna will inaugurate Cosmoprime a new area dedicated to the masstige and prestige markets and to niche perfumery and opening from March 16th to 19th, 2017. With 151 exhibitors (81% coming from abroad) from 28 countries, Cosmoprime meets the particular requirements of the retail sector with special initiatives with an international impact. Within Cosmoprime, The Perfume Factory will offer attendants the opportunity to visit a real perfume manufacturing chain, from olfactory composition to maceration, from filtration to filling, packing and wrapping.  A limited edition fragrance will be produced, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, in collaboration with some leading suppliers including: ICR, Bormioli Luigi, Candiani, Aptar, Ima Group, Coven Egidio, Pusterla 1880 and Industrial Box. The fragrance has been created by the perfumer Luca Maffei. It is a gender-free Eau de Cologne revised from a contemporary and sophisticated viewpoint. The next Cosmoprof show will also host the first edition of Tones of Beauty, a project devoted to the multi-ethnic beauty, with cosmetic brands of “Black & Brown” products. Also presented for the first time at Cosmoprime, the BeOrganic area will be fully dedicated to companies producing certified organic beauty products. The number of exhibitors participating in Cosmopack, the show within the show dedicated to the supply chain of the beauty industry, is expected to grow by 8%, 50% of them coming from outside Italy and from 29 countries, including most European countries, Turkey, the USA, China, South Korea and Japan."
Are perfume brands really aware of trends?,"First, the agency worked with NPD: with their cash payment statistics, they shed a factual light on the selective market. “It is a way to put trends analyses into perspective, compared to the reality of the market,” Aurélie Dematons observes. “Sometimes, we get really surprised.” For example, NPD data show that in the category of women’s perfumes, floral fragrances only represent 32.5% of the products purchased, while historically, every year, they accounted for the majority of the products launched (about 60%). “Why do we keep launching so many floral perfumes, when according to NPD data, consumers prefer oriental ones?” Aurélie Dematons asks. Philippe Pourhashémi, founder of the Supremeye website, and journalist, designer, and talent scout in the world of fashion, is another partner of Aurélie Dematons’s, who identifies channels of influences thanks to his fashion expertise. In 2016, POP was one of the most dominant of them. “The Pop trend is a transversal trend: it can be found everywhere, in fashion, art, and perfumery.” With Pop, Aurélie Dematons describes a quick, colourful approach adopted by consumers who influence communication and packaging the same way as the olfactory strategy. “In communication, it is characterized by a very visual, playful way to seduce today’s young people, in particular on social networks, for example Instagram, which has really become a key vehicle for both major and small perfume brands,” Aurélie Dematons explains. “From an olfactory standpoint, it is conveyed by floral and fruity fragrances, whose top notes are designed for consumers to be attracted very fast in store,” she adds. The Pop trend expresses an urgent need to revive freedom and good humour and be joyful again. The perfumes following this movement take the opposite course of the year 2016, when the climate was stressful due to terrorist attacks and the loss of… pop icons! The third expert consulted was Hakim Azib, founder of the Bowe studio. “It was important to notice how packaging follows certain codes,” Aurélie Dematons explains. As an example, the study shows a return to themes that highlight the dressmaking heritage of renowned companies. This trend is illustrated with decorations that often sport a knot (Bottega Veneta, Burberry…). “This sort of tiny details marks the establishment and close relationship between perfumery and the DNA of the House that inspired them.” Lastly, with Annie Begnaud, founder of the Ab Agency, the study focused on the new means of expression and distribution implemented to make consumers discover products (samples accompanying the product, boxes, data targeting and cross-referencing…). Perfume trends by genre, transversal trends, 2016 news… the study conducted by Le Musc et la Plume deciphers last perfume year from all angles. “It is designed like a reference object that is easy to read in order to understand where we come from and where we are going,” Aurélie Dematons concludes. Study available in hard copy or as a training presentation."
MakeUp in LosAngeles: Digital natives shake up beauty trends,"The second edition of MakeUp in Los Angeles, which was held on 08-09 February 2017 at the Quixote Studios in West Holywood fulfilled all its promises with a number of exhibitors that doubled and a number of visitors that grew from 600 to 1,650 compared to the previous year. It must be said that in the makeup business, as in other sectors, California now plays a key role in innovations and trends.  The 2017 edition of MakeUp in Los Angeles focused on how digital influencers are revolutionizing beauty, and how brands can
harness this new power. ""The Beauty sphere is currently in a state of upheaval,"" said Leïla Rochet-Podvin, Founder of Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation, one of the experts charged with running the event’s conference programme.  ""Selfies, Snapchat or Instagram posts — in this new era dominated by influencers, consumers are totally ’hooked’ to their smartphones, and modifying the beauty landscape."" The birthplace of big internet American companies and of the great trends of recent years, California is at the heart of these upheavals.  “Los Angeles is a true melting pot, open to a large variety of cultural influences, and packed with a lot of big influencers: celebrities, artists and designers,” highlighted Noelle Kot, Associate, Global Marketing at Glamglow. Anastasia Soare, founder of Anastasia Beverly Hills, the epitome of these brands whose audience exploded thanks to social networks, shared her experience and explained how very good products can now gain a global fame in a very short lap of time. While TrendAnalytics has unveiled that 82% of women consider that social media have changed the definition of beauty, it is clear that all beauty brands were not equally successful in their digital strategies. Actually, while the circulation of a magazine like Glamour now reaches 2.3 million readers in the United States, the four main beauty influencers (bloggers and vloggers combined) reach an audience of 17 million people. “A brand cannot hand over its communication to web influencers without fully rethinking its relationship with its customers,” explained Conor Begley, co-founder at Tribe Dynamics, an agency specialising in digital marketing.  “In particular, it implies to let others tell your story,” he added.  In this context, MAC, Benefit, Too Face, Urban Decay, and MakeUp for Ever are the brands that - in the United States - have maximized the coverage provided by web influencers. Enough to feed the discussions in the lively alleys of the show!  “All the elements were present to make of MakeUp in LosAngeles a success. Top suppliers and top brands, had clearly decided to not to miss this event,” said Sandra Maguarian, the show manager.  Her only regret is that she was not able to host all the exhibitors who wanted to participate in the event because of the lack of space available.  A problem that should be solved as of the 2018 edition since the organizers have already found a new exhibition venue!"
Evaluating requisites and desires of the growing skin care products market,"There is a standup geographical demand for skin lightening or skin whitening creams and lotions at and along the equator. While the residents of the colder parts of the earth and those in gulf locations exhibit a significant affinity to tanning lotions and sun protect respectively. All geographies combined, the demand figures for sunscreen lotions and creams hold a dominant share of the overall revenue in the industry. This disparity of demands among the consumer populace are more of brownie points rather than a business hurdle. It has provided the vendors with enough freedom to maintain an economical balance in their choice of ingredients for product composition. Going by the figure, Asia-Pacific contributes the maximum share of revenue to the global roundup value. There is a thin divisive line in between the desired and the healthy. As a fact, skin is the largest organ of the human body which adds the first tier of protection against foreign particles and bodies. A good skin care regime for the entire body is necessary for every human to maintain overall health. There is a dire need for a typical shift from cosmetic skin care products that only aim at temporary lightening or brightening of the skin towards more natural products that nurture the skin from within the deep layers. As per market figures, a considerable mass of global population is experiencing the necessary shift at present. However, a majority remains to overcome their economic limitations and spare a part of their expenditures on effective skin care products. In addition, the product developers face intense pressure from the social and environmental activists that do not agree with either the publicity agenda or the constituent elements of their offerings. There have been campaigns across social media and internet pinning down that there being “fair and lovely” is not a requisite. In other instances, the environmentalists have raised their concerns against the use of constituents derived from exotic animals or plastic compounds for delivering “enhance beauty.” In latest news, the industry witnessed a ban on the use of microbeads as a scrubbing agent, citing it unnecessary and a menace to the environment at large. While some of the voices against the industry operations are conveniently tuned down because of their non-relevance, there are several others for which the industry has prepared an action plan. Manufacturers in this industry segment have their priorities set on catering to the core consumer desires, over their needs. The range of products that attend to the needs of a healthy skin are made available at higher prices than the rest. Prominent companies, such as Avon, Estee Lauder, and L’Oréal, have a committed base of buyers, their trust tagging along to the brand value of the products. Successful brands with high market value share the same history of teaming up with healthcare professionals and skin care experts to obtain primary customer reviews and resolve a common fix to their issues. They have leveraged strategic business acquisitions and mergers to capture the product lines with promising market potential. Small companies that venture out to introduce similar line of cosmeceuticals get a hold of local market easily but face a tough time making it big in the global commercial interface. Low marketing budgets and modest ingredients along with limited scope for research facilities for product development are the core restraining factors that make it difficult for small- to mid-sized manufacturers from shining solo. There exists a limited number of small names in the skin care products market that have managed to be consistent in their product quality, reputation, price, and yet managed to emerge as winners on global platforms. For the others, partnership with the pharmaceutical giants brings them an opportunity to improvise and enrich their portfolio. In addition, a sturdy advertising and marketing strategy helps them get recognized as a brand name. Although, seldom is the case when the prices have not hiked up post the strategic acquisition of these manufacturers. On a comparative note, the leading names in the skin care industry have felt the pulse of the regional markets. They realize that there is an opportunity to build remarkable profit margins within low-price range products. Simple compounds go into the making of these products as compared to the trademark complexes used in high-range alternatives. Low consumer expectations and the unquestioned trust on brand name helps garner remarkable profits. A sequence of latest product launches indicate that they are wary of not being able to capture the participation from midrange income consumers. These users comprise the population segment, which does not look upon skin care products as necessities to their lifestyle. With the introduction of low-priced products, the prominent industry vendors aim at inculcating a habit among their users, which can be leveraged to lure them into active participation across all market segments. According to the findings of a latest market research, the global skin care products market is bound to attain the $179 billion revenue mark by 2022. Business analysts predict the industry to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% over the rest of the forecast period 2016-2022. Adaptability and agility in response to consumption pattern aids the completion of set targets for the global industry."
Makeup continues to boost global prestige beauty sales,"Makeup continued its overall leading role in the global prestige beauty market in 2016.  Sales of prestige makeup products soared by 23% in South America in 2016 (compared to +9% for prestige skincare products and +13% for prestige fragrances), by 13% in North America (compared to +3% for prestige skincare products and + 1% for prestige fragrances) and by 6% in Europe (compared to +1% for prestige skincare products and fragrances), according to data from The NPD Group. In the U.S., sales of prestige beauty products grew by 7% in 2016 (vs +6% for the overall beauty market), according to The NPD Group.  The prestige beauty market was mainly driven by the increase in make-up sales (+12%) which, according to the market research firm, contributed to 76% of incremental gains of the sector in value and to 83% of the volume increase.  On the other hand, sales of prestige fragrances continue to weaken, with a growth of 1% only.  As far as prestige skincare sales are concerned, the U.S. market grew by 3% 2016. The trend is very similar in most markets, with consumers attracted in every product that can improve their appearance instantly including in a selfie made at any time of the day.  Self-staging on social media plays a key role in this phenomenon. In a dynamic global market, France was the exception in 2016.  Sales of prestige beauty products dropped by 3% compared to 2015, according to The NPD Group, the strongest decline in 10 years.  Skincare sales recorded the strongest decline (-7%), while sales of perfumes and make-up dropped by 2%. The French market, which has been suffering from a sluggish economic environment for several years, was strongly hit by the decline in foreign tourist numbers in 2016 after the wake of terror attacks, explained The NPD Group. ""The Paris region accounted for two-thirds of the decline, while it is usually a driver for the market,"" Mathilde Lion, a beauty specialist at NPD, told Reuters. However, some segments of the market remained unaffected by this trend and recorded strong growth in 2016. That is the case of niche fragrances, which are continuing to grow and, in the make-up category, of products for eyebrows, lipsticks or skin luminizers."
Cosme Tokyo: A window on Japan’s beauty trends,"“The show has grown by 30% in exhibition space this year,” said Takuya Ishimoto, Director of the show for Reed Exhibitions Japan. “We have worked on increasing the quality of exhibitors as well as the number of international companies with new country pavilions from the US, Spain and Turkey”, he added. The rise of international exhibitors has been a constant goal of the organizers. This year, the proportion of foreign companies coming from 36 different countries culminated at 40%.  The biggest contingent came from Korea, a long-time supplier for the Japanese beauty market. “The Japanese market is opening up to international markets but is still quite closed. Also, Japan is now aware of the competition coming from Korean and tries to differentiate itself with its historical culture,” analyzed Florence Bernardin, founder of Information & Inspiration, a beauty trends agency specializing on Asian markets. As usual, the show was divided in two areas with CosmeTokyo dedicated to finished products, which welcomed 8,454 visitors, and CosmeTech dedicated to the industry’s supply side and representing approximately 2/3 of the exhibition space, which welcomed 16,358 visitors. In total 24,812 professional visitors walked the floor, representing a 6.7% increase compared to 2016 (23,295 visitors). In order to further promote the internationalization of the show, the organizers also invited 100 buyers from overseas and organized B2B meeting with the exhibitors. A delegation of Japanese buyers and importers was also invited to the show to strengthen its position as the biggest trade show for cosmetics in Japan. “Japanese companies are trying to internationalize their services,” highlighted Takuya Ishimoto.  “We hope to bring more and more international visitors with a focus on professionals coming from Dubai and Russia, but also the Americas and Europe in the coming years. That’s why, the next edition will be held in early December to avoid clashing with Chinese New Year and the Holidays in occident. The show will change venue and go to Makuhari Messe to allow the exhibition to be held in one space and not in separate halls like it was this time.” Despite the organizers efforts, the internationalization of Japanese brands seems still timid. According to a buyer from US-based retailer TJX visiting the show, “buying Japanese brands is a difficult mission.  Most Japanese beauty brands are still unfamiliar with export procedures and the need of foreign customers outside Asia”, he added. Another key feature of the event was the importance of brands and suppliers with natural and/or organic claims. “The trade show reflects the current trend in the market: a great wave into natural products. There is an increasing sensitivity to health in Japan. After the Fukushima disaster and other health concerns consumers have started paying more attention into the ingredients used in their cosmetics products. Although Japanese were late at picking up the natural and organic trends, the market is considerably turning into them but also sustainable and locally sourced products with a focus on Japanese values,” concluded Florence Bernardin."
Cosmetic surgery market enjoys growth worldwide,"Specialists estimate continued and stable growth in cosmetic surgery procedures worldwide, with 8.9% growth by 2020. The market, worth US $8.5 billion 2016, could be worth US $9.2 billion in 2020. Global growth is above all driven by Asia, which saw annual growth of 10% in 2016 and should continue to follow Europe closely in 2020.  Demand in Asia is exploding, practitioners say, driven by a rapidly growing middle class and a quest for more Caucasian features. On the whole, the market for medical and surgical cosmetic procedures in the USA is predicted to account for almost half of the global market by 2020 (44%), followed by the Asia-Pacific region (23%), Europe (25%) and Latin America (7%). Behind the United States and Brazil, South Korea was the third biggest market for aesthetic treatments in 2015, with 1.2 million procedures out of a global total of 21.7 million, according to data from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS). While breast augmentation and liposuction are the most popular procedures in the USA, Brazil, Mexico and most of Europe, demand in South Korea is for eye, nose, cheek and chin resculpting. Injectable products (principally botulinum toxin and fillers) remain the market leaders in terms of value (38%), with an average annual growth of 8.3% per year expected until 2020. However, energy-based devices (laser, ultrasound, radiofrequency) and body contouring devices are almost as popular (35% of the global market), and higher average annual growth is expected (11%). Body contouring procedures saw the biggest growth in 2016, at 16.3%. This category includes various types of procedures, such as facelifts, abdominoplasty, buttock implants and liposuction. Cosmeceuticals (active cosmetics) are seeing stronger growth than breast implants, with average annual growth of 7.6% versus 2.2% from 2014 to 2019. Asia saw the strongest growth in breast implants, at 7.3%, compared to 0.4% in Europe. The IMCAS analysis was compiled using available data relating to the medical and surgical aesthetics market from market research companies, financial analysts and industry professionals present at the IMCAS Tribune."
"“The brand’s storytelling is a key factor of success”, Benny Tung, Parfumerie Trésor, Hong Kong","Premium Beauty News - What are the origins of the Parfumerie Trésor? Benny Tung - I studied in London and I discovered artistic perfumery in Europe with my sister, mainly in London and Paris.  As far as fragrances are concerned, the choice is much more limited in Hong Kong than in Europe.  We thought there was an opportunity to develop the artistic perfumery segment in Hong Kong and we partnered to open the city’s very first artistic perfume shop. It is a family-owned business and a family story. Fragrances have been very important in our personal and familial history. Premium Beauty News - How do you select the brands your distributing? Benny Tung - For food and for clothes my personal preference always goes to high quality and niche.  It is the same for fragrances.  The most interesting brands are those focusing on quality rather than on marketing.  Beyond quality, other very important criteria are the brand’s storytelling and emotional touch.  Of course, the brands we sell must match with the style of the store.  Eventually, exclusivity is a plus. Premium Beauty News - How many brands are you selling? Benny Tung - So far we’re selling 24 brands including 20 brands that are exclusive to Hong Kong and some are even exclusive to the Asia region. Let’s mention, for instance, Arabian Oud, Bella Bellissima, D’Orsay, E.Coudray, Evody, Fragrance Du Bois, Histoires de Parfums, Jardins d’Écrivains, Jovoy, Juliette Has A Gun, L.T. Piver, Laurent Mazzone, Les Parfums de Rosine, Making of Cannes, Memo, Van Cleef & Arpels, Xerjoff, Yosh... We import the brands and sell them in our retail store.  In most cases, we are their official distributor in Hong Kong.  We hope that the culture and lifestyle of niche and artistic perfumes can be appreciated and spread to other markets. Premium Beauty News - Who are your customers? Benny Tung - Most of our customers are women, but there are also some men looking for a gift and also some perfume lovers. About 60% of our customers are based in Hong Kong. We also have many customers from other Asian countries, mostly from Korea, but also from Japan and Malaysia, and also from mainland China.  While some of them are just starting to discover perfumes, younger consumers are already well informed about artistic fragrances. Floral and citrus notes are the most popular among our customers but woody fragrances also perform well during the winter.  However, clients from the Middle East or India prefer stronger and more woody perfumes. Clients from mainland China also appreciate oud."
MakeUp in Los Angeles promises to be the major makeup event of this start of year,"Premium Beauty News - More exhibitors and more visitors... more conferences and more speakers too? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - We were the first surprised by the enthusiasm MakeUp in Los Angeles generated across the entire industry. We knew that California was - more and more -, ""the place where things happen"" but it is clear that the explosion of the Internet phenomenon and e-sales literally boost our show, not just on the West Coast but also in all the other regions of the world where we are present. Simply because, MakeUp In is the only makeup event in the makeup industry that fits exactly to the evolution of this sector, with always more innovations, flexibility and subcontractors! The beauty industry is at a turning point in its history, revolutionized by technology and the arrival of Millennials (people born in the 1980s and 1990s), a savvy generation when it comes to the use of makeup. During the first day of the MakeUp in Los Angeles Event, on February 8, 2017 at the Quixote Studio, leading trend specialists, experts and brand representatives will provide insights of the major beauty trends shaping the future of our industry. With a special focus on the West Coast influences, considered as the innovation hub of beauty, this first day will be dedicated to the new influences that are disrupting our industry. Premium Beauty News - Do you think new winds of change are really blowing from the Californian coast in terms of makeup trends and innovations? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - The first conference on the first day, Wednesday, February 8 at 10:20am will set the scene! It will be given by Sarah Jindal, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst-Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel, on the theme: ""Overview of Upcoming Trends and the California Influence."" Sarah will present the beauty trends in the US and how they should influence the future of our industry. She will also focus on the West Coast and the specificities of this market. Another highlight of this first morning in Los Angeles, makeup in the movie industry. An unavoidable topic in Los Angeles, just a few steps away from Hollywood. A theme that will be closely reviewed from 01:30 pm to 02:30 pm, this same Wednesday, February 8, by Michele Burke, MakeUp Artist. For her, ""designing makeup for leading ladies and men on feature films is a highly specialized field. High profile actors, producers, directors as well as time and money restraints require the film makeup artist to develop a unique eye, special skills and techniques."" On Thursday, February 9, from 11:45 am 12:30 pm, another conference not to be missed, That of Antoinette van den Berg, ""The Lady in Blu"" from the Future-Touch Company, themed: ""New Influences: Changing time concepts."" Antoinette believes that, ""usually future cosmetic trends, are defined by visual elements. While new influences are non visual and in-material"". ""The Lady in Blu"" will visualize in-material influences that will lead to new time concepts and shine a light on how to use the changes as a source of inspiration for product and concept development in the cosmetic industry. Premium Beauty News - This second edition of MakeUp in Los Angeles will mostly be an opportunity to meet top brands that influence the makeup generation.  Sandra Maguarian -  Absolutely! Anastasia, SmashBox, GlamGlow, Flirt, Nyx, Stila, Houglass, Yes To, Ilia Beauty, Rituel de Fille…, will be some of the top brands who will take part and enliven the various discussions at the roundtables and conferences of this second edition of MakeUp in LosAngeles. As of the first hour of the first day, the tone will be given! Anastasia Soare will open this first session of debates by retracing her path, probably one of the most amazing in this West Coast saga. Beauty pioneer, creative visionary and powerhouse entrepreneur Anastasia Soare is Founder, CEO, and driving force behind Anastasia Beverly Hills (ABH) - one of the fastest-growing brands in the global beauty industry. The digital influence, which is irrigating the beauty sphere from its Californian epicenter, will be one of the hot topics of this day with the presence of brands like Stila (Samantha Cutler, Chief Product Development Officer); Hourglass (Kate Helfrich, Vice President Product Development); Yes to (Ingrid Jakel, CEO) and NYX (Joyce Kim, Vice President Product Development). Another highlight of the first day will be the roundtable on Millennials with the exceptional presence of Jill Tomandl, VP Product Development & Innovation at Lauder - Smashbox. A round table dedicated to the influence of Millennials with the participation of innovation Millennials in the Lauder Group (ELC Gen Next), from the brands Clinique (Karina Spritz); Glamglow (Noelle Kot) Flirt (Vanessa Munoz) and Smashbox (Kia Ragland). Finally, the Wellness trend, which is flooding the beauty planet, will be at the centre of exchanges taking place at the last round table with rising brands in makeup and represented by their founders, Katherine & Caroline Ramos for Rituel de Filles and Sasha Plavsic for Ilia Beauty. Premium Beauty News - Particularly ""rich"" conferences in perspective? Sandra Maguarian - It is with the help of Leila Rochet-Podvin - in charge of this first day of conferences - and speakers, that you will get a better understanding of the growing influence of new technologies and social networks. Beauty is more daring, more hedonistic, a sign of our ever more connected society that now uses images to communicate. Selfies, Snapchat or Instagram posts – in this new era dominated by influencers, consumers are totally “hooked” to their smartphones, and modifying the beauty landscape. Premium Beauty News - Packaging of course will also be in the spotlight! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Make up products are the combination of three inseparable elements, present in any and all product, and which must work together in close harmony to generate the expected result: the formula, the packaging and the applicator. The combination of different areas to treat (eyes, lips, nails…), each with its own specific demands, with a wealth of packaging technologies (tubes, pencils, swivel mechanisms, sprays…), not to forget a booming number of applicator types (brushes, felt-tips, flock-tips, spatulas, balls…) results in significant complexity, that brands must master in order to introduce products that meet the high expectations of ever more educated, demanding and mobile consumers. Thursday, February 9 from 11am to 12pm and then in the afternoon from 02:30 pm to 05:00 pm, Gérald Martines, Founder and President of IN•SIGNES and his industry peers will show you how to make the ""right packaging choice"". The first ""Beauty Packaging"" workshop will help you get a complete overview of this vast universe and better understand the technology behind it. This workshop will present the process for selecting the appropriate packaging for a specific application and will set up a comprehensive typology of cosmetic packagings: – Inventory of makeup areas,
– Specific constraints,
– The selection process of a packaging type,
– Overview of the main dosage forms for cosmetic formulas: lotions, serums, oils, gels, wax…
– Combining make up application with packaging technology: Cosmetic packaging typology. From 02:30 pm to 05:00 pm, you will know everything about mascaras, lipgloss, lipsticks, pencils and packaging intended for foundations. You will get a grasp at the basic technology at work, identify critical functions and walk through the main criteria to consider developing an impeccably operating pack, from material compatibility issues to air tightness and more. A workshop where you will have access also to some significant innovations and current technology trends to provide Marketing Product Managers and Packaging Engineers with a comprehensive overview. Mascara is beyond dispute the cosmetic category where the interaction between the formula, the applicator and the pack plays the most critical role, and where innovations in these elements nourish each other, resulting in a sustained stream of novelties. Second packaging thoroughly reviewed, Lipgloss, which is probably the favorite lip make up category with the younger generations, because of its ease of use and an ever-increasing palette of available effects. After being a relatively low tech category for a while lipgloss has seen a sustained pace of innovation in applicators and packaging solutions lately making it a very dynamic category. Third ""featured"" packaging, traditional lipstick, which remains the flagship of any makeup lineup. Innovations in multi-benefit formulas and new gestures have lately fueled a corresponding flow of innovations in packaging solutions in order to handle the more demanding modern lipstick formulations or the new ways in which makeup brands are utilizing the good old mechanisms. Then come pencils, are a ubiquitous make up solution, which has invaded virtually all makeup applications from eyes to lips and face, not to forget the highly dynamic segment of brows. The classical wooden pencil, still a must, has evolved into a wealth of solutions from plastic to automatic pencils opening lots of opportunities for innovative applications. Finally how not to review packagings intended for foundation, which is the foundation... of makeup. Few categories embrace as many applications, combining such a vast variety of formula types, each with its own requirement in terms of texture and viscosity, with a large choice of packaging solutions that must be carefully selected to properly deliver the optimal result.

Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech to open their biggest edition next week,"Year after year, the Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech trade show continues growing.

Perfume brands successfully target young women consumers,"Are women under 35 years of age the best bet for perfume makers? With total sales of 390 million euros YTD end of August 2016, the segment of perfumes targeting Millennial women account for one third of women’s perfumes sales in value. According to The NPD Group, this segment reported a significant resurgence over the past two years in France and is now one of the main drivers of the market growing by +5% over the period August 2014 - August 2015 and +4% over the period August 2015 - August 2016 in a market that dropped by 2% in 2016. The trend far exceeds the French market with a double-digit growth several other European countries including Spain and Italy. In order to attract digital-native women whose expectations and consumption patterns are deemed to widely differ from those of their elders, brands have opted for two different strategies. The first one consists in launching a brand-new concept, such as Olympea by Paco Rabanne (best European [1] launch in 2015). The second strategy consists in the reinterpretation and rejuvenation of a major classic line such as YSL’s Black Opium (best European launch in 2014) or Poison Girl by Dior (best European launch in 2016, based on YTD figures October 2016). ""Big names adopt a very targeted communication to attract women under 35. For example, bottles of reinterpreted classics are entirely customized, with more girly or glittery colours. Brands also try to build familial stories by choosing movie star’s children or former beauty icons as global ambassadors. A key role is given to music as well as to digital marketing which offers immersive experiences thus multiplying consumers’ commitment on social networks. Furthermore, communication is often unconventional, putting forward a more rebellious or offbeat way of life than their elders,"" says Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. Fall 2016 has only accentuated the trend, with several key launches typically targeting Millennials such as YSL’s Mon Paris, N° 5 L’Eau by Chanel or Kenzo’s World (the three top performing launches of October 2016, according to The NDP Group). ""However, while these new proposals are clearly meeting success, we did not survey the real age of those actually buying these perfumes and that could be a source of surprises,"" adds Mathilde Lion.  Indeed, both prestige brands and retailers are aware of the difficulty to attract younger consumers in the selective channel. As far as men’s fragrances are concerned, the trend contrasts with the women’s market. According to NPD, sales of fragrances targeting younger men have fallen sharply over the last two years (-7% YTD August 2015, -8% YTD August 2016). However, the market research company deems that this segment, which accounts for only 18% of the entire prestige men’s fragrance market, has a great potential for growth. Depending on their success, recent launches might therefore reverse the trend."
Italy-based colour cosmetics supplier Regi is starting its US factory,"Premium Beauty News - Quite a progression for your company since its creation, in 1994. What explains this success? Vittoria Cicchetti - Since the beginning, we have been an open-minded, customer oriented, very transparent and earnest company. We try to create a strong partnership with our clients. We love to work together, move forward together and grow together with them. At the same time, we are always trying to spark innovation, in all its forms. Our R&D department is constantly pushing forward to implement new technologies: that’s why we are always up to date with the cosmetics world’s evolution. We take pride in the quality of our products and processes, certified by the highest quality standards. Each year we work to improve our supply and production chain, to give our clients the best possible service. Premium Beauty News - Within a few years Regi has become a major supplier in the make-up business. The opening of a new plant in the United States is a key step of the company’s global expansion. Vittoria Cicchetti - We created the company in 1994. Very quickly we benefited from strong growth. And as of the year 2010 we decided to build a new industrial site in Crema where we are now and then to settle in India in 2010 in a factory with a surface area of 3,500 sq. m. (37 673 sq. ft.). As for Regi USA that we are now opening, it was designed as a new production and distribution unit, a new milestone for our company, with the clear idea to merge our business model into an American operational approach and an innovative logistics system. Our presence on the US market goes back to many years, just like the decision to invest in tailor-made formulations to suit the American market.  It became a reality this year, with a 4,500 sq. m. (48,437 sq. ft.) facility, replicating the same technological standard as Regi’s HQ in Italy. The plant is fully equipped to deal with the main product categories from day one (powders, emulsions, anhydrous products) with a possibility for expansion. Premium Beauty News - You already had a footprint in the United States. This new plant is a logical outcome!   Vittoria Cicchetti - Over the years, our relationship with American clients grew so much tighter that it almost seemed natural to get closer to them physically. Regi USA has the same imprinting that our clients are familiar with: over the edge technology, high capacity, flexibility, certified quality standards, total traceability, quality as our philosophy of work.  And the same level of expertise of our people and the same love for our products than we have in Italy. At the same time, Regi USA will be a revolution for our US customers and all those who need global distribution thanks to a faster, simpler and more comfortable way to work together. A great step forward: to imagine, develop and produce literally by their side. New challenges, new solutions but the same passion."
UK: Sales of prestige beauty products jump 6% post-Brexit,"The greatest growth post-Brexit has been in the sale of niche fragrances (£125+) and super premium skincare (£200+), both of which reported double digit growth. “The growth in prestige beauty sales is impressive,” says Teresa Fisher, Senior Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. She adds, “Post-Brexit there was much uncertainty in the market, but what these figures show is that the demand for luxury and prestige beauty products has been boosted by Brexit. Why? We know that shopping in the UK became less expensive for overseas tourists due to the drop in the value of the pound and that the largest growth in the market has been in London and online.” The prestige beauty market in the UK was valued at £2,446 million in 2015. The post-Brexit sales boom mainly concerns luxury, high-end beauty products with a premium price tag.  Reporting double digit growth, super premium skincare sales rose 32% compared to the same period in 2015, and in comparison to pre-Brexit where the sector only grew by 4%. Niche fragrances reported an increase of 59.5% in sales compared to the same period in 2015, growing twice as fast as vs pre-Brexit (at 28% growth in January to June 2016 compared to 2015). A survey carried out by Dealabs, France leading platform for sharing good deals, shows that average prices of cosmetic products (mass or prestige) are 3% lower on British online sales platforms than in France. Taking into account the exchange and delivery costs, buying on a British website is therefore especially interesting for the most expensive products. Most regions in the UK reported growth in sales of prestige beauty products with Midland and the East plus Yorkshire and the North East demonstrating the strongest areas outside London. However, it was in London where the greatest growth was reported and this was mimicked online. For the three-month period July to September 2016, online sales (although it only represents 9.2% of total prestige beauty market) increased by 34.3% compared to the period July to September 2015 and contributes most (43.7%) to total prestige beauty growth in this period. The second biggest contributor in the three-month period post Brexit was London, with 37.9% of total growth, increasing sales at by 7.3%. London represents 30.1% in value of the total prestige beauty market in the UK. The drop of the British currency in the wake of the Brexit vote was followed by moderate inflation, mainly boosted by cost of clothing and footwear, recreation and culture and furnishings. The fact that prices did not grow faster is probably due to the high margins some economic players were able to achieve when the Sterling surged during the euro crisis.  However, it is not known how long main players will resist to the temptation to increase prices in particular before the Christmas festive season. “We have already seen that some manufacturers in the news have increased their pricing so it will be an opportunity to review the future ahead with regards to consumer’s ongoing purchasing habits,” concludes Teresa Fisher."
More launches in niche perfumery than in the selective network in 2016,"More than 2,000 new perfumes were launched all around the world in 2016, a high figure that mirrors the progress observed over the past few years. Among them, 41% come from niche perfumery, and 34% from the selective network – a significant shift since 2015. It should also be highlighted that the share of women and men’s perfumes is declining, to the advantage of the “mixed” or “non-positioned” types typical of niche perfumery, which has become the prevailing genre: it now represents 43% of the offering, compared to 17% in 2006. Isabelle Ferrand observes that men’s fragrance trails “are reaching new power heights.” “Along with the family of Woody fragrances, which prevails, the Fern family is making a strong comeback, but more like a sub-family. Without being dominant, it appears like a hint behind woody or oriental bases. The Hesperides family is losing ground, but citrus fruit still remain easily perceptible as top notes.” Women’s fragrances are mainly classified in the Floral family, for 72% of perfumes, followed by the Oriental family, 13%. There is even a tendency to make hybrid fragrances with the Oriental family: the term “Floriental” is now increasingly used. As for “non-positioned” perfumes, which should now be considered a determining category on the market, the families ranked at the top are Floral (36%) and Woody perfumes (31%). “In the future, I bet Woody fragrances will boom among women’s perfumes,” explains Isabelle Ferrand, always on the look-out for weak signals. The rose remains the queen, as it is claimed by many brands. Iris is also used regularly in olfactory compositions, and more surprisingly, in the new Cartier fragrance for men: L’Envol. Isabelle Ferrand also emphasizes the fact that patchouli is settling as the new flagship ingredient of the year. Isabelle Ferrand has noticed more and more savoury bases in perfumery, which has opened to exclusive influences with cannabis, caviar, buckwheat, algae, rain, chestnut, champagne, or wasabi notes… As for the sweet flavours, pear notes are gaining ground, and sweet notes like honey, coffee, or crème brûlée remain well-positioned. “This year, the phenomenon to pay attention to is that of perfume couples. Think about Zadig et Voltaire, who have launched their men-women duo at the same time, or about the simultaneous launch of One Million and Lady Million as a Privé version, or how Jean-Paul Gaultier has put Mâle and Classique closer together. Given all these recent daring campaigns, we can imagine heterosexual couples will soon no longer be a reference to launch a perfume couple,” Isabelle Ferrand anticipates. To be continued in 2017."
MakeUp in SaoPaulo puts the spotlights on innovation,"In a context characterized by the recession of the Brazilian economy with a strong attention to prices, all eyes were on the show’s famous ""Innovation Tree,"" which unveiled a selection of the most cutting-edge new products. Among these innovations we selected: – Alkos’s new ’Single Twins Eyebrows’ product, a double-ended pencil featuring one end for drawing and definition, and another to fill, set and highlight eyebrows and ensure they stay in place all day, to address the full brows trend that has been on air for some time now.
– ’Miracle Sensation Purple,’ a highly pigmented pen eyeliner in a striking purple shade designed by Schwan Cosmetics.  According to the manufacturer it lasts for 8 hours or longer. The liner is water-resistant, free from parabens, and dries to a matte finish.
– Faber-Castell’s latest invention, a magnetic lipliner made using a gel-like formula for an extra-smooth finish. The liner, which comes in highly pigmented color variations, is soft and creamy when applied, but hardens into a ’magnetic’ finish that lasts for 8 hours after less than a minute.
– While bold lips have been on trend for some time, lipsticks manufacturer Weckerle has been working on an alternative — the transparent ’Ph-Antastic Lipstick’. The product reacts with the skin’s pH levels upon application, forming a custom shade in a crystalline high-shine finish.
– As far as packaging is concerned, Qualipac has come up with a solution to the problem of fiddly packages, such as mascara, eyeliners and lip gloss tubes. Its new product ’One Touch’ offers a simple press-and-release mechanism that can be custom designed with multiple materials and shapes. While the Brazilian cosmetics market has proved particularly resilient in the economic crisis that has hit the country since 2014, competition in this market has steadily increased.  The positions of the main players were reshuffled. Natura’s market share thus dropped from 14.9% in 2010 to 11.1% in 2015. Simultaneously, the Boticário Group, the other Brazilian cosmetics giant, recorded a rise of its market share from 6.9% in 2010 to 10.9% in 2015. ""The Boticário Group has been able to anticipate changes in Brazilian consumption habits and transform its businesses into a multichannel model,"" explains Valeria Grossmann, General Director of design agency Centdegrés in Brazil. In such a context, the participants in MakeUp in SaoPaulo insisted on the key role of innovation to boost the growth of beauty brands. For instance, Arcade Beauty and Adhespack, two specialists in sampling and single-use packaging, highlighted the huge potential of samples in an increasingly digitized market. According to Daniel Fernandes de Oliveira, Business Intelligence Manager at ABIHPEC, the Brazilian association for the personal care industry, makeup is probably the category with the greatest growth potential in Brazil. The country accounts for 50% of cosmetics sales in Latin America, but only for 42% of the makeup consumption. ""For several years, Brazilian cosmetics players have demonstrated their ability to innovate while containing the rise of prices,"" he said. This perfectly matches with the expectations of Brazilian consumers whose great interest in cosmetic products seems to be hampered only by the limitation of their purchasing power."
How Millenials are driving the digital beauty revolution,"Considering that what Millennials are doing now is what everyone will be doing soon, it is key to have a better understanding of their behaviours. “For beauty brands, digital beauty is the next major wave that will create a dramatic shift in the beauty industry and how consumers interface with their products. Many brands are still trying to navigate how to embrace and adjust to this new generation of beauty buyers,” said Sinead Norenius-Raniere, Board Member of the Bay Area Beauty Association. According to Facebook data, nearly 1 in 2 surveyed Millennial [1] and Gen X [2] beauty buyers in the US are still looking for the beauty style and products that work best on them. Where are they looking? Not just magazines, stores and TV anymore. Digital is now a main channel for beauty purchasers, with mobile leading the way. Indeed, beauty accounts on Instagram attract over 20 million unique followers in the US.  “Women now have a vibrant array of content creators to gather advice on the latest beauty products and techniques from ease of their mobile phone. Whether it’s a friend who shares their same skin concern or a blogger with a great smoky eye, women are relating to other women who they feel have less to personally gain from sharing their beauty know-how,” explains Facebook IQ (a Facebook division focused on research, data, and trends) In parallel, the survey conducted by Poshly on 175 women between the ages of 18-35 finds 65% millennials trust the makeup recommendation of a makeup artist or beauty influencer on Instagram or YouTube over a salesperson in the store. While Facebook finds 56% Young Millennial Beauty Buyers (18-24) agree that when it comes to make-up, they are adventurous and enjoy experimenting with their look. The Poshly survey reveals that 78% would be more inclined to purchase makeup from a brand if they could see what it looks likes virtually on their face before purchasing it. When it comes to age segmentation, Facebook IQ shows there are significant variations on how the different age classes consider beauty.  While Younger Millennials (18-24) are more open to experimenting with beauty products they are also more likely to embrace not wearing make-up in content they post on Instagram, using the #nomakeup. Older Millennials (25-34) are more comfortable in their own skin but start to think about remedies against aging, including battling wrinkles, covering dark circles and creating the appearance of dewy skin.  They aren’t as up to date on the latest beauty tips and tricks as they were just a few years ago. Eventually, for Gen Xers (35-44) beauty is part of a holistic approach to overall wellness.  Their resources and priorities are different from their younger counterparts, too. Many still consult magazines, and they’re more focused on their “me time.” Gen X women also post more about their lives, with hashtags like #kids, #fitmom, #yoga and #lovemyjob being unique to this group on Instagram."
Cosmoprof Asia 2016: Record numbers confirm the success of the new format,"For its 2016 edition, Cosmoprof Asia faced a daunting challenge. Held in cramped conditions last year in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC), the show had no other choice than move to larger premises.  The organizers thus decided to split the show into two distinct venues: suppliers (packaging, formulas, Ingredients, machinery) were therefore moved to AsiaWord-Expo (AWE), a modern and large exhibition centre near the airport, while finished products and some selected suppliers stayed at the HKCEC, on the Hong Kong island. This strategy not only allowed the show to host new exhibitors (650 new companies) and new sectors (ingredients, machines), but it was also well accepted by both visitors (up 21%!) and exhibitors. The event welcomed 650 new companies this year taking the total number of exhibitors to 2,698 from 49 countries and regions. 732 companies from 19 countries exhibited at the AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE), the venue for packaging, ingredients and processing equipment, from 15-17 November 2016. Finished cosmetics were showcased at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) from 16-18 November 2016 by 1,966 companies from 49 countries. Cosmoprof Asia 2016 hosted 24 national and group pavilions from Australia, Belgium, Brazil, California, China, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA with inaugural pavilions from Bulgaria and Latvia. The fair played host to 76,818 trade visitors from 129 countries and regions (21% increase over 2015). “With the strong international representation and presence, Cosmoprof Asia remains the indisputably most important networking opportunity in Asia Pacific for the beauty industry,” said Michael Duck, Executive Vice President, UBM Asia Ltd. For the first time ever, AWE served as a focused venue for companies specialising in packaging, machinery, OEM, contract manufacturing and raw materials. While a handful of key exhibitors decided not to participate this year, the overall mood on the show floor was very positive, in particular because of the impressive affluence, proving the visitors clearly understood where to find what they were looking for. The headline event was the first edition of the Innovation Circle Awards, organised in partnership with trends agency Beautystreams, recognising the most innovative packaging, design and formula. A jury panel comprised of the beauty industry’s elite including AmorePacific, Centdegrés, L’Oréal, Marie Dalgar, Martha Tilaar Group and NYX Cosmetics selected the winners and products were displayed in a prominent area on the show floor. The Lipstick Factory in Hall 5 gave live demonstrations on the manufacturing process of a luxury lipstick thanks to a partnership with three leading Italian exhibitors - Brivaplast (packaging), Chromavis (formulation) and Vetraco (machinery). The project was supported by the Italian Ministry of the Economic Development and ITA - Italian Trade Agency, in collaboration with Cosmetica Italia - Personal Care Association. At the HKCEC, the “Extraordinary Gallery” in Hall 3G took centre stage. Here a selected group of coveted and innovative multicultural brands from supply chain and finished products displayed their products. On this occasion, a special edition of a high-end nail lacquer in three unique colours and textures was jointly created by Centdegrés, Groupe Pochet (glass), Fiabila (nail polish) and trend agency Beautystreams. Concomitant to the show, a rich information programme comprising more than 30 educational sessions offered world class content to all participants. The World Asia Forum held across both venues addressed the industry’s most talked about trends and topics. Sessions in AWE focused on the latest ingredients, technologies and packaging, while at HKCEC visitors discovered the latest trends and development in product, branding and marketing. Cosmoprof Asia will be back in 2017 from 14 to 16 November at AsiaWorld-Expo and from 15 to 17 November at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre."
"The beard, a massive success among the French","No one can deny how much hair has been growing on men’s faces recently. Just over half of Frenchmen (52%) surveyed by Ifop say they are always closely shaven, compared to 48% who declare they have a beard, a moustache, or a goatee. Still, the beard remains the most common facial hair form among men, with 40% of bearded men among the adult men’s population. If several beard styles can be differentiated, it is the three-day beard that is the most popular (24% of bearded men), ahead of the ten-day beard (8%), the short beard (5%), and the long beard (1%). However, there is no general agreement about the moustache, far from it: only 4% of the French aged over 18 have yielded to it. The same goes for the goatee (3%) and short beards on the chin (1%). Nonetheless, this big comeback is far from concerning all generations and social classes to the same extent. Indeed, wearing a beard seems to be closely related to the age of the people surveyed: the proportion of bearded men is twice more important among young men under 35 (52%) than among seniors aged over 60 (24%). And it is among thirty-year-olds aged 25-34 that it is more common to wear a beard (55%). And yet, it is actually reaching the older generation (50% for men aged 35-50), which shows having a beard is not or no longer restricted to young people. It can also be noticed that the beard is mostly popular among upper working classes, in particular managers and higher intellectual occupations (54%) like teachers, journalists, and artists. The survey results also highlight a North/South split as regards the prevailing form of hair among the male sex. It is actually in the regions located in the North-East and North-West quarters of France that the proportion of hairy faces represents a majority, except in the Parisian region, where beards and hairy faces are a minority (43%). On the contrary, the proportion of closely shaven men represents a majority in all regions south of the Loire river. And after the large central region, it is in Provence that it is the lowest. Bearded or closely shaven? Women are really divided over this issue. Half of them consider closely shaven men are sexier, and 45% are more easily tempted by bearded men, in particular men with a three-day beard (33%). Just like their male counterparts, women are much less attracted by moustaches (only 2% think men with a moustache are sexier) and beards on the chin (1%). It should be noted that young girls are extremely seduced by bearded men. More than eight French women aged under 25 out of 10 (81%) think men are sexier with a beard. According to Ifop analysts, “if clean-shaven faces remain the standard among a narrow majority of Frenchmen, more hairy faces are unquestionably trendier right now, in particular among young men massively encouraged to wear the beard by women their own age.” The beard has seduced a large share of the male population by going much beyond “bobo” and other “hipster” borders through a social imitation process."
Increasingly image-conscious men and baby boomers boost the beauty market,"According to a recent survey by Canadean [1], the increasingly visually-oriented culture of society often means consumers associate image with success. While women are 1.3 times more likely to feel under pressure to look good than men, both genders associate appearance with success in personal and professional lives, with 66% of women and 61% of men subscribing to this belief. The belief that image correlates with success is strong across all age groups, with over half of consumers agreeing. Young adults aged 16-24, however, are likely to be most influenced by this notion, with 65% agreeing, decreasing to 60% among those aged 55 and over. “This trend reflects how image-consciousness is catching up with men and baby boomers, demonstrating narrowing gender and age disparities in the beauty market,” explains Veronika Zhupanova, Analyst for Canadean. According to Canadean, the increasing number of occasions when men use skincare products exhibits this trend.  “Among major global economies, men used skincare products on 453 billion occasions in 2011, which shot up to 557 billion occasions in 2015. Meanwhile, as image-conscious consumers age, the desire to maximize appearance among the older generation will increase,” said the market research firm. “With image-consciousness becoming ever-more pervasive among aging populations in developed economies and the pension age rising, competition to look good among this demographic will drive demand in categories such as anti-aging skincare and make-up, as consumers seek to impress employers and appear as dynamic as younger colleagues,” noted Zhupanova. Amongst the young, social media, now a popular daily ritual, can be a significant driver of image-consciousness. “Selfie” culture encourages the taking of close-up photographs as a means of self-expression and impressing peers. The close-up nature of the shots, however, means potential for skin imperfections to be captured is high, and may encourage people to seek out products to minimize this. “While there have been a number of launches targeting photo occasions for young adults, such as Estée Lauder’s Flash Photo Powder, older consumers remain overlooked despite increasing social media use. This demographic offers prime opportunities in the make-up and skincare categories to innovate in line with the latest trends, such as the desire to be always ‘photoready’ during busy days. In order to make the most of this opportunity, companies should be subtle in their marketing towards older consumers, emphasizing the important role photos have in making memories, for example,” continued Zhupanova."

Cosmoprof Asia 2016 opens first “One Fair Two Venues” event this week,"Cosmoprof Asia 2016 will play host to 2,698 exhibitors (compared to 2,504 in 2015). More than 60,000 attendees are expected. Japan is the Country of Honour this year in cooperation with the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) with the support of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Japan Cosmetic Industry Association (JCIA). A product showcase, a networking reception, onsite demonstrations and market-specific seminars will highlight the Japanese cosmetics market.

"The ""MakeUp In"" trade shows strengthen their global implantation strategy","Premium Beauty News - In eight years the gone through road is quite impressive! Sandra Maguarian - In such a fast moving and complex world, hungry for change, there is no room for complacency! This doesn’t mean we are not proud of what we have already achieved, on the contrary, but we must constantly adapt to this fast-changing world. Our shows prove it! Eight years ago, they simply did not exist! Just take a look at what’s going on in the make-up sector with this redistribution of cards between newcomers and traditional players. Who would have imagined a few years ago, the pace at which some small and medium brands are gaining a firm foothold at the expense of big brands, via the internet and the power of bloggers and influencers. Everything has changed in just a years months. Premium Beauty News - Your strategy is to be where things happen in terms of make-up innovations? Sandra Maguarian - It’s impossible to predict everything of course, but we do our best to anticipate and be there when the wave is just starting growing to accompany it. Clearly, the timing of the first MakeUp in Paris in 2010 was perfect! The launch of a similar event in New York also made sense. As did the successive openings in Sao Paulo and Seoul. Creating the first BtoB event in Korea in 2013 also stuck perfectly with the sudden attractiveness of the country for its innovations in formulas and packaging. And the recipe was the same for MakeUp in LosAngeles. In both cases, the fashion aspects had full hold. Imagine that we simply increased twofold the number of exhibitors at MakeUp in LosAngeles from one year to the other! Simply outstanding, don’t you think? Premium Beauty News - You announced that MakeUp in NewYork will stay in Manhattan but moves on the 5th Avenue in 2017. Sandra Maguarian - We can’t wait to give the good news this week. As you know, it is not that easy to find a venue in Manhattan meeting all our requirements. This new venue which is located at number 415 of this mythical 5th Avenue is a place that meets all these requirements. It is in the centre of Manhattan, therefore ideally placed, easy to access, on two very accessible levels for visitors. This new venue will also allow us to strengthen the exclusive nature of our event with a limited number of floor places. Premium Beauty News - In Asia, you decided to extend the concept? Sandra Maguarian - The success of MakeUp in Seoul is undeniable! But the make-up market is evolving very quickly in Asia. And as you know, each country in this geographic area has its own strong cultural identity. It influences behaviours trends, expectations, needs. The MakeUp In concept must adapt to these cultural identities and try to satisfy each component of a booming region. This is also the same approach that led us to create MakeUp in LosAngeles while in the meantime MakeUp in NewYork is progressing year after year. One country, two events! For Asia, obviously such a large and diverse area can only be covered properly by becoming directly involved in each of its countries and by seeking to find or bring the good ""make-up"" word in each country. Not any country, of course: after South Korea, China and Japan are obviously the three pillar countries of this legitimacy in the field of make-up and skincare. MakeUp in Seoul changes to MakeUp in Asia and will take place successively as planned in Seoul on 5 and 6 April next, then in Shanghai in April 2018 and in Tokyo in April 2019, to settle in Seoul again in April 2020. A logical, coherent and efficient itinerary for the benefit of visitors and exhibitors! Premium Beauty News - All in all, quite an impressive network of events! Sandra Maguarian - It is not for the sake of growing. Above all it’s efficiency that’s driving us! It is also demand coming from this vast variety of visitors/exhibitors. This comes down in one year, to five events, three months apart! Think globally but act locally! "
France: Pharmacies directly compete with perfume shops and department stores,"In a context where French consumers are increasingly sensitive to prices and promotions when health and beauty products are concerned, it is not surprising to see that high-end distribution channels are losing ground. Indeed, the data revealed by Sandrine Cayeux and Anaïs Dupuy, Consumer Insight specialists at Kantar Worldpanel, during the seminar organised by FEBEA on current changes in the French beauty retail channels, show a steady growth of mass market channels and discount channels. On the contrary, the selective circuit (perfume stores and department stores) continues to lose ground, despite its resistance in the fragrance segment. However, the pharmacy channel remains very attractive and seems not to be impacted by this phenomenon.  ""In five years, the selective channel lost 2.5 million buyers and recorded a decrease of the average basket value,"" said Sandrine Cayeux. Actually, the competition is tough.  On average, French consumers visit 4 retail businesses for their beauty hygiene purchases out of a total of 220 theoretically available in this segment. However, according to Kantar, the pharmacy channel appears as the main competitor of perfumeries and department stores. A third of the people who make their purchases in the selective circuit also buys beauty and hygiene products in pharmacies.  There are also 7.9 people who buy their products both in pharmacies and online, in addition to the selective circuit.  Purchasing powers of consumers buying in the selective channel and in the pharmaceutical channel are also very similar. Nevertheless, customers of the selective channel are younger than those of the pharmacy channel since regular attendance of pharmacies starts with the first child. The two channels have other similarities: they are appreciated for the variety of their offer, the in-store advice and the facility to find the right products on the shelves. However, perfumeries and department stores show better performance for the shopping experience, loyalty offers and the distribution of samples.  The strengths of pharmacies are the advice by a professional and the quality of products. Over the past five years, the number of buyers of hygiene and beauty products in pharmacies has grown steadily (with a penetration rate rising from 28% in 2011 to 29.9% in 2016) and a rise in the average value of purchase (69.3 euros in 2016 vs. 62.8 euros in 2011) and in the frequency of purchases. Let’s note however that 60% of incremental volumes earned by pharmacies are a net gain for the overall market and not simply the cannibalization of other circuits. But when cannibalization exists, half of it is affecting perfumeries and department stores. When asked by Kantar about the reasons to buy beauty products in pharmacies, French consumers first mention “the quality of products”, “the possibility to find skincare products suitable for sensitive skins"" and ""the quality/price ratio.” The pharmacy channel appears as a more serious competitor than the web for the selective channel, although online sales still have significant room for improvement in France, where they account for 7% of total beauty prestige sales, compared to 26% in the UK. According to Kantar, online buyers have a lower purchasing power than perfumery customers and are highly motivated by discounts.  “The online channel has its own specificities it not just a complement to bricks-and-mortar beauty store,"" says Anaïs Dupuy. In order to regain market share, the selective channel must rely on its best assets strengths, in particular on fragrances, which are the channel’s flagship products.  The shopping experience is also an important asset where some improvements are possible, especially through even better targeted and customized samples, or even better loyalty programs."
Russia: The rise of local brands,"Despite the crisis in the economy, the beauty industry is doing quite well in Russia, which remains the 4th largest personal care market in Europe.  Clearly, the rise of imported products prices, in the wake of the strong devaluation of the Russian currency in 2014, logically led consumers to shift a part of their purchases to locally produced mass personal care items, but they did not renounce to prestige perfumes and cosmetics, even if they had to cut back on other expenses due. According to market research firm RBC, ""Provided the rubble remains stable and the households’ real income continues to grow, the Russian beauty market will experience a steady growth during the years to come."" The optimism was clearly visible on the show floor. This year’s edition of InterCHARM hosted more than 980 exhibitors, including 242 international companies and was visited by 69,894 visitors, an increase of 11.3% compared to the previous year. “The show returned to growth this year, even if some companies have frozen their investments.  Furthermore, the crisis had a positive impact on Russian manufacturers and brands which took advantage of the situation and gained market shares. They were also able to grow in terms of quality,” explained the organisers. In the wake of the Russian rubble devaluation, imports of personal care products decreased in 2015 while the domestic production increased. ""We work mainly with international brands, but the number purely local customers is increasing. There is a real rise of Russian brands,"" confirms Christian Darsy, Vice President Sales Cosmetic & Household at Fareva, one of the world’s leading subcontractors who operates a plant in Russia and another in Ukraine. According to Synovate Comcon, in the mass retail channel, skin care brand Chistaya Linia dominates the market before Nivea. Natura Siberica’s success story is also emblematic of this phenomenon. The Russian natural cosmetics brand now has its own stores in Moscow, Kazan, Surgut, Tuymen, Ryazan, St. Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don, Novosibirsk and Kyzyl in Russia, as well as in Barcelona (Spain ), Copenhagen (Denmark), Tallinn (Estonia), Tokyo and Yokohama (Japan) and Hong Kong (China) and its products are available in numerous stores in France, Belgium, UK, Germany, China and several other countries. Other Russian brands such as Sachettè or MontCarotte also successfully grew in credibility in the prestige segment. The success of Natura Siberica also illustrates the huge interest of Russian consumers for natural and organic cosmetic products. They are paying an increasing attention to the composition and quality of cosmetic products.  As a result, the 2014-2015 crisis did not impact the sales of natural and organic products which continued to grow during this period. The growth in this segment is explained by the consumers’ increasing attention to their health and by a growing sensitivity to environmental issues.  There is also a greater availability of natural and organic cosmetics in bricks-and-mortar beauty retail chains, whether in traditional networks (Rive Gauche now distributes US beauty brand Avalon Organics) or in recently launched dedicated stores such as the Organic Shop chain. Since 2013, InterCHARM has devoted a specific exhibiting area to independent perfumery brands.  Under the name ""La Niche"", this area reflects the dynamism of high-end niche perfumery in Russia. Of course, in Russia as in other countries in the world beauty chain retailers and major international selective brands represent the vast majority of sales. But niche brands hold prominent positions in department stores or in the most upscale points of sale in Moscow and other big cities. While the economic situation is stabilizing, the strong enthusiasm of Russian consumers for cosmetic products should continue to drive the growth of the market with annual growth forecasts oscillating between 6% and 12% depending on market research agencies. The oral care segment is one of the best performing, although most of the growth will come from key market segments: skin care, hair care, colour cosmetics and fragrances."
"Olfactory coaching, or how to revive advice in store","Of course, the days when we remained loyal to the same perfume our whole lives (or almost) are gone… if there ever were days like these. Still, most of us have a very personal olfactory style that conveys the impression we make on others’ memories. But we need to get to know it or recognize it: it is often embodied by four or five favourite fragrances for which it was like love at first sight, and which are tricky to identify among the extremely large offering in classic or alternative perfumery. “Given the number of references on the market today, it is really difficult for consumers not to get lost in the world of perfumes, especially since they no longer get the advice they did until the 80s/90s, before self-service perfume stores emerged. But they still need it,” comments Juliette Faliu, co-founder of l’Olfactorama and creator of Nez Bavard, a concept of olfactory meetings for people interested in perfume, enthusiasts, and lovers. To make up for this lack of advice, multiple initiatives are being launched. For example, after working for professionals in her early career, Sophie Normand decided to offer private individuals her knowledge in perfumery by organizing olfactory coaching sessions. “Too many people wear ‘mainstream’ perfumes, because they just do not know what else to wear, and I think it is a shame,” she explains. Once her clients have sent her back a first contact questionnaire, she gets a better idea of their olfactory perception during meetings at their homes or near the Opéra, in Paris: that is where most perfume stores have settled, so she can introduce them to different raw materials or notes. “The idea is to find the perfume(s) that will correspond to them, so that they know which words define what they like and feel. We do change with the seasons or the different periods in our lives, but we often stick to the same scents,” she explains. Once this phase is over, our expert suggests a transversal selection of about ten niche perfumes or major classics to rediscover, and she invites her clients to go and test them directly in store. “A perfume may be more or less present on the skin, it may have a very different outcome depending on the wearer, so the test phase is essential to eventually keep only two or three key fragrances,” she adds. Usually thirty-year-old Parisians, Sophie Normand’s clients do not hesitate to spare EUR80 to EUR130 (group formula) for this new approach. “Most of my clients think commercial perfumes no longer correspond to them and everything smells the same in the selective network. They feel like turning to alternative perfumery, but they are a bit lost, because they do not know this world,” adds Sophie Normand. Advice is actually an essential for small niche brands, and it has contributed a lot to the growing interest in alternative perfumery. At Annick Goutal’s, L’Artisan Parfumeur, or other stores like Frédéric Malle’s, the objective has always been to take the time to get to know customers and offer them experience. These values are making a strong comeback, as they are used as a differentiating argument by independent perfume stores, and major brands like Guerlain or Chanel have been introducing profiling in their wholly-owned stores, for their own products. Profiling is practiced in different ways, in particular with digital technologies for a few major traditional brands or points of sale in the selective network, or at Nose’s, a cosmetics and perfume concept store that has developed olfactory diagnosis software. At a larger scale, and within the limits imposed by a format that covers the whole selective offering, there is also Marionnaud’s “Beauty Code”: advisors are equipped with touch screen tablets. If they are commonly used in olfactory coaching, digital technologies can raise the same issues as the lack of advice. “Digital devices will never replace the advice provided by humans. In the field of perfumes, they still cannot make customers feel like visiting a store, so they will probably always remain a complement,” Juliette Faliu asserts, “because the need for help comes from the fact that perfumery is not an easy subject to deal with, from an intellectual standpoint. And it makes it quite difficult to provide useful knowledge to the general public. Therefore, a good advisor must both be a good psychologist and a good translator, so that they can transpose customers’ words into the perfume language. In addition, they must show excellent knowledge in the market’s fragrances to determine which of their own products correspond to those mentioned by customers. No software can offset this adaptive knowledge and relationship,” she adds. However, digital technologies are still interesting in that they create communities, in particular for young people for whom networks prevail… and contribute to providing advice. To manage to survive troubled times, the perfumery market tends to reposition itself on a higher-end, more exclusive world. And even if it is still a little early to predict the future of olfactory coaching, there is no doubt personalized advice is part of the luxury instruments it can integrate."
Global men’s personal care market to reach US$166 billion by 2022,"Constant change in lifestyle and rise in disposable income have increased the demand for men’s personal care products [1], finds Allied Market Research (AMR) in a recent report [2]. Moreover, increase in the number of product offerings to tap the fluctuating grooming habits of men and organized retail further fuel the market growth. In addition, the global upsurge in online retail platforms, and the escalation in health, and fitness consciousness among men is anticipated to offer more business opportunities. However, rise in packaging costs could prove to be a major challenge for the players. ""The increasing bent towards corporate life and rising awareness towards men’s grooming, specifically among the youth is expected to boost the demand of personal care products. Moreover, launch of herbal products with low chemical content has witnessed remarkable growth in the men personal care market"", states Yogiata Sharma, Research Analyst, and Consumer Goods at AMR. According to AMR, the men’s skin care segment accounted for the maximum market share in 2015, due to wide-spread popularity of face creams and moisturizers among the consumers. The segment is anticipated to lead the market throughout the analysis period, with a CAGR of 4.5% from 2016 - 2022. From a growth perspective, men oral care product category would witness the highest CAGR, owing to the increasing penetration of advanced toothpaste, to tackle dental problems, among customers of all age groups. The demand of this category would be also be supplemented by the increasing demand of mouth and breath fresheners. North America is presently the largest market of men personal care products, with a revenue of US$36 billion in 2015. The region is anticipated to continue its growth at a notable pace, owing to health consciousness and awareness towards men’s grooming. Market penetration of oral care products is relatively much higher in the U.S. due to extensive usage of mouth washes and breath fresheners among smokers and drinkers. Personal cleanliness products such as antiperspirants & deodorants are also popular in Canada owing to their regular usage among youth. In parallel, AMR expects Asia-Pacific to account for the highest growth rate in the overall market throughout the forecast period, owing to the upsurge in demand from countries such as China and India. The growth would be driven by the increased adoption of the different product categories, supported by the increasing disposable income. Furthermore, it is anticipated that demand for shaving products would experience maximum growth in the developing countries such as China and India."
Global duty free and travel retail faces bright future,"The sector, currently valued at a significant US$62 billion according to duty free and travel retail specialist Generation Research, had been growing steadily for the past six years, and while in 2015 it suffered a decline, the figures for the first quarter of 2016 show that the business is back on its upward trajectory. Total sales grew by just under 1% compared with the same period last year. Sales in Asia Pacific, a region that has for some time made a very significant contribution to the expansion of the sector, saw strong growth of 5%. The fragrance and cosmetics category is the main driver of growth globally and its sales were up 7.8% in the first quarter, while sales of wines and spirits were up by 4%. Sales on board ferries grew by 6.5%, while airport sales remained stable. TFWA president Erik Juul-Mortensen said that these figures allowed the sector to be cautiously optimistic. Within the wider travel and tourism industries, all pointers would suggest that this bullish prediction is justified. Air traffic forecasts project that the number of people taking to the skies will continue to boom. The trade association Airports Council International says that passenger numbers worldwide will more than double from 2015, when the number of air travellers reached 7.2 billion, to just over 19 billion in 2035 - a compound annual growth of 5%. The World Tourism Organisation’s report for 2015 showed that international tourist arrivals were up 4% to reach a record of 1.2 billion, 50 million more than in 2014. “This can only be good news for our industry, and all the indicators would suggest that we have plenty to be upbeat about,” said Juul-Mortensen. “This is a great sector to be in, and with growth rates that have been, in many years, the envy of many high street retailers, duty free and travel retail presents a wealth of opportunities.”"
Make-up: The new supply-side challenges,"Premium Beauty News - What the heck is going on in the makeup industry? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - It is clear that many players probably underestimated, three or four years ago, the growing influence of the Internet on an entire generation for online purchases. And we also underestimated, of course, the power of people expressing themselves on the internet to praise the benefits of a particular product and whose legitimacy seemed insignificant at first sight. But, not only has this legitimacy continued to gain momentum but sales of products ""hence scrutinized and put forward"" have also dramatically increased. Gone are the times when classical purchases in department stores resulted from a voluntary approach, now have come times for spontaneous purchases, impulse purchases, selfies purchases, triggered by the talent, persuasion of a particular blogger or influencer. Premium Beauty News - Given this radical change in buying behaviours, the only sensible thing to do was to take action! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Yes of course, but it’s not that easy when you have to manage research teams, marketing teams, for some of them plants and for all of them rather traditional distribution channels. Because meanwhile, ""internet players"" don’t have to bother with all this. They move fast, offer special bargains, change their product lines or launch new ones in no time. There is no respite, you have hardly launched a counter offensive that you have to deal simultaneously with multiple and new attacks coming from all fronts. You therefore need to be very responsive, very flexible... and very competitive! Premium Beauty News - A ""revolution"" which obviously is impacting the entire industrial sector. Jean-Yves Bourgeois - It is the increasing acceleration of the subcontracting sector whose ""full service"" offer can only but attract new comers, and as an indirect consequence established industry players who have no other alternatives than to have recourse to it more and more. ""Time to Market"" and ""Innovation"" have become essential tools to stay in the game. Premium Beauty News - Does it mean the whole sector is going to switch to total subcontracting? Jean-Yves Bourgeois -  Not easy to predict but some say it. Nothing is sure, but some leading brands strongly think so. And for others, it is clearly the only way to quickly gain market share. Hence, there is a real re-balancing between manufacturers who are part of this subcontracting sector. Formulators / fillers are obviously the most sought-after. So much so that they are asked more and more to provide a full service, including packaging, accessories and even in some cases the POS equipment to set up in the outlets. Formulators / fillers have become, over the years, real trend setters. We are far from the times when a basic subcontractor only performed what he was asked to do. This sector has fantastically structured and equipped itself industrially speaking. It is now fast, innovative and full of creativity. And among packaging manufacturers, a lot of them are understanding that it’s time to jump on the bandwagon before it starts gaining too much speed, by also remaining close to brand owners but also, increasingly, to formulators/fillers, by offering solutions and not just an industrial product, by also anticipating market demand, by being reactive and pro-active. In a nutshell, by staying at the forefront. Another true revolution to address! Probably the biggest of all, because existing industrial tools have not really been formatted for this type of challenge. Premium Beauty News - But as the saying goes ""tall oaks from little acorn grows"" and the same is true for small companies who will need an industrial strike force worthy of the name? Jean-Yves Bourgeois -  That’s true and that’s what’s reassuring for these manufacturers but nonetheless we are observing an historic shift. And it was very interesting to see the latest press releases of a number of packaging manufacturers such as the Albéa, Texen or Pochet Groups who were precisely oriented in that direction and have understood what it takes to stay ""in the game"". Premium Beauty News - You are offering a helping hand, which can only be grasped! In this context of hyper specialization of an industrial sector... ""niche"" trade shows are more than welcomed? Jean-Yves Bourgeois -  ""Niche"" trade shows cannot be created everywhere! A true notion of ""industry"" must exist. It exists in premium packaging and the Luxe Pack trade show is a proof. It also exists for cosmetic ingredients and the in-cosmetics trade shows are a proof. And finally it also exists in the make-up industry and the ‘MakeUp In’ events obviously evidence it."
Travel retail needs to innovate and to tap into new technologies,"Last year Tax Free World Association (TFWA) president Erik Juul-Mortensen closed the TFWA World Exhibition & Conference with a comment on how buoyant the mood had been. And at this year’s closing press conference, he said that despite the challenges the industry had faced, the atmosphere was still upbeat. Eventually, the event recorded a slight decrease in visitor numbers: 6,443 persons visited the show, down 2% from 6,558 last year.  “A healthy figure under the circumstances,” said TFWA. However, according to TFWA, the number of visitors from the key categories of duty free operators, travel retail operators, landlords and agents was up from 4,625 in 2016 compared with 4,584 in 2015, with 1,811 companies represented compared with 1,788 last year. “There are reasons for cautious optimism for the travel retail industry,” said TFWA president Erik Juul-Mortensen who likened himself to former British prime minister Harold Wilson, who stated that he as an optimist, but always carried an umbrella. One key reason for optimism are growth forecasts regarding air traffic. By 2025, there will be more than nine billion air passengers, a 70% increase compared with 2015. During the TFWA World Exhibition & Conference, several speakers called for a new approach of the business that would take into account the change in consumption habits. According to Garry Stasiulevicuis, managing director of Counter Intelligence Retail, attitudes to luxury are changing. ‘Luxury’ is no longer about possession, but all about experience. The travelling population has changed, and there is a much younger travelling consumer coming through airports who wants different things and different experiences. CEO of Dufry, Julián Díaz González highlighted how a more experience driven, personalised offer was required to attract the all-important Millennial traveller. Presenting highlights of TFWA’s recent study on the impact and influence of mobile technology and e-commerce on duty free & travel retail, Peter Mohn, founder and CEO of m1nd-set, highlighted that nine out of ten people use the internet at an airport. But what is interesting is that 31% of people said they were looking for information on brands and products to compare prices or to find out more by reading customer reviews. While in Europe 40% of passengers do this, in China well over half (56%) consult the internet when shopping at the airport. Similarly, a running theme at the inflight workshop at this year’s TFWA World Exhibition & Conference was the necessity to innovate. Suffering a double digit decline, the value of the sector fell to US$2.64 billion in 2017, which is less than in 2007, nearly a decade ago. Airlines can’t offer the same ranges as airport and they need to innovate constantly.  Internet as a huge potential in this sector and can be a way to make flying and buying a real shopping experience."
Hong Kong: The eyebrow craze spreads amid increased social competition,"According to an ancient Chinese tradition, one’s future can be read on its face.  Stalls practising the face-reading discipline, which dates back more than 2,000 years, are still found in market streets and near temples in modern-day Hong Kong.  A strong brow would translate to the person’s ability to plan ahead, high cheekbones could point to power. Today, this tradition may be combined with aesthetic concerns, in order to improve people’s chances in life.  For instance, some Chinese face readers propose customers to pluck their eyebrows to help achieve their life goals. ""It’s an instant change and you can change it for everyone,"" Mrs Li Chau-jing told AFP, describing her clientele as ranging from just a few years old to in their 70s. ""I can help a person in the shortest amount of time, by bringing them energy and happiness and the goal they want to reach,"" Li said. Mrs Li has been running her shop in the working class neighbourhood of Sham Shui Po for six years and its walls are covered with photos of her clients’ eyes and brows. Women tend to come to her to solve emotional or relationship problems, men for better luck at work, she says. According to this former make-up artist, women tend to look for a way to solve their marital and sentimental problems while men want to boost their professional opportunities.  For Mrs Li, straight brows will bring more luck and happiness than curved.  ""If the brows are very straight, then those people will not have to suffer through many hardships,"" she says. Customer Edward Lam, a 35-year-year old technician for a television station, said he felt more energetic after having his brows modified. ""The biggest goal I have for fixing my eyebrows is to find jobs and to have better networking, and that my career will improve,"" Lam told AFP. ""I believe that the impression I gave was better,"" he said of job interviews since having his brows worked on by Li. While some may prefer eyebrow-plucking Li’s proactive approach, others are happy to stick to tradition.  Nevertheless, the eyebrows trend has skyrocketed in China, and more generally in Asia, in the wake of the South Korean influence, a country where social success, for men and women, would be increasingly linked with a perfect appearance. Salons offering eyebrow grooming have been mushrooming in China over recent years. Image-conscious urbanites can, for example visit Browhaus, a brow and lash grooming chain originally founded in Singapore in 2004 that has expanded to 40 outlets in 10 cities, mainly in Asia, but also in London and New York."
"Trends: UK and France, two converging beauty markets?","The UK and France are the two biggest European cosmetics markets after Germany (12.537 billion euros in 2015 for the UK and 11.357 for France, according to figures from Cosmetics Europe). However, consumption behaviours strongly diverge in the two countries, in particular for the prestige cosmetics segment. While French women have bought 1.6 prestige beauty product per person on average last year, the annual average is 2.6 for British women. The difference is especially noticeable for the make-up category since the British are buying twice as much as the French (1.2 per unit against 0.5 in France). Similarly, and contrary to stereotypical beliefs, French women buy less fragrance than British ones (0.7 units per person per year in France vs. 0.8 in the United Kingdom). ""Beyond overall figures, it is interesting to look deeper into the different categories to understand the preferences and the buying habits of each market. While the French spend less overall, they invest more easily in certain types of products such as anti-aging creams,"" says Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. According to NPD figures anti-aging creams account for 44% of total skincare sales in value in France, vs 32% in the United Kingdom. For their daily face care routine, British women seem to prefer make-up removers and cleaners, which represent 10% of the entire skincare category sales, the double than in France. While makeup accounts for 29% of total sales of the prestige beauty industry in the UK, this category is less important in France, where it accounts for only 15% of the prestige market. Makeup is the smallest category in France while it ranks in second position behind perfume in the United Kingdom. GRAPH While eyebrow makeup is a strong trend both in France and in the UK, when make-up is concern, French women remain loyal to traditional categories. Mascara accounts for 14% of sales in France vs. 9% in the United Kingdom and lipstick sales are twice as important in France as in the UK (18% of total makeup sales vs 9% in the United Kingdom). However, foundations are much more popular in the UK, where they account for the half of total makeup sales vs. 42% in France. Despite cultural differences in purchasing habits, the NPD report shows that the two markets are converging with regard to the latest industry trends. The craze for eyebrows and masks, the rise of hair care, the development of anti-aging skin care products targeting eyes and lips, for instance, are transcending cultural boundaries. ""Historical differences regarding consumption habits in France and Great Britain persist for traditional categories. However, should we look at the most recent trends, it is clear that the explosion of borderless digital trends and the influence of global brands and celebrities are transforming prestige beauty into an open and responsive market able to bear universal trends that transcend borders,” concludes Mathilde Lion."
"“The beauty market is becoming greener”, Elfriede Dambacher","Premium Beauty News - How is the natural and organic beauty market evolving in Germany? Elfriede Dambacher - Generally speaking the entire beauty market is becoming greener. There are many gradations of green cosmetics. In Germany we have divided the beauty market into three segments: conventional cosmetics, nature-inspired cosmetics, and natural & organic cosmetics. Based on these segments we are able to depict the main market trends. Germany is the largest cosmetics market in Europe and also the largest market for natural & organic cosmetics in Europe. The market is showing a high level of growth. The year 2015 showed a turnover growth of 10 %. Natural & organic cosmetics have a market share of more than 8 %, whilst most European countries have a market share of 4- 5 %. The development of natural & organic cosmetics benefited from the German heritage of many organic brands. In German speaking countries this trend began earlier than in other European countries. And retail provided a good availability early on. Customer reach was expanded primarily by German drugstores. Along with nature-inspired cosmetics, green cosmetics account for more than 15% of the German beauty market today. Premium Beauty News - Younger consumers seem particularly receptive to the message conveyed by these products. What are the main consequences? Elfriede Dambacher - Younger consumers make high demands on organic brands. Next to efficiency and performance, design and authenticity are key factors of success with the youngest consumer segment. Young consumers are looking for their own brands and they shop differently. Stationary retail in Germany is not meeting those challenges appropriately. For consumers it is often easier to find attractive novelties online, which benefits international niche brands. They are making the market more attractive. Premium Beauty News - Digitalization is transforming the mainstream beauty market. What about natural and organic brands? Elfriede Dambacher - The market for natural & organic cosmetics is no exception. On the contrary, online retail improves the availability even for the smallest villages. And the young people interested in natural & organic cosmetics are web savvy and well informed. Online they can find reliable recommendations in no time. Of course this affects the entire market. Premium Beauty News - So far, no leading natural brand has emerged globally. How do you explain this lack of internationalisation? Elfriede Dambacher - The natural & organic cosmetics industry is shaped by small and medium-sized businesses. Initially, the main focus was on the use of natural resources for the R&D of the products. Processes and communication were neglected. But as the demand for green cosmetics is increasing, organic brands need a distinct profile and sufficient capital to succeed globally in the core markets for natural & organic cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - What will be the main topics to be discussed at the next edition of the Natural Cosmetics Conference? Elfriede Dambacher - We will discuss current topics that are relevant for the market. Two relevant aspects playing a role in the development of the market: There is a lack of strong brands and stationary retail is not picking up on the potential the market is offering. Also brands with a distinct positioning are gaining ground in the nature-inspired market and in the segment of non-certified natural and organic cosmetics. How these challenges can be met will be the focus of a multi-faceted program and leading international experts, trend researchers, lateral thinkers, scientists and retail companies. The International Natural & Organic Cosmetics Conference is considered the top event in fall and a must for all interested in the changes evolving in the beauty market. The 2016 edition of the Conference will take place in Berlin September 27-28. And next year the Conference will be held on September 26-27, 2017. Natural & Organic Cosmetics Conference

Luxe Pack Monaco 2016: A 3 in 1 show,"The Luxe Pack trade show, which will open tomorrow in Monaco during three days will gather more than 450 exhibitors originating from 35 countries (48% from France, 46% from other European countries and 6% from the rest of the world).

"Australia and New Zealand: A definitely growing ""beauty"" sector!","A few figures first! According to the survey of the Franco-Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, after a few years of decline, the Australian beauty sector was again on an upward trend in 2015 thanks to both perkier consumer morale and a rise in their disposable income. The sector’s turnover is estimated at EUR 637.8 million (AUD 945 million). The market is expected to grow annually by 1.2% from 2016 to 2021, driven by the popularity of innovative, multifunctional and natural & organic products. The share of imports is very important since it represents 75% of the market demand. France is Australia’s first supplier in perfumes and the second in cosmetics. According to recent studies, competition is expected to increase even more due to the growing interest of consumers for mass market products. Among the most significant market trends, anti-ageing cosmetic products are very popular among the Baby Boomer generation. Demand is also on the rise for so called ""holistic"" products and organic and natural products. Multifunctional products or ""DIY"" beauty solutions are also increasingly popular. All surveys highlight the fact that organic products are truly one of the strong points of ""Made in Australia"" cosmetics and obviously a key argument used by local brands to conquer export markets. The dynamism of the market is confirmed by Australian brands themselves. A proof of that is the performance of companies like Nutrimetics, SelfCare Corporation, Napoleon Perdis, Ere Perez, Inika, Natio or Sugar Baby. ""The dynamism of the Beauty sector is truly perceptible on Australian and New Zealand markets,"" confirmed Olivia Courtman, Product & Accessories Sourcing Specialist at Nutrimetics, a company that produces and distributes via its home sales network (40 000 beauty advisors) skincare products (80%) and make-up products, and that continues - no surprisingly - to enjoy a steady rise in its sales of colour cosmetics. The story is the same with the brand Ere Perez: ""We are on a + 20% yearly trend,"" highlighted Hiram Martinez, CEO. As for Sonia Amoroso from SelfCare Corporation (40 million dollars in revenue), specializing almost exclusively in the production of skincare products, ""with such high market demand, I was actually unable to allow myself a holiday break these past months!"" As for Napoleon Perdis, who last year refocused on the Australian market, now supplying over 875 stockists, David Jones and Myer, its own 85 stores are working at full capacity. ""There has been a constant influx of new brands in to an already highly competitive market,” explained Petra Bergman, PR & Marketing Manager- Mann & Noble, “giving the consumer infinite choice which in turn means beauty brands are constantly challenged to find new ways to stand out from the pack and connect with consumers"". ""We are about to launch 70 new products with our Inika brand we acquired two years ago,"" explained Lino Sinni, Marketing Director, Total Beauty Network. On the side of New Zealand the beauty market is now worth EUR 76 million (NZD 1.25 billion). From 2015 to 2018 a 1.2% growth in volume is expected thanks to the popularity of multifunctional, organic and natural, ""DIY"" products and sets (gift boxes). Imports account for 90% of the market. France is the leading perfume supplier and the country’s third cosmetics supplier. Despite the country’s geographical isolation and relatively small number of inhabitants, most major beauty brands are represented and their product range is varied. The economic fundamentals of New Zealand are strong, GDP per capita is catching up with that of other major Western European economies (with more than USD 31,000 in 2013) and unemployment fell to its lowest level since 2009 (5.8% of the working population in 2015). Note that New Zealand launched in 2005 a long term reform (through 2020) on its digital economy. And that in 2010 the country joined the top 10 of the most open economies to digital innovation. Indeed, due to its geographical remoteness, the Internet appears to be the best source for development. The government is investing heavily to develop its infrastructures: between 2008 and 2015 nearly NZD 4 billion (2% of New Zealand’s GDP) were allocated by the State to develop infrastructures solely dedicated to digital economy. A common point to all these Australian and New Zealand brands, most of them rely on Asian sub-contractors (China) for their formulas and packagings. On the other hand they are thirsty for innovation and are constantly ""on the look-out"". Australian consumers enjoy spending. They have a high purchasing power, which has increased by more than 43% in 15 years, 15% higher than that of French consumers. Household debt is also high but domestic consumption is driving the country’s growth. Consumers are demanding, increasingly sophisticated and aware of European trends. In Australia the purchase decision is determined primarily by the price tag. In addition, the growing interest of Australians for quality, and the growing impact of fashion phenomena fuelled by the media and advertising make ""genuine"" products and branded and high-range products particularly popular. Australian consumers - so-called early adopters, fond of new technologies - love novelties and alternative products. Like other people in the world, Australian and New Zealand consumers are increasingly connected and retailers of consumer goods must face strong competition from online players. In general, the premium sector is demonstrating unprecedented economic dynamism. Global market sales in 2012 were already worth some EUR 210 billion, a quarter of which was generated by French luxury industries. This leading position is being confirmed by exceptional sales increase across all luxury sectors. Indeed, the rising number of foreign tourists from Asia as well as their taste for luxury goods is a strong growth driver for this industry. But not just tourists! It is striking, to notice, for example in Sydney, the number of Asian people who have settled in the country in recent years. The luxury industry is expected to grow by 11.1% over the coming years."
Beauty retail: Bricks-and-mortar stores and online channels complement each-others,"The study, conducted on a representative sample of 1,000 individuals aged 18 and more, found that 57% of cosmetics buyers use the Internet to get more information about products. However, for 71% of them, brick-and-mortar stores remains the main purchasing destination. ""With the Internet, many of the customers who enter the store have a detailed knowledge of the products and they are therefore looking for something else, such as reinsurance, product staging, advices on complementary products. Customizing the experience through the relations with shop assistants thus becomes essential in beauty stores,"" commented William G Koeberlé, President of the FFPS and FEPD (European Federation of Perfume Retailers). Many consumers (43%) use internet to compare and get upstream information on the products and their prices. However, customers massively go to physical stores, to see the products (58%) or test them (41%). In addition to advices, the symbolic status of beauty products thus pushes buyers to brick-and-mortar points of sale (to see, touch, smell ...). However, the study also unveils interesting differences in consumer behaviour especially between generations. Indeed, while the Internet is the main point of contact for information on beauty products, it is also the preferred tool of women (72%) and for those under 35 (78%). On the contrary, men and those over 35 still use brick-and-mortar stores as the primary contact point with cosmetic products. With no surprise, internet purchases are mostly driven by price (50%), promotions (44%) and the possibility to purchase at any time (39%). ""Customers always have the final say. As far as beauty products are concerned, brick-and-mortar stores and online channels are complementary and developing an omnichannel business is a key factor of success,"" concluded William G Koeberlé, President of the FFPS and FEPD (European Federation of Retail Perfumers)."
MakeUp in New York: Attendance still going up,"“Sophisticated and changing textures are the key trends in formulas as well as nomadic and environmentally friendly packaging,” said the organisers of the show. For this edition, close to 30 companies participated in the innovation competition and submitted 60 products including 43 formulas and 17 new packaging and applicators. Eventually, the jury selected 24 products, which were presented on the Innovation Tree at the centre of the trade show. One of the key formulation trends is the importance of pearlescent, metalling and glittering effects for the eyes.  “It is the big new trend today,” explains Florence Bernardin, founder and manager of Information & Inspiration.  “In the wake of what happened a few years ago for the nails, the trend for pearlescent and glittering effects is quickly growing for the eyes.” Aircos, for instant, presented Countless Effect Eyeshadow, an enriched formula with pearlescent coated binder with a silky and airy texture thanks to the back injection technology. The Cosmetic Group USA showcased baked powders created in a jar, with pink and light metallic highlights. Another highlight of the innovation competition was the Matte Me Metal liquid lipstick by iTiT Cosmetics, with its matte metallic finish. MakeUp in new York was also the occasion to discover never seen textures: – Perfume Touch Up, a transparent solid fragrance with a texture that glides smoothly and effortlessly on skin, into a portable pencil packaging for easy touch-ups,
– N24 Flower Lip Balm by Sunzhou Ante Cosmetics, a transparent the lip balm with a flower incrustation and real 24K gold chips to inside. The growth of the show allows the organizers of MakeUp in New York to look the future ""with serenity"". But it also forces the event to move to a bigger venue. “At a time when many professional events in the beauty sector are going to overlap next year in New York and outdo one another, often in the same exhibition area, MakeUp in New York, like its siblings in Paris, Seoul, Sao Paulo and Los Angeles, will continue to be the exception in the Beauty sphere. Exhibitors and visitors know it, this and this is what makes and will continue to make MakeUp in New York a special event in a place of its own,” announced the organizers."
The Russian personal care market bounces back,"“Many key international and local players confirm this trend and add that consumers haven’t cut their budget but just became more rational in purchases,” explain the organisers of InterCHARM, the largest perfumery and cosmetics exhibition in Russia, CIS, Central and Eastern Europe.  Avon sales in Russia, for instance, increased by 25% in monetary terms and 13% in volume in Q1 2016. Henkel also recently increased its sales in Russia, after a decrease in 2015.  Lush also said the demand is recovering: its revenue increased by 12% in Q1 2016, sales have slightly increased in volume terms too. Consumer goods market increased by 11.3% to RUB 7.79 trillion (USD 119.8 billion) during 12 month-period from April 2015 to April 2016, GfK reported.  Personal care products account for approximately 6.6% of this market, or about RUB 514 billion (USD 7.9 billion). Price increases are not the only propeller of the rise of cosmetics sales. Consumers have become 6.1% more likely to buy personal care products. At the same time, the average spend per one purchase has not changed, says representatives of the market research firm. In 2015, sales of cosmetics and personal care products grew faster than other consumer goods (+18.9%). In 2014, these sales increased by 4.3% - slower than food and household products. This record-breaking sales were driven by perfumes and make-up products (+38% and +29% respectively). Body care also recorded impressive growth in 2015. According to Euromonitor, the segment grew by +19.3% compared to the previous year. As far as the hair care category is concerned, one of the key growth trends is the popularity of hair loss treatments and salon products that rose by 2.6% and 7.4% respectively. During the crisis, companies did not reduce the production of shampoos, a relatively stable consumable commodity. In 2015 the volume of local manufacturing reached 386 million units, which is 2.4% more than in 2014. Even the smallest segments of the market performed well: bath care increased by 4% (Euromonitor) and soaps grew by 11% (Russian Government Statistics). In parallel, the rise of foreign investments in Russia also illustrates the recovery of the economy. According to Ernst & Young, Russia ranked first in the world in 2015 regarding foreign direct investment projects, with the highest number since 2010. Germany is the leading foreign investor in Russia.  According to the Central Bank of Russia, Germany’s direct investments have increased four-fold in 2015, from USD 350 million to USD 1.42 billion.  Other top foreign investors are: USA, France, Italy and China. During the first half of this year 25 international brands opened stores in Russia, almost twice more than the same period in 2015, global estate company Knight Frank reported. Moreover, no brands have left the market, and at least, 10 more operators are expected till the end of 2016. Among the newcomers are Holika Holika from South Korea, Urban Decay from the USA and Kiko Milano. The new drivers of the Russian cosmetics market growth will be discussed during the Retail Connect Summit organised during the InterCHARM trade show, which will take place in Moscow on 26-29 October 2016.  On the radar of discussions are trends in perfumery, natural and organic products, Russian legislation, retail and e-commerce."
"Data: Women love lipsticks, mainly on Sundays","Perfect Corp., the editor of YouCam Makeup, the world’s leading virtual makeup application, has recently published a series of data on the behaviour of its users regarding lipsticks. Indeed, the lipstick trial feature has been ranked as the #1 most used feature in the YouCam Makeup app for the past 6 months in the USA, in Europe and in Asia.  Over 11 million women test virtual lipstick try-on’s every week. And there are about 1.6 million lipstick trials daily. First lesson: The users of YouCam Makeup - mainly Millennials - go mad for matte! Actually, data from YouCam Makeup shows beauty fans like matte lipstick twice as much as glossy.  The figures speak for themselves: almost twice (1.7) more females choose the matte option over the gloss option of the app. Data from YouCam Makeup also reveal how beauty lovers are mapping out their weekly lip colours.  Sunday is the peak time of applying virtual lipstick.  “Female users are mostly using YouCam Makeup and trying on different shades on Sunday night (7-9pm EDT) to prepare their looks for the week ahead,” explains Perfect Corp.  “Furthermore, starting from 3pm on Wednesday, the lipstick trial feature rises leaving us to believe that women are rewarding themselves or starting to plan their weekend lipstick hues.” Data collected by the application are also a good source of information about the hottest lipstick colours of the moment.  Bright pinks and red shades, for instance, were the most popular colours in July. The app also allows mapping preferences.  For instance, as far as the US are concerned, YouCam Makeup reveals that: – Females living on the West Coast apply nude shades twice more than females living on the East Coast.
– Red shades still dominate across all of the US cities.
– Females living in Miami prefer bright shades over pastels."
"US trends: ""Beauty Augmented"" and Beauty hackers","On the occasion of the release of this study, Premium Beauty News met the founder of the agency, Leila Rochet-Podvin who will soon be flying to New York again where she will lead, as part of the MakeUp in New York trade show, both a conference on the evolution of make-up trends and Indie brands in the US and a round table dedicated to the influence of these indie brands [2]. Premium Beauty News - You called your report, ""Beauty Augmented"", why did you choose this title? Leila Rochet-Podvin - Beauty Augmented refers to a beauty universe that is more and more ""augmented"", fuelled by increasingly digital consumption, a reflection of ourselves via selfies and a strong desire to use cosmetics differently. In this context, beauty becomes more assertive and the make-up market, particularly, is driven by points of reference that evolve towards greater hedonism, driven by new imaginaries, new creative brands, representations of new femininities, the whole of it fostering beauty conversations on social networks. As a consequence, the market has crossed the boundaries of imagination in a US make-up market that is rooted in the Entertainment industry. People speak more and more of ""Retail Augmented"" (""more experiential""), of Consumption Augmented (""savvier with Smartphones""), and now of Beauty Augmented. We were able to identify six beauty trends illustrated with boards and iconic products that we bought during our four trips to the East Coast and the West Coast since January 2016. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about some of the six forward-looking universes in the report? Leila Rochet-Podvin - In our report we started from the six traditional make-up universes to express the new ""augmented"" facets that will drive tomorrow’s beauty market. Nude is one of the universes of reference, a major trend that emerged during the 2008 crisis, which consisted in doing without make-up and relying on invisible and ""unpretentiousness"". This universe has greatly evolved and ""augmented"" with the ""Shades of Nudes"" trend - a nude trend where colour has emerged. On the one hand with - sepia or chocolate - bold tones that accentuate features (rather than concealing them). A tone found in fashion but also in complexion shades (with the explosion of bronzers) or of lips (returning to the chromatic trend of the 90s). The other facet of ""Shades of Nudes"" is nude celebrating diversity - collections of nude shades were enriched to cope with the diversity of skin tones, to the recognition of multi-ethnicities and shades within the various local communities. It must be recalled that now in the US, there are more non-Caucasian births, and consumers regard brands’ recognition of diversity as a sign of modernity, all the more for Millennials. Hence the lingerie brand Naja, launched a new ""nude for all"" line, with seven shades of nude to address all skin tones. Meanwhile beauty brands are now complementing their palette of shades (Sephora USA offers 37 shades for its new 10Hr Wear Perfection Foundation). Beyond foundation products, the recognition of diversity, addressed in the sub chapter ""nude diversity"" goes beyond the foundation universe and unfolds in the universe of skin correctors, concealers and even blushes. Premium Beauty News - In the US, the market seems to be driven by ""Indie"" brands, can you tell us more about this phenomenon?  Leila Rochet-Podvin - Indeed, we no longer speak of niche brands, the new buzzword is ""indie brands"", i.e., new ""independent"" brands. These hyper-creative brands, usually with a good mastery of social network codes and taking advantage of the e-commerce channel or of concept stores, are those that challenge the codes. Millennials particularly, eager for alternatives, dote on them. Note that according to the NPD Group, results of make-up in the prestige sector were strongly boosted by internet sales, with a 30% [3] growth for make-up products in the first quarter of 2016. We called them the ""Beauty hackers"", because they divert the traditional codes of beauty in terms of packaging, distribution or textures. They are driven by an unbridled and very communicative creativity. Ridding this trend, there are brands like Milk MakeUp, which stemmed from a US creative collective launched in February 2016 or the brand created by the influencer Kylie Jenner, Kylie Cosmetics. In this report, we identified for our clients the brands to follow and our observations. The report, US Trends - Beauty Augmented on make-up is available since August 2016.

Marc Jacobs kick starts men’s beauty trend for ’male polish’,"Jacobs, who has long been a pioneer of eye-catching style statements, has been single-handedly reclaiming the ’man’ in ’manicure’ via regular social media posts documenting his penchant for colourful nails. He favours dark, moody shades such as purples, blacks and burgundies, adding a touch of grunge-glam to his everyday look. Social media users everywhere have since been embracing the #malepolish trend with renewed enthusiasm, with Instagram displaying over 1,200 images tagged with the caption. Although stars such as Marilyn Manson, Jared Leto and Jacobs himself are known for championing the gothic look with sombre shades, the Internet shows a glitzier side to the trend. From creamy pastels to glittering metallics, guys, it seems, are getting bold with their manicure choices. Many have adopted an artistic approach, with NYC graphic designer Samsonntag documenting a spray-painted aesthetic, while others, such as dancer and nail artist-in-training Ben Thomas, have channelled a love of all things scientific into intricate, prism-like designs. Whatever the colour, the rising popularity of the #malepolish movement is symbolic of a wider trend - that of the increasing interest in male beauty in general. In January, new figures predicted that the growth in the male grooming sector would drive a steady increase in the global haircare market over the next three years, with growing numbers of fashion-conscious consumers cited as the main reason for the boost. Male grooming has undergone a revival across the beauty industry over the last few years, boosted by the launch of high-profile products such as Clinique’s Sonic System Deep Cleansing Brush, brewery Carlsberg’s shampoo, conditioner and body lotion trio, and must-have products such as beard oils and scented moisturizers. #Malepolish is proof of just how much the face of mainstream men’s beauty is changing."
Multifunctional and masstige cosmetics: Two major trends of the Brazilian market,"Despite current economic difficulties, Brazil accounts for 32% of the revenues of this premium segment in Latin America, followed by Mexico (23%), Argentina (15%), Chile ( 8%) and Colombia (6%). In Brazil, the premium market is driven by the fragrances, which accounted for 36% of the value of this sector in 2015. According to the market research firm, sales of premium personal care products in Latin America are expected to grow at an average rate of 5% per year by 2020, a slowdown compared to previous years when the segment registered an average of 8% real growth per annum from 2010 to 2015. Against this backdrop in which purchasing power falls, the public begins to look for quality products, but with lower prices, those products known as masstige. “The consumer of beauty products in Latin America is facing a difficult challenge.  With more education, infrastructure, with the internet providing greater autonomy and access through different channels, they are looking for quality products,” says Fernando Cruz, senior analyst at Euromonitor International in Santiago. However, according to the expert, with limited purchasing power and slowdown in their economies, this consumer must search for alternatives to get the better quality products at lower prices. [1] Another important trend in the personal care industry is the use of special ingredients, says another market intelligence company that brings its knowledge to the exhibition, Factor-Kline. Elaine Gerchon, the company’s project manager, says these product formulations, designed to improve performance, have grown from 40% to 45% in the global market over the past few years. “This increasing popularity of multipurpose cosmetics has led to the increased consumption of special ingredients, which have multiple functions associated with a single ingredient. As an example, I cite the consumption derived from polypropylene glycol (PEG), which acts as a rheology modifier and has emulsifying properties,” explains Gershon. [2] The Factor-Kline study analyzed the main regional markets – Brazil, China, Europe, India, Japan, Southeast Asia and the United States – into eight categories: surfactants, emollients, rheology modifiers, conditioning polymers, UV absorbers, fixative polymers, preservatives and emulsifiers.  For the company, global expectations are for the personal care products ingredients market to grow at an annual rate of 2.8% between 2015 and 2020, exceeding US$10 billion by 2020. The UV absorbers category should lead the growth trend, followed by the category of preservatives and rheology modifiers. In 2015, in-cosmetics Latin America brought together 184 exhibitors from over 40 countries and 2,760 unique visitors. Now, with the repositioning of the brand and a wider range of exhibitors and visitors from all over this part of the world, the expectations of the organizers are even higher. “We’ll be playing host to about 3,500 professionals who will get to know over a thousand products of 200 exhibiting brands,” said Daniel Zanetti, event director. The complete schedule of free Marketing Trends presentations is listed at www.in-cosmeticslatinamerica.com/en/education/education/"
Chinese app giant Meitu launches global fashion and beauty campaign,"Meitu, the third-largest developer in China and a top 10 global app developer on the Apple AppStore, is aiming to promote talent as well as brands within the fashion and beauty world with their campaign, via China’s top social video-sharing platform, Meipai. #FacesOfFashion was first rolled out during London Collections Men earlier this summer, streaming events and footage to more than 100 million Meipai users in China. Models Eva Herzigova and David Gandy, One Direction’s Niall Horan and actor Stanley Tucci all featured in the campaign’s exclusive footage, which included backstage access and interviews throughout the event. Following the success of the move, Meitu is now planning to turn the campaign into an ongoing initiative, bringing it to fashion and beauty events throughout the US, Europe, Latin America and Asia. As well as bringing content to hundreds of millions of mobile consumers in China, the move will also increase awareness for Meitu’s selfie and virtual makeup apps, which include BeautyPlus, MakeupPlus and SelfieCity. This is not the first high-powered publicity drive by Meitu; an earlier in-app promotion campaign with key South Korean beauty influencer and makeup artist Pony on its app MakeupPlus, alongside branded makeup looks, tutorials and livestreams on Meipai, led to over 730 million selfies being created using Pony’s MakeupPlus looks. The success of the campaign inspired Meitu to help bridge the divide between east and west and satisfy a Chinese audience hungry for content from other markets. Meitu’s apps, including MeituPic, Meipai, SelfieCity, BeautyCam, BeautyPlus, BeautyPlusMe, Airbrush and MakeupPlus, are installed on over one billion unique devices worldwide."
Flag-themed nail art: the surprise Olympic beauty trend,"Leading the way was Serena Williams, who has long championed bold style choices on court. The US tennis legend sported a miniature American flag on her forefinger during her women’s third-round singles tennis match against Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina last week, emphasizing the point with a US-themed scrunchie and a red headband. Switzerland’s Isabelle Forrer matched her nails to her red costume during the women’s beach volleyball qualifying match between Switzerland and Australia, adding a striking white cross to her ring fingers in a replica of the Swiss flag, as a reminder of her fighting spirit. Manika Batra made sure that all those close-up shots of her serving in her women’s singles qualification round table tennis match featured the Indian flag, thanks to her colourful and eye-catching nail design, while Canadian Jamie Lynn Broder opted for an artistic, abstract style for the women’s beach volleyball qualifying match between Germany and Canada, featuring a cute maple leaf print in pillar-box red on a white background. Gold medallist Katie Ledecky displayed her pride at swimming the 800m freestyle for team USA with a manicure that alternated red, blue, and white stripes. And finally, Marleen van Iersel managed to honour both her home country of the Netherlands and nod to the spirit of the games during the women’s beach volleyball qualifying match between the Netherlands and Costa Rica, with nail art alternating the Dutch flag and the iconic five rings logo of the tournament. Team spirit? Nailed it."
Deodorant is key in the beauty routine of young Germans,"“At the beginning of puberty, young people experience their own body odour to be rather embarrassing or even disgusting - and the same goes for that of others. An unpleasant smell is to be avoided by all means. In extreme cases, adolescents and young adults are even mobbed because they smell of sweat - and they mob others because of their body odour,” says IKW. In such a context, the study Youth undisguised [1] finds that most young people do not leave the house without deodorant. It is also a permanent companion in sports and school bags which helps to control some of the unpleasant sensations of the transition to adulthood. 83 percent of adolescents and young adults use deodorant once or several times a day. For 81 percent, deodorant can even contribute to strengthening their self-esteem. “There is a psychologically interesting explanation for this: One’s own body odour is closely linked to the emerging sexuality during puberty. During puberty, young people actually and figuratively get ‘hot’ more frequently. And the body odour gives this away. Deodorant is therefore not only used to conceal the personal smell and instead create a more favourable scent, but also serves to mask the treacherous pheromones. This provides adolescents and young adults not only with more confidence when dealing with friends. They can also play it safe when meeting the opposite sex, avoiding embarrassment and the risk of being rejected because people do not like their smell.” The connection between odour and the transition to adulthood can also be recognized from the fact that deodorants are often a bone of contention between parents and their children: parents often do not like the new scent or perceive it as extremely exaggerated - this is why young people frequently use deodorant in their own room or only after they have left the house. What did young people say: “Deodorants are part of the day-to-day.”
“When I’m with my girlfriend, I do not want to stink.”
“We will leave a note on the table if somebody stinks: “Buy yourself a deodorant.” – You may easily be mobbed.”
“Deodorant leaves me feeling safe.""
“My father always says that it stinks and that I use too much of it – I’m only allowed to use it in my room.”"
Cosmoprof Bologna launches new B2B area,"Located in pavilion 19, the new area will gather: – the Extraordinary Gallery, Cosmoprof exclusive area dedicated to emerging and innovative luxury beauty brands and companies,
– the Premium Perfumery zone, dedicated to masstige exhibitors and perfumes, cosmetics and toiletries,
– as well as the International Buyer Lounge, where are organized meetings between Cosmoprof and Cosmopack exhibitors and selected distributors and brands. In collaboration with Accademia del Profumo and Cosmetica Italia, the Italian Personal Care Association, the Cosmoprime area will also include The Perfume Factory where all the industrial steps of the production of a perfume will be reproduced, from olfactory creation to maceration, from filtration to filling, packaging and cellophane wrapping.  To celebrate the 50th edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna a fragrance will even be produced in limited edition. The Perfume Factory will also host the Accademia del Profumo Awards ceremony with a location designed for that purpose. Eventually, the new area will also host the Cosmoprime Forum, an educational program featuring workshops and round tables with a focus on present and future beauty trends and retail issues. Cosmoprime will open its doors to visitors from 16-19 March 2017, in conjunction with Cosmopack, the part of the fair dedicated to the beauty supply chain.  According to the organisers, this timing “will allow professional visitors to spend one more day in scheduling B2B meetings and increasing their network and, at the same time, business relationships between the beauty industry, exhibiting at Cosmopack, and companies of finished products attending Cosmoprime will be easier.” The 2016 edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna has been characterized by record numbers, with 2,510 exhibitors and more than 200,000 visitors attending the show."
All4Pack to focus on European consumers’ “packaging experience”,"The survey was conducted last May by the ObSoCo, in collaboration with the show’s Expert Committee gathering a panel of major brand representatives, among 2,186 consumers in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. It aimed to define European consumers’ “packaging experience”, both from a functional and emotional perspective, considering the major challenges the packaging industry is facing today: personalization, application, fight against the carbon footprint, digitalization of points of sale, and e-commerce. The first of the main lessons to be learnt is that most respondents are favourable to innovation. 57% consider smart, connected packaging represents a real source of progress, including 71% of those aged 18-24. In the Beauty/Health/Luxury sector, which pays close attention to the product composition, for 31% of the people surveyed, it will help improve people’s health and life quality. As for e-commerce-related constraints, more than half the respondents, all countries included, say they are in favour of reducing the environmental impact. But their design expectations vary depending on their nationalities: 43% of the Spanish and 38% of the French prefer solid packaging, while 33% of the Germans and 32% of the Italians would choose light packaging to reduce waste. This small gap is also generational, as lightness is the best option for young adults aged 18-24, while the 55+ are more favourable to the other solution. Still, for 35% of the people surveyed, the most important function remains the guarantee for a well-protected product or formula. The packaging information that mentions the product origin is also deemed essential. 32% of the French mainly see the packaging as a “source of useful information on the product.” The most expected data is mainly the geographical origin, for 24% of respondents of all countries, while 19% of them favour the composition, and 18% the producer’s identity.
This function is also valid for the Beauty/Health/Luxury sector, since 27% of the people surveyed consider the packaging has an informative role. But for 16% of them, it is also the “object that helps buy the right dose”, and 13% see it as an added value for products – a trend that is confirmed in the luxury segment. As it is so popular, innovation will be to the fore at All4Pack. Designed as the showcase of trends and new launches, the Pack Innovation will provide a global vision, with a selection of ten innovative packaging designs. The Best Pack area will be focused on connected packaging and e-commerce, in collaboration with international design schools. And the guests invited on the TV set will discuss the approaches observed as well as a prospective vision. Lastly, the 2016 edition will host the Pentawards Exhibition 10/10 as a world exclusive: a unique retrospective of the best packaging rewarded for their great creativity for 10 years in 10 categories."
e-beauty in all its forms,"And who are the main drivers and beneficiaries of this achievement? Women consumers. Most of them have now already acquired a few skills in new technologies, so they adopt innovations without any reservations. YouCam MakeUp, the free Android and IPhone application developed by the Taiwan-based Perfect Corporation company, was downloaded 150 million times in 18 months around the world. To adapt to the endless diversity of people and optimize the interaction between consumers and cosmetics brands, Alice Chang, founder of Perfect Corporation, wanted a platform dedicated to beauty that would gather three applications to apply any virtual makeup (YouCam MakeUp, YouCamNails), improve selfies (YouCamPerfect), and exchange on beauty with a social network for the beautysta community (Beauty Circle). YouCam MakeUp, the most popular of all three applications, makes it possible for users to instantaneously test the latest makeup trends and their shades on their faces, thanks to the augmented reality technology. Its strength is that it reflects a moving camera image and gives a high quality result. The application mainly seduces the Millenials generation in the United States, China, Brazil, but also France – 79% of women users are aged 18 to 34. The website receives about 15 two to four-minute visits per month, during which all users test 11 colours on average, at each session. The success of YouCam MakeUp also represents for brands a fantastic opportunity to enjoy direct access to 150 million potential customers. Partnerships help them take advantage of general information reports, like the most common wishlists saved according to the various regions of the world, or get more personalized information with competitions created in collaboration with women’s magazines or relayed through the Beauty Circle community. The objective is to boost online sales on brands’ e-stores, but the test/validation/purchase trilogy is convincing for both parties. Similarly, it is all about virtual reality with OTSTC Creative Biometric. Created in 2003, the agency is already working with Armani, Biotherm, Boots, Vichy/La Roche-Posay/Inneov, Dior, Givenchy, or Guerlain to offer virtual solutions, applications, or software for makeup, hair dyes, and skin diagnoses – all in real time. A real tool to enhance sales, the solution also applies to points of sale, where the products showcased can be virtually tested. The intuitive touch screen application mimics makeup gestures for a natural effect. As for LF Beauty, who aim to shape tomorrow’s retail, they present a new technology based on a camera placed in different retail display spaces to detect consumers’ hand movements and identify the products examined. The Link Influence company has adopted a different approach, by banking on collecting and analyzing data from the web. Their tool, Radarly, makes it possible to listen to conversations and comments made on websites’ forums and social networks in real time. This raw material is retrieved, processed, and analyzed by a team of sociologists and research directors, and then sent back to customer companies. For R&D services on the look-out for trends, this information is a new godsend. “There is a strong demand from cosmetics brands to better understand customer expectations. The luxury sector, which has been less in demand recently, is also getting increasingly interested in this technology,” comments Laëtitia Amiault, Link Influence Sales Director in France. The company is also present in England and Germany, and has just purchased its counterpart in China, where the social web is used differently. In this overview of new technologies, one can notice the appearance of an essential data resource: sampling. Sample distributor Delpi, developed by Adelpi, delivers both samples and information reports on consumers to brands. Thanks to its interactive screen, this terminal informs users via different ways (videos, ad campaigns, pictures, product information…). And it is them who, on their own initiative, ask for the perfume or cosmetic sample of their choice, after filling in a quick questionnaire with their names and email addresses (the addresses are checked and validated in real time). A QR code can be added to learn more about the sample’s journey and transformation into a product purchase. The connected Delpi terminals can be personalized and integrated to any type of environment (points of sale, parties, shopping malls, cinemas…). This 100% French technology is available on the national territory for now."
Brexit: What are the implications for the cosmetics industry?,"Of course, there will be many changes, but absolutely nothing has happened yet! The outcome of the British vote marks the beginning of long negotiations, and until the process is over, the United Kingdom remains a member of the Union, with all the rights and obligations that derive from this. In particular, EU law continues to apply to and in the United Kingdom until it is no longer a member. “For our cosmetics sector, it means that all existing laws, regulations and guidelines remain in place exactly as they did before the vote - nothing changes,” said the Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association (CTPA) in a release.  “In particular, it means that all of the cosmetics sold in the UK must continue to comply fully with the European Cosmetic Products Regulation, including requirements relating to safety, labelling and the ban on animal testing.” One can imagine, once the final decision for the exit has been made, that the United Kingdom’s legislation will gradually differ from that of the European Union. It is plausible, but it is not the most likely hypothesis. In fact, it will mainly depend on the role the country will decide to play within Europe. Indeed, the reality is that the European integration process offers European States a wide range of options, in particular in terms of business relationships. The United Kingdom may, once again, become a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), similarly to Switzerland. This way, its goods would not be taxed as part of intra-European trade, and it would take advantage of the free trade agreements between the EFTA and third countries. Since the EFTA is not a customs union, the United Kingdom will still need to renegotiate its tariffs with all the countries that have not signed any agreement with this organization. The United Kingdom might even join the European Economic Area (EEA), as did the three other members of the EFTA – Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway – to maintain the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labour (the four freedoms at the core of the single market). [1]
However, in exchange, the European legislation will need to be enforced in these areas. In practice, the British would then have to undertake to comply with what they have just rejected, meaning: the better part of European rules and standards. Or worse, they would no longer have a word to say regarding their content, since EEA members only have a right of consultation when it comes to drafting the European texts related to them. So, just like Switzerland, the United Kingdom might choose to get its relationships with the EU sorted bilaterally, by negotiating on a case-by-case basis the clauses on the free movement (or not) of capital, goods, services, and labour. As for the Swiss, this resulted in a massive convergence with the EU. “The UK is still in Europe. We will not be relocating the country to Asia. Commerce and collaboration between the UK, EU member states, and the rest of the world will continue,” highlighted Simon Birkenhead, Europe Managing Director of L2 consulting firm. However, nobody knows what the UK’s future relationship with the EU will look like and the uncertainty is the real risk. “We will be following the developments closely to ensure we give clear and consistent advice to members as the process of an exit unfolds. Undoubtedly there will be much speculation and many will ‘jump the gun’ in saying what needs to be done and by whom,” CTPA Director General Chris Flower told Premium Beauty News. “We will avoid that to ensure we continue to give clear and sound advice in a timely manner to aid clarity and not create confusion.” As a result, the United Kingdom will need to renegotiate both the conditions of its divorce and of its new relationship with the European Union, in a form that remains to be defined. “At present, there are many possible options for this new relationship, but things will not be the same as before an exit,” the Director General of the CTPA insisted. One thing is nearly for sure, the United Kingdom will no longer be the gateway to the European market for many cosmetics brands and suppliers, in particular from North America. It will no longer be considered as a first country to export to within the European Union, and it will no longer keep the Cosmetic Product Information Files required by the European Regulation, except if unlikely bilateral agreements are concluded in this regard. Now, that’s a hard blow for many multinational companies settled in the country!  In contrast, European companies surveyed by Premium Beauty News are rather optimistic. According to them, the impact on the cosmetics industry will be low due to the limited role of the country in this sector. However, a recession in the United Kingdom would necessarily affect the European market."
"Personalization and social media drive sales of U.S. beauty brands in 2015, according to Kline","“Personalization starts at the product level when brands like Skin Inc., Lancôme, or Mix-o-logie offer their custom beauty regimens or scents, and continues through personalized products suggestions offered by beauty apps or targeted marketing messages through various social media platforms,” explains the market research firm. Both large and niche brands utilize the power of social media to connect with target consumers. Large brands like Neutrogena, Clinique, or Estée Lauder have become key social influencers as they turned to beauty social media celebrities to appeal to millennials. Smaller brands, such as Tarte, Too Faced, E.L.F. Cosmetics, Anastasia Beverly Hills, and IT Cosmetics, among others, often choose to make relationships by appealing to their target audience through the girl-next-door type of social stars. “Smaller brands have a distinct advantage as they are very nimble and can listen more closely and adapt to consumers’ demands quicker,” comments Naira Aslanian, the research project manager. “The fact that smaller brands, particularly in the makeup products class, grow the strongest confirms the power of social media levelling the playing field among large players with hefty advertising budgets, and small, niche brands that do not have the larger marketing budgets. It also demonstrates the power these companies have in terms of sales.” Recognizing the efficiency of direct engagement with consumer, large brands are also shrinking their traditional marketing and advertising budgets, indicating a move towards digital and social campaigns. Mobile devices play a crucial role in personalizing a consumer’s beauty routine. Sephora launches its online Pocket Contour class, a mobile-only experience that helps beauty newbies gain knowledge of how to properly contour. Apps like Beautiful Me or Plum Perfect can digitally identify the shoppper’s skin tone and suggest the ideal makeup match from the user’s social media photos. Moreover, “selfie approved” products like Covergirl’s Outlast Stay Luminous foundation, along with various bold lipsticks, are introduced due to the high impact of social media on consumers. Resonating with the selfie generation desiring bold lips and driven by innovative products, lipsticks and lip glosses is the fastest-growing product category, recording over 8% growth in 2015 in the US market. The key drivers are multi-functional/hybrid products like liquid lipsticks, which provide skin care benefits, as well as bold, long-lasting lip colour. With more men paying more attention to their personal appearance, skin care products for men record the highest growth of 9.5% in 2015. While skin care is driven by a gender focus, the fragrances category moves away from being gender-specific, especially niche scents."
The European cosmetics market returns to a more dynamic growth,"According to the figures recently released by Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics and toiletries market grew by +3.1% in 2015, compared to 2.1% in 2014. “Our industry remains strong and shows signs of growth despite trying economic circumstances. Valued at 77 billion Euros, Europe remains the largest market for cosmetic products in the world,” commented Loïc Armand, President of Cosmetics Europe. The growth was driven by dynamic sales in Switzerland (+12.4%), the United Kingdom (+10.9%), Romania (+8%) and Hungary (7.5%). As far as product categories are concerned, make-up was the most dynamic (+7.2%), followed by skin care (+3.4%), toiletries (+2.8%) and fragrances and perfumes (+2.7%).  Hair care remain the weakest category but returned to growth in 2015 (+0.8% compared to -0.2% last year). Skin care and toiletries remain the most important product categories in Europe, followed by hair care and fragrances. On the occasion of the third Cosmetics Europe Week, which was held from 13 to 17 June 2016, the European association of cosmetic manufacturers, also presented the results of a study on the socio-economic contribution of the cosmetics industry. According to the report prepared by Risk & Policy Analysts Ltd. (RPA): – The vast majority of Europe’s 500 million consumers use cosmetics and personal care products contributing to well-being and healthy lifestyles, and positive self-esteem every day.
– The European export market (mainly from France, Germany and Italy) totalled 17.2 billion Euros in 2015, with France and Germany accounting for around 53% of total exports from Europe.
– The strength of the entrepreneurial cosmetics industry lies in its mix of both big and small companies: there are 4,605 SMEs in Europe and this number is growing
– At least 2 million jobs are supported across the European value chain, with 56% women and 44% men being employed in the cosmetics industry.
– The sector is science driven with more than 26,000 scientists in the industry, covering a diverse range of scientific disciplines. “Europe is the global flagship producer of cosmetic products. In 2015, the European cosmetics market was valued at 77 billion euros, making Europe the largest market for cosmetic products in the world. The industry make a significant contribution to the European economy across its value chain. It is estimated that the cosmetics industry brings at least 29 billion euros in added value to the European economy every year, of which 8 billion euros is contributed directly by the manufacture of cosmetic products (the remaining 21 billion euros is generated indirectly through the supply chain),” said Cosmetics Europe."
Parisian department store Printemps Haussmann inaugurates the Avery Perfume Gallery,"The Avery concept was born in 2010 in London and created by a store inaugurated just a minute away from New Bond Street. Then, stores opened in Modena, Italy, and New Orleans, Louisiana, and the concept gradually spread across the world. Today, from Milan to Doha, and from Rabat to Moscow, all stores show different settings, but assert their own identity depending on their aspirations and the local environment. However, they do share some common points: mainly an atypical olfactory discovery experience combining the works of artists, creators, and new talents. The concept will now be introduced in France at the Printemps Haussmann department store in Paris. “Avery has seduced us with its differentiated offering,” explains Delphine Herve Turra, Beauty Market Manager at Le Printemps. “They had a certain modernity and olfactory interest in their product selection, and we had the same requirements,” she adds. Pending the opening of a new area dedicated to Beauty scheduled for 2017, le Printemps Haussmann will inaugurate a temporary 12m2 Avery Perfume Gallery corner at the store’s entrance.  A real curiosity room, it will showcase a scenography of bottles, prints, carefully selected objects, including a collection of ceramic sculptures to diffuse perfumes, and rare brands: the exclusive Avery lines, but also Re Profumo, Santa eulalia, So oud, Boadicea the Victorius, Andrée Putman, A Lab on Fire, Roads, and Agonist. Absolutely unique in France, The Fragrance Kitchen will be the flagship brand of the area and the inspiration for its theatrical identity. Created five years ago by Sheik Majed Al-Sabah, of the Kuwait royal family, who is very keen on perfumes and beautiful materials, it comprises 80 references and has already seduced many enthusiasts on the other side of the Atlantic. “Le Printemps has always been able to make people discover new launches. It takes longer and longer for us to make our selection, as it needs to be increasingly more sophisticated,” declares Delphine Herve Turra. “We bank on brands that have the potential to develop in the long term. It is essential to take the time to get the concept settled and really correspond to our foreign customers’ expectations, but also to make our aura shine forth to our French customers,” she concludes."
Natural formulations and changing consumer habits transform US facial skincare and anti-aging market,"The overall facial skincare and anti-aging market experienced a 1.4 percent decrease in sales in 2015, falling to US$6.6 billion, with limited engagement from the aging Baby Boomer population impacting the entire category. Consumers age 55+ are the least likely to report usage of nearly every facial skincare product surveyed by Mintel [1], with one third (32 percent) not using any of the surveyed products (vs 19 percent overall).  However, according to a recent report by the market research firm [2] consumer interest in natural formulations and changing cleansing habits present opportunities. According to Mintel, natural formulations have become central to the facial skincare and anti-aging market, as major brands and niche brands alike now feature natural claims on product packaging.  Interest in natural beauty and personal care ingredients is on the rise, and natural product trends paired with the strong association between diet and skin is driving the emergence of food-based and probiotic facial skincare. Actually more, consumers are interested in milder, more natural formulations and those that shield against pollution as one in seven (14 percent) agree that pollution impacts the appearance of their skin.  What’s more, consumers also view lifestyle as an important factor in their skin’s appearance, with many agreeing that factors such as hydration (44 percent) and diet (36 percent) impact skin’s appearance more than using skincare products (26 percent). Another 38 percent agree that stress impacts the appearance of their skin, and as such, 30 percent of consumers look for anti-aging products featuring anti-stress claims. As a consequence, consumers are most likely to be using or interested in using products with vitamin C (85 percent), fruit based ingredients (78 percent), oatmeal (78 percent) and honey (76 percent). Further supporting this trend, 72 percent of consumers use or are interested in using products featuring probiotics. “Consumers are embracing healthy, holistic living, and our research shows that these lifestyle changes are driving the facial skincare and anti-aging market. In such a saturated marketplace, products featuring natural formulations are standing out to consumers who trust identifiable and natural ingredients,” said Shannon Romanowski, Category Manager, Health, Household, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel.  “The link between diet and skin is evident, and as consumers increasingly associate their lifestyle with their skin’s appearance, product formulations with added food-based ingredients and vitamins stand out among the competition.” Furthermore, Mintel research reveals that saturation in the facial skincare and anti-aging market is occurring as benefits in traditional moisturizers, anti-aging products and specialized products blur category segments. Products such as daily use moisturizers now integrate anti-aging benefits, leading to a decline in sales of strictly defined anti-aging treatments. In fact, while anti-aging is still the largest segment in the category, it saw sales decrease 6.3 percent 2014-15. Further, 21 percent of consumers do not use and are not interested in using anti-aging products compared to 18 percent of consumers who use them. While lip balm has been one of the most dynamic and fastest growing segments of the category, with sales increasing 55 percent from 2010-14, the segment faltered in 2015 as sales declined 3 percent due, in part, to competition from coloured cosmetics (e.g. tints, gloss, lipstick) with moisturizing and protective qualities undercutting sales. Reported usage of lip balm took a slight dip from 2014-15, dropping from 52 percent to 49 percent of consumers using these products. Meanwhile, facial cleansers continue to gain market share from the anti-aging segment. The cleanser segment is currently the fastest growing in the market, increasing sales 4.6 percent 2014-15 to reach $1.8 billion. Anti-aging products are also losing market share to moisturizers, which experienced an uptick of sales of 2.9 percent 2014-15, amassing US$765 million. As the facial cleanser segment increases market share, no-rinse cleansers are poised for growth. Mintel research reveals that while just 8 percent of adults currently use cleansing waters (also referred to as micellar waters), this increases to 14 percent of consumers age 18-34. And consumers view cleansing waters favourably, with many agreeing that they are refreshing (45 percent), safe for sensitive skin (43 percent) and more gentle (39 percent) than rinse-off cleansers. However, there are barriers to usage: nearly half (46 percent) of consumers perceive these products as more expensive than rinse-off cleansers and one quarter (28 percent) agree they have confusing usage instructions. “While the facial skincare category has experienced tepid sales over the years, in 2015 we saw declines for the first time in five years. Moving forward, the category’s success will rely on younger consumers and the growing facial cleanser segment, with an emphasis on natural, recognizable ingredients and innovation like ‘waterless cleansing.’ To broaden the appeal of these products, brands should be proactive in addressing concerns surrounding cost and usage instructions,” concluded Romanowski."
MakeUp in Paris: An edition full of new features,"Eventually, the Seine River did not flood the Louvre and MakeUp in Paris opens its doors this week on the seventh edition of a trade show, which has established itself, even more this year, as the big European appointment in the global make-up sector. Yet this new edition is setting new records.  150 exhibitors coming from 19 countries - the biggest number since the creation of the show - will present visitors new ingredients, formulas, packaging and accessories dedicated to the make-up industry. Furthermore, one week before the opening, MakeUp in Paris counted more than 4,000 pre-registered visitors, the highest number ever. Among the new features of this edition, a very special highlight will be put on environmental issues.  Many exhibitors participated in the green innovation contest organized by the MakeUp in Paris team and sponsored by Chanel Parfums et Beauté: ten formulation companies decided to submit a total of sixteen products while twelve packaging and accessory suppliers will present a total of nineteen products. The products selected will be presented to visitors in the MakeUp in sustainable area of the event. This area, located at the entrance of the show will enable visitors to better understand and therefore better anticipate environmental issues in the ""Personal care & Beauty sector"". Chanel Parfums et Beauté, the sponsor of this area, will take the opportunity to introduce its SEP tool developed with the company Pure Project, an open source tool available to all interested companies. MakeUp in Paris 2016 also opens its doors to the digital revolution which is shaking the beauty industry! With the Digital Beauty area, visitors will have the opportunity to discover digital solutions applied to beauty and make-up and meet the various service providers in the field.  “These can be very innovative companies in product design, distribution and customer relations, of consulting firms specialized in digital strategy,” explain the organizers.

Pack & Gift 2016 to focus on digitalization and customization,"Innovative materials, connectivity, 3D, new solutions and new technologies are reshaping the promotional offerings of tomorrow.  This mutation of the market will be at the heart of the 9th edition of the Pack & Gift tradeshow under the Pack Fiction common thread. “The field of expression for promotional offerings is increasingly vast, and Pack & Gift strives, year in and year out, to highlight these new trends, so essential in the quest to come up with ever more striking solutions,” say the organizers. Formerly the preserve of luxury brands, promotional packaging today concerns every sector. Conscious that these offerings shine a real spotlight on their products, brands are paying more and more attention to them, and taking particular care not only in the creation of the promotional product itself, but also of its overall environment, and in particular the way in which it is presented at the point-of-sale. Buoyed by the new fabrication, printing and customisation techniques, the creative possibilities are endless. On the stands as well as in the conferences or by way of the organized events, the Pack Fiction common thread will highlight the avant-garde solutions that shape the promotional offerings of tomorrow and open up new prospects to advertisers. All these solutions will be futuristically presented in the Pack Fiction area.  A jury of expert professionals will reward the best solution on 16 June 2016.  Two categories will be awarded: – New Technologies. Rethinking packaging and promotional items through the prism of digital. Personalization, connectivity, scalability and 3D will be the watchwords 
– Design. Materials and shapes are revolutionized, innovative, flexible, durable, sensory, eco-design and transform uses.. Offering a natural link to the theme of the show, a Pop-Up Store will illustrate - with the aid of demos - the new possibilities for point-of-sale presentations, which today can be brought to life thanks to the new printing and customisation techniques. Furthermore, a Trends Wall will guide visitors in their choice of colours, with a patented smart system enabling them to determine colour schemes suited to their products, their markets and their target consumers. This area, designed as a place of discovery and interactivity, will be managed by the ColoriConseil agency, in partnership with Pantone and ColorPassport. These demo zones will be complemented by a programme of conferences that will address and analyse all of these topics, in particular the roundtables ""Packaging has its digital revolution"" and ""Packaging customisation: trends and instruction guide"" or a presentation Birchbox’s customer loyalty techniques by François Morrier, Joliebox Co-founder and Europe Creative Director Birchbox. More than 3,500 visitors are expected on Wednesday 15 and Thursday 16 June 2016 at the Paris Porte de Versailles Exhibition Centre, Hall 5.2."
China Beauty Expo:  Focus on latest beauty trends of the Chinese market,"With three fairs under the same roof (Cosmetics, Professional Beauty and Cosmetech), China Beauty Expo brought together more than 800 suppliers and over 1,200 international and domestic brands in 15 halls of the Shanghai New International Exhibition Center. The beauty supply chain (the Cosmetech part of the show) featured over 800 exhibitors - including Intercos, Cosmax, Kolmar, HCT Group, Greentech, Yonwoo, Kyodo Printing, Haasbel, WestRock, Weckerlecosmetics, Symrise, Fiabila, Keystone - attracted by the 3,300 local cosmetics makers (including more than 50 companies whose production is valued at over 100 million Yuan).  “Cosmetech at China Beauty Expo is the biggest gathering point for beauty packaging and suppliers in the world,” claim the show organizers. As far as finished products are concerned, the organisers have increased the international scope of the show with 20 collective pavilions (Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Israel, Japan, Korea, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, USA, etc.) and a focus on Korean brands and the K-Beauty wave which is taking the Chinese market by storm.  Besides local brands, this unique gathering is a great opportunity for identifying the main trends of the Chinese beauty market. Beyond the traditional skin-lightening and anti-spot products that are traditionally associated to the Chinese market but were not taking centre stage this year, cosmetic brands have multiplied face and body care solutions: anti-wrinkles masks, strengthening, hydrating and lifting products, or gadgets that stretch the face to hide wrinkles, scars and dark circles… Acne - the teenager’s enemy, but also the one of rebel skin adults - was one of the brains’ main are of focus.  Some brands now offer sessions of injections and pulsation in salon to eradicate acne. Others remain in the daily creams and scrubs masks, which components are so-called ""green"" or ""natural"". Besides the usual moisturizing body milks and creams, brands offer new solutions in order to hydrate the skin, including electric portable foggers and formulas with actives encapsulated in nutritious balls and some time with gold particles. Taking care of one’s hair with repair masks or treating shampoos remains a big trend of the Chinese market.  New products to boost the hair growth are also increasingly popular, as well as laser hair removal to get rid of unwanted hair. For even whiter teeth, brands even offer you toothpaste with ""natural"" whitening active ingredients, or whitening services ""respecting the enamel"". This year again, many new brands have chosen to surf the natural wave. Without really guaranteeing truly natural products, a large number of brands communicate on the natural qualities of their products and do not hesitate to use green-washing or green-painting techniques. Brands also launching care products for pregnant women and babies (creams for sensitive skin and children’s skin, products with active ingredient to ""naturally and safely"" protect babies’ skin, ...). In the wake of firming-leggings and similar types of clothes, some Japanese brands have chosen to innovate in slimming-lingerie lines to reshape the body without the constraints of the old corsets. For more fantasy: temporary tattoos, jewelry and 3D gel nails, metal capsule nails, makeup from common to unusual pigments, implantation one by one of false eyelashes for more real volume ... WeChat Commitment! A big trend of this show is the will of all brands to engage passersby in their WeChat account with contests, free samples, promotions if they scan the QR Code ... WeChat and other social networks have become essential for the success of a brand in beauty products in China. And it is the major communication channel for Chinese brands in 2016!"
Alternative Fragrance & Beauty: a show with the looks of a concept store in the heart of Paris,"Premium Beauty News - You describe Alternative Fragrance & Beauty as a new generation show. Can you tell us a bit more? Julie Cartigny -  The Carreau du Temple is a venue dedicated to urban lifestyles. It is a real breeding ground for projects right in the heart of Paris. Alternative Fragrance & Beauty perfectly fits this concept, although we also strive to get off the beaten track. The word “show” too often rhymes with hubbub, turmoil in the aisles, and lack of natural light. It is an exhausting experience, so we have decided to offer everyone a break, so they can discover brands in a different way. The scenery designed by the Cent Degrés agency makes this “circular” walk quite atypical, as every brand can reproduce their own worlds with specific decorative items. This way, Alternative provides brands with a maximum of opportunities to tell their stories. As influences, sectors, and markets are opening up, it also seemed important to us to open the doors of this event to all exceptional product enthusiasts. The late-night opening on the Friday night and the whole day on Saturday, June 18 will make it possible for exhibitors to create a bond with this public of beauty lovers, without any intermediates. The exhibitors willing to sell their products will be able to do it, and the general public will have access to about ten free conferences. Premium Beauty News - How many brands are you expecting? Julie Cartigny -  Alternative Fragrance & Beauty will welcome more than 130 brands: 60% from the worlds of makeup, skincare, hair care, and accessories, and 40% from perfumery (alternative perfumery, home perfumery, and all types of diffusers). We will offer an exceptional overview of innovation in this sector, from slow cosmetics to the most sophisticated skincare products, and demanding perfumery. Again, the idea is to gather an international, original offering with different retail positionings targeting networks like department stores and concept stores, but also independent hotels, spas, organic networks, independent perfume stores, pharmacies, selective distribution, distributors willing to broaden their portfolios… Premium Beauty News - The Beauty Challengers Awards used to be organized at Beyond Beauty Paris. They will now be part of this new show, but have you changed the model? Julie Cartigny - The Beauty Challengers Awards is a widely recognized competition that has existed for more than 10 years. Many brands now enjoying a solid reputation have been supported by global experts who spend some of their time every year to discover tomorrow’s beauty. This year, we have decided to open the doors of our offices – a whole week at the end of May – to about forty influential jurors (decision makers or influencers), as well as to approximately thirty well-informed consumers, who will vote to reward the best brands. Again, it seems crucial to us to strengthen the direct relationship with consumers. Premium Beauty News - Can you also tell us about your partnership with Olfactorama? Julie Cartigny - We are delighted to benefit from the energy of the Olfactorama team, who will award their own prizes to the best perfumes of the year on the night of June 17, in the Carreau du Temple auditorium. Olfactorama, who will be present throughout the event, have also devised an Olfacto Blind Test for the show, where professional visitors will be able to blindly assess the perfume brands present. A dedicated award will be attributed following a visitor vote. Again, that’s a first! Several other areas and animations will be organized throughout the three days to make both professional visitors and the general public live new experiences and stimulate their senses by visiting the IFF/Cent Degrés/Procédés Chenel/AESTHETE/Sensorial studio areas… to smell, touch, taste… Premium Beauty News - How many visitors are you expecting? Julie Cartigny - We are expecting between 1,000 and 1,500 professionals, including 20% foreign people, and over 1,500 visitors from the general public, though this is difficult to quantify. Consumer expectations are changing, and so is the offering in points of sale. The new faces of the Brazilian beauty market On the occasion of the Alternative Fragrance & Beauty tradeshow, the editorial team of Brazil Beauty News (the Brazilian edition of Premium Beauty News) will put one of the world’s biggest cosmetics market under the spotlights. The roundtable will be moderated by Kristel Milet and Vincent Gallon (BrazilBeautyNews.com) and will feature the Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in France, Helen Kupfer-Haas (HKH  Exclusive Brand Boosting), Alessandra Tucci (Perfumeria Paralela) and Sabine Lubot (Aptar). The Brazilian market is transforming dramatically, and new opportunities are emerging for brands and retailers.  Retail channels are evolving toward more complexity and variety, new brands are entering the market and consumers’ expectations are changing and becoming more sophisticated."
Fragrance houses strive to better understand gen Y and Z consumers,"The so-called “GENYZ”, that elusive slab of society spanning from generation Z’s tweens to 34-year old millennials, is drawing the attention of fragrance suppliers around the world. In order to effectively aim their products toward this moving, highly connected and short attention-spanned target, fragrance makers Symrise and Firmenich have run studies to map out how they relate to perfumes and assist their industry partners in better planning their launches. Symrise’s qualitative research with Gen-Z girls in four US cities unveiled five trend concepts: ‘Pretty Please’, ‘Enchanted Rebellion’, ‘#Funfashionista’, ‘Don’t Worry, B-Happy’ and ‘Get Sporty’. ‘Pretty Please’ orbits around traditional romantic, feminine love - the Juliets of the new age. ‘Enchanted Rebellion’, on the other hand, is all about a somber, sensual and mysterious approach towards love; think sexy vampires and devoted werewolves exchanging bites over a distraught maiden. “#Funfashionista” is this generation’s Sex and the City, fusing together female friendship and a high sense of fashion with an urban-chic backdrop. ‘Don’t Worry B-Happy’ translates a happy-go-lucky attitude towards life, while “Get Sporty” was a concept suggested by the interviewees themselves as an expression of their relation to sport fashion. According to the team at Symrise North America, participants were asked which aromas were related to these core concepts and then crossed the data with a list of top-selling perfumes for this demographic. The results were used to create a new collection of fragrances for perfumes, shampoos and shower gels, allowing Symrise’s clients to develop products specifically aimed towards female Gen-Z consumers. Mapping the consumer behavior of tweens and teens revealed the most ethnically diverse and connected generation to walk the Earth thus far. “Their main influences come from friends, social networks and also from their parents,” says Doreen Bucher, VP Marketing, Fine Fragrance at Symrise North America. Having grown up under heavy influence of the Internet and smartphone culture, they are hardwired towards innovation and display short attention spans. Nevertheless, they’ve quickly come to realize their buying choices affect other people’s lives as well as the environment, and therefore demand transparency from their brands of choice. Although fragrances are not among the top priorities for this group of consumers, they still have an important role once suggested. When asked how they would spend US$ 100 and US$ 1000, clothes and shoes got the biggest slice of the pie, but fragrances weren’t far behind. “What’s interesting is that at this age they are still defining who they are in the world, so the way they dress and the brands they choose are of high importance,” says Bucher. The research also pointed out how most of the 14 to 17 year old girls targeted in the study struggle to express the kind of fragrances they prefer and find it hard to describe them in words. Interviewees vaguely ascertain that they’re more inclined towards “light and fresh, but no too floral” scents. Curiously enough, they also claim to enjoy men’s fragrances, coming as far as using male deodorants because they think they are more effective. Fragrance supplier Firmenich, on the other hand, focused their studies on millennials of 16 cities in 12 different countries, including Brazilian capitals Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Recife. The research was made in partnership with marketing intelligence veteran Archetype Discoveries Worldwide and relied on a sensorial methodology. The study was based on the Jungian concept of archetypes, and pledged to shed light on the subconscious expectations of a generation that is highly active on the virtual world, but passive on the real world. “We needed to fully understand what is behind this behavior, how millennials truly feel and figure out what we can do to help our clients reach out for their hearts,” says Daniela Cunha, marketing director at Firmenich Brasil. One of the company’s exclusive products to come out of this research effort was the Harmony fragrance, which blends the freshness of the hundred-leaved rose, crystalline musk and velvety incense, resulting in a scent that evokes tranquility and wellbeing. According to Firmenich, the scent also references the current blurring of gender stereotypes."
The subtle sophistication of Iran,"In her introduction, the study’s author reiterates the fact that its geographic situation and history shaped Iran very differently from its Oriental neighbours. As the cultural crossroads between Russia in the North and Africa in the South, the country has always been the meeting point of the Eastern routes. “This is one of the reasons why a great variety of endemic ingredients can be found there, like saffron or the rose,” Hélène Capgras explains. Its history, the richness of the Persian culture, the fact that it was at the forefront of modernization in the 70s, the shock of the Islamic revolution, or the Iran/Iraq war, all these factors have built the profile of a contemporary society between modernity and constraints. The 21 cultural, historical, sociological, or lifestyle topics chosen for the Brain for Beauty study give an accurate vision of the pillars of this society. Women or femininity is one of these topics, and it is recurring, in particular in the chapter about fire: this key element symbolizes Iran, born from the pre-Islamic religion known as Zoroastrianism, “this very egalitarian religion that built the role of women within society and made it possible for them to have access to the status of Queen or Head of the armed forces,” Hélène Capgras explains. Women also appear in the evocation of the “7 princesses” that embody the diversity of Iranian beauties, from the Kurdish influences in the North to the high cheekbones at the gates of Russia, the golden hair allegedly responsible for the victories over the Roman armies, or the matter complexions in the South, often with bright eyes… femininity is always reflected in the body’s grace. Less lascivious than Oriental women, Iranian women look slim and thin. Today, this femininity faces restrictions and bans, but Iranian women deal with it with compromises: Hélène Capgras talks about a “constant body fight”. “In 1990, makeup was completely banned. Today, it has become a way for them to assert themselves through beauty. It is a positive mask that helps cope with the public space outside, such a contrast with private lives indoors, where people are freer,” she describes. Men share the same approach of beauty, as depicted in the chapter about Heroes. This myth conveyed the notion of masculine beauty for centuries, and it is still visible today in the attention Iranian men pay to their image. “The importance of well-known floral perfumes actually outdoes the powerful trails of the Middle East, in particular with the rose, the olfactory expression of femininity,” Hélène Capgras emphasizes. Whether they be classics, memories of the 70s, or niche fragrances, perfumes are essential for both men and women. French and Italian brands dominate a market where counterfeiting is still common. And cosmetics and makeup encounter the same difficulties: “there is an incredible variety of import brands, but the offering is still complex to decipher depending on the distribution modes,” Hélène Capgras observes. And yet, new perfume stores and pharmacies are present, with a very rich offering in hair care: a whole chapter is dedicated to it in the study. Iran’s young, educated population makes it a real demographic pot: if young people are confronted with restrictions and bans, they still manage to cleverly circumvent them to claim their own identity. Indeed, in conclusion to her study, Hélène Capgras highlights the extraordinary personality of this country in search for a modern Persian expression of luxury. “This country radiates a subtle sophistication that can mostly be found in Beauty codes.”"
United Kingdom: Face oils drive growth in prestige skincare,"The growing popularity of face oils is driving growth in the prestige skincare market in the UK, according to the NPD Group.  The women’s face oil market was worth £4.9 million (EUR 6.2 million) in 2015, and whilst this category accounts for just 1% of the total prestige women’s skincare market, it reported double digit growth in 2015 where it increased by 30.8% compared to 2014. “This demonstrates that innovation is key to the development and growth of new categories within skincare, it also reveals that there is real opportunity for further growth,” says Teresa Fisher, Senior Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. Actually, the face oils category (which includes: facial moisturisers, facial cleansing oils, anti-ageing beauty oils) is among the most dynamic ones in the United Kingdom. The market of women’s face oils has grown from £2.3 million in 2011 to £4.9 million in 2015, doubling in size in just four years. Treatment shave products for men, an emerging category reported sales of £4.7 million in 2015 growing 20% on 2014, demonstrating that men have adopted oils for shaving preparation as part of their daily shaving ritual. According to NPD, the market for prestige face oil products has been fuelled in part by the increased awareness of the product category. New launches in the facial oil sector in the past year include Elemis Nourishing Cleansing Oil, Bare Minerals Mineralixirs, Clinique Smart Treatment Oil and Kiehl’s Daily Reviving Concentrate. However, the number of new product launches for face oils in the UK was just 15 in 2015, compared to the number of launches in the serum sector which was 45. Indeed, the serum market is more mature with sales of £49 million in 2015. Nevertheless, The NPD Group considers the face oils market presents a huge opportunity for brands.  Furthermore, the trend for facial oils has extended beyond skincare to include new product launches in the make-up sector with Clarins Instant Light Lip Comfort Oil, Lancôme Juicy Shaker, Smashbox Photo Finish Primer Oil and YSL Rouge Volupte Tint in Oil. Best-selling face oil products in the UK in 2015 (alphabetical order) Bobbi Brown - Soothing Cleansing Oil 200ml
Clarins - Huile Orchidee Bleue 30ml
Clarins - Huile Santal 30ml
Clinique - Take The Day Off Clns Oil 200ml
Sisley - Rose Noire Huile Precieuse 25ml “We are witnessing a new consumer who is increasingly turning to their peers for advice on products and take the lead from social media and bloggers. As a result they are willing to try new products and innovations, incorporating them into their beauty ritual,” Teresa Fisher concludes."
"For Clarins, China is a pioneering digital market","Premium Beauty News - In China, you still mainly sell your products through department stores and spas. Why focus on digital technologies?  Julien Chiavassa -  Our online sales represent 15% of our total sales in China. This share is higher than the global average, which shows how advanced China is in the digital field, and in particular in the mobile field. Chinese consumers breathe through their mobile phones. And even if we still sell a lot via physical stores, the influence of digital platforms is getting stronger and stronger, as it impacts our offline activity more and more every day. Almost two thirds of our sales in physical stores are influenced by our digital points of impact. Our sales teams in-store and in e-commerce used to work separately, so we did not have any visibility or centralized database on our customers. Now, we want to get rid of this compartmentalization and send a coherent message through our distribution channels. We focus on the online content to develop the click & collect system, enrich the digital experience in-store, and make it more emotional. We aim at making the offline to online transition natural, because transactions are increasingly made online. Better knowing our customers helps us merge our online and offline loyalty programmes and improve our services. Premium Beauty News - How did you centralize your data from the various distribution channels upstream? Julien Chiavassa - Parallel to our physical network, our online sales in China are achieved by Tmall, the trading platform developed by the Alibaba group via Taobao (two thirds of our sales), our own Chinese Clarins website, clarins.com.cn (a quarter of our sales), and other retailers online. Our main challenge was to gather all our sales networks, making sure our system could handle all these different data. Then, everything changed with WeChat, the instant messaging application, which has become an aggregator, the essential contact point in China for anyone intending to do some brand communication, CRM, and loyalty programmes. In terms of marketing campaigns, we bank less on our website, and more on our official WeChat account. Once customers have been added to our database, we ask them to follow our official WeChat account, which provides us accurate knowledge of our recruiting platforms. Right now, we can learn how many customers are really present on all our networks. We can also determine how often new consumers are recruited by each network – Tmall is the best performing. And today in China, we can apply the same communication cycle to every new consumer, whatever their original channel. Premium Beauty News - Most of your turnover is achieved in Europe. Why have you chosen China to implement this cross-channel organization? Julien Chiavassa - China is the first market where we can develop our organization, due to its ecosystem. This market is really immersed in the digital world, mainly via mobile devices. The share of our media investments dedicated to digital technologies will have risen from 15% to 65% in two years in the Asian Pacific region. And it will have reached 100% in China. Given its specificities as an online environment – many Western websites are blocked – China offers the opportunity to adopt a local start-up approach, which actually makes things easier for us, as there is no need to adapt to this market if one already had a global installation.  Besides, Chinese people are very enthusiastic, and our teams really committed. On top of that, our customers are always ahead of us: we keep trying to fill the gap between their expectations and what we offer them. As for the worldwide extension of this model, WeChat is the most popular messaging application in the Asian-Pacific region. We also plan to use WhatsApp in Japan and KakaoTalk in South Korea. Premium Beauty News - In terms of content, what do you feature on your WeChat account? Julien Chiavassa - In addition to brand and product information, we are trying to reach a certain balance with a lifestyle, less self-centred approach. And we endeavour to create an innovative content in coherence with the specific WeChat format, as it is very different from Facebook. We also work a lot on how to build a relationship with Chinese tourists abroad."
The face of European online beauty shoppers is changing,"“The online sales of beauty and body care products in Europe is set to grow more than eight per cent each year up until 2019. That means the online channel reflects four times the growth of stationary retail stores,” according to Dr. Mirko Warschun, head of the Consumer Industries and Retail practice at A.T. Kearney for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. This is one of the key findings from the firm’s current study of e-commerce trends for beauty and personal care products. Based on representative surveys of consumers in Germany, Great Britain and France, the global management consultancy company has been publishing this study annually since 2012. In addition to price - which is still the number one reason for online shopping - other purchasing criteria are gaining increasingly in importance: already half of those surveyed look for product information, customer ratings, tips and styling ideas. The study reveals that innovative applications such as online tests, mobile skin type apps, beauty forums and communities with expert tips, illustrated product reviews or complimentary samples with the delivery offer online retailers good opportunities for competitive differentiation. This is also a way to capture the 20 per cent of surveyed consumers who say they do not shop online because they need to see, feel and test a product. “Retailers and brand owners who also give their customers a feeling for their products online are definitely ahead of the game,” adds A.T. Kearney e-commerce expert Dr. Peter Pfeiffer. At the same time, British customers expect a high level of convenience. Nine out of ten feel a delivery time of no more than four days is acceptable. About half of those surveyed feel shipping should be free. However, if there are costs associated with delivery, 93 percent of the respondents said five Pounds would be the maximum limit per shipment. Overall, the study separated the target groups into five types according to age, monthly disposable income for beauty and personal care items (on-and offline), willingness to experiment and delivery expectations. The five groups are: Classic Beauty Shoppers (46 per cent), Natural Cosmetic Lovers (8 per cent), Health Conscious Shoppers (17 per cent) Fashionistas (9 per cent) and Beauty Junkies (10 per cent). “Online retailers should use the differences among these consumer groups to tailor their promotions in order to attract Beauty Junkies and Fashionistas to new products or brands,” according to Pfeiffer. Although these two segments make up the smallest share of shoppers at the moment, they spend two to three times more money per month on beauty and personal care products than the “classic” online customer. What’s more, they enjoy a higher level of disposable income and are therefore more willing to pay for delivery and returns. In addition to product customization and tailoring ingredients and preservatives to specific customer needs, organic and natural cosmetics are a growing trend for online retailing in Europe: the majority of shoppers buy these products online, either exclusively or occasionally. However, in the U.K. so far it’s only 37 per cent who occasionally buy these products online. The study also reveals that Amazon is clearly the market leader among shopping addresses when it comes to make-up, perfume or shower gel. In Great Britain, Amazon is followed by the drugstore chain Boots, which is also the third most important brand in the country. “Online beauty shoppers are no longer looking at just price. They value the comfort of digital shopping, are looking for information and want to try new things. Customer knowledge is therefore becoming the key factor for success in online retailing since preferences are quite different depending on country and consumer segments,” adds A.T. Kearney consumer goods expert Warschun."
Halal cosmetics: A growing global market but disparate certification systems,"""When an animal-based product isn’t halal (""allowed"" in Arabic), or contains alcohol, it’s not only forbidden to consume it, but it’s also considered to be impure: you cannot use it on your face, or your skin,"" said Shaikh Ali Achcar, manning the stand of the Swiss-based Halal Certification Services (HCS) at the in-cosmetics tradeshow, which was held last week in Paris. Beside ethanol, the list of products prohibited under the Islamic law mainly includes animal byproducts: pork or pork by-products, animals that are dead or dying prior to slaughter, blood and blood by-products, carnivorous animals, birds of prey, land animals without external ears, etc. Actually, there are several ingredients that can be of concern to Muslim consumers eager to extend their respect of the Islamic law to cosmetic products. Possibly problematic ingredients include: allantoin, ambergris, collagen, elastin, ethanol, gelatine, tallow and tallow derivatives, snail slime, cochineal extract, etc. ""The majority of the consumers do not know if the product comes from animal-based ingredients or not. So when they see the halal product, they buy it,"" said Achcar.  ""In the case of a company that has animal-based products and synthetic ones in the same (factory), we have to understand how they separate the production in order to avoid cross-contamination,"" he added. Achcar has begun to build a client base in the cosmetics industry, with HCS charging between 1,500 and 2,000 euros (about US $2,250) for its scientific team to analyse products.  HCS also inspects factories to certify them as halal. A few years ago halal cosmetics were a niche market for a few small businesses, mainly in Muslim countries in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. But an industry worth around $20 billion (18 billion euros) in 2014 is expected to double by 2019, when it will represent six per cent of the global cosmetics market, according to the British market research firm TechNavio. The trend is boosted by the fact that ""some countries are developing regulations making it mandatory for cosmetic products to be certified halal,"" according to Monica Ducruet, who is in charge of regulatory questions for the Swiss group Givaudan’s French subsidiary. Major beauty products companies are beginning to adapt to the trend. L’Oreal has had hundreds of its ingredients certified halal, and experts have checked its production lines turning out goods for the huge market in Indonesia, which counts 200 million Muslims. ""The fact that halal products can be traced back through the entire value chain is important for them in terms of quality assurance,"" German chemicals giant BASF said in a recent news release.  The company has certified as halal 145 of its German-made ingredients destined for beauty and personal hygiene products. But Givaudan’s Ducruet said companies were having difficulty standardising the certification.  ""The problem is a lack of recognition between the different certifying bodies. Some countries, like Indonesia, have made lists of approved halal certifiers, but it’s hard to have a certification recognised in several countries,"" she said.  For instance, there are five large Halal certifiers in Germany, and state based systems in some countries such as Turkey and Iran, making it essential for brands to know their target markets before launching Halal products."
What is in people’s minds when they buy organic cosmetics?,"Choosing to go for organic cosmetics usually implies a global, “all-organic” commitment. 85% of organic cosmetics buyers bought organic food over the past 12 months and confirm it corresponds to a will to change their lifestyles. This is conveyed by the fact that they focus more on their consumption pattern (wastage, waste management, carpool…), but above all, on their own physical fitness, for 86% of them, and psychological health, for 86% of them. This commitment is very contemporary, as organic cosmetics buyers adopted this lifestyle less than 5 years ago, for 70% of them, and often after they grew aware of the environmental or health impact. Their approach is boosted by the need to preserve their health (41%) and support environmental and ethical values (26%), but they also do it for their own pleasure (21%). Their choices are mainly oriented towards facial care, for 20% of them, and hair care (20%), and then body care (16%). The first profile corresponds to “committed ambassadors” for the environment. They are middle-aged, they have a good buying potential, and they represent 33% of buyers. Then, there is a group defined in the study as “beauty addicts” (25%): it is mainly composed of young women and motivated by a holistic vision favouring the price as the main purchase lever. The “seniors concerned for their own health” represent 21%, “the animal advocates” 12%, and there are 8% of hipsters, a group mainly composed of men. In addition, the study highlights the fact that these products are now more easily available, as purchases are equally made (30%) in supermarkets, pharmacies / parapharmacies, and specialized stores."
After a successful 2016 edition MakeUp in Seoul will launch an event dedicated to skincare,"With a number of exhibitors which was up by 20% compared to last year, the 2016 edition of MakeUp in Seoul started under the best auspices.  Apparently, it met all the organisers’ expectations. The number of visitors continued to rise, reaching a total of 2,416 this year with a net increase of Chinese and Japanese brands, according to organizers. Furthermore, more than 1,230 people packed the conference room over the two days to attend a series of conferences and get a complete run-down of the global make-up industry.  “Emphasis was put on China, Japan, Brazil and, of course, Korea with the presence of many personalities coming specially from these countries to discuss and exchange on the dynamism of the beauty industry. Questions were many and topics addressed were the subject of intense discussions,” said the organisers. Mrs. Lee Eun-im, Director of the Hera Division - a brand part of the Amore Pacific Group - thus introduced the Seoulista concept, this Korean woman beauty who, like the Parisienne and New Yorker before her, now captivates the world.  According to Eun-im, the Seoulista is an attractive woman who has a ""natural and well-honed instinct to see beyond beauty and fashion trends to create her own, inimitable style."" She is professional, sophisticated, and ""makes rational and informed decisions."" Crucially, Eun-im specifies, she is the ""only arbiter of her life"". The key to nailing the K-beauty aesthetic is a natural, healthy and flawless-looking complexion. Rather than using products to cover up imperfections, Seoulistas prefer to address the source of any issues, leading Hera to launch its new ""Age Reverse Cushion,"" designed for use on dull areas, such as around the nose and under the eyes.  Additional products within the range include ""Hera Rouge Holic,"" a creamy textured lipstick designed for building colour with each application. The Hera brand, whose private lounge attracted many industry professionals was, for the third consecutive year, the partner of MakeUp in Seoul. The sensorial effects of cosmetic formulations was a key trend along the innovations presented this year by companies exhibiting at MakeUp in Seoul, including many shape-memory textures, and silky, satin or light effects. Considering the interest of the Korean market for beauty brands, the next edition of MakeUp in Seoul in April 2017 will be extended with a brand new event dedicated to skincare products: SkinCare in Seoul."
Esxence 2016: Flourishing niche perfumes in a changing future,"With a 26% increase over the last four years, according to The NPD Group, the niche market is as popular as ever. But is this dynamic capable of absorbing an ever growing abundance of brands and with a number of launches that seems to be increasing even more? Silvio Lévi, founder and director of the show estimates the niche perfumery potential to about one billion euros in Europe, with, he notes, however, great disparities between countries. “All markets are not nearly as strong as Italy where, thanks to a large number of independent perfumeries, alternative perfumes can expect gaining 1,8% of the beauty market. While in France where, apart from Paris, the alternative network is very limited, this market share is only of 0.5%,” he explained. Each year, after approval of a committee of nine experts, the show welcomes new brands or with developing ranges. The 2016 edition hosted about 200 brands including 15 newcomers. “There was a massive arrival of new brands but with no true stories behind them,” nuanced Johann Vitrey, director of Sesame, a retail company specialized in the Middle East. For him, the notion of niche should only be expressed in the plural form. “There are different categories: perfume brands, conceptual brands around a story, heritage brands and finally experimental brands. Within these definitions, launching a niche brand should really involve some risk taking in order to offer never seen before or differentiating perfumes,” he added. While in 2015, newcomers were often French and Italian, the 2016 edition confirmed the massive presence of brands from the Middle East (The Spirit of Dubai, The Gate, Amouroud, Hadara...) or operating in this market, indeed a big perfume buyer. “Yet the arrival of this Oriental wave seems to be out of step,” noted David Frossard, founder of Différentes Latitudes. “Two or three years are necessary to properly develop a brand and unfortunately, within this time frame, the economic and political context has changed, the Middle East market has become less promising and consumers from this region are travelling less to Europe,” he explained. A reference event for all international players in niche perfumery, Esxence 2016 perfectly reflects the flourishing creativity of this perfume sector with many facets but which is still questioning itself about its future."
Fragrance trends in Brazil: Toward a broader diversity,"The quest for new trends is what guides Brazilians’ behavior in the fragrance scene. Brazil has been the world’s largest fragrance market since 2010, according to data from Euromonitor, and it is characterized by the coexistence of different styles and microtrends. “The speed that marks the current consumer society makes it challenging to predict trends,” says Alessandra Tucci, fragrance expert and founder of Perfumaria Paralela, a company that specializes in innovation and strategy for the fragrance industry. According to Alessandra Tucci, Brazilians have a very particular relationship to perfumes compared to North Americans and Asians. “Our culture perceives fragrances as a sign of personal care, beauty, enhanced self-esteem and even sensuality. While Asians are more reserved and perfume can be seen as invasive in some cases, in Brazil it is always welcome, as long as it is used with common sense.” Some trends become more popular than others depending on the consumer profile, she says. ""The trends in Brazil are aligned to Europe and the U.S., with a strong focus on fresh, floral aromas and scents enriched with fruit notes, as they are more casual and easy to please.” There is also a move towards gourmand fragrances, with sweetish, statement scents that consist primarily of edible notes such as vanilla, nougat, praline, meringue, coffee and chocolate. Tucci says they have been incorporated into perfumes over the last few years and have become a favorite among men and women of all generations. “Vanilla scents have been completely integrated into male fragrances, as well as florals and fruits. This has contributed to bridge the gap between traditional gender-specific fragrances.” Alessandra says ingredients that were hardly ever found in this context, such as fragrant herbs with warm woods, bitter chocolate notes, and the contrast between mint and fig are now used in men’s fragrances, which are equally popular among female customers. The generational aspect also has an influence on consumer perception. The striking and austere notes of the chypre family, for example, have been reinterpreted to appeal to the tastes of the modern consumer. Made from the combination of oak moss, florals, citrus fruits and patchouli, they have become more fruity, with less moss notes and a hint of gourmand chords. ""This has resulted in more sophisticated perfumes, with elegant, long-lasting and modern scents"", says Tucci. Tucci also points out a new way to wear signature scents - fragrance layering. Combining different fragrances is a common practice among connoisseurs and has been gaining popularity with consumers. “Some companies use fragrance layering as their foundation, such as Jo Malone, which has recently opened its first store in Brazil. The brand encourages mixing and matching scents to create a truly unique scent.” Sophistication has been a challenge for Brazil, which in 2013 had only 7% its fragrance-spend going on premium fragrances, according to a study conducted by Swiss fragrance house Givaudan. Tucci also highlights the quick maturation of the Brazilian fragrance market, which has seen an increased demand and more discerning customers eager for novelty. However, she argues that it is necessary to facilitate access to unique products. “In my point of view, a mature market requires a diverse distribution network and broad access to information. But we are on that path."""
MakeUp in Seoul to focus on trends and innovation,"With sales exceeding USD 7.3 billion (EUR 6.6 billion), Korea is the third largest beauty market in Asia and ranks 12th in the world.  Moreover, by using on average 13.4 cosmetics daily, and this from their teens, South Korean women hold the world’s record.  The country is also the world’s largest per capita skincare consumer. In the mean time, exports of Korean cosmetic products have reached USD 2.75 billion (EUR 2.5 billion) in 2015, a rise of +53.6% compared to the previous year. Korean beauty trends have been dominating the Western cosmetics sector for some time now, and the craze shows no signs of slowing.  Korean beauty chain Aritaum now claims over 70 locations throughout North America, and L’Oréal Paris recently added its first cushion foundation to its repertoire, joining the likes of Lancôme and Dior in embracing the Korean phenomena. Korean e-sites such as SoKo Glam now bring the Asian nation’s cult products to a global audience, with a constantly updated stock. US beauty brand Sabbatical Beauty is the latest to get on board, launching a Korean-inspired capsule collection for Spring 2016. Titled ’Breathe’, the 10-piece collection offers products infused with skin-nourishing herbals inspired by Korean beauty. The success of Korean brands can be explained by the inventiveness of the suppliers in this sector.  These suppliers et sub-contractors will meet up next week in the South-Korean capital on the occasion of the third edition of the MakeUp in Seoul tradeshow. This year, the show will focus on innovation staging an ""Innovation Tree"" that will highlight the 19 new innovative products selected by a committee of experts [1] among the 45 proposals submitted by 23 companies participating in the event. In alphabetical order, laureates are: Albéa, Aptar, Asadal Beauty Products, Bonne, Chromavis, FS Korea, Gotha Cosmetics, Intercos Korea, Red of View, S&P World, Strand Cosmetics, Yonwoo..., representing in total, 9 formulas, 8 packagings, 1 ""Full service"" and 1 make-up accessory. Concomitant to the trade show, a two-day conference programme will put a particular	 emphasis on inter-influences in terms of colour cosmetics between large countries such as China, Brazil, Japan and, of course, South Korea...  How do they influence one another?  What lessons can be learned from the trends, emerging in these countries?"
France: New record for perfume and cosmetics exports,"Despite the international slowdown in growth, the French cosmetics industry (perfumes, skincare, makeup, hair care, toiletries, etc.) is still developing worldwide: export sales of cosmetics companies operating in France rose again in 2015, with a 4.4% increase. The cosmetics sector’s balance of trade – third positive segment of the French balance of trade, behind aeronautics and wine & spirits – has exceeded 9 billion euro for the first time. “It is the image of French products associated with quality and know-how that help France remain the global leader in this sector,” the FEBEA explains. The sector has also taken advantage of a highly favourable euro-dollar parity. Skincare products and perfumes are still the main drivers for French cosmetics exports, as these two categories represent 75.5% of the total French export sales, respectively 42.5% and 33%. If its weight does remain much lower, the makeup category proved very dynamic, with exports rising by 17% for lip makeup, 10% for eye makeup, and 12% for powders. The European Union remains by far the first Made in France perfume and cosmetics buyer in the world. In value, almost half of French exports in this sector (48.9%) is sold in European countries. On this market, the French industry kept gaining market shares, compared to its immediate neighbours, as its exports show a 5.8% rise, and its balance of trade with the European Union is also on the rise (+5.1%). Germany remains the first French perfume and cosmetics buyer, followed by the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy. Among the first five customers of the French industry, only the United States, ranked second, is not part the European Union. The relative dynamism of the American economy and the fact that the euro is weaker than the dollar have actually much benefitted the French cosmetics industry, whose sales to this country boomed by 15% in value, reaching 1.1 billion euros. Russia’s economic difficulties and the collapse of its national currency had the reverse effect though, with a very significant drop of the balance of trade with this destination (-44%). In Asia, the situation is contrasted. Exports to China kept rising in 2015, with an 8% increase compared to 2014. But the slowdown is quite strong, as the rise had reached 16.5% in 2014, compared to 2013, and 17.5% in 2013, compared to 2012. As for sales to Hong Kong and Taiwan, they fell by 11.5% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to the previous year. Similarly, sales to South Korea and Japan declined by 8.2% and 6.8%, respectively. By contrast, French cosmetics imports from China, Japan, or South Korea increased a lot, even if the balance of trade with these countries remains much positive for France. Driven by the United Arab Emirates (+14%) and Saudi Arabia (+11%), the area of the Near East and Middle East showed a 12% growth in a year. Exports to the African continent rose by almost 3%, compared to 2014. Ultimately, Latin America took everyone by surprise. It returned to growth with a 3.7% increase for exports, for the whole 2015 year. As an example, despite the strong devaluation of the Brazilian currency and an economy in recession, French perfume and cosmetics exports to this country rose by 1.30%. Other countries in the area did even better, like Mexico (+12%) or Peru (+14.3%). “The good results of the cosmetics sector can be explained by the diversity and quality of French production, which represent major assets for companies operating in France, as they can adapt and meet very diverse consumer demands and market conditions,” concludes Patrick O’Quin, President of the FEBEA."
"The 2016 edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna welcomed about 250,000 visitors","""Cosmoprof is a trade show that is continuously growing: this year 250,000 visitors and 2,510 exhibitors (+ 5%) attended the show. Bologna lived extraordinary days: without presumption but with pride and satisfaction we can say that Cosmoprof is the largest Italian trade fair and the most important platform for the cosmetics industry, both in Italy and in the world, with editions in Las Vegas and Hong Kong,” said Duccio Campagnoli, President of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof.  “This year, we had to add 20,000 square meters of outdoor facilities.” Most of the show sectors recorded growth.  The Green sector, gathering companies offering natural and organic cosmetic products, increased by 22,15%.  The Hair and Furniture sectors grew up to 8.20%, while the Nail sector registered a 4% increase. Finally, the Extraordinary Gallery, the section that houses niche and high-end brands, has grown up to 39.09%. Eventually, Cosmopack, the section dedicated to the industrial supply chain (industrial equipment, packaging, contract manufacturers, sub-contractors, formulators, fillers) grew by 5.42% in 2016 and was attended by 21,900 professional visitors from the industry. The next edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna will take place on 16th-20th March 2017 (16th-19th March for Cosmopack and 17th-20th March 2017 for Cosmoprof) and will be the occasion to celebrate the show’s 50th anniversary."
"Hybrid lacquers and innovative removal techniques boost sales of professional nail care products, finds Kline","The global professional nail care market is currently driven by two key areas of innovation - the products themselves and their removal techniques, explains Kline in just-published report: Professional Nail Care: Global Market Brief.  In 2015, the market posted growth of almost 6%. The long-wear nail polish (also called hybrid or semin-permanent), which combines the benefits of gel and regular nail polish, appears as the biggest innovation since the introduction of gel-polish. The hybrid category posts a triple-digit increase in 2015, finds Kline’s report. “While this innovation is the key market driver, it is also leading to cannibalization of sales between product types, which causes several brands to suffer declines in sales for their nail polish product lines as loyal consumers shift to the use long-wear nail polishes,” comments Agnieszka Saintemarie, the report’s project manager. “These products particularly target nail polish users, while gel users only use it for a shorter period of time, wanting to take a break from gels.” In parallel to the success of hybrid lacquers, innovation regarding removal methods is becoming increasingly important due to growing concerns from consumers over the use of acetone or fillers, which can damage one’s nails.  “In response, brands extend their services by creating unique removal techniques, offering a wide variety of options from peel-off base coats to steamers, resulting in the removals experience witnessing most innovation in 2015,” explains Kline. Steamers that warm up acetone-based removal solutions to create steam, which helps remove gels and acrylics, have been one area of innovation. Some of the products available in the market include Steam Off from The Painted Nail and Gel II’s Steam Gel-Polish Removal System. Alessandro International creates its own nail clip. CND creates the Xpress5 Top Coat, which enables CND Shellac to come off in five minutes. A variety of the brands, such as Akzentz, Nubar, and Cuccio, have started offering foil wraps for the easy removal of soak-off gels and gel polishes. While booming in Western markets, hybrid nail polish and novel removal techniques are still in the early stages in the Asia-Pacific region, which is currently driven by nail art. For instance, in South Korea, filing continues to be the main removal method, and Bandi is the only local brand offering long-wear nail polishes."
South Korea’s exports of cosmetic products continue to soar,"Korean cosmetic products are still doing it pretty good around the world. Actually, South Korea’s beauty exports reached US$ 2.75 billion in 2015, an increase of 53.6 per cent over the previous year, according to statistics from the Korea International Trade Association (KITA).  The country’s cosmetics exports have enjoyed double-digit growth since 2010, surpassing the US$ 1 billion mark in 2013. This strong growth contrasts with Korea’s overall exports that dropped by 0.2 per cent in 2015 due to the lack of global demand.  Indeed, Korean cosmetic makers have been able to take advantage of the strong demand in the neighbouring Chinese market. Exports of South Korean cosmetics to China doubled in 2015, confirming the popularity of K-beauty in the country.  Sales to China reached US$ 1.09 billion in 2015, accounting for 39.5 per cent of South Korea’s exports of cosmetic products. “The influence of Korean beauty brands is such, that the ’Seoulista’ virus has stormed over all the Asian countries, especially China. This Korean beauty is truly staged,” explain the organisers of the MakeUp in Seoul tradeshow, which will be held on 6-7 April 2016. Korean beauty brands now stand right behind French brands in China, but rank before Japanese (3rd) and US (4th) brands. Innisfree, the budget cosmetics brand owned by South Korea’s beauty giant AmorePacific, is a good illustration of this success. It is now one of most popular Korean beauty brand in China.  It has now expanded its number of stores in China to 100, since opening for the first time in 2012. After China, Hong Kong is the second destination of Korean cosmetics exports. In 2015, Korean cosmetics exports soared to US$ 663 million, a growth of 64.4 per cent compared to 2014. However, the downside of the K-beauty boom is that another business is booming in China: counterfeits of Korean brands. Beyond Chinese markets, Korean brands are also expanding in the rest of the world, primarily in the USA.  In 2015, Korea’s exports of cosmetic products reached US$ 663 million, up 56.1 per cent compared to last year.  USA are now the 3rd destination for ‘made in Korea’ beauty products. Korean manufacturers are eager to quickly increase their global footprint by leveraging on their reputation of makers of quality and trendsetting products.  The AmorePacific Group (Laneige, Etude House, Innisfree, Sulwhasoo, etc.) has recently launched in the Middle East, starting in Dubai, with the aim to rapidly grow in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran.  The group also intends to launch some of its brands in Latin America. Similarly, Korean make up and skincare brand Toly Moly, which is already sold in Sephora’s stores in the US will soon be sold in the beauty chain’s stores in fifteen European countries. As far as Europe is concerned, while Korean cosmetics exports are still low they are growing quickly. In France alone, they rose by 140.3 per cent in 2015 to reach US$ 15 million."
"Iran: beauty, cosmetics, perfumes, and paradoxes","With a population of 80 million inhabitants, including 55% under 30, Iran is a growth-driving, dynamic market. The fact that international sanctions have been lifted and that the economic situation should therefore improve have made it even more attractive. But this country is not without its own paradoxes. For a thorough understanding of unknown Persia’s trends and lifestyles, the study The New Faces Of Iran - Fashion, Beauty & Paradoxes first describes the historical, geographical, cultural, and social pillars that define the Persian civilization. As a tremendous cultural and historical cradle, the country that became an Islamic Republic after the 1979 Revolution, mainly defines itself according to its ancient origins. “It is a Muslim country, but people consider themselves Persians and Iranians above all. It is essential to understand this subtlety,” Nilufar Khalessi explains. Despite an embargo that lasted for decades, the major cities of Iran have been experiencing much progress, driven by the dynamics of a 2.0, highly-connected, Western-oriented young generation. However, the choices made by these young people show they will not let foreign countries dictate their consumption habits, as they actually prefer national goods.  “Young Iranians deliberately have not completely assimilated the Western culture, although they do know and master its codes, since they have integrated them. And we would make a mistake if we tried to force them into a mould,” Nilufar Khalessi adds. As they are extremely educated – so is most of the population in large cities - Iranian women enjoy an important part in society. They are very present in institutions and play a crucial role, whether in the family or society. “The status of women is different from what can be observed in many Arab countries. Even the way they wear their veils is more lax, as it does not completely frame their faces and allows for much femininity to be seen,” Nilufar Khalessi explains. The study used portraits of women from Isfahan, Tehran, and Shiraz to shape the contours of a generation that has been playing with the paradox between their public lives, as they comply with the established Islamic laws, and their private lives, subverting these laws for more freedom, whether in terms of beauty or fashion. Women are deeply committed to this young generation’s active and creative development, in all artistic fields. “Iranian women hardly go out without makeup on, because the relationship with aesthetics is strongly developed,” Nilufar Khalessi affirms. Therefore, it is essential for them to beautify their eyes, eyebrows, lips, and hair. “In the city, the veil does not completely frame women’s faces. It is a real distinguishing feature: half the hair is uncovered, so women work a lot on it, often dying it blonde, and they are not keen on naturalness”. Facial care focuses on “zero defect” choices to fight against pollution-related problems, acne, or oily skins. In addition, the study highlights the very strong relationship with plastic surgery, in particular rhinoplasty. “They choose L’Oréal, Dior, Lancôme, and many other well-established brands for their daily consumption, although they also buy other products by interesting local brands to be studied,” Nilufar Khalessi concludes."
France: Sales of prestige perfumery negatively impacted in 2015 by Paris attacks,"Despite a difficult environment for retail sales in France, the selective perfumery channel maintained a turnover of 2.9 billion euros in 2015.  ""While in store sales of retailers’ private brands continue to grow, sales of selective products are decreasing by no more than 0.9% in value over the year, according to The NPD Group, despite the impact of terrorist attacks in January and at the end of the year (-1.9% in December),” said the French Federation of Selective Perfumery (FFPS). The decrease of prestige fragrance sales - fragrances account for almost two thirds of the French prestige market - at the end of the year slowed down the overall industry growth. Indeed, the makeup and skin care categories increased in 2015. According to the FFPS, the decline of perfume sales in 2015 (-1.6% in value) is explained largely by poor figures recorded in November and December, which are the most important months for this product category. The month of January 2015 was also particularly affected. However, sales of women’s and men’s fragrances did not react the same way in 2015.  On the one hand, women’s fragrances have collapsed with a decrease of 2.8%, in value. In this segment, only gift packs grew (+4 7%). On the other hand, sales of men’s fragrances remained almost stable (-0.6%). In contrast, sales of high-end niche fragrances by independent brands or of the private collections of the main selective brands continue to grow strongly. However, their small market share - which is estimated between 2 and 5% - does not allow this segment to substantially impact the trend. Less subject to seasonal variations, sales of skin care products recorded their best progression (+0.6%) over the last two years. Similarly, and despite a difficult month of December (-1.1%), makeup products recorded their best performance since 2013, with an increase of 0.4% in value, boosted by lipsticks that grew by 8.5%. ""Selective perfumery retail chains maintained their turnover in 2015. Retailers have adapted to the changing market by offering consumers a multichannel purchasing experience, by maintaining accessible prices encouraging loyalty. The market was recovering before the November attacks that led to a reduction in visits to the shops during the year’s last two months, which are the most important months of the year,"" said William G. Koeberlé, President of the FFPS."
US beauty consumers increasingly turn to technology during their shopping experience,"US consumers are increasingly becoming dependent on digital assistance in nearly all aspects of the beauty retailing experience.  According to Mintel, two in five (39 percent) consumers are interested in using, or have used, a store-provided tablet to research beauty products available.  What’s more, one third (36 per cent) agree that they would be interested in using in-store tablets or their own mobile device to pay for beauty products. “Smartphones and tablets are playing an increasingly pivotal role in the beauty retail experience. Brands should assume that their audience has a connected device at their fingertips at all times and should look to leverage behavioural research in order to better understand when and how consumers are using these devices,” says Diana Smith, Senior Research Analyst, Retail & Apparel at Mintel.  “The beauty category is ripe for an explosion of technology-driven innovation. A great example of this is connected stores which allow consumers to shop how they choose while giving them unique ways to try out products on their own before buying, regardless of a salesperson’s availability.” According to the market research firm, consumers are turning to technology as a cost-saving measure as well, with three in five (58 per cent) interested in mobile apps that provide beauty product offers to redeem in-store.  Coupon redemption is popular among beauty retail shoppers as nearly half (47 per cent) have redeemed coupons using their smartphone or tablet when purchasing products in-store or online. Further, 54 per cent of beauty retail shoppers are interested in apps that allow them to compare prices. The beauty market’s heaviest buyers, those who made 11 or more purchases in the 12 months ending October 2015, are the most likely to engage on social media with seven in 10 (69 per cent) saying they like to share their product experience on retailers’ social media channels, double that of consumers overall (35 per cent). What’s more, 71 per cent say social media posts encourage them to buy particular products. Mintel research reveals that the majority of beauty retail purchases are, in fact, planned with three in five (63 per cent) consumers buying items to replace/replenish products they regularly use. Planned experimentation with new beauty products is not uncommon as 30 per cent of consumers venture out with the intent of trying something new. However, spontaneity is also popular among beauty retail shoppers: half (52 per cent) are influenced to make a purchase that is most likely unplanned, with one in five (22 per cent) influenced by a sale or the opportunity to use a coupon. Another 14 per cent of beauty retail shoppers report unplanned purchases resulting from advertisements. “The beauty category’s heaviest purchasers not only turn to the internet and, more specifically social media, for inspiration, but they also are influential to others given their increased interest and knowledge of beauty items and brands. Brands should look to capitalize on these influential consumer advocates by giving them a voice and providing rewards for their endorsements. Taking into consideration the fact that many consumers plan their beauty purchases - whether to replace regularly used items or experiment with new ones - positive feedback from heavy users on social platforms could encourage potential buyers to move forward with a purchase,” concludes Smith."
Beauty Success welcomes their first steps in Africa,"Premium Beauty News - Beauty Success is the first global perfume brand to settle in West Africa. What made you decide to focus on this region for developing worldwide? Stéphanie Chalard - We seized the opportunity we got when we met CFAO, the distribution leader in Africa: they were opening new shopping malls and were looking for beauty franchises with French brands and middle-range, affordable products. It appeared like the perfect union of two types of expertise, that of CFAO, with their deep knowledge of the region and logistics on the ground, and ours, since we are experts in selective perfumery and franchises. Premium Beauty News - What was your strategy to enter this market? Stéphanie Chalard - We relied on a very deep analysis of the competition and consumer expectations, but also of our partner brands. As for competition, there are a few small institutes, but products are mainly available other ways than via dedicated infrastructures. That is why the market is very exposed to counterfeiting. We are really the first global brand with which consumers can be sure of the products’ origin. And this meets the expectations of the booming middle class: they seek affordable premium products and are mainly interested in makeup and perfume. Premium Beauty News - How did you adapt your offering? Stéphanie Chalard - These very strong expectations for masstige products encouraged us to highlight our private label, which is actually very successful. The segments the most represented are perfumery, makeup, and haircare, with a mix of French, international, and ethnic brands. Premium Beauty News - Can you already report on your results, even shortly after this opening? Stéphanie Chalard - The first results are very satisfactory and reassuring. The average buying basket amounted to over €60 last December. We first thought it was due to the impact of novelty and Christmas and New Year celebrations, but it kept rising in January. We have different types of customers, both expatriates and locals. And there is a new category of consumers now, with women that were not used to visiting perfume shops. The beauty salon also works very well, although there is only one treatment room for now. Premium Beauty News - What are your next plans? Stéphanie Chalard - Our partnership with CFAO will last 10 years, and we plan to open about twenty points of sale in a certain number of countries in West Africa. Our next project should be implemented at the end of the year. Premium Beauty News - What difficulties have you been facing? Stéphanie Chalard - Logistics are very complex, so CFAO’s help and expertise is essential to us. Training and sales techniques are also tough to deal with. Premium Beauty News - What are Abidjanese women’s favourite products? Stéphanie Chalard - Lancôme, Dior and Givenchy are very successful with their perfumes and makeup products, and so is our private label."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna: A 49th edition more global than ever,"With more than 2,500 exhibiting firms and 73% of them coming from outside Italy, the 49th edition of Cosmoprof promises to be more global than ever.  Furthermore, the show will host 25 international National Collectives, with South Africa, Australia, India, Morocco and Indonesia among the newcomers. “Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna goes from strength to strength and is becoming increasingly global. With the ground laid by a packed schedule of road shows introducing this world-leading format to the key international markets, each year Cosmoprof welcomes exhibitors from new countries, professional operators, researchers from the most experienced trend forecasting agencies and top buyers: a community which accompanies Cosmoprof not only to Bologna but also to the Las Vegas and Hong Kong editions,” explains Duccio Campagnoli, President of BolognaFiere, the organiser of the show.  “This growing internationalisation is one of Cosmoprof’s real strengths.” As far as visitors are concerned, the organisers expect the next edition will beat previous records, with a 19% increase in online pre-sales.  Visitors from 150 nations are expected to attend the show.  Last year the show welcomed about 248,000 visitors, including 79,000 from abroad. The organisers consider internationalisation as a vital ingredient of Cosmoprof, which is seen by cosmetics firms as a way to access both established and emerging players. The are therefore renewing the International Buyer Programme that will once again help set up B2B meetings between exhibiting companies and a selection of top international buyers. For the first time ever, the 49th edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna will also offer an exhibition area dedicated to domestic and international manufacturers and distributors of halal-certified products (which are “suitable” for Muslim consumers).  Located inside the Natural Cosmetics pavilion, this new zone is part of the Halal Beauty Care & Spa project, developed in partnership with the Italian halal certification body WHAD (World Halal Development). “With an annual growth rate of 12% worldwide (as high as 19% in GCC markets) and the number of potential consumers reaching one third of the world’s population, halal cosmetics are a rapidly rising trend,” explain the organisers of Cosmoprof. While halal cosmetics are most sought after by consumers in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, this trend also directly impacts international brands and manufacturers.  Indeed, 80% of the cosmetic products sold in Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), for instance, are actually made in Europe, primarily Italy and France. Furthermore, as these products place particular emphasis on “natural ingredients, the production process, fair trade and eco-sustainability, they are increasingly appreciated by non-Muslim consumers.” Among the exhibitors, Acumen International Trading will present Love Your Nails, a line of halal nail polishes, Cultivator Natural Products, which will present its line of hair dyes, Intercosmetica will showcase its numerous halal formulations, and Khadija Cosmetics, will introduce its halal makeup line. A total of fifteen companies will exhibit in this space."
Makeup and fragrances boost sales of prestige beauty products in the U.S.,"“The beauty industry has been growing at a rapid and consistent pace for the last few years, but what is happening below the surface, at the category level, is changing considerably,” said Karen Grant, Global Beauty Industry Analyst, The NPD Group. “For example, in 2015 we saw even more concretely how the roles of makeup and skincare are becoming intertwined. The immediate results of slimming, lifting, tone correcting, and radiance achieved by makeup face products is not only influencing consumers’ relationship with makeup, but also with that of skincare.” The prestige market outpaced the U.S. mass [2] channel,  where sales grew 2 per cent for total beauty in 2015, versus 2014, as per Nielsen. As in prestige the mass growth was driven by the makeup category, and both skincare and fragrance sales were down for this channel in 2015. “Consumers are shopping for and using makeup differently, which is a factor in softer sales of skincare products,” added Grant. “Looking at some of the top performing brands, we’re also seeing that consumers are increasingly drawn to emotional rather than functional appeal. This craving of a more sensory experience is having a positive influence on fragrance sales as well. Brands and manufacturers that win listen and find compelling ways to respond to the increasingly diverse crowd of consumers before them, who are being influenced and inspired by society in ever-changing ways.” The growth in prestige face makeup is accelerating, driven largely by concealer and other face products including primers and contour, highlighting, and sculpting kits - in line with the contouring and strobing trends which came to life in 2015. Eye brows continued to outperform the eye makeup segment, and lip colour saw the largest increases within the lip segment. For the first time, brown/nude lip colour shades surpassed pink or red as the leading colour. Within skincare, facial skincare growth slowed as age specialists and facial moisturizers experienced a drop in dollar sales, tying in with the blurring of lines between makeup and skincare. What is driving growth in skincare are smaller categories like masks, alternative formats such as oil, clay, and paper, as well as hair and sun products. Looking at fragrance, growth in juices outperformed the overall U.S. fragrance market in 2015, and home ancillaries such as candles have also performed well. “Economic and generational factors are influencing how consumers shop for, view, and prioritize the beauty categories. The consumer base has changed demographically, socially, and functionally. This new base of consumers has more options than ever before, and they look for brands and products to work for them, satisfy their needs, connect with them on a more personal level, and embrace their values,” said Grant."
The complex marketing of “probiotic” cosmetics,"The skin microbiota, this community of microorganisms that covers the human body, have multiple unexplored properties unexplored and a composition - so a genome - unique to each individual . Excessive hygiene or unsuitable care could weaken it. We can ""feed"" the skin microbiota using probiotics ( ""good"" live bacteria ) and prebiotics ( food for bacteria). If cosmetics companies shown interested for this for some time, there are many obstacles to face : as much in terms of wording as marketing. Indeed how to use living organisms in beauty creams, and ensure appropriate use. How to communicate on bacteria when the prevailing discourse pushes hygiene at its worst? AObiome has developed a product with living bacteria naturally present in our microbiome but which have disappeared due to an“over-developed” hygiene. AO-mist can be stored for four weeks at room temperature or in refrigerator 1 additional month, and is applied as a last layer onto the skin, after application of the daily beauty routine. Shampoo, body and face cleanser does not contain live bacteria, but are without preservatives to not attack the skin microbiome. Another solution is to use ""de-activated"" bacteria. But can we still talk about probiotics (which theoretically are ""live"" bacteria)?  That’s why brands talk about “probiotic tehcnology”. Aurelia Probiotic Skincare aims to help reduce inflammation to limit skin ageing. Glycoproteins from bifidobacterium, the probiotic used by the brand, helps repair, protect, monitor and support the skin cells by acting on the level of cytokines (inflammatory skin reactions responsible). All other ingredients used by the brand are natural and sourced responsibly and ethically or even organic. Aurelia Probiotic Skincare has a premium and scientific approach . According to Claire Vero, the founder, ""we have tried to educate the world of beauty, starting with journalists, bloggers and consumers. Probiotics are a new approach in cosmetics and we aim to have a clear and didactic approach.""  And it seems to work since Aurelia Probiotic Skincare keeps being quoted in magazines ( Elle, Vogue , Grazia , Glamour , etc.) or receiving industry awards (35 since launch).  ""Our brand is made known through the media but also through word -of-mouth because our consumers are very loyal.  They have made the switch to our purely natural yet scientific approach and are seeing the results in their skin."" Since launching in 2013, Aurelia Probiotic Skincare became the fastest growing beauty brand at Liberty and already has its own ""corner"". The brand is present in France at Oh My Cream, and wants to expand in Europe (Italy, Spain and the Netherlands in particular). Another brand, Gallinée, will be launched in early March 2016. Its creator, Marie Drago is a pharmacist and wrote his thesis research on the use of probiotics in cosmetics. Gallinée aims at taking care of the microbiome with a triple complex prebiotic, probiotic and lactic acid. Objective: To regain a healthy skin by stimulating its basic functions, reforming the acid mantle of the skin by removing natural irritations and aggressions and stimulating the microbiome. The range La Culture will offer five products (Face Cream, Cleansing Foam, Mask & Scrub, Body Lotion and Hand Cream). The ambition is to come out with a full range including hair products to take care of the entire skin microbiota.  ""The pH value of the skin is 5.5 on average, the idea is to find that balance with our complex pre-probiotics and lactic acid. The scalp is supposed to be an acid soil, and it is not anymore,"" says Marie Drago. The brand marketing tone is science-based and natural, and focused on well-being. Other brands use probiotics and claim it as his clinic with anti-redness range based on ""Lactobacillus helveticus"". Probiotics are still a sensitive issue . Brands and retailers are still cautious about it because it is not easy to hold pro-bacteria claims after attacking it for years. Some brands choose to direct their communications toward science, others towards natural. The consumers seek above all the results. On Aurelia Probiotic Skincare web site the most visited page are not ""scientific "" ones but clients’ testimonies."
Body contouring procedures drive growth of the cosmetic surgery industry globally,"Globally, body-contouring procedures saw the biggest increase in popularity in 2015, increasing by 13.5 per cent. This category includes a wide range of procedures such as facelifts, tummy tucks, buttock augmentation and liposuction. This was followed by energy devices (such as the use of lasers), which jumped by 9.3 per cent, and cosmeceuticals. Breast implants increased the least, seeing a 3.9 percent growth worldwide. Experts predict cosmetic procedures to increase steadily on a global basis at an average rate of 8.9 per cent until 2020, at which point the market, which was worth $6.89 billion in 2015, will be worth $10.49 billion. The USA, which accounted for 45 per cent of the market last year, remains the biggest nation for cosmetic surgeries, with Europe claiming 24 per cent of the market and Latin America 9 per cent. The biggest change will be in Asia, which is expected to see its cosmetic surgery industry grow the most, at an average annual rate of 13.8 per cent between now and 2020. In contrast, Europe, which accounted for 25 per cent of the global market in 2014, will see its share diminished to 21 per cent over the next four years."
A first perfumed edition for Tranoï,"""There were regularly alternative fragrance brands participating in Tranoï in order to meet buyers from the concept and sophisticated fashion stores visiting the tradeshow,"" says Wouter Wiels, creator of Les Rives de la Beauté and director of Tranoï Parfums. The relocation of a part of the show in a larger venue enabled Tranoï to offer a larger space to fragrance brands. Tranoï Parfums aims to create an introduction between the buyers visiting the fashion trade show and a selection of contemporary creative fragrance brands. “It seems obvious that many of the contemporary brands in high-end perfumery, as with the most exclusive stores in the world, only have to gain from finding new ways of connecting. Tranoï Parfums plans to enhance this opportunity and support the brands and buyers to maximize this potential and make it a sustainable reality,” adds Wouter Wiels Gathering almost forty niche fragrance brands, the Tranoï Parfums area was located in the very centre of the newly added venue of Tranoï Homme & Preview, just in front of the show entrance. “There is a real demand from the concept stores, from all these high-end outlets, which are visiting Tranoï and search for more exclusivity,” explains David Frossard, forerunner of the niche fragrance business with his own multi-brand agency Différentes Latitudes. ""Owners of fashion boutiques have understood that niche fragrance brands can generate a real revenue, provided that shop-assistants are well trained,"" he continues. Given the recent profusion of alternative perfumery brands and the limited space available within the show, the organizers of Tranoï Parfums created a selection committee composed of Martine and Armand Hadida, Marie-Françoise Stoulz, Director of the beauty department of Le Bon Marché, Lionel Paillès, journalist, Philippe Di Méo, designer, David Frossard, and Wouter Wiels. “Tranoï’s regular visitors do not necessarily know much about perfumery, so it is important to guide them by narrowing our selection to truly beautiful brands”, explains Wouter Wiels. According to David Frossard, the aim of the selection was to support brands having a true identity. ""This is a category where we often find beautiful products, but lacking a vision and brand identity. As far as I’m concerned, I prefer brands with a story, with their own universe and a true artistic visibility, in short, brands that know how to make themselves desirable."" And to give substance to this speech, Philippe Di Méo, set designer for the project, created an artistic installation of sensory discovery - the “Perfume Dressing Rooms” – using the iconic raw materials of perfume that link fashion and fragrance. A second edition is already scheduled next June before the event crosses the Atlantic and settles in New York"
Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo get bigger and increasingly international,"“Cosme Tech Cosme Tokyo is now an Asian event, not only a Japanese event,” says Hajime Suzuki, the show manager.  “As far as cosmetics are concerned, Japan is a very attractive market because of its size, but also because it is a real trendsetter in Asia.” Actually, the number of international exhibitors more than doubled compared to the previous edition. Numerous brands coming from other Asian countries, but also from Europe, Australia, the United States, Africa and the Middle East presented their products during the three-day exhibition. Among them, a high proportion of natural and organic cosmetic brands, a trend Premium Beauty News already pointed out at the previous edition.  “There’s a strong demand in Asia for natural products, and while they still need to be educated, consumers are increasingly aware, about what does that mean in terms of quality and about the importance of certification,” says Karen Kung of Naveen, a Taiwanese organic skincare brand certified by Soil Association. In the Cosme Tech part of the show, the section dedicated to packaging and ingredient suppliers, the number of international exhibitors was also on the rise while Asian operators remained, by far, the most numerous. “Japanese are much more curious and much more interested in international innovation than before,” explains Hajime Suzuki. Riding on this trend, the organizers say their aim is to double the size of the show by the next three years, and to gather a thousand exhibitors at the next edition in January 2017.  “We want our show to become the trendsetting centre for cosmetics in Asia,” states Hajime Suzuki. To ensure its growth, the tradeshow relies on exhibitors and visitors from South Asia’s dynamic markets - Thailand already had a large collective stand this year - but also on an increased participation of leading global cosmetics makers: Korea, Turkey, USA, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland. However, despite its attractiveness, the Japanese cosmetics market - as many others - remains a very difficult one, with specific codes and a high level of competition. “There are a plenty product categories and very high quality requirements.  As a consequence, ordered quantities are quite low,” explains Tony Zhang, Sales & Marketing Director Asia at HCT. The organizers have invested heavily to facilitate business relations.  ""We organised a briefing session for all international exhibitors on the eve of the opening on the particularities of the business in Japan,"" said Hajimi Suzuki. An online system to organise appointments before the show was also provided to exhibitors and visitors. ""It allowed us to contact agents and importers who interested us, and then to meet them at the show, it’s very effective,"" explains Thierry Recouvrot from French brand Plantes & Parfums de Provence. The next edition of Cosme Cosme Tokyo Tech will be held from 23 to 25 January 2017."
BASF identifies 2017 beauty colour trends,"Following extensive market research, BASF’s trend hunters have identified next year’s lifestyle trends and carefully grouped together colours to reflect them. “BASF’s 2017 Color Trends consists of four distinct beauty profiles, each based on cultural drivers in the global marketplace,” said Valérie Pian-Parison, Marketing Manager at the Personal Care business of BASF. “We have been keeping a close eye on both regional and global developments as well as the latest fashion shows in order to help our customers create products and brand experiences that really resonate with consumers.” The Smart and Seamless colour collection appeals to people who rely on technology that integrates seamlessly into their everyday life, and long for beauty products just as smart.

Male grooming trend boosts global hair care sales,"Market research by Technavio has predicted that the global hair care market will grow at an annual rate of 3 per cent (Compound Annual Growth Rate) between now and 2019 to exceed USD 91 billion. [1] The trend for male grooming and the growing number of fashion-conscious consumers were cited as the principal reasons behind the growth, with the aging populations of developed nations such as the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, China, and Japan also boosting the sales of hair products. The Americas were the largest revenue contributor during 2014 with a market share of around 37 per cent. The US is the largest market in this region with a revenue share of around 15 per cent.  Its aging population contributed to the growth of this region as a result of the early adoption of hair colours and dyes. Shampoos accounted for 34 per cent of the market share during 2014, the research found, and is expected to reach a market value of around USD 28 billion by 2019.  Technavio predicts that emerging markets - Brazil, China and India - will be the fastest-growing regions in the shampoo segment. As far as shaving lotions and creams are concerned, the growth of the global market is even more impressive as Technavio predicts sales to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of around 7 per cent between 2016 and 2019 to surpass USD 8 billion by 2020. [2]  The fact that men are becoming more fashion conscious and increasing willing to try new and innovative products is key growth factor for the market. Europe dominates the global market for shaving lotions and creams, with a market share of around 38 per cent.  And, with 62 per cent of the overall market share, pre-shave products (shaving lotions, creams, gels and soaps) represent the main segment by product categories. Male grooming has undergone something of a revival across the beauty industry over the last few years, with hair care and skincare the main focus. Over the course of 2015, several high-profile products were unveiled for men, including Clinique’s Sonic System Deep Cleansing Brush and brewery Carlsberg’s shampoo, conditioner and body lotion trio."
The Korean beauty trends set to dominate in 2016,"Cushion foundation, which comprises a spongy formula that is applied to the face with a pillow to provide easy and flawless coverage, isn’t going anywhere for now. The added bonus of integrated SPF protection, wrinkle prevention and antibacterial properties mean that this budding trend is sure to take over next year. French beauty brand Lancôme is leading the way and has carried its successful Miracle Cushion formula over to its Spring 2016 collection, playing on the Korean penchant for cult packaging by adding some sweet pastel cover art to its compact. Contouring has undergone many a transformation since first appearing on our radar some years ago. 2015 saw the birth of ’clown contouring’ and ’strobing’, but 2016 will be all about doing it the Korean way. The ideal face shape for many Korean women is a soft oval with a dainty chin, known as the ’V-line’, and the look can be achieved by highlighting the center of the face, using concealer under the eyes and shimmery tints down the cupid’s brow, the bridge of the nose and the chin, before shading the perimeter of the face to make it appear smaller. Check out beauty vlogger Luvableviet’s tutorial for more information. As beauty fans become aware of increasingly limited water resources, many brands are experimenting with alternatives. Water-free skin care lines first came to our attention thanks to Korean brand Whamisa, whose collection relies on essential oils and plant extracts to hydrate the skin. Market research group Mintel recently predicted that water-free cosmetics will explode over the next decade, so watch this space."
Five wacky beauty trends that went viral in 2015,"""Bubble nails"" or ""hump nails"" had already been around for a while, but they had an online revival over the summer. The look involves sculpting acrylic gel onto the nail to create a dome shape which is then filed down to create a short, square and very arched shape, and it divided the opinion of nail lovers everywhere. This led swiftly to the trend for ""aquarium nails"" - a painstakingly time-consuming concept whereby two false nails are filled with oil and glitter to create a ’snow globe’ effect for the fingers. The trend for Brony hair came from an unexpected place - 1980s TV show ""My Little Pony"". Led by celebrities including Katy Perry, Kelly Osborne and Georgia May Jagger, the look, which involves dyeing the hair the pastel and candy-coloured hues of the famous toy ponies, hit Instagram during the summer. Brony hair could be as simple as taking on a mint or violet all-over colour, or could be mixed up by using several different shades at the same time. Although the words ""clown contouring"" might sound like a joke, it isa pretty effective makeup technique. Beauty blogger BellaDeLune kickstarted the trend when she posted a video to YouTube showing how an extreme-looking theatrical clown base of makeup could be blended into a subtly contoured look.  Beauty lovers everywhere pounced on the idea and women all over the world are now testing it out and showing off the results on Instagram. When supermodel Kendall Jenner lay down on a hotel carpet and arranged her hair into heart shapes, she probably didn’t realize that her photo, which became the most liked picture on Instagram, would set off a craze for heart halos. But the cute snap struck a chord with hair and beauty lovers everywhere and before long, sentimental Instagrammers were delicately arranging their tendrils into romantic compositions and #hearthair was trending. The springtime trend for technicolor underarms was brought into the spotlight by pop singer Miley Cyrus, who posted a picture to her Instagram account showing her wearing a white crop top accessorized with some daring bright pink body fuzz. This led to a flurry of publicity and lots of beauty tutorials about how to set about jazzing up your pits, with popular colours including blues, pinks and purples."
Multi-masking drives growth in prestige skincare,"The Instagram and social media craze for multi-masking - the fact to use multiple masks simultaneously on different zones of the face - is stimulating a huge growth in the face mask market.  While skincare masks account for just 1.6% of the total women’s skincare market in the UK, the category reported double-digit growth in the YTD October 2015 where it increased by 22.8% vs. the same period last year to reach a total value of 6 million pounds (8.22 million euros), according to The NPD Group. Multi-masking mania -  The mask market has witnessed steady growth over the past three years which accelerated in 2015 due to the popularity of multi-masking. In the UK, the market has increased from £3,890,385 in YTD 2012 to £5,977,414 in YTD October 2015.  According to The NPD Group, growth has come from new launches and an increase in unit sales which rose to 187k unit sales in the YTD October 2015, rising 22.3% on the same period last year. “Masks have been growing in popularity over the last three years, but the Instagram craze for multi-masking stimulated huge growth in the market. Customers began experimenting with two or three masks at one time and this trend really took hold in the UK. Emerging early in 2015, it has become the ‘must-try’ skincare trend of the year, it was pioneered by beauty bloggers and Instagram influencers who demonstrated the trend, sharing their pictures online. This frenzy of online activity saw consumers spending more on masks so they can experiment with this innovative method of treating the skin at home,” explains June Jensen, Director U.K. Beauty for The NPD Group. According to The NPD Group, skincare remains a vital sector within the prestige beauty market. The total value of women’s skincare market represents about 24% of the total British prestige beauty market. Specialist products like masks and cleansers are key to sustain the growth of the market. “The recent growth in the mask market, fuelled by the trend for multi-masking is important in a number of ways. Firstly it’s boosting the prestige skincare market by increasing sales, whilst ensuring that customers are exploring new products and experimenting with new lines in different ways. It also demonstrates the role that beauty bloggers and Instagram influencers have on the sales of beauty products,” concludes Jensen."
"The ""MakeUp in"" concept is expanding across the Atlantic","Premium Beauty News - Success was the one expected at MakeUp in Sao Paulo! Sandra Maguarian - Yes another successful event! And you will agree that the task was not an easy one considering the current situation in Brazil. With a deflating economy and a deleterious political climate, MakeUp in Sao Paulo welcomed in two days more than 1,200 visitors! And all the exhibitors were delighted, because in spite of the situation, Brazilian and South American women in general use more beauty products. This market is holding up well and is even more resilient than expected given the general crisis in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - As for the United States, 2016 is shaping up as a very busy year in terms of Beauty BtoB events, with the launch of two new tradeshows.  What do you think of what some call this ""overflow"" of trade shows? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Sandra and I are not really adepts of waffling. All these competitors do not deliver, in our view, a new concept in New York. With an interval of four months between them, the same year, what difference do you see between PCD and Luxe Pack New York in terms of positioning? In a one-month interval, what difference do you see between Cosmoprof/Cosmopack in New York and Cosmoprof/Cosmopack Las Vegas? Anyway, we have never compared ourselves to others. We really have very few exhibitors in common who made the distinction between both a long time ago, and, above all, very few visitors in common... Our core target remains Marketing and R&D teams. Premium Beauty News - Regarding MakeUp in New York, you chose another venue. Brooklyn is quite challenging! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Yes and it’s a winning challenge! Getting to Grand Prospect Hall is very easy. Probably easier than to get to other places in East of South Manhattan. We made the experiment several times. There is a direct subway line that connects in 35 minutes Upper Manhattan to Prospect Avenue station, which is a few steps away (150 meters) from the venue we chose. Grand Prospect Hall is a beautiful, warm and friendly place with a garden and 250 free parking spaces. In addition, we will organize free shuttles, every half hour, from Central Park and Penn Station (for visitors coming from New Jersey). By telling the taxi driver to drive along the East River or Hudson River, it takes only 35 minutes with no traffic jams or traffic lights, to get to Grand Prospect Hall from downtown Manhattan. This is probably the reason why a lot of people working in marketing and development teams of major brands located in Manhattan, live in Brooklyn! And it is much easier to go from Kennedy Airport (where a lot of our visitors land!) to Brooklyn. We have already sold more than 70% of the show floor dedicated to exhibitors. All our loyal exhibitors are following us! And some ""key"" visitors even confirm: ""Go Brooklyn!"" Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Action in Los Angeles? Yet another challenge to take up! Sandra Maguarian - It’s great and original! Everyone is so exited! Registrations for Conferences and Workshops are doing very well. The twenty five exclusive stand locations planned for a few number of suppliers were distributed in only ten days! Just have a look at the list of speakers taking part to the various round tables to convince yourself that we are supported by the biggest brands in the region.  Chanel Parfums et Beauté also wanted to partner. Premium Beauty News - Too many shows spoil the shows! What is your opinion? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Competition is very healthy when it takes place in a fair manner. It makes things move in the right direction. But ultimately, it is up to exhibitors and visitors to make their choice. They are the final arbiter. We visit our exhibitors often and we listen to our visitors. They know it.  And our unique positioning attracts both of them."
The 2016 edition of Cosme Tech & Cosme Tokyo is set to break new records,"Cosme Tokyo, dedicated to finished products, and Cosme Tech, dedicated to the suppliers of cosmetic brands, which will open their doors on 20-22 January 2016 in Tokyo, are continuing their expansion to become “the largest comprehensive cosmetics exhibition” in Japan,” according to the organisers. Cosme Tech & Cosme Tokyo is expected to gather 700 exhibitors from 50 countries, a growth by 30 per cent compared to the 2014 edition [1]. “One of the reasons of the powerful growth is an increasing number of international exhibitors, especially at Cosme Tokyo 2016. International Area is doubling its scale, gathering more exhibitors not only from Asia, Europe and America but also from Middle East and Africa,” said the organisers. Of course, another attraction of the event is the Japanese market itself. Indeed, with consumers constantly striving for perfection and manufacturers and brands constantly reinventing and renewing their portfolio of skincare and make-up products, Japan and Korea have become key references for cosmetics brands in Europe and North America. Cosme Tokyo, the section dedicated to finished products, gathers a remarkable lineup of Japanese cosmetic brands, most of which are difficult to find at any other exhibitions in the world, in particular those belonging to small and medium size companies. Izavell Co., for instance, will showcase a whitening cream using a sake-derived ingredient sourced from a long-established brewery in Kyoto.  For its part, C-Tec Co. will launch a water, alcohol and perfume-free serum based on ascorbic acid and a fermented rice extract.  The surprising long fibre mascara by D-Up Corp. is another example, the more mascara is applied the longer eyelashes are, and it can be removed easily with fingertips and warm water. The next edition of Cosmo Tech & Cosme Cosme Tokyo should also confirm the dynamism of the natural and organic cosmetics segment in Japan.  While more and more Japanese brands, such as Tree Of Life, Jujubody or Raco Ginza, offer these products, this area is still dominated by international brands and suppliers."
Four beauty trends set to impact global markets by 2025,"In a future where the line between human and technological device blurs, water becomes a protected resource, energy concerns ring true and natural ingredients take centre stage, beauty brands must innovate to stay relevant. Augmented human The line between human and technological device is blurring as smart technology puts people in greater control of their individual health and beauty needs. “As consumers become increasingly familiar with using technology to track their health and well-being, they are looking for beauty brands to offer products and devices that boast similar functionality. New product development in augmented reality is providing the next step in virtual mirrors and real-time visualisation of the effects of beauty products on the skin and hair,” said Vivienne Rudd, Director of Insight, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. Water: the new luxury Water is set to become a precious commodity as consumption outstrips supply. According to Mintel, the more consumers become aware of this, the more beauty brands will need to change how they manufacture and formulate products to limit their dependence on water.  In this area, as for many other environmental issues, consumers are changing their habits and expect companies to do the same. Already, we are seeing the rise of water-saving beauty solutions such as wipes, dry shampoos, nonrinse body washes, and alternative toothpaste formats. But the next generation of products will work without any water at all. Power play Consumers are facing an energy crisis as the pace of modern life catches up with them. Aware of consumers’ need to make long-term lifestyle changes to address falling energy levels, beauty brands are delivering products that put energy claims at the forefront of their message.  This may include partnerships with producers of food and beverages. Gastronomia The saying goes, ‘it’s what’s on the inside that counts’. Interest in natural ingredients is on the rise as more people dare to push up their sleeves and get involved in the process of creating beauty products. “Traditional beauty and personal care remedies are moving into the mainstream as more and more consumers start to ‘cook up’ their own versions. Brands will need to shift their focus to highlight artisanal processes while also making it easier for consumers to make products at home. Looking at the decade ahead, we’ll see brands borrow inspiration from the meal kits developed by food companies, propelling the subscription beauty box model to the next level,” Vivienne concluded."
United Kingdom: A dynamic cosmetic market torn between promotions and innovations,"The UK market is depicted as dynamic and creative. Its distribution structure is quite different from the rest of Europe. With the dominance of Boots, which holds more than 2,500 drugstores, the competition on price is fierce with a market boosted by promotions. However, ""there are always opportunities to be seized. Consumers are curious and like novelties,"" explains Karine Tiano, Agent for cosmetic brands in the UK. ""The Anglo-Saxon culture, prompt to change, always open up an opportunity for a new brand. The retailers indeed play on novelty, on pionnering new products to bring in less famous brands."" Beyond drugstores (Boots, Superdrug), there are of course the department stores, specialty stores, many concept stores and independent stores, e-shopping sites and teleshopping.  Fashion retailers are also taking a growing space in the market by combining cosmetics with the outfits and stimulating impulse buying. TopShop launched its cosmetic brand in 2010, including more than 69 shades of nail polish in 2011. Today the brand has partnered with BeautyMart, which created a real beauty shop in its flagship store at Oxford Circus. Launched in 2012 BeautyMart is present in store and online with an exclusive selection of iconic brands. ""The concept stores like The GoodHood store, BlueBird, Alex Eagle, or The Conran Shop, are also getting into beauty, to offer these products which are part of our lifestyle,"" says Karine Tiano. ""But for a brand, it is best to be among specialists and classic distribution like Space NK or Selfridges, or online with Net-a-Porter, feelunique, lookfantastic or CultBeauty"". Indeed, the English are the first online buyers in Europe. This distribution channel should not be overlooked. Another important distribution channel is teleshopping. The QVC channel, which is present in the UK for over 20 years, is the market leader. Consumers love new products , so they are not very faithful, and the price is the first factor in the purchase decision. Kiko has managed its presence in the UK with a price level in line with the market and well-chosen locations. The masstige seems however little appeal to British consumers, as demonstrated by the failure of Sephora few years ago. Consumers either buy in department stores or with specialists for luxury brands or from Boots or Superdrug for mass products."
More than 1/3 of Chinese online shoppers now buying cross-border,"On behalf of PayPal, Ipsos interviewed in 29 countries [1] a representative quota sample of adults (aged 18 or over) who own and/or use an internet enabled device.  The research [2] investigated the online and cross-border shopping habits of consumers. The report confirms that China’s consumer class is massively entering the global online ecommerce market.  About 35 percent of Chinese online shoppers claim to have shopped cross-border in 2015, vs. 26 percent in 2014, while China’s overall online shopping population saw modest growth (81 percent of online adults report having shopped online in the last 12 months in 2015, vs. 80 percent in 2014). A full 25 percent of online shoppers said they from US-based websites in the last 12 months. The next most popular countries are China (19 percent of online shoppers have purchased from Chinese sites) and the UK (14 percent). However, American shoppers infrequently shop beyond their own borders. While among all respondents surveyed around the world, 50 percent of online shoppers report making purchases from a website in another country in the last 12 months, only 22 percent of American online shoppers have done so. Of the 29 countries surveyed only Japan has a lower volume of cross-border shoppers, at 12 percent. On the contrary, Ireland, Austria and Israel are the most active cross-border shoppers with 86 percent, 85 percent and 79 percent respectively of online shoppers having made a cross-border purchase in the past 12 months. Cost is a consideration that both motivates and deters global purchases in 2015. Nearly three quarters (73 percent) of all cross-border shoppers surveyed cite better prices as the reason to make purchases cross-border rather than domestically, followed by notions of access to items not available in their own country (selected by 67 percent of cross-border shoppers) and discovering new and interesting products (58 percent). Shipping cost is of paramount importance to cross-border shoppers. Almost half (47 percent) of online shoppers say that delivery costs deter them from making international purchases (or making them more often). At the same time half of all online shoppers say that free shipping would make them more likely to buy from a website in another country. Shipping cost is the top reason for abandoning an online purchase from a website in another country, cited by 43 percent of online shoppers who have abandoned a cross-border purchase. In most regions, clothing and apparel is the most popular category for cross-border purchases. Travel & transportation, and Consumer Electronics, as well as Entertainment & Education usually rank 2nd or 3rd.  Asia-Pacific is the region that stands out for its high interest in cosmetics and beauty products that are purchased across the borders by placing this category in second place. Source: PayPal"
"Young generations are recalibrating fragrance consumption, finds Symrise","Digital natives include Millennials (Generation Y, 19-36 year olds) and Generation Z (kids under 18 years old), they have grown up with the internet, social media and smart devices.  According to several studies, their socializing, education, information gleaning and shopping behaviour differ considerably from that of earlier generations. In order to better understand their relationship with fragrances, Symrise initiated a primary consumer research on digital natives in four US cities - Atlanta, Los Angeles, Freehold NJ and Yorktown NY. The consumers were introduced to several visualized lifestyle concepts, preferences of the concepts and olfactive associations were determined. The results of this study led to the creation of five future trend concepts, with olfactive pairings, thus helping Symrise and its customers to understand and successfully address this generation. “Leading this important initiative was exciting. We explored the young consumers’ preferences across a spectrum of categories. They are a fragrance-savvy, fun, yet responsible generation, interacting with each other in ways, much different from the other generations. We are excited to share the process, findings and fragrances from this platform with our clients,” says Doreen Bucher, Vice President, Marketing, Fine Fragrance & Specialty Bath, North America. “Thanks to technology, young consumers are recalibrating various dimensions of fragrance consumption – purchase behaviour, moments of use, fragrance preferences and commitment to sustainability. Symrise strives to continually understand the consumption behaviour of this important demographic segment,” concludes Usha Vijay, Vice President, Marketing, Symrise, North America."
The intimacy of beauty routines around the world unveiled,"A study conducted by RealityMine compares the settings in which personal grooming sessions take place in different international locations. The market research firm used eDiary data of 4,054 panellists from the US, Australia, France, Mexico and Russia. Globally, people are most likely to engage in personal care routines at 7AM and 9:30PM (Figure 1). However, in France and Australia the morning peak is a bit later, at 8AM. Each country also has smaller peaks during the day. Interestingly, in Mexico, the amount of people grooming stays relatively high throughout the day. During the same half hour as personal grooming, relaxing, having a meal and doing household chores are fairly common in every country. Relaxing is specifically popular during the evening routines, while having a meal – in this case breakfast – is common during the morning. The French are also likely to engage in hobbies (32%), and in the afternoon, the link between hobbies and personal grooming is specifically strong. Meanwhile, in Russia, drinking is the most common activity, as well as doing household chores, during the same half hour as beauty sessions. People worldwide are most likely to be on their own (80%) during their daily beauty routines. Although Russians are more likely to be with their partner (75%), children (64%) or pets (40%), than on their own. The company of a partner and/or child is not uncommon among other countries either, but it’s clearly less significant than it is in Russia. Looking at other countries, Mexicans are distinctly more likely to be in company of siblings or other family (28%) - this may be due to the family-oriented culture where gathering for breakfast and in the evening for dinner is common. According to RealityMine, mainly positive or neutral emotions are experienced while people of all nations are grooming. However, tiredness is also widely reported, especially during the evening routines (37%). Nearly half of Australians reported feeling tired while they were grooming, however, they also reported happiness (63%) more than other countries. Interestingly, Mexicans feel distinctly more confident (42%) than the panellists from other countries. “When comparing the data behind the half hour before a personal grooming session and the half hour when grooming actually happens, we can find an increase in positive emotions such as happiness and confidence in every country when beauty session takes place. Although evening beauty routines are often carried out when panellists report feeling tired,” highlights RealityMine. In the same half hour as personal grooming, TV (45%) and mobile (44%) are the most consumed media channels. Australians and French panellists are the least likely to consume digital media, while printed media is slightly more common among them than other countries. While only 26% of French panellist used mobile during their personal care sessions, the usage among Mexicans was twice as high (53%). After TV, mobile and computer, radio is the next most popular media channel, with 21% tuning in during personal beauty sessions. Morning is the time of day when people around the world are most likely to tune in to radio while getting ready for the day."
"Mascara: A successful, slow evolution in Brazil","In Brazil, 32% of women regularly wear makeup, and mascara is an essential: with 38%, it dominates the eye segment (source: ABHIPEC). Albéa has been working on it with local and international brands present on the Brazilian market: they have developed a specific approach combining the formula, the packaging, and the applicator. And to best meet local expectations, the group felt the need to learn about these consumers’ profiles, their purchase and use habits, and the makeup effect they wish to obtain. “Thanks to our Albéa Tips Studio platform, which invents, develops, and produces all types of makeup applicators, every year, the Albéa Group designs about twenty applicators on the global scale. They can be fiber or plastic mascara brushes, brushes for the eyebrows, lipgloss or eyeliner applicators, etc. This study will help us quickly develop innovations specifically adapted to the Brazilian market”, Anne Rutigliano and Pauline Uhlen explain. In Brazil, the mascara offering is still quite limited, as can be seen with the number of brands, the number of references per brand, and the range of brushes or formulas. Brazilian women are more faithful to their brands than European women. However, they do declare they are interested in easy-to-use innovations designed for an efficient makeup result. The study made it possible to watch videos of 50 women and analyze their gestures and the application. Volume and length are their main expectations. Although they are used to the traditional shape of fiber brushes, which currently dominate the market, the women surveyed state they would actually welcome plastic brushes for their differentiating effect. The specificities related to the hot and humid climate, in particular the wide use of waterproof formulas, must also be taken into account to develop adapted packaging. Another specificity of the Brazilian market is that it has been traditionally supplied by direct-selling networks. As a consequence, word-of-mouth and tips on social networks are key factors to advise, reassure consumers, and make them purchase a product. Therefore, efficacy is essential, as it helps brands develop both a customer base and their loyalty. “The first mascara solutions adapted to the Brazilian market will be showcased at the next FCE show in May 2016”, Anne Rutigliano and Pauline Uhlen announce."
Tradeshows: Smaller and more targeted events appeal to the perfume and cosmetics industry,"Putting an end, after 13 years, to the Beyond Beauty Paris tradeshow, Informa has decided to split it into two different events:  the first one, Alternative Fragrance & Beauty, will be dedicated to emerging cosmetics and perfume brands and will take place on 16-18 June 2016 at the Carreau du Temple in central Paris, the second one, Beauty Factory, will be dedicated to suppliers, and will open its doors on September 13th to 14th 2016 at Palais des Congrès Paris. “Much more than just a fair, Alternative Fragrance & Beauty will break the rules of traditional events and will host around a hundred participants carefully selected in an unusual and unique setting that was designed by the agency Centdegrés,” claim the organisers. The first two days of Alternative Fragrance & Beauty will be dedicated to business meetings and to exchanges between brands, distributers, and international buyers (department stores, e-shop, concept stores, selective distribution and assisted sales, independent perfumeries, niche perfumeries, pharmacies, health and beauty stores, drugstores, alternative networks, travel retail, spas, hotel groups, boutique hotels), looking for something unusual. The last day will be open to the public: the exhibiting brands will be able to sell their products on site and to test their potential, but, more than anything, they will have the opportunity to establish a direct link with their customers and to forge an intimacy with the brand. Similarly, Tranoï, the event that has been revealing young fashion designers for 15 years, is seizing the opportunity of its move to a larger venue at the Cité de la Mode et du Design, in the East of Paris, to complete its offering with an area dedicated to perfumery and lifestyle, thus meeting buyers’ expectations. “The demand comes from the show’s customers, stores, and concept stores, who have been asking for more perfumes in their shops,” explains David Frossard, founder of Différentes Latitudes and partner of the project. About 40 brands selected by a committee composed of Martine and Armand Hadida, Marie-Françoise Stoulz, Director of the beauty department of Le Bon Marché, Lionel Paillès, journalist, Philippe Di Méo, designer, David Frossard, and Wouter Wiels, creator of the event Les Rives de la Beauté, are expected to take seats on 23-25 January 2016 in a central area designed and set up by Philippe Di Méo. It still remains - before January - to convince the brands that will need to meet the requirements of our selection. “Tranoï’s visitors do not necessarily know much about perfumery, so it is important to guide them by narrowing our selection to truly beautiful brands”, adds Wouter Wiels. “The transversality of the two worlds, the good image of Tranoï, and the experience of the Hadida family, who also own the L’Éclaireur concept store, represent a good starting point,” he concludes. Actually, these launches confirm the success of smaller fairs, less expensive for exhibitors, more practical and easier to access for visitors.  As far as the supply-side is concerned, tradeshows such as MakeUp in Paris, then declined in New York, Seoul and Sao Paulo, or such as PCD, for packaging, and Cosmetagora, for cosmetic ingredients, have pioneered the model.  The launch of Beauty Factory in 2016 and the launch of Cosmetic 360, this year, confirm this deep trend. Regarding finished products, the most convincing models were the Exscence and Pitti Fragranze events, both located in Italy and dedicated to rare perfumery, or Elements in New York, which recently partnered with Capsule."
Lipsticks and face make-up boost the prestige cosmetics market in France,"Being key elements for a successful ""photo ready"" looks, lipsticks and face make-up products are the two main drivers for the growth of makeup sales in France. Sales of lipsticks over January to August 2015 grew by 11% in the selective channel. Annual lipstick sales represent a total of 70 million euros and the segment is driven by innovation. Actually, the launches of the last twelve months (Chanel Rouge Coco Baume Rouge Dior, Lancôme in Love Shine Love, for example) account for 18% of all sales, up by 33% compared to 2014. However, existing lines also performed very well with a growth of +7%. The two lipsticks to the most that topped the sales from January to August 2015 are Rouge Coco Chanel (shade 444 Gabrielle) and Rouge Dior (shade 999 Rouge Ara). ""While 2014 was marked by the success of gloss, lipsticks are making a comeback in 2015 with products combining colour and treatment, providing anti-aging, soothing or colour fixative effects. Classic shades remain demanded,"" highlights Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at NPD Group. With an increase of 2% from January to August 2015, foundations and other face make-up products are the second key drivers of the prestige beauty growth in France.  Two segments are boosting the sales complexion products: foundations, which represent a market of almost 102 million euros per year, recorded a growth of 4%, while, concealers, illuminators and contouring, grew by 5% compared to 2014, to reach more than 11 million euros per year. According to NPD, the selfie craze and the importance of images on social networks greatly impact makeup application methods as well as product choices. Highlighters / illuminators, and other products face make-up products are experiencing a revival, thanks to the popularity of application techniques such as contouring or strobing (maily based on the use of illuminators) that promise a flawless complexion, that are advocated by beauty vloggers and other online tutorials. Similarly, the claims ""HD Photo"" or ""Studio"" are more and more common for complexion products. ""What is interesting in the current narcissistic trend is that it allows the prestige beauty market to recover through the promise of a professional-class makeup for everyone. Conventional makeup products are thus being revisited for a perfectly photogenic application and final result,"" concludes Matilda Lion."
Alternative perfumery: where are we up to in France?,"Premium Beauty News - Contrary to other European countries like Italy, Germany, or England, is alternative perfumery experiencing difficulties finding its own place in France? How are things going to evolve? David Frossard - Fifteen years ago, only few fragrance lovers were interested in this type of perfumes. Today, the alternative perfumery concept has been integrated. It has become accessible, and the sector has developed its customer base, even if France is less open – historically and culturally – to pioneers in this field. So yes, the future can be promising, provided the concept is clearly defined and structural issues are settled. Johann Vitrey - Its future is controlled. As the cradle of perfumery and of the major selective brands, which belong to groups that also own distribution networks, France does not leave much room for artistic and niche perfumery: by definition, it is the property of small houses and – often independent – artists. It is tricky to find one’s own place in a saturated country. François Hénin - Alternative perfumery has reached an interesting step, a phase of maturity, so it will need to express itself differently. The concept is actually getting a bit outdated, but some brands are thinking about further asserting their identity through the packaging or communication. The future will mostly be secured by retail and its development: this is the great revolution expected to make up for the lack of distribution of rare perfumes in our country. Premium Beauty News - How can this distribution be “revolutionized”? François Hénin - Revolution might be triggered by the main operators, because it needs people willing to invest in the long term. And it is also, or actually mostly about remapping perfume shops in France. Jovoy, Ombres Portées, Sens Unique… there are initiatives: they are meant to try and get out of the Parisian circle to penetrate deeper into the country. David Frossard -  This perfumery branch has no proper distribution network, only a few independent players, department stores, concept stores… it is very heterogeneous. The challenge will be to define in which channel this perfumery can work and develop. Things are already changing. Concepts such as Liquides, my perfume bar, attract department stores because they offer an exclusive shopping experience, and advice is given by real perfume specialists. There is growing interest from major distributors: for example, Sephora has selected a few alternative perfumery brands like Juliette Has A Gun [NB: Sephora has just opened a 3.0 store to highlight niche perfumes as well, with a broad collection of testers], Le Bon Marché has dedicated its perfumery department exclusively to this sector, the Printemps department store has devoted a large area to it, and Galeries Lafayette are going back to it with brands like Atelier Cologne or Ex Nihilo. Johann Vitrey - Absolutely. LVMH has adopted this idea of going back to the truth with its Small Is Beautiful store in St-Germain-en-Laye, in the west of Paris. The concept is definitely focused on customers, reception and service, and on a sophisticated product presentation. This very concept is a model, an example to be followed. It is a revolution I am ready to draw inspiration from. Another solution could be to open franchise stores in order to set up a direct network of several points of sale with its own trading group. Many have been thinking about it for a long time, and a few players did it, although it requires heavy investment for an uncertain return. There is also the idea of developing one’s own network of wholly-owned stores, and I encourage brands to consider it. Not all of them, obviously, but those whose range is broad enough, and which have extension projects, and the potential to do it. It is a heavy investment, but it is exactly what French customers want: enter into a different world, a brand, and appropriate it. Premium Beauty News - Other than distribution, which difficulties is alternative perfumery experiencing right now in our country?  Johann Vitrey - Today, nobody can come to an agreement on the definition of the segment itself, and this is the first difficulty. It is hard to find one’s own place when the industry is not clearly defined itself. What is rare perfumery? Which brands can be considered to be part of it, and which brands should be excluded? Then, there is the size of the companies behind these brands. Beyond their creation skills, these people are usually not trained to regulations, export, or legislation. There is a lack of organization and professionalization. So, with Paris Parfums Rares, we are trying to provide solutions, and others are doing the same, for example through labels such as Différentes Latitudes and Comité Joséphine. Things are getting structured for a better organization. Lastly, there is the weight of selective perfumery in a shared network. The agreements signed by major groups’ brands with independent perfume stores compel them to make a certain number of purchases every year, and this is really extremely tough financially, especially in this economic context. It prevents them from investing anywhere else, and obviously, in rare perfumery. David Frossard - It must be pragmatic and follow the market’s rules. Increasing the number of launchings obeys to a strategy of linear profitability for brands with a visionary, well-defined approach. This contributes to the creative dynamics typical of the sector, but it must not make people believe anything is possible. It is up to distributors, retailers, and even the press, to sort things out and avoid those that claim they belong to creative perfumery, when they actually do not. A multitude of brands embark on the adventure, which makes buyers even more confused, whether they are professionals or end users, and prevents good brands from emerging. That is the reason why I created a label [NB: Différentes Latitudes]. It is a closed concept that guarantees a truly creative perfumery, a DNA, a story, a long-lasting concept. François Hénin - Indeed, niche perfumery already suffers from this fast-moving race. Brands with a real DNA are doing very well, as can be seen with the recent purchases by major groups. The last protection we have remains retailers, who do possess the knowledge and power to select real rare perfumery brands."
Kanebo launches first skincare line for over-60s women,"On October 16, 2015, Kanebo Cosmetics launched Twany Glow, a new skincare line mainly targeting women in their 60’s from Twany, one of its core domestic skincare brands.  Women in their 60s comprise 17% of the female population in Japan’s and 40% of the total cosmetics-using population of women aged 15 -89.  Furthermore, the per capita spending in households of the 60 - 69 age group is the highest, and money spent on cultural activities, leisure, and social entertainment is also higher than those in the younger age brackets. This generation is also highly conscious about beauty matters and has a positive attitude towards skincare. “Women in their 60’s belong to Japan’s baby boomer generation, which has been at the forefront of mass consumption, and they care about their appearance. Our research revealed that 90% of these women use skincare on a daily or almost daily basis, which is a higher ratio than for younger generations,” observes Yukio Makino, brand manager of Twany. Yet, due to the post-retirement decrease in average household incomes, a 2014 Kanebo survey reveals that women over 60 are inclined to constrain their cosmetics expenses without having to trade down to products of lesser qualities. Compared with women in their 50’s, studies also show specific need of older women.  After the menopausal years they experienced changes in their skin. The sebum content in the skin decreases, the skin’s temperature can lower more easily, and conventional skin care items that place importance on moisturizing can no longer adequately address problems of dryness. “Until recently in Japan, emphasis was placed on young and middle-aged customers and women in their 50’s and older tended to get grouped into one big segment. But for women in their 60’s - who represent the majority of Japan’s cosmetics-using population - skin care that fulfills their particular lifestyles, spending patterns, and beauty needs is essential” adds Yukio Makino. The Twany Glow line was developed to address the specific needs of skins that tend to have low sebum content. Five products are available for daily skin care: cleansing cream, facial soap, lotion, emulsion, and cream. These basic skin care items are priced slightly lower than conventional Twany cosmetics. Kanebo has also paid particular attention to the packaging design.  Taking into consideration that the power to grasp can weaken with age, the package was specially made for easy grasping. The cap was made to open easily, and the bottle was devised to be less prone to slip out of the hands. To prevent breakage, the package is made of light-weight plastic in an easy-to-hold oval-shaped cylindrical form, and the screw cap is designed to open with fewer twists. Strategic parts of the bottle and the cap have been done in relief to prevent slippage. As far as distribution is concerned, Twany is sold mainly through free-standing cosmetics specialty stores, often found in regional cities or local shopping areas in larger cities."
"In Los Angeles, on February 3 and 4, 2016: MakeUp enters in action!","This new event, proposing a different format from the MakeUp In events organized so far, looks like a new stage for the Beauteam team. ""As we can see,  explains Jean-Yves Bourgeois, the program of this first MakeUp in Action in Los Angeles places emphasis more on the conferences and workshops aspect than it does on products presentations by suppliers"". This side of the event will be purposefully limited, both in number of exhibitors and floor space. As for participants/visitors, access to the event will be free, but there will be a fee to participate to conferences and workshops. ""We have the ambition,  emphasizes Sandra Maguarian, to organize an event that gives pride of place to quality exchanges between professionals and where education and knowledge sharing are the main goal."" This explains the two mornings of specialized workshops animated by experts who will have the possibility to use, at their convenience, a particular product of a particular supplier, to illustrate their point. And also the desire to privilege roundtables where interactivity between all stakeholders in the make-up industry will be key with a true commitment of local and international brands. ""This is a totally new concept we are proposing,  explains Jean-Yves Bourgeois. The West Coast is the perfect spot for this. It is the place where all kinds of start-ups emerged. This region, with its level of creativity and dynamism, never stops surprising us! It was an obvious place to be and ride this wave!"""
"“Absolute customization may be the future of real luxury”, Bruno Cottard, VP Jean Patou","With its historical expertise in perfumery, its internal perfumer-creator, and its laboratory located in the heart of the golden triangle in Paris, the brand was predisposed to meet this expectation. The creation process requires both the work of a real dedicated craftsman and the commitment, in terms of time and thinking, of the customer. Thomas Fontaine, the Maison’s perfumer, organizes five to ten meetings with the customer to become immersed in his/her story, discover his/her olfactory world, and convey this personality with a signature. “All this requires to understand who or what the person is, unconsciously, and what he or she intends to show”, the perfumer comments. Several suggestions are made over a period of six months, depending on the raw materials selected, and always with the guarantee of exceptional quality ingredients. The rose/jasmine note of the Grasse region, so dear to Patou perfumes, remains the main theme that will give the original creation its Patounade. Then everything narrows down to the final outcome. The Maison takes care of the administrative and regulatory procedures and produces five litres of perfume, which are kept in a safe at the headquarters. After nine to twelve months, the proud owner pays 50,000 euros to receive a Jean Patou-designed, 100ml bottle made of Baccarat crystal, bearing his own engraved initials, arms, or monograms. The whole is featured in a wooden, leather, or fabrics box made by Elie Bleu, Pinel et Pinel, or Norline’s workshops. “We have estimated at about 4,000 the number of people that may be concerned by this offer, so it is not really a market, but it is still important for the prestige of a House of perfume like ours to make a unique high perfumery service available to people who can afford it,” explains Bruno Cottard. The brand has already approached several people in Europe and the United States, and it intends to rely on word-of-“nose” to reach customers endowed with an exclusive trail."
"Man buns, braids and bold colours among the top Google beauty searches this year","According to the recently published “Beauty Trends 2015, Hair Care Edition (U.S.)” analyzing the monthly volume of beauty-related search queries from January 2013 - August 2015, the man bun has emerged as one of the most-searched for hairstyles after appearing on the scene in 2014. Thanks to celebrities such as Harry Styles, Jared Leto and Leonardo DiCaprio, the trend spread like wildfire, and men all over the globe turned to the internet to recreate the look at home, turning to the search engine to find out ""how to grow a man bun"" and ""how to tie a man bun"". According to Google, 2015 saw men’s hair queries overtake women’s hair queries for the first time. Man buns aside, the other big searches were for ""Mad Men""-style comb-overs and fade haircuts, a gradient style that sees the hair go from longer at one point to very short at another. When it comes to women, one of the biggest rising search trends has been for braids, which have been given a new lease of life on the catwalks of late. Squared-off ""box braids"", which consist of multiple hanging braids weaved into the hair, and cornrow ""goddess braids"" which lie partially flat against the scap, are the hottest trends, based on the search data, with interest in both starting in 2013 and peaking this year. The braided look, which continued to reign supreme on the Spring / Summer 2016 runways, seems set to stick around for a while yet. The third major beauty search trend since 2013 has been for daring hair colours. The recent ’Granny hair’ trend that took off this spring, inspired by stars like Kelly Osborne and Rihanna, means that searches related to grey and silver tresses are amongst the most popular. Purple has also been having a moment, with Katy Perry’s Grammy Awards lavender hairdo this February sparking off a round of searches for the look. Rainbow hair has also made its mark, both in the streets and in online searches."
"Cosmoprof Asia 2015 to spotlight the natural, baby care and male grooming segments","The growing demand for “truly natural” products in Asia is evident in the number of companies at Discover Trends displaying a plethora of eco-sustainable and natural beauty cosmetics.

Sephora welcomes connected beauty with a new 3.0 store experience,"Interactive terminals, mural tablets, digital shelves, selfie mirrors and even phone chargers: without a doubt, Sephora is breaking with conventional shopping codes, ushering in the 3.0 boutique concept. Sephora Flash boutiques will have a much smaller surface size than traditional sites, covering around 100 square meters and at first glance seem to stock a limited number of products. Indeed, the physical items in-store have almost been halved compared to the classic Sephora retail space yet beauty addicts can actually discover and purchase from over 150 brands and 14,000 products thanks to virtual shopping. One of the main changes to the in-store client experience begins with the shopping basket. Clients are given a physical one for direct purchases from a large selection of makeup and skincare and a digital basket in the form of an NFC card. This allows shoppers to access the brand’s online boutique of around 14,000 references thanks to various terminals, tablets and digital shelves throughout the store. All purchases can be paid for at the counter. Selected beauty items in-store can be immediately brought home whereas items selected online are delivered either to your home or at the Sephora Flash boutique. As a specialist of select fragrances, Sephora has showcased a linear wall dedicated to premium-classic perfumes as well as niche fragrances with a wide selection of testers. Each tester is equipped with NFC tags that allow shoppers to access a multitude of information on the product, from a simple description to the shopper’s personal digital basket page. To do this, all you have to do is deposit the tester on the connected screen. To round up the connected shopping experience, clients can also benefit from a number of services: a makeup bar, beauty bar, Make Up For Ever eyelash bar and a brow bar by Benefit. All the services are guided by expert specialists for an express beauty makeover combined with personalized advice. On your way out, don’t forget to pass by the Flash bar to take your very own large-scale selfie in the aptly-named selfie-mirror, recharge your smartphone and pick out some well-deserved beauty samples thanks to a dedicated digital distributor."
"Light, reloadable, customizable: the reload. mini-spray is designed to refashion perfumery","Testing, changing, moving: the 5ml mini-spray launched by reload labs. is just super-trendy. “As people no longer put perfume on only once a day, in the morning or at night, consumers express the desire to do it whenever they feel like it, and small sizes have become very popular, only one person out of ten takes their perfumes with them when they leave home,” explains François Turck, General Manager Europe of the French start-up. People want to be able to move with their perfumes; they want to discover, test, and change them: reload. targets both uses. The start-up had to face several challenges to manage to take perfumes out of people’s bathrooms. “The travel size solutions available until then were not very efficient,” François Turck adds. What were their main flaws? They were not really waterproof, and consumers got tired of seeing their precious perfumes evaporate. So when it designed its mini-spray, reload labs. decided to focus on this aspect as well as on the various refill systems and the final appearance of the product. The idea was to develop a reloadable flask to be inserted into a spray packaged with an interchangeable, customizable case. Consumers can reload the flask with their own perfumes, either with the funnel provided, or with the valve designed to be attached to the perfume bottle pump, after removing the pump protection on the spray. They can also buy full refills to discover as many new perfumes as they wish, thanks to an exclusive patented system. And they can enjoy the same flexibility with the case. Although the original one is black or white, consumers will be able to purchase separate cases, and even create one in their own image on byreload.com, which features cases in different colours and with endless decorations: printed ones, others covered with leather, or made of aluminium or Zamak… The reload. reloadable mini-spray is available in its box for EUR19.90, and is provided together with its empty refill and funnel specifically designed to avoid discharges. As for the pre-filled refills, they cost 5 euros and are available from the dedicated piece of furniture in selective perfume shops, where empty sprays are also sold. They make it possible for consumers to test perfumes over time. The packaging containing the refills is marketed with a voucher that bears a single number, which enables to generate a EUR5 reduction voucher online when purchasing the real size product (as from 50ml), and therefore reimburse the cost of the refill tested. “Our study results show we can consider a 15 to 20% conversion rate, which is much higher than any other recruiting tool,” François Turck concludes. Partnerships have already been concluded with about ten brands (Issey Miyake, Arden, Kenzo, Givenchy, Hugo Boss…). In Europe, reload. was launched in early October in approximately twenty countries, in particular via the Douglas network (Nocibé in France), via Manor in Switzerland, and Ici Paris XL in Belgium and Luxembourg. It will be launched before the end of the year in the Middle East in partnership with the Chalhoub Group, and should be available in the United States in 2016. As for its debuts in France, Nocibé offers to test the eaux de parfum Jeu d’Amour by Kenzo, Dahlia Divin and Pi by Givenchy, Hugo Man, Hugo Woman and Bottled by Hugo Boss, and L’Eau d’Issey pour Homme by Issey Miyake. Reload. has thought about launching temporary collections with these perfume houses to increase brands’ visibility: an exclusive, limited selection of references only available for a few months to discover fragrances in a completely innovative, unique way. In order to design its product, reload., a new player on the perfumery market, approached the Ileos Group, but also Arcade Beauty (formerly known as Bioplan) and Axilone for their know-how in the field of injection and conditioning. “The company contacted us for our expertise in small size diffusers and our know-how in terms of full-service solutions”, explains Stéphane Frémiot, Senior VIP Sales Europe at Arcade Beauty, who initiated the project. The body, the pushbutton, the internal spring tube, and the interchangeable case make up the upper part of the spray. They are injected at Axilone Plastique, in their plant located in Auray, Brittany, France, and then they are assembled together. The Zamak base adapted to this upper part is supplied by another company, Pack-Man. “The initial specifications were designed to make refills interchangeable, while guaranteeing efficient watertightness and quality spraying”, explains Virginie Muntaner-Verdeille, Key Account Manager at Axilone. “We started from a first drawing provided by reload., and then we designed the spray. We had to integrate all the functional elements in an object that presented a lot of constraints in terms of size and design. We adapted the product to industrialization and gave reload. some advice on the materials to be used in this type of product.” We chose not to develop a new pump, but to start from an existing engine suited for a specific spray. It is the SP5 pump engine by Albéa, the mini-pump specialist, that was selected. Albéa designed a special connecting element which obtained a patent for its diameter and height in order to guarantee the unique nature of the refills. Lastly, Arcade Beauty is responsible for reloading the refills, installing the covers, and printing the batch-codes on the cases. And the result is displayed with furniture manufactured in France by Como. All in all, 200,000 sprays were produced to implement the concept, and 500,000 more will be available before the end of December."
E-beauty trends 2015: Towards an augmented use of beauty products,"Alcimed’s first finding is that the word ""e-beauty"" covers a wide range of products with great differences from one another. There are for instance electronic tools to facilitate the application or the efficacy of products, as well as connected objects, beauty monitoring apps and communication and marketing tools developed by beauty brands. Electronic devices designed to facilitate the application of skin care products, increase their efficiency, ensure more appropriate use, or extend the effects, have multiplied in recent years. According to Alcimed, there are two main trends: on the one hand, the democratization of professional instruments, and on the other hand, the use of brushes allowing more efficient applications. Thus, electronic devices inspired from those used in beauty salons or dermatology offices are becoming available to the greatest number. ""This is especially true for devices using pulsed light or electricity to improve a specific aspect of the skin. Known and used by professionals for over twenty years, they are making their entry on the consumer market,"" said the consulting firm, mentioning the use of red light for anti-ageing purposes (""Luxury"" by Tanda) or of blue light for acne-fighting procedures (""Clear Rayz for Acne"" by Quasar), as well as small electrical impulsions to increase product penetration and stimulate cell regeneration (""Trinity Facial Toning"" by Nuface) or even laser hair removal (""Laser 4X"" by Tria.) The use of brushes to apply skincare is mainly a mechanical solution. Their number is growing, particularly in Europe, with various actions: exfoliating (microdermabrasion), cleansing (by micro-oscillations or ion pulses) or combining several actions to be increasingly multifunctional. ""New brushes, fully dedicated to makeup are being marketed. Inspired by the Korean trend of electrical application, brushes have a tip that reproduces the finger tapping in order to assure a more uniform application of foundations, BB creams, moisturizers, concealers, blush and bronzing powders. The Color Me applicators marketed by Eric Jimenez are a good illustration of this trend. Another major emerging technology aims at improving consumer’s knowledge about the skin, its quality and its needs. Sensors in placed in devices measure parameters such as hydration, blemishes, colour, temperature, aging and environmental stresses (pollution and UV radiation), etc. The BeautyExplorer launched by Sony earlier this year is a perfect example of this trend. The device analyses the light that is reflected from the skin and provides its diagnosis. Tools measuring sun exposure such as Netatmo’s June, or those that continuously measure several skin parameters such as the flexible patch that L’Oréal developed with the University of Illinois. However, innovations are not just about applying skincare products, they also include the user’s experience. Actually, two main tracks are being explored. The first one consists in helping consumers during the purchasing act. Thanks to smartphones and electronic mirrors now make it possible to visualize skin problems when they occur, and to test make-up or hair products through interactive interfaces. The most striking examples are Panasonic’s Beauty Mirror and the L’Oréal’s Makeup Genius application. The second option consists in ensuring the safety and traceability through intelligent packaging. This is what provides Israel’s start-up Visualead. To fight against counterfeiting, the company’s Dotless Visual Code technology can control the authenticity of items provided the manufacturer has printed a smartphone-readable code on the product’s packaging. Each code only works once, and cannot be reused or rewritten by counterfeiters. According to Alcimed, brands such as L’Oréal and Ferrero have already created millions of unique Visual Dotless Codes for their products in China. ""In light of the innovations that are already available, one can expect an explosion of electronics and digital tools on the cosmetics market and the use of increasingly original technologies. The devices of the future will surely draw their inspiration from areas external to the cosmetics arena in order to offer new and ever more surprising features, that will revolutionize our vision of beauty products,"" concludes Pierre Gadrat, Director of Alcimed’s BU TIM."
Brazil set to take the lead on men’s grooming by 2019,"A study conducted by the market research firm also shows that sales of shaving products, soaps and shampoos for men have totalled US$4.7 billion in 2014 – a 99.4% increase over 2009. The product mix is increasingly more diversified, and Brazil’s cosmetics leadership will be particularly drawn by bath and shower products, which are set to grow by 111% between 2014 and 2019. Deodorants (+53%), hair care (+38%) and shaving products (+32%) are to follow. Marcela Viana, market research analyst at Euromonitor International, says the increase in income observed in recent years combined to new customers entering this market should bring Brazil to the top of the rank. Marcela points to the fact that manufacturers also play a key role in Brazil’s strong performance in this market. “The industry has been contributing considerably to this scenario by launching products targeting male consumers.” Men thus account for around 40% of Granado’s customers.  The Brazilian cosmetics brand has four men’s grooming brands - Glicerina, made of vegetable glycerin bar soaps and body washes; Antisséptica, with antifungal and antibacterial products; Barbearia, whose highlight is a shaving soap for men who shave in the shower or sauna; and the dermocosmetics range Granaderma. Granado’s marketing and sales director, Sissi Freeman, says the company has followed closely the behaviour of male consumers in Granado’s 40 concept stores throughout Brazil. “Product loyalty is an important feature. Our antiseptic talcum powder, which was Granado’s very first product, has become a tradition passed on from generation to generation.” Brazil’s cosmetics giant Natura also has a portfolio dedicated to male customers, ranging from perfumes and deodorants to creams, foams, moisturizers and hair care products. ""As well as practicality, men look out for efficiency and points of difference in the product composition. That is why the beauty industry has been investing in products with the latest technology. One of Natura’s competitive advantages is that male customers can purchase products online through Rede Natura (Natura network), which meets their demand for quick and easy solutions,” says Alessandro Mendes, product development director at Natura. Euromonitor’s Viana points out that unlike women, men do not tend to be impulsive buyers - “they are more careful and patient customers,” she says. Christoph Mayer-Loos, co-founder of online men’s grooming store Shop4Men, agrees with Viana. “It is a demanding target audience, aged 20 to 45 years. Most often, the first purchase is a product that they have already tried. Once they discover more options, the next purchase is usually larger and includes different products,” he says."
Selfies and strobing boost prestige makeup sales in the UK,"The total value of the British prestige beauty market is £1.2 billion in January to August 2015, which grew 6.4% on the previous year. Make-up represents a substantial part of the sector accounting for 32.8% of this market and has grown by 3.2% on the same period in 2014. “Make-up is really driving growth in the prestige beauty market fueled by the popularity of the selfie. Pioneered by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, it’s a trend we see across the board and make-up is essential to creating the perfect look. At the same time strobing, which emerged in early 2015, is the years’ hot new make-up trend which is driving consumers to spend more on highlighters so they can experiment with this new way of accentuating the face,” explains June Jensen, Director U.K. Beauty for The NPD Group. According to NPD, the three core segments of the makeup category have all reported double digit growth in the period January to August 2015, compared to the same period in 2014.  The total value of face make-up is £206 million, up 17%; total eye make-up is valued at £101 million, growing by 13% and total lip make-up reported sales of £54 million growing by 16%. Foundation alone, which is part of the face segment, reported sales of £112 million and grew by 16% in the period January to August 2015, compared to the year before. This dramatic growth can be attributed directly to the continued popularity of the selfie.  “Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Beyonce and Cara Delevingne have inspired a generation of women to post selfies on social media channels such as Instagram and Facebook. Face, eye and lip make-up is vital to achieving a photo-ready finish and brands have responded with foundation and primers that reference the look people want to achieve using terms like photo-ready, camera-ready and HD. It’s spurned a new sub-sector and is driving sales,” explains Jensen. Strobing Emerging as a key make-up trend in 2015, strobing - a new make-up technique used to layer highlights on the face to create an illuminated complexion - has driven growth in the highlighter/illuminator sub sector by 48.5% in the period January to August 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Total sales of highlighter products in this period were £8 million whilst in the same period in 2014 sales were £5.5 million. “Highlighters have witnessed an incredible amount of growth in the past year driven solely by the new trend for strobing. This has been a huge topic on social media, on beauty blogs and in the mainstream press. Brands have capitalised on this with new launches and focusing marketing on existing lines to drive sales in store and online,” concludes Jensen."
Cosmoprof Asia to celebrate 20th anniversary and French cosmetics,"Benefiting from the high growing rate of the Asia-Pacific beauty and personal care market, Cosmoprof Asia has grown from a humble regional fair into what is today one of the ultimate annual destinations in Asia for professionals in the beauty industry.  Since its inception in 1996, the event has expanded in importance and in size, having grown four times bigger. With 2,362 exhibitors from 42 countries and regions over 81,500 square metres of exhibition space (+7% compared to 2013), last year’s edition reaffirmed its dynamism. In 2014, the tradeshow welcomed about 60,000 visitors, 64% of them originating from outside Hong Kong. “The show has constantly adapted to changes in the industry and market and today reflects the entirety of the industry, offering visitors unrivalled access to the latest offerings in perfumery and cosmetics, natural and organics, packaging and raw materials, aesthetics and spa, nail, hair and accessories, all represented by major international and Asian companies,” explain the organizers. To commemorate its 20th anniversary, Cosmoprof Asia 2015 has numerous special events and activities in store. At the front stage comes Spot on Beauty, a launchpad for new products that was initiated in 2014. An area of 3,700 square meters showcases the latest launches in cosmetics, skincare, nail and hair. In addition, new pavilion called “Discover Trends” will house exhibitors representing three emerging segments of the beauty industry – cosmetics for men, natural and organic products, as well as baby products. To enhance interactive learning during the show, a dedicated Trends Forum has been added to the Spot On Beauty area. Global research companies such as Euromonitor, Groupe Carlin International, Information et Inspiration and Kline will reveal their views on current and future beauty trends. After the success of last year, the charity initiative Boutique will be back: visitors can hand-pick a selection of travel-sized product samples sponsored by 20 exhibitors, to be presented in a customised gift box, for a small donation. All proceeds will go to a selected charity. On the occasion of this 20th anniversary, the 9th edition of the International Buyer Programme, a trade programme designed to give exhibitors and high-profile visitors the opportunity to meet and engage in pre-scheduled one-on-one meetings, will focus on Asian countries (China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea) and Turkey. “Through its 20 year history, Cosmoprof Asia has bridged French companies and international buyers. Participation has included the likes of Laboratoires Ingrid Millet and Evoluderm, and the event has helped launch French products throughout Asia such as Kadalys’ anti-ageing banana-based cosmetic,” claim the organisers. On the occasion of the 20th Anniversary, 108 French exhibitors (39 are first time exhibitors) will participate in the show, and Business France and Cosmoprof Asia are creating the “French Cosmetic Awards” to honour French brands that demonstrate an innovative and creative approach to the Chinese market. A panel of judges will assess participating French cosmetics products on originality, innovation and excellence in communication strategy. The panelists will comprise representative from three French companies with established presence in Hong Kong - Caudalie, L’Oréal and Ann Jema, as well as retailers Mekim Ltd and Asia Spa & Wellness Ltd, and independent industry experts and Hong Kong celebrity beauty blogger, Ms. Queenie Chan. Cosmoprof Asia 2015 will be held from 11 to 13 November at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre."
Global cosmetic brands draw their inspiration from Korea and Japan,"Japanese women have exported the ""beauty routine"" concept that Koreans have developed and amplified.  Then came the BB creams, now followed by compact cushions and facial treatment sheet masks. The quest for a flawless skin and for eternal youth is common to Japan and Korea beauty habits.  Of course, the Japanese and Korean consumers differ in their approaches to beauty, their average age and their consumption preferences, however Françoise Hernaez Fourrier (full presentation available here below)  insists on the reciprocal influences between these two countries, which are geographically very close and also benefit from their proximity with the huge Chinese market. ""Cosmetic products enter into China in the wake of the K-pop and Korean TV series,"" she says. However, Florence Bernardin (full presentation available here below) points out important differences related to demographics.  ""Japan is truly becoming the market for anti-aging products and for seniors.  Anyone looking for examples of products openly intended for more the 50+ should go to Japan to find them,"" she says. ""The Korean market on the contrary is still driven women in the 30s, but also by government subsidies and by the Chinese demand which strongly boost innovation."" In these fairly conservative societies, competition and the need to appeal to consumers constantly looking for new and highly efficient products, local brands do no hesitate to grow outside the box. For instance, in countries where cleanliness, hygiene and washing, are key cultural elements of everyday life, some cosmetic brands have successfully marketed products addressing the need to maintain the skin’s microbiome in good conditions and offering to boost skin’s ""good microbes"" by applying various kind of muds on the body. Nevertheless, the ritual of washing the skin before applying skincare and makeup, or before going to sleep, remains a key element of the beauty routine in both Korea and Japan. Korea’s brand Etude House thus proposes a kit of 12 cleansing care products (one for each month) to adapt washing and meet the different needs of the skin to the changing climate conditions all along the year. Japanese and Korean brands are also increasingly interested in the rinsing and post-cleansing steps of the routine and are launching products that help to maintain a good skin hydration at that moment. This reinvention of washing also requires new approaches, in particular by replacing plain water with vegetable or floral waters. Among the other developments identified by Florence Bernardin, the progressive evolution of cushion products from makeup to skincare.  These small ultra-soft sponges placed in airtight boxes that can be soaked with liquid formulations are also getting increasingly small so as they can be brought everywhere.  A good illustration being Primera’s new Baby Sun Cushion SPF32/PA++.  With no more than 15 g, the compact fits easily in the bag of the mother who wants to reapply sunscreen easily on her baby’s skin. Katalin Berenyi, co-founder of French-Korean brand Erborian, which imported the BB cream concept in Europe, insists on the differences between the ideal of Korean beauty and the European one. ""To create Erborian, we took inspiration from Korean beauty rituals and from the traditional herbal pharmacopoeia. And obviously, we studied trends and practices of contemporary young Korean women,"" she explains. ""However we have taken great attention to the adaptation of our products, including formulas, to the expectations of French women."" Indeed, while Korean women seek to remain eternally in their twenties and to a achieve a skin as perfect as that of a baby, European and especially French women, want a more natural beauty look. “Making a mere copy of a Korean formula would not have worked."" It is a bit too early to predict whether, after the craze for French cosmetics and the revolution that Japanese designers brought on the market with the clear lines of their packaging, the “Hot in Seoul” label could become the ultimate selling argument in the world of beauty!  However, the Land of Morning Calm has already acquired a strong influence within the cosmetics industry and now ambitions to compete with French brands in the Chinese market. According to the Korea International Trade Association (KITA), Korean cosmetic brands already hold 22.1 per cent of the market vs. 30.6% for French products.

French prestige skincare market bounces back from recession,"The prestige beauty channel in France returned to growth in H1 2015, increasing by 0.7 per cent in value.  According to The NPD Group, this revival is based on a return to growth of the perfume and makeup categories, and mostly on a pretty rebound of the skincare segment (21 per cent of the beauty market) which contributes to more than half to the growth of the channel. ""With a growth of 1.9 per cent in value at the end of June 2015, the prestige skincare segment is driven by the rise of light textures such as serums and oils, the success of which is expected to continue over the second half of the year,"" says the market research firm. In a category dominated by skin creams, serums (the second segment of skincare by size) drive both short-term (+14 per cent in value in H1 2015) and long-term growth (+22 per cent vs 1st half 2011). They account for three-quarters of the growth of the skin care category without cannibalizing skin creams that remained flat after two years of decline. ""While more basic categories are in competition with other distribution channels, serums, which boast higher actives concentrations and benefit from the strong technological advances made by Prestige brands, are increasingly preferred by consumers. Lightness, ease of application and immediate effect are real assets to seduce French female consumers,"" explains Mathilde Lion, Expert Beauty Europe at The NPD Group. Like serums, oils are gaining momentum in the selective channel with a 44 per cent growth in the first half and sales exploding, especially within the anti-age segment. Because it is highly sensorial and particularly easy to apply, this category is conquering all skin care segments, from face to body care, including anti-aging, moisturizing, and sun care products. The success of dry and light formulas launched in pharmacies in recent years, has opened the way to a new generation of prestige products.  Furthermore, the trend is driven by the search for naturalness, since oils are mainly composed of natural ingredients. ""Light textures are on the rise and this trend is a long term perspective with the arrival on the market of hybrid products combining the naturalness of oil and the technicality of the serums. ‘Oil serums’ for instance combine the nourishing power of oils and the freshness of serums. Fall 2015 should confirm this trend with the launch of innovations such as oil-in-gels or balms-in-oil,” concludes Mathilde Lion."
MakeUp in New York 2015 unveils a series of hot innovations,"The 2015 edition of MakeUp in New York, the event dedicated to the suppliers of makeup brands, which was held on 9-10 September at the Penn Plaza Pavilion, was once again very busy, with about 2,500 visitors (a 15 per cent increase compared to 2014). “The 110 exhibitors to MakeUp in New York, were able to see for themselves that once again this show was a much awaited event by top brands in the US make-up industry, an event that has never stopped carving a name for itself in the world of global business events dedicated to the beauty industry,” commented the organisers. This year, the new accessories, packaging solutions and formulations presented by the exhibitors have been evaluated and selected before being showcased in a dedicated area, the salon’s ""Innovation Tree"". Highlights this season include Sephora’s new ""Double Down Brush Set"" by HCT, a patented 2-in-1 brush that can be converted into a double-ended tool by removing the larger head and attaching it to the handle of the smaller brush. This feature protects the smaller brush head from damage and debris, keeping it clean and safe for contact with the eyes. Preventing bacterial contamination is also the aim of the ""Tip and Blend Brush Collection"" by Pennellifaro, a brush featuring a rounded shape with a central tip in relief, on to which a small amount of liquid or cream foundation can be poured directly. Not having to put product on the back of your hand first guards against waste and contamination. Hygiene was also in the focus of US-headquartered supplier of makeup brushes Anisa International.  The company showcased a range of cleansing products entirely dedicated to the cleaning of makeup brushes and applicators.  According to Anisa, “61 per cent of women clean their makeup brushes less than once a month or not at all, in particular because they take too long to dry.”  Anisa also explains that uncleaned or improperly cleaned brushes can significantly impact product performance.  The product solutions showcased by Anisa thus allow a deep clean or a quick refresh of makeup tools with a few seconds. As far as formulation are concerned, the ""Eyebrow Gel Volume"" by ABC Texture brings brows into the spotlight with a fibre-enriched, 30° angled brush that claims to facilitate precision, accuracy, evenness and easier application. As for the new gel-to-pencil eyeliner ""Liquid Like Gel Sensation EL"" by Alkos Group, it combines the precision of a liquid liner with the application and the result of a pencil. The fast-drying formula is waterproof, long-lasting and can be used on the outside and the inside of the eye. Contouring remains big business in the business, so the ""Art of Contouring"" tool by Faber Castell will no doubt prove popular. Described as ""a natural face lift in 3 steps"", the product reshapes and sculpts the features, with a highlighting element adding radiance and the blush aspect resulting in a youthful flush. And innovation isn’t just for women. In line with the growth of the male grooming sector, there is plenty of development when it comes to guys’ beauty products, as demonstrated by the new ""BB Cream for Man"" by ICC.  The men’s nail product has been formulated to reactivate the nail barrier and protect them from breakage and flaking due to the dehydration caused by exposure to solvents and surfactant. The special base is lightly coloured but not glossy, giving nails a ""healthy and natural look."""
MakeUp in New York to open its doors this week,"The event’s organisers chose to place this new edition of MakeUp in New York under the sign of innovation and trends with a new animation, the Innovation Tree Products, that will reveal new products presented by exhibitors and selected by a committee compound of experts in formulation, packaging, full service and accessories. For its participation in MakeUp in NewYork this year, cosmetics packaging supplier Albéa has set up a Beauty Bar where famous professional makeup artist Jody Formica will offer free makeup sessions with easy-to-use temporary tattoos, for a fun, trendy and bohemian touch!  Albéa and Jody Formica will also showcase the latest beauty innovations in make-up, including false lashes, eyebrow and mascara brushes. For the third time MakeUp in NewYork will invite its exhibitors and visitors to discover a unique exhibition, The Art of Beauty, featuring vintage cosmetics and make-up objects from the Camilli and Hattemberg collection, and organized by Le Musée à la Carte. This year, members of the CEW - a non-profit, professional organization with more than 8,000 members worldwide from 2,250 companies in the beauty industry - will be offered a private visit of the show that will give them and the exhibitors a unique opportunity to meet in a quiet and exclusive environment. Once again, MakeUp in New York is teaming up with the students of the cosmetics and fragrance marketing program of the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT). Virginia Bonofiglio and her students will present a history of American make-up from the 1920s to the 1980s, with a video presentation along with several period-inspired makeup looks on models. The presentation will take place on Wednesday, September 9th, in the conference room, from 10:15 am to 10:45 am."
Makeup in Sao Paulo builds on the success of the first edition,"Premium Beauty News - In a little more than three months will open the second edition of MakeUp in Sao Paulo. A much awaited event by the whole Brazilian cosmetics industry! Sandra Maguarian -  Absolutely! The message that was passed on to cosmetics suppliers at the conference dedicated to Brazil, last June at MakeUp in Paris, by Mrs Nazish Munchenbach of Granado, Mrs Vanessa Machado of Quem Disse Berenice (O Boticario Group) and Mrs Maria Paula Fonseca of Natura, was clear: “Come over, we need you!” Remember also comments at the close of the first edition.  Among the exhibitors, Arcade / Bioplan, Topline Products, Oxygen Development, Fiabila, Strand Cosmetics Europe, Faber-Castell, Geka-World, for instance, praised the high quality of the event.  As far as visitors were concerned, we also received very good feedbacks from brands such as MakeB (Boticario Group) and Granado. Premium Beauty News - Despite a difficult economic context, analysts appear to agree that Brazil remains a country with a high potential for the cosmetics industry. What is your opinion on this? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Rather than engage in a hasty global strategy, Brazilian brands prefer to be part of this local growth and consolidate their position challenged by a stimulating international presence. A challenge, which they know is determined by innovation and the integration of technologies coming from all industry partners. Brazil has managed to become in a few years one of the world leaders in many Beauty segments.  And the general economic downturn currently occurring after 30 years of continuous growth allows in fact to reflect on the longer-term taking into account the positive indicators and the emergence of new trends. Third largest cosmetics market after the United States and China, Brazil represents 9.4% of the world consumption of cosmetics and ranks first in the segments of Deodorants, Perfumes and Sun care products. Despite the apparent weakening of the Brazilian economy, the beauty and personal care markets seem to be playing their card better than most of other segments of the economy. Cosmetics are the country’s most dynamic sector with a growth 3 times higher than the country’s GDP. In the health, perfumes and cosmetics sector (HPC), the make-up category continues to rank third in the world’s consumption, representing 7.7% of Brazil’s cosmetics market with a homogeneous distribution of subcategories (nails 28%, lips 24%, face 24% and eyes 24%). 32% of Brazilian women regularly wear make-up. Premium Beauty News - Another key point, the distribution of cosmetics which was the exclusive preserves of ""door to door"" sales is changing! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - If direct selling remains the most widespread distribution model in Brazil, the development of infrastructures, the growing number of sales channels and the challenge offered by a growing pack of international competitors open today new opportunities and determine future issues. The discovery of the variety of make-up products is new to the Brazilian woman who still has simple consumption needs. The percentage of sales is lower than in other countries and often limited to lipstick, nail polish and mascara. This suggests an interesting potential for growth, provided however the consumer is offered a larger universe to discover. The attractiveness of Brazil has opened the cosmetics and make-up market to a varied and growing international competition. With 8% of imported products, the hegemony of local players does not seem however to be threatened for the moment, although the market share of subsidiaries of international companies producing in the country, should also be taken into account. Yet, the arrival of new competitors, has prompted Brazilian companies to react. The arrival of international brands was an opportunity to take inspiration and improve.  Competition pushes local companies to step out of their comfort zone to give the consumer the choice of quality and creativity can only be a source of growth, they emphasize. The variety of the offer and novelty helping to educate the market, particularly that of make-up, generate a positive effect. While the influence of established international service providers can already be felt, each brand operating on the market calls for more options."
The Nordic natural cosmetics market benefits from ethical consumerism,"Denmark has the largest market for natural cosmetics in the Nordic region. According to a recent report by Organic Monitor [1], natural and organic products comprise 4% of total cosmetic and personal care product sales in Denmark.  The country also has very high market share for organic foods, 7%; the highest in the world.  “Danish consumers are high spenders on natural and organic products because of ethical and environmental concerns,” explains the consulting and training firm. Widening availability is also driving market growth. Natural and organic cosmetics are making inroads in department stores, beauty retailers, supermarkets, drugstores and non-retail channels. However, health food shops still have the highest sales share. Although imported brands are highly established, Nordic brands are showing a rise in market share. The Danish company Urtekram has taken market leadership. It has a strong market position in all country markets partly because of its extensive product range and distribution. It was the first company to launch Cosmos-certified organic cosmetics in the region. It also has products with the Fairtrade and Nordic Swan labels. Organic Monitor finds green labels are becoming increasingly important in the Nordic region. Consumers are increasingly looking for logos and symbols that represent ethical and/or environmental attributes. The Nordic Swan is most established for personal care products, recognised by over 90% of consumers. Ethical labels will be featured in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit Europe. Hosted in Paris on 21-23 October, at the Paris Marriott Champs-Elysées, an update will be given on the growing myriad of ethical labelling schemes for cosmetics & personal care products. Urtekram will be sharing its experiences with such labels at the summit."
Brony hair: the new trend inspired by My Little Pony,"""Brony"" hair is the latest style to take over Instagram. The look involves dyeing your locks the signature pastels and candy-coloured hues of the toy ponies, often mixing up different shades at the same time. Some stars, like Katy Perry and Kelly Osbourne, who is known for her violet crop, have been rocking the look for months, while others, such as model Georgia May Jagger, are new to the Brony scene. The daughter of Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall took to Instagram earlier this week to unveil her new ’mermazing’ look, with a photo showing off her multitoned green, pink, purple and orange locks captioned ""Bronies with @alexbrownsell @bleachlondon Mermazing Hair colour."" The UK fashionista has kept her roots natural and left sections of her long blond hair uncolored to keep things choppy. Cara Delevingne was also spotted championing the look earlier this month when she stepped out with sugary pink hair. The actress turned out to be sporting a wig — a good idea if you want to test out Brony hair without committing — but her choice of color proved the trend is hot right now. Brony hair could be a natural progression from ’Rainbow hair’, the trend that has been sweeping the Internet all summer. Thanks to celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Kaley Cuoco, graduated ombré styles that involve leaving the roots their natural colour and adding flashes of pastel or fluo tones to the bottom half of your tresses have been big news. The concept is both fun and practical in terms of regrowth."
Global Photoshop experiment unmasks beauty standards around the world,"The ""Perceptions of Perfection"" study, carried out by Fractl for the Online Doctor service from UK health and beauty retailer Superdrug, saw 18 female graphic designers around the world Photoshop the image of a model to reflect what they felt would make the image more attractive to the citizens of their country. According to the authors of the study, “the results show just how much the ‘perfect body’ varies depending on geographic location.” While the Spanish and Colombian versions of the image closely represented the model’s natural shape and look, designers from Venezuela and Peru favored a bustier image, with Argentina opting for a slimmer model. The US designer chose a slim but curvaceous shape, while the UK result was made more slender overall. The final result for Italy, home to voluptuous sirens such as Sophia Loren and Monica Bellucci, was surprisingly lean and leggy. Another country endorsing a wispy silhouette if the results are to be believed is China, whose submitted image featured an incredibly slim (if improbably busty) model. Once translated into real-life dimensions, the experiment’s organizers estimated that the Chinese model would weigh just 101 lbs (around 46 kilos) and have an unhealthily low BMI of 17. Elsewhere in Asia, the Filipina designer manipulated the picture to cinch in the woman’s waist, emphasizing her hips and chest. Hips were also on the menu in Egypt, while the South African representation was more straight up and down. The authors explain that the experiment aimed to ""better understand potentially unrealistic standards of beauty and to see how such pressures vary around the world."" The organizers explain: ""We focused on female designers, as we wanted a woman’s view of what her culture finds attractive and to understand more about the pressures they face.""

Baking: the hottest new makeup trend,"It’s actually the latest big makeup tend and a quick scan of Instagrammed photos tagged #bakingtechnique reveals scores of women captured with various amounts of powder patted all over their faces. Baking, in the cosmetic sense, involves wetting the skin after foundation and concealer have been applied by using a damp sponge to dust powder over dark shadows or areas of the face that you want to highlight. As well as highlighting facial features, it also sets makeup to keep your look fresh throughout the day. For perfectly baked under-eyes and covering up dark circles, makeup artist Heidi Hamoud recommends using an eye cream such as Bobbi Brown’s Hydrating Eye Cream to prep. She then suggests using a thick, pigmented concealer and dabbing it on the under-eye area, before blending out any creases and tapping the area lightly with a face powder like Laura Mercier’s Invisible Loose Powder to set the makeup. Former drag queen and makeup artist Mathias Alan also recommends using Urban Decay’s De-Slick Makeup Setting Spray over foundation and concealer for the ultimate bake. Now it’s baking time! Using a damp sponge, you can then apply a generous amount of powder under the eye, before leaving it to set for five minutes and dusting off the excess with a makeup brush. However, Hamoud’s tip is to use a hard-pressed powder such as the Make Up For Ever Pro Finish Powder to go over the ’baked’ area with a brush, using light flicking motions to smooth everything out, buff off the powder and provide extra coverage. It isn’t just eye bags that can benefit from the approach — the technique can also be used as a method of contouring when applied underneath the hollows of the cheekbones and to the chin or down the bridge of the nose for a baking hot look."
Nearly six in ten US women check ingredients on their beauty products,"The ""Green Beauty Barometer"" survey [1] has revealed that the majority of US shoppers (59 per cent) read beauty product ingredient labels prior to purchase, while nearly 40 per cent intend to increase their spending on all-natural beauty products. ""For the last several years shoppers have become more conscious about what they put in their body through food consumption, and that’s spilled over to a greater awareness for what they put on their body,"" commented Lisa Strain, co-founder of the Kari Gran skin care and makeup brand. Sulfates were the top ingredient to look out for, with 29 percent of participants seeking to avoid them. These were followed by parabens (22 per cent), synthetic fragrances (18 per cent), PEG compounds (15 per cent) and mineral oil (11 per cent). Women aged 35-54 are most likely to check the labels, with 65 per cent scanning the ingredients list of products. Sixty-three per cent of 18-34-year-olds do the same, as to 59 percent of those aged to 45-54. The age group least likely to read the label (52 per cent) was the 55-64s. Regarding future habits, it appears that natural beauty is becoming more of a priority for many women, with 39 per cent of participants claiming they will buy more all-natural beauty products in the next two years than they currently do. Millennials aged 18-34 are the most likely to spend more on all-natural beauty products in the next two years, with half of them claiming they will. This is compared to 44% of women aged 35-44, 34% of women aged 55-64, 31% of women aged 45-54 and 30% of women aged 65-plus. When asked how important it was to purchase all-natural products among particular beauty categories, skin care came out on top, with 54% of women claiming it is important their skin care product purchases are all natural. This was followed by all-natural hair care at 49%, makeup at 40%, fragrance at 31% and nail care products at 26%. A recent ""Natural Personal Care Global Series"" survey by market research company Kline found that the natural cosmetics market grew by 10.6 per cent between 2013 and 2014. Earlier this year a Nielsen survey found that 46 per cent of participants would be willing to pay more for a beauty product that claimed to be ""all natural."""
Bubble nails: The next big trend for fall?,"""Bubble nails"" first appeared in the US a few years ago, but they have been getting serious Instagram attention in the last few weeks. Also referred to as ""hump nails"" (if they boast an elongated tip), the trend involves sculpting acrylic gel onto the nail to create a dome shape which is then filed down to create a short, square and very arched shape. Typically, the bubbles (or humps) are painted in bright bubble gum colours and adorned with glitter, shimmer or, in some cases, fake pearls and gems. One of the most prominent advocators of the trend on social media is Texas-based salon Nails By Ann, which regularly shows off its innovative decorative techniques for bubble nails. Bows, studs and plastic flowers are all added to the already weighty-looking extensions. Some nail fans have been going crazy for the look, with users such as @coco_datvirgo_bihh posting messages of support to the salon such as ""These are perfect #humpnails #bubblenails @nailsbyann I’m in love"". However, not all beauty lovers agree on this. User @shes_sharkastic said: ""Yall are seriously getting your nails done like this on purpose tho?! For real? Like, really? #bubblenails #humpnails #acrylicnails #grosstrends #thingsthatarentcute #nasty"" while @_aleko_okela_ took it even further, saying: ""These nails are absolutely disgusting. wth is a humpnail? like what can you do with these? Who would want this on their hands? Who even thought to try this? I can’t even! #ICantEven #humpnails"". One nail artist, @kbfancy_wancy, even posted a message asking clients to stop requesting the service, saying: ""Attention clients...oval, stilleto, square, coffin is the nail trend but DAnnG check out these bubble nails?! #won’tdothem #urexcusedtogoelsewhere #gumballs"" ."
Beauty’s digital pure plays go physical on the U.S. retail market,"Birchbox, the pioneer of online subscription sampling, opened its first physical store in New York City in 2014, followed by its first holiday pop-up shop for men later in the year. The firm has also teamed up with Gap to bring Birchbox to seven U.S. locations through pop-up shops and recently announced it plans the opening of two new stores in 2016. Similarly, Violet Grey, which offers edited beauty collections online, opened a store in Los Angeles, while Credo Beauty, an online natural beauty retailer, also opened its first physical location in San Francisco, hoping it will be the start of a chain and become a multichannel retailer, as Mademoiselle Bio did in France. “The flurry of online retailers entering the physical world signifies yet another paradigm shift in beauty retailing,” notes Karen Doskow, Director of Kline’s Consumer Products practice. “While everyone else has been flocking online, online pure plays are becoming physical. Omni-channel retailing strengthens both ways as retailers and marketers strive to offer channel agnostic consumers the convenience of shopping in physical stores and online.” Amazon, the behemoth of all virtual pure plays, has also begun to go physical. In February 2015, the company introduced its first staffed on-campus pick-up and drop-off service at Purdue University. Amazon has also leased space in New York City which could possibly become its first retail store, as reported by the Wall Street Journal in October 2014. According to Kline, technology is also playing a key role in transformation of the beauty-retailing environment. Many physical retailers are working to blend online and offline together through technological enhancements, such as diagnostics tools like Sephora Color IQ, augmented reality mirrors, such as the iMirror, and online tutorials. Beacon technology that informs shoppers of information and special offers when in stores is implemented by all types of physical retailers during 2014. Despite its rapid ascension, virtual channels account for only 8% of total U.S. beauty and personal care sales while physical stores account for the vast majority, according to the Beauty Retailing USA report [1]. “This movement underscores the continued relevance of bricks and mortar in an increasingly digital world,” concludes Doskow."
Clowns are the hottest new beauty inspiration according to new viral makeup trend,"""Clown contouring"" is the latest trend to take off in the beauty world, and though it might sound like a joke, it is a pretty effective makeup technique. The phenomenon started earlier in the summer when beauty blogger BellaDeLune posted a video to YouTube showing how an extreme-looking theatrical clown base of makeup could be blended into a subtly contoured look. Beauty lovers everywhere have since pounced on the idea and women all over the world are now testing it out and showing off the results on Instagram. The process requires setting out triangular panels with ’teardrops’ under the eyes, before adding a bold circle of bright pink blush and crudely over exaggerating the lip area. It started out as a bit of fun, but the idea comes from a poignant place. ""Even though you don’t need this amount of makeup or any makeup at all to look beautiful, let’s face it, makeup is fun and it’s a way of expressing yourself,"" explains BellaDeLune in her video. She adds: ""I cannot tell you how many times I’ve been called a clown and been called many other names and been hated on because of the way that I use this art form."" Clown contouring sees classic highlighting and contouring techniques used on the nose and forehead, while wackier touches including recreating a poop emoji on your face which is then blended away, keeping things tongue in cheek. The fun has rolled over onto Instagram, where women have been posting videos and pictures of their own attempts — some serious and others less so. But Belladelune has started something, and several tutorials have cropped up on YouTube ever since her original post, including a step-by-step serious instruction film by SmashinBeauty and one by makeup artist Wayne Goss demonstrating the effect on men. Bustle has also posted a hilarious video of its editors trying out the look on themselves. Whether this trend is here to stay or not remains to be seen, but it’s good to remember that when it comes to beauty, a little clowning around never hurt anyone."
Point Parfums Digital: Towards the uberization of distribution?,"The idea of distributing perfume or cosmetic samples, or even products in their standard sizes via automated machines is not new. Various concepts have already been tested with more or less success. However, Point Parfums Digital intends to go much farther by creating a link between the physical and digital worlds, thanks to a concept involving a kiosk protected by a world patent. And it seems the start-up is not the only one thinking about it. “Since a tiny part of our capital (2,000 actions for 2.52 million) was listed on the Euronext Paris Free Market in early June, we have been approached by several distributors and brands,” declares Patrick Tardif, founder and Director of the company. “It is still a unique concept, as it makes it possible to smell a fragrance freely, buy a sample for 1 to 4 euros, and then be reimbursed for it and/or buy the bottle chosen online via the QR code on the packaging”, explains Patrick Tardif, who sees this innovation as the perfect example of how the digital world’s assets can be efficiently integrated into physical locations. The now famous phygital retail concept is getting both brands and distributors enthusiastic. Patrick Tardif is well-known in the small world of French perfumery. In 1991, he created Process Blue, which quickly became the first franchise network of selective perfumery in France with 120 stores, before being purchased by Nocibé in 2000. He knows distribution very well and is convinced the selective distribution agreement in its current form will not withstand the expiry of the exemption regulation in 2022. “Almost 1,400 new fragrances are launched internationally every year, which means several billion samples are distributed, but they miss their targets much too often, because distributors used them for something they were not meant for. Starting from a certain amount of money spent, the samples end up at the bottom of bags without any target, or without customers being asked whether they are interested in such or such product.” The Point Parfums Digital concept was tested on more than 45,000 consumers with brands like Azzaro, Clarins, Thierry Mugler, or Paco Rabanne, but also with very little-known brands on the French market. In the end, the conversion rate varied from 12 to 40% depending on the fragrance and location. “Consumers want to smell perfumes before they buy them, because the scent is the main reason they will actually make a purchase. That is why online selling is doing poorly in perfumery. We offer brands an economical solution to get them closer to customers, and we offer customers a quick, convenient solution to test products and make purchases,” Patrick Tardif emphasizes. “Today, luxury is also being able to make customers gain time.” On top of it all, Point Parfums Digital boasts about offering manufacturers, brands, or distributors a cheap means – by comparison with the cost of a store – to reach customers. Indeed, the Point Parfums Digital automated kiosks fitted with touch screens only occupy a maximum area of 0.25m2. They can be installed as stand-alone machines or in groups of two, three, four, six, or even twelve in any passageway: commercial galleries, cinemas, train stations, subways… The company has already signed agreements with shopping mall lessors to implant its terminals in almost 200 places in France. And yet, today it intends to go much farther. “There are 25,000 shopping malls around the world, not even counting airports,"" underlines Patrick Tardif, who is no longer just focusing on France. “The success we knew when we got listed on the stock exchange, and the fact that we have been spontaneously approached since then made us rethink our strategy.” In short, with an increase in value of approximately 9 million euros (given the value of the securities currently listed) and a strong interest from major players of the industry and distribution, Point Parfums Digital has developed broader ambitions than the 3 million euros first intended to be raised to spread across France. “We are three years ahead of our competitors. It is enough to start industrializing our concept and consider creating the first global network for perfume distribution,” he claims. Therefore, the idea is to approach a group that will be able to develop the concept on the global level over a period of about ten years. As a matter of fact, Patrick Tardif has given an exclusive mandate to NFinance Securities to receive bids. “Can you imagine the commercial potential of 20,000 terminals connecting consumers to online stores?” As pure players like Amazon, eBay, Cdiscount, NET-A-PORTER.COM, or vente-privee.com are taking a keen interest in perfumes and cosmetics, and while brands are trying to increase their points of contact with consumers, this new concept might actually quickly revolutionize the way numerous perfume brands are sold!"
"“Skincare and perfumery drive the new dynamics of Beyond Beauty Paris,” Claudia Bonfiglioli, Informa","Premium Beauty News - You have recently taken control of Beyond Beauty Paris with a renewed team and the ambition to revive the event. What is your diagnosis on the show’s positioning? Claudia Bonfiglioli - When I joined the Informa Group in September 2014, I aimed at developing the Informa Beauty Division on the global level. After six months in Shanghai and the huge success of China Beauty Expo, I was able to see the European market from a new perspective and understand the weaknesses of the show’s positioning over the past few years. There is an obvious need for renewal, which is why we decided to give it a stronger identity driven by two major sectors, Skincare and Perfumery, endow it with new dynamics, and renew with its DNA, which is mainly composed of beauty trends and innovation. Beyond Beauty Paris is the first show after summer, so it enables professionals to get back into the swing of things, discover new trends, get familiar with the new emerging currents, find different sources of inspiration, feel influences… It is an important event! Premium Beauty News - You have taken on several issues at the same time: a more dynamic programme of conferences, an emphasis on beauty trends… How is this going to take shape along with the usual Zoom and Beyond Beauty Lab?  Claudia Bonfiglioli – The Zoom, our launching platform for emerging brands, and the Beyond Beauty Lab, whose theme will be Skin & Environment in 2015, are highly attractive and perennial areas, so they are obviously still part of the picture. In addition, as part of our renewal process, we must provide both the public and exhibitors with new highlights to complete the show’s existing offer. Our programme of conferences – the Beyond Beauty Talks – has been reinvented! We have introduced a new branding to go back to the Beyond Beauty origins and opted for a more dynamic composition: on top of the traditional 45-minute conferences, masterclass series and round tables will be integrated into a programme that is already rich, and which is designed to enhance reflection, trigger debates, and make visitors take part in exchanges with all beauty players. It will be an opportunity to discuss topics like the new connected generation, the arrival of new pharmacy players and experts of galenics, the flood of home devices and connected objects, the reinforced presence of emerging markets, not only as players, but also consumers, the influence of Asia in the Western world… and all this in the presence of great names like Clinique, Erborian, Ioma, Chanel, BASF, L’Oréal, HEC Paris, and many others. As for trends, they represent the main thread of this 2015 edition, as can be seen with our exhibitors’ products and services, our Talks, but also the new Beyond Beauty Trends area gathering styling and trends agencies like Peclers and Centdegrés. Premium Beauty News - The launching of Beyond Beauty Fragrance is another key element of the new Beyond Beauty Paris. How will the perfumery area be organized? Claudia Bonfiglioli – This year, it seemed essential to us that the perfume industry needed to be better represented, as it is little, or not evoked at all on French professional shows. Creating the Beyond Beauty Fragrance area was mainly a response to the rare perfume market, which achieved a 160 million euro turnover in 2011. The segment increased threefold in only ten years! The show will thus give the opportunity to this exceptional perfumery sector to express itself through various highlights: first, a dedicated exhibition area in the presence of about twenty niche brands, but also two masterclass days focused on artistic perfumery, a large round table with Thomas Fontaine, from Jean-Louis Scherrer and Patou, and lastly, an olfactory tour. We are very honoured to have been able to set up this project in partnership with Marie Huet and Johann Vitrey [2] and with the support of the Comité Joséphine. So, to start afresh after summer holidays, Beyond Beauty will offer a real odyssey in honour of auteur perfumery, and we are happy to organize the very first rare perfume meeting in Paris! Premium Beauty News - What about Creative Beauty, the part of the show dedicated to suppliers? Claudia Bonfiglioli -  The area dedicated to the upstream part of the industry will definitely have its own place on the show! Ingredient and raw material suppliers, packaging and conditioning companies, formulators, private labels and OEMs, service providers for companies… they have all accepted the invitation. Exhibitors like B.Kolormakeup, Capsum, Baralan, Lablabo, Laboratoires Alpol, SICAF Laboratoires, Euro Vetrocap, and others will showcase their innovations and new expertise for major cosmetics groups and manufacturers to find inspiring ideas, new technologies and solutions to develop their product ranges. Premium Beauty News - In short, how would you define this new Beyond Beauty Paris show? Claudia Bonfiglioli –  This year, Beyond Beauty Paris will mix trends and innovation with a 360° vision: from manufacturers to end users, from Europe to Asia, and from brands to suppliers. Our exhibitor offer and our programme of conferences complement each other, so visitors will be provided with a global vision of what the beauty world will have to offer tomorrow. But this new Beyond Beauty Paris has also taken a new direction towards the world of Perfumes…"
Survey: The top ten beauty trends of the decade according to British women,"The British Association of Beauty Therapists and Cosmetology (BABTAC) survey revealed that women in the UK think defined brows are the most stylish beauty look of the past decade, confirming several previous market analyses showing the importance of this trend. Stars including UK supermodel Cara Delevingne and US actress Camilla Belle have championed the trend and sparked brow envy among beauty lovers. Contouring, a makeup technique made famous by reality TV star Kim Kardashian, was deemed the number two trend. The concept uses foundations and concealers of differing shades to subtly sculpt the face by enhancing features such as lips and cheekbones, while ’slimming’ other features such as the nose. Dark ‘berry’ lips claimed third place in the survey, with the Nineties-style look proving popular with beauty lovers today. This was followed by the classic red lip look, with smokey eyes proving to be the fifth most popular trend. Other looks that made the top 10 list include winged eyeliner, glossy lips, nude lips and drawn-on beauty spots. The least popular trend at number 10 was the natural look. A total of 2,844 British women aged 18-73 took part in the survey, with the majority claiming to have learned the techniques through trial and error. More than half confessed to watching YouTube tutorials online to improve their skills.  This probably explains the success makeup sessions proposed by many brands and retailers.

Digitally-influenced sales to reach US$2.2 trillion by year-end,"Digital interactions are expected to influence 64 cents of every dollar spent in retail stores in the United States by the end of 2015, or US$2.2 trillion, according to Deloitte Digital’s latest study, “Navigating the New Digital Divide.”  This figure has grown considerably from 14 cents of each dollar spent in brick-and-mortar stores in 2012, the first year Deloitte Digital conducted the annual study.  A major shift that Cosmetics Europe President, Loïc Armand, recently pointed as a “a real change of paradigm”. Deloitte Digital defines “digital influence” as the percentage of traditional brick-and-mortar retail sales impacted by shoppers’ use of digital devices. Deloitte Digital has also identified a growing digital divide where consumers’ digital behaviours and retailers’ ability to deliver on those consumer expectations continue to diverge. “Retailers often use the wrong metric–e-commerce sales–to indicate whether their digital strategy is working,” says Kasey Lobaugh, principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP and Deloitte Digital’s chief retail innovation officer. “Last year, e-commerce sales represented US$300 billion, or just seven per cent, of total retail sales, while digitally-influenced store sales were over five times higher. Retailers that prioritize and design digital functionality with the sole purpose of driving sales in the e-commerce channel marginalize the consumer experience and risk ceding authority to competitors.” While the upward trend in overall digital usage has accelerated, this year’s study uncovered dramatic new behaviours. Among consumers who use digital devices to shop: – Mobile influence is up, but price checking is down. Actually, consumers are advancing in their sophistication-using mobile more often for inspiration and idea generation earlier in their shopping process, and not simply as a price comparison vehicle.
– Digitally-influenced consumers buy more and spend more. Consumers who use digital while they shop convert at a 20 per cent higher rate compared to those who do not use such devices. Consumers that access social media during the shopping process are four times more likely to spend more, and almost one-third (29 per cent) of those surveyed are more likely to make a purchase the same day they turn to social media before or during their shopping trip.
– Not all categories are equal. Digital behaviour has evolved across all categories, most notably baby/toddler and home furnishings.
– Consumers are hunters, not gatherers, once they arrive at the store.  Nearly 8 in 10 consumers (76 per cent) surveyed interact with brands or products before arriving at the store. Shoppers now make buying decisions at other points, and even make purchases online to pick up in store.  “Retailers that fail to measure the influence of digital along the entire path to purchase can miss key indicators of performance and customer behaviour. Retailers should focus on designing and building customer experiences that play to how their customers are shopping for their products - rather than direct consumers to the point of purchase if what they really seek is inspiration or information,” concludes Jeff Simpson, director, Deloitte Consulting LLP and co-author of the study."
Lipstick shade preferences around the world,"Heathrow Airport has just teamed up with World Duty Free - one of Europe’s leading travel retailers - to release its first “International Lipstick Colors of the Year” report, lifting the lid on beauty trends in the world’s 50 most stylish destinations, from Moscow to Sao Paulo, through London, Paris and New York. The variety of the results is somewhat surprising. In London, for example, the colour du jour is ""Caramel Nude"" — the linchpin of the city’s easy-going makeup vibe (think off-duty model). Beauty lovers in the UK capital team their lippy with a strong, groomed brow and a flush of bronzer, with lightly tousled hair. The key is to not look like you’ve tried too hard. Things couldn’t be more different over the pond in New York, where, according to the report, the classic ""Bright Red"" lip is still going strong. Polished, sassy and iconic, this is a look that women in the Big Apple are ‘dressing down’ with low-key eyes and a sleek blow-dry. Glamorous Dubai calls for a sultry feminine aesthetic — which explains the popularity of ""Rose Pink"" in the UAE. Inspired by recent catwalk looks from Tom Ford and Yves Saint Laurent, this colour can easily be vamped up with a smudgy dark eye and big hair for extra attitude. Asian skins require a slightly different hue, so it’s no surprise that ""Sheer Coral"" is the most popular lipstick shade for travellers going to Shanghai. Makeup fans out East are wearing this look with a bold cat eye and a stripe of bright colour underneath the bottom lashes. Finally it’s over to Paris, where the low-key London approach is being given a French twist in the form of ""Dusky Rose"" lipstick. Parisian women, who hate to look too made up, are rocking this feminine shade with just a dot of blusher and beautifully clear skin. To see download the report and see the most popular lipstick colours for travellers to the full 50 destinations, see here."
The European cosmetics and personal care market shows signs of recovery,"The European cosmetics industry has returned to growth in 2014, with sales rising by +0.5% in value, according to figures from Cosmetics Europe, compared to a decrease of 1.4% in 2013. The European market retail size [1] is thus equivalent to 72.5 billion euros total, about one third of the global market. Germany remains the main market in Europe (13,12 billion euros), followed by France (10,58 billion euros), the United Kingdom (10,40 billion euros) and Italy (9,39 billion euros). However, the four major European markets have recorded contrasted performances in 2014. While the United Kingdom grew by 5.3%, growth in Germany was limited to 1.6% and that of France to 0, 1%. By contrast, Italy remained in recession (-1.4%), as well as Spain (-1.3%). With the exception of hair care products (-0.2%) all product categories have risen in value, with colour cosmetics (+ 1.2%) and toiletries (+ 1.3%) being the most dynamic. Skin care and toiletries remain the most important product categories in Europe, followed by hair care and fragrances. Eventually, regarding external trade, France remains the largest exporter of cosmetics, well ahead of Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. According to Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics and personal care industry employs approximately 1,700,000 people including 25,000 scientists.  Over the past five years, the industry has been able to grow direct and indirect employment by 2.3% or more than 39.000 workplaces."
"Well-being, good looks: comparative views on the latest beauty and food trends","Premium Beauty News - It seems beauty is being redefined, and well-being and vitality are playing an increasingly significant role in determining what is desirable and sexy. Leila Rochet-Podvin - Today, more than ever, beauty is a passport in contemporary life, as shown with the more and more narcissistic development of society, where self-image gets shared online, in particular among “digital natives”. However, good looks are now intimately linked with well-being. Beauty is no longer only superficial, it is transcended. The new Grail is the naturally beautiful, healthy beauty, which is becoming the new definition of glamour. This can be seen with the boom of “wellness gurus” (Chico Shigeta in Japan, Henri Chenot in Italy, Dr Howard Murad in the United States) and new rising icons, the “healthy stars” that are now very regularly followed on social networks (Erin Heatherton, a yoga enthusiast, Jessica Alba, creator of The Honest Company, Gwyneth Paltrow, author of “All is good” and blogger for Goop, Elle Macpherson, creator of the new Super Elixir, a wellness supplement…). Béatrice de Reynal - More and more women and men know that what they eat, live, move… can be read on their skins and faces, but also in the way they move and are. Beauty is becoming holistic. It is the synthesis of a nutritional balance, a certain quality of life, food, skincare, and physical, intellectual, and spiritual activity… Beauty is the living part of our bodies: it can be seen, worked on, modulated, magnified. Premium Beauty News - You have identified no less than six trends categorized under three main themes: anti-industry, neo-industry, supra-industry. Is this the relationship with industrial modernity that best defines new consumption attitudes? Leila Rochet-Podvin – It is the age of hyperconnection and uncertainty about our (economic and global) world. Former (vertical, rigid, standardized) consumption patterns are changing. Consumers are turning more evanescent, polymorphous, and paradoxical – they have been revolutionizing the way they consume. So, we have defined three main trends to classify the changes in our industrial model, which are common to the food and beauty worlds: 1/ ANTI-INDUSTRY (by contrast with the mass model: it corresponds to a reinvention of the world around purity, nostalgia, and frugality) 2/NEO-INDUSTRY (which draws from the advantages of modern society to offer us more, for a more nomadic, YOLO – You Only Live Once – consumption model) and 3/ SUPRA-INDUSTRY (a more scientific, predictive, or even integrative trend, thanks to the power of new technologies, which also makes room for human beings). Béatrice de Reynal - However, paradoxically, nutrition and skincare are gradually becoming hypertechnical, ultra-sophisticated, extremely powerful, and all modern technologies like connector or scientific technologies, genetics, metabolomics, electronics and others are used to preserve and display the naturalness in each and every one of us. Premium Beauty News - You have wished to emphasize the synergies between nutrition and cosmetics in particular. This can be seen with active ingredients, but what about finished products? Leila Rochet-Podvin - Today, beauty, health, and well-being are intimately related, and we feed our bodies the same way we feed our skins. When a young woman is asked what is most important to have a beautiful skin, she answers “drink water!” first. Béatrice de Reynal -  Our skin mirrors our health: it is an open book on our health, but also our personality, doubts and moods… Nourishing our beauty from the inside is an art that requires instinct, but also know-how. Premium Beauty News - On the contrary, the boundaries between the various universes are more rigid at the regulatory level. There is no legal definition of cosmeto-food, for example. What are the consequences? Katia Merten-Lentz -  Law is quite “rigid” by nature. It evolves slowly, once professionals are already well-advanced on innovations and have set the tone for a new current. No doubt this is what will happen with cosmeto-food, if the trend gets confirmed. To this day, there is no legal definition of cosmeto-food: it is a bit like ten years ago, when we started talking about functional foodstuffs. However, the sector is regulated by the food’s legal framework (labelling, advertising, and claims). And yet, significant areas of uncertainty remain as regards the way the EFSA reacted to the first marketing authorization applications for cosmeto claims… scientific demonstrations are going to have to be VERY solid! Premium Beauty News - Within this context, you are encouraging brands to be bold and give meaning to their products. Leila Rochet-Podvin -  First, we invite brands to view things from a wider perspective, rather than just consider their own market and competitive sphere. Consumers are not split up like our industry. We should not stay stuck in our own worlds! What is occurring in the food sector has strong implications in the beauty world and should no longer be ignored. Besides, we are living in a great era, where anything is possible. In addition to ethical values, consumers have never left as much room for boldness and creativity. The road is wide open for innovation! Béatrice de Reynal -  Our stomachs are getting smaller shares. People eat less, but want to eat better: better for health, for beauty, for pleasure. Cosmeto-foods have now become reality, and we should not miss this opportunity to satisfy demanding consumers who want to have it all: beauty, good taste, and pleasure."

Global UV nail gel market to reach US$ 59.31 million by 2020,"UV gel nails are artificial extensions worn on the fingertips, and they use ultraviolet light to cure the gel during the application process. Usually, the gel stays intact for minimum three weeks without chipping and gives a natural look. The UV nail gel market is projected to record a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% between 2015 and 2020, according to a recent report by Markets and Markets [1].  The global UV nail gel market is therefore expected to reach 59.31 million US dollars in 2020. North America dominated the global UV nail gel market in 2014 and accounted for over 53% of the market size, in terms of value, followed by Europe.  In terms of individual countries, the market is dominated by U.S. on account of increased demand for innovative and efficient products, followed by the U.K.. The rest of the world is expected to witness the highest CAGR during the next five years due the low base effect. Brazil in particular should emerge as the world’s fastest-growing UV nail gel market. However, Asia-Pacific - primarily driven by Japan and China - is expected to witness a prominent growth rate due to the increasing fashion awareness and increase in per capita income. According to the market research firm, the key factors driving the growth of UV nail gel market include: the growth of the nail care industry, advanced technology in fashion, affordability and durability, growth of U.S. nail industry, and preference of gel over acrylics.  The efficiency and superior properties of UV nail gel also contribute to fuel the demand. However, restraints for UV nail gel markets are exposure to UV light, high competition from nail polish major players and use of acetone while removal of nail gels. Methacrylate is the most commonly consumed UV nail gel, accounting for 95% share of the total market size, in terms of value in 2014. Actually, the main utility of using UV nail gel is its durability, which is hardly possible without methacrylate. Methacrylate is followed by acrylate with a market share of 5% in the same year."
What are the assets of skincare brands in France and the USA?,"When asked about their main expectations regarding a skincare product, US consumers massively opt for moisturization. ""The US market appears less sophisticated compared to France or even China where specific treatments appear much demanded by consumers.  In China, in particular, specific treatments are boosted by the success of stain removers and lightening products,"" said Philippe Jourdan, the founder and CEO of Promise Consulting Inc. Being an American brand is a definite asset in the US market, as local brands record higher scores on all criteria: brand value, awareness and market share. In France too, domestic brands record higher scores than foreign brands. The brand DNA is another important factor of success in the skincare market.  Both in France and in the USA, skincare specialists (Clinique, Clarins) dominate the market. However, luxury brand Lancôme performs well on both sides of the Atlantic. As far as China is concern, luxury remains the most important factor of success, with Chanel, Estee Lauder Shiseido forming the top three. ""In the US market the importance of being a specialist is mainly based on two criteria: the awareness and image. In France, being a beauty specialist is also a plus in terms of awareness, but this is less true in terms of image. The advantage of specialization is therefore more fragile in France,"" highlights Philippe Jourdan. In the eye of consumers, the most important features are: texture, high quality and efficiency / value for rice are the key assets for skincare products. However, one can note the importance of femininity in China. In France, the importance of good value for price is emerging as an important asset. ""French women want efficiency, but not at any price,"" explains Philippe Jourdan. Eventually, while the investment in branding appears highly correlated with market share in the US, this is less true in France where expert brands post good performances in terms of sales but show lower scores in terms of image."
Small-size beauty products appeal to French consumers,"Skincare, fragrance or makeup: all prestige beauty categories are concerned by this French craze for compact formats. According to The NPD Group, there are three key factors to explain this success: the price (a small size perfume costs between 40 and 45 euros vs. an average 62 euros for a 50 ml), the travel size format is in line with the needs of modern life, and the possibility to give in to the temptation to test new products at a lower cost. As far as fragrances are concerned, both the perfumery classics and the most recent launches have adopted the new sized packaging, aiming at attracting greatest numbers. In 2014, sales of feminine fragrances in 21-30 ml bottles recorded a 1% increase in units when the overall market fell by 2%. The situation is similar for men’s fragrances, with an increase of sales by 2% in units in 2014 for small formats while the whole segment decreased by 5% over the same period. “Small size products allow to target different buyers, which are less loyal to brands and are looking for new products,"" highlights Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. “This is a real lever for growth and the trend has been accelerating sharply in the first quarter 2015, with sales of women’s fragrances in bottles of 30 ml and less growing by 8% while the 31-44 ml male fragrances generated a 10% surplus of units sold compared to last year."" Makeup items also ride this trend, which is probably fuelled by the success of beauty boxes in this sector. For instance, The NPD Group points out the success of makeup kits usually offering a number of trial size products. After a harsh period, 2-in-1 products are also making their come back with sales increasing by 59% in units in 2014. The small-size revolution is also underway in the premium anti-aging skincare category. According to The NPD Group, sales of 30 ml and less formats grew by 9%, both in units and in value in, 2014. ""It’s a small segment within the entire anti-aging market (4% of units sold) but it has a high growth potential,"" concludes Mathilde Lion."
Natural and organic cosmetics appeal to Asian consumers,"Asia has one of the fastest growing markets for natural and organic cosmetics.  According to market research firm Organic Monitor, sales revenues are projected to exceed 1 billion U.S. dollars in the coming years [1]. “The largest market is in China,” highlights Organic Monitor. “In spite of many green brands boycotting the Chinese market, it remains the most prominent in Asia. High-end brands are coming into the Chinese market, attracted to the rising purchasing power of its consumers. Japan has the second largest market for natural and organic cosmetics in Asia.” With a broader definition of natural and organic cosmetics, Future Market Insights values sales of these products in ASEAN countries [2] only to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2014 and expects it to reach 4,4 billion U.S. dollars by 2020, reflecting a CAGR [3] of 9.5%, according to. “The ASEAN organic cosmetics market is expected to account for nearly 6.6% of the global organic cosmetics market by 2020,” says the company in a recent report [4]. Thailand and Indonesia, accounted for 53.8% of the ASEAN natural and organic cosmetics market in 2014.  Thailand is expected to dominate the overall ASEAN Organic cosmetics market, accounting for 29.3% market share by 2020. However, Singapore is expected to record highest CAGR 9.8% followed by Malaysia. According to Organic Monitor, concept stores are the most important channel for natural and organic cosmetics. “Many brands - Western and Asian - are opening stand-alone stores or salons for their brands. The American company Aveda is the frontrunner, operating concept salons across Asia. A growing number of Asian brands, such as Forest Essentials, are also investing in concept stores to raise visibility and awareness of their product ranges,” explains the company. In the ASEAN, the franchise outlet is expected to post double-digit growth and emerge as the dominating distribution channel for natural and organic cosmetic products. According to Future Market Insights, Department stores are predicted to hold second position in terms of CAGR. As the market is taking off, Organic Monitor finds greenwashing a major challenge for natural and organic brands in Asia.  “Asia is rife with brands making false natural / organic marketing claims, with some placing fake logos and symbols on product packs. As a consequence, there is a high level of consumer confusion about natural and organic cosmetic ingredients. Marketing is another major hurdle, with many brands not effectively communicating their green credentials,” points out Organic Monitor. As a consequence, standards are becoming increasingly important, with a growing number of brands taking the certification route and many organic retailers requesting certification to ‘legitimise’ marketing claims of brands.  According to Organic Monitor, Ecocert standards are the most popular, having the highest adoption rate amongst Asian brands."
Global consumer confidence increases in 2015,"Global consumer confidence was up during the first quarter of 2015, according to the Nielsen Global Survey of Consumer Confidence and Spending Intentions [1]. “While confidence across global regions remained relatively stable in the first quarter, there is considerable variation across different markets,” said Louise Keely, senior vice president, Nielsen, and president, The Demand Institute. “In the first quarter of this year, the key emerging markets of Brazil and Russia saw large declines in confidence for the second consecutive quarter, with the drop in oil prices and the political instability in Brazil. China dropped another index point at the start of this year, which comes after a four-point decline in the previous quarter, reflecting the recent slowdown in GDP there.” Confidence increased slightly or remained stable in every region except Latin America. For instance, consumer confidence remained steady in North America (106) and increased one point in Asia-Pacific, posting the highest quarterly regional index score of 107. Confidence in the Middle East/Africa (96) and Europe (77) edged up one point in the first quarter, but decreased two points in Latin America (86) - the region’s lowest score since 2011. However, global discretionary spending intentions declined or remained steady in the first quarter across all lifestyle categories measured. About three-in-10 global respondents (32%) planned to spend on holidays/vacations, new clothes (31%) and out-of-home entertainment (28%), quarterly declines of two, three and two percentage points, respectively. Global saving intentions, on the other hand, showed a slight increase from fourth-quarter 2014. About half of global respondents planned to bank their spare cash (48%). U.S. consumer confidence increased slightly in the first quarter, mainly driven by increased optimism regarding job prospects, while personal finance sentiment and immediate spending intentions declined. In Canada, confidence declined to reach the country’s lowest score since 2012. Europe remained the least optimistic region globally, but there were several signs that green shoots were sprouting. Job confidence rose in 15 of 32 markets, while respondent’s personal financial outlook increased in 18 from fourth-quarter 2014. Confidence for immediate spending intentions, while still comparatively low, increased in 19 markets. Italy and Greece, two of the regions debt-ridden and recession-battered countries, both showed confidence increases of 12-points in the first quarter. Italy’s score of 57 was the highest for the country since 2011, and Greece posted a confidence reading of 65 - its highest level since 2009. In the region, only Germany (100) and Denmark (106) reached the optimism baseline level. They were also the only two countries in the region where half (50%) of respondents were confident about immediate spending intentions. Several other countries posted their highest confidence scores in several years: The U.K.’s score of 97 reached the highest level since 2006; Ireland (92) reached its highest since 2008, Spain (67) reached its highest since 2010, and Portugal (59) reached its highest since 2006. Conversely, ongoing geopolitical tensions between Russia and the Ukraine likely contributed to new confidence lows reported in these countries. Russia’s index fell for the second consecutive quarter to 72, a level lower than its confidence reading at the height of the Great Recession, and the Ukraine’s score dropped 11 points to 41 in the first quarter."
"Beauty devices still have room for growth in the U.S. but face many challenges, says Mintel","US women are most likely to associate cleansing (44%) and exfoliating (55%) benefits with skincare devices, as opposed to topical skincare products. However, while innovation around lower-priced items continues, many devices remain out of reach for the average female consumer, according to Mintel latest report on beauty devices in the USA [1]. Current users of skincare devices skew young, particularly for cleansing brushes which are most popular among US women age 18-24 due to several factors including skin needs (i.e. oily, more acne prone) and a general tendency to be more engaged in the beauty category. As may be expected, household income is a significant category driver, with those in the US$75K+ groups reporting above average usage of skincare devices. Across the board women agree that price remains a significant barrier when it comes to purchasing a skincare device. While innovation continues around lower-priced devices, many are still priced higher than the optimal price range for women (around US$50), according to Mintel data. More encouraging for the industry is that skincare devices have a broader audience among women who are interested in trying out new products, suggesting that the device market has room to grow. Incidence of skincare devices is low, with only a small percentage of women reporting usage across devices. For example, 6% of women have used a laser device and only four per cent have used an airbrush makeup applicator in the last year. Cleansing brushes generate the highest usage rates with 13% of US women stating they have used a sonic cleansing brush in the last year. While trial is low, interest in skincare devices is strong. Consistent with higher usage and awareness, both sonic (34%) and rotating (33%) cleansing brushes generate some of the highest levels of interest. Interestingly, despite very low usage, skin massagers produce the strongest interest among women with 36%. Outside of replacement (49%), cleansing brush users are motivated to purchase new devices by a variety of factors including special offers (28%), reviews (28%) and family/friend recommendations (26%). When asked what the top reasons for purchasing a beauty care device, 36% of US women referenced trying a product out and liking the results, while 30% were impressed with product results on someone they know. While women are seeking information, the in-store experience also remains important. Regardless of product type, skincare device shoppers are most likely to cite mass merchandisers as their top destination for beauty devices (55%). Online retailers are also a popular choice for 35% of beauty product shoppers, while 13% prefer to browse beauty products online and buy in-store, according to Mintel data. The next evolutions in skincare devices are coming in the form of technology and products that promise new benefits. According to Mintel Trend Second Skin, wearable technology is going beyond allowing consumers to be hands-free, it’s helping people to monitor their health, and even maintain their appearance. “We’re seeing innovation in the category in two specific areas: tech and benefits claims. The latest innovations in skincare devices include mobile apps, smart devices and wearable technology, including cleansing brushes with a microchip that adjusts speed and cleansing time based on the user’s skin needs and an iPhone-connected device that uses transdermal skin imaging to develop a customized skincare routine,” explains Shannon Romanowski, Senior Beauty & Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. “For consumers looking to target specific skincare needs, innovation comes in the form of benefit claims like wrinkle reduction or hair removal,” she adds."
"“Customers in the Middle East are demanding, very connected, always seeking novelty”, Antoine Joujou, Chalhoub Group","Premium Beauty News - How is your Perfume-Cosmetics business doing in the Middle East? Antoine Joujou - The beauty sector represents 47% of our activity. It is a real growth driver on this market. Since the local population usually wears traditional clothes, makeup and perfumes are used to differentiate oneself, and people pay particular attention to them. The group is specialized in three fields, fashion, lifestyle and beauty, the latter being the most flourishing sector for us. This market has a huge potential in the Gulf countries, as it showed an 8.8% growth between 2013 and 2014 – and it is keeping up the pace. The main local consumers spend between 400 and 500 dollars per month on average on beauty products, and about 1,100 dollars per month on oriental perfumes, bakhoor oriental oils, and Western perfumes. Premium Beauty News – What growth has the Chalhoub group achieved on this market? Antoine Joujou - On the one hand, the Chalhoub group is the main distributor, with a very broad portfolio of international brands like Coty, Dior, or Puig; on the other hand, it works with retail stores such as Sephora and L’Occitane. It also invested in the creation of its own concept, Wojooh, which corresponds to local needs and aspirations. In 2014, Wojooh developed its own makeup line, “Wow by Wojooh”, which is mainly dedicated to oriental women. The perfume and cosmetics activity of the group (Distribution + Retail) has been rising over the last few years, exceeding 10% per year. This year, we are expecting a strong growth, but less important than the previous years. Several factors contribute to the growth of the beauty sector on this market. Thanks to our research and development department, we constantly get relevant information about consumer trends and behaviour. This way, we can adapt our marketing strategies according to local consumers’ tastes and aspirations. Premium Beauty News - And how is the market changing exactly? Antoine Joujou - Perfumes remain the key category in the Middle East, as they represent more than 64% of market shares. However, we did find a gradual change in the makeup segment, which has grown by more than 20%. This partly results from the dynamism of brands like Make Up Forever and Benefit, but also from retailer private labels, which offer very attractive ranges (Sephora, Wow by Wojooh). In addition, the nail, eyebrow, and complexion sectors are booming, although the fastest-growing segment has always been the eyes. Skincare is still a bit behind, but it does have some potential, thanks to innovation-enhancing brands like Clarins, Lancôme, Clinique, etc. Premium Beauty News - Why have you renamed your Beauty label? Antoine Joujou -  We have changed the name of our Faces label for Wojooh, the literal translation of the word ‘Faces’, as it has always appeared on our logo, and it has always been used by our Saudi customers (our first market). This repositioning for Wojooh was part of a strategy to get closer to our customers and stand out against the competition. Our message is clear: we are proud of our roots, we are passionate about beauty, and most of all, we can provide beauty expertise in line with both our men and women customers’ expectations. Premium Beauty News - You have created your own makeup line, Wow by Wojooh; according to which criteria was it developed? Antoine Joujou - Wow by Wojooh was launched in September 2014 after a two-year development process focused on finding the best type of product, texture, colours, and long-lastingness for the Middle East market. We wanted to meet the specific needs of this market and its very demanding women consumers. The brand is completely ‘Made in Europe’, for more credibility in terms of product quality. It has made a very promising start, and the Wow by Wojooh brand received a warm welcome from our customers, exclusively in our stores. Premium Beauty News - Have you found local brands have been developing, in particular on the perfume segment? Antoine Joujou - We have observed a craze for the perfumes that best suit local customs (oud, amber, musk): they have known a growing success over the past few years. The offering is both local (Hind Al Oud, Designer Shaik, Khaltat…) and international, with more intense lines and private collections that prove very popular with our customers (Gucci, Armani, Givenchy, YSL…). Premium Beauty News - Have Western brands changed their approach? Have you noticed any effort to adapt, and with which priorities? Antoine Joujou - Indeed, brands are now increasingly trying to attract customers from the Middle East. They really have to make the effort to adapt to this market if they want to penetrate it and arouse its interest. Adaptation must be done from a communication angle first, by complying with rites and bans (images censored, messages considered too suggestive). Then the offering must comprise more adapted perfumes and, lastly, the concept of stores and services must be unique to the region. Middle East customers are very demanding, very connected, always seeking novelty and exclusivity. This is all the more true for the beauty market. Premium Beauty News - Is there any room for new brands? Antoine Joujou - Yes, there is. Novelty is one of the most important criteria for Middle East consumers, so there is certainly enough room for new entrants. It remains to be determined how to get established over the long term, while gradually reinventing oneself to keep that ‘novelty’ factor alive. Premium Beauty News - Are you thinking about extending the presence of your Wojooh network to other markets? Antoine Joujou – We are actually trying to broaden our perspectives. We think we can benefit from the influence of the Middle East on a few emerging markets that share the same interests, tastes, or customs as the Middle East, and on which our concept would have more impact than a global chain."
The potential for growth in the MEA & Turkish beauty markets,"The Middle East is very complex and diverse, therefore posing significant challenges to beauty brands. Political and economic instability is one of the major obstacles to beauty sales growth in countries such as Syria and Egypt, although Saudi Arabia and Iran are thriving. According to marketing consultancy Butterfly London, which works with beauty brands in the Middle East, the population is young [1] and eager to try new brands, in particular international high-end ones, such as Chanel, Gucci and Dior.  The premium segment accounts for 42% of sales in the Middle East, of which 42% is fragrance, haircare 25%, skincare 16% and make-up 16%. Andrea Visus, associate director, Butterfly London, commented on rise of the “digital self,” saying, “Saudi girls love to express themselves on social media. They have several Facebook accounts and separate social networking profiles showing different personalised looks. They learn make-up tricks just so they can look good on Facebook.”  Arabian men, too, tend to be extremely image conscious and a well groomed appearance denotes career success and social standing. Another aspect of consumer behaviour in the region is that traditions are strong and beauty secrets are passed from mother to daughter. As a result, staple products, such as bar soap, standard shampoos and toothpaste have high sales, according to Euromonitor in its analysis of the Middle East and Africa. Yet, it is the increasingly sophisticated youth demographic, growing urbanisation and the rise of the middle classes that is driving growth in premium fragrances and skincare. The MEA region has the lowest per capita spend globally on haircare at just $3 per annum. Euromonitor registered haircare sales growth of 11% in 2014 and the category represented 6% of the global market. The largest haircare market was Iran at $830m, followed by Turkey with $790m and Saudi Arabia, worth $650m. All witnessed double digit growth in 2014. Haircare sales in Israel were lower at $290m but its $36 per capita spend was the highest of any MEA country. Global brands from P&G and Unilever dominated sales value, though local brands were popular due to their lower price point. Conditioning and repair, oil/keratin and natural/organic/bio products were strong across all price bands. Halal cosmetics is a growth category, not only in the Middle East, but also in Europe, where Muslims account for 5-10% of the population. Halal certification requires adherence to the strict laws of Islam and there are many different Halal labels used across the world. For instance, there are five large Halal certifiers in Germany, and state based systems in Indonesia, Turkey and Iran, making it essential for brands to know their target market before launching Halal products."
The 20th edition of FCE Cosmetique highlights the Brazilian market dynamics,"Now representing the world’s third largest cosmetics market, Brazil is banking on a continued growth of over 10% per year (+11.8% in 2014, according to the ABIHPEC), which could make it reach the second rank by 2020, behind the United States. However, the two-digit growth should be put into perspective, as the inflation has been quite significant for a while (+6.40% in 2014, and it might reach 7.5% in 2015, according to the IMF, before declining). According to the organizers, the two joint events gathered about 500 exhibitors, local and international ingredient, packaging, formulation, and tailor-made manufacturing suppliers, as well as industrial equipment manufacturers, whose presence illustrated both the innovation and trends presented to the 17,000 professional visitors expected. This edition highlighted the boom of several Brazilian players like Nanovetores, resulting from the craze for encapsulated actives on the market. The company is specialized in the encapsulation of natural actives in an aqueous environment, and came to introduce a wide range of ingredients and fragrances encapsulated in 200 to 300-nanometer particles designed to make it easier to apply face, body, and hair care products as well as textiles. As for sampling, the Brazilian company Adhespack showcased its new Self Sampling line, a whole set of automated sample distributors intended either for points-of-sale or event hosting. Then, the Arcade Beauty Group - created by the merger between Arcade and Bioplan - unveiled its new name and logo exclusively at FCE, as well as Proteo, a travel-size 50ml pack designed and developed in Brazil by Aptar. Arcade Beauty took care of the industrialization of the bag and filling. Once again this year, international tailor-made manufacturers took an active part in the event. Intercos and Weckerle were there, and Fareva Chromavis exhibited their new skincare line for the first time: Mystical Treatments is a series of formulas developed and produced to meet the specific needs of the Brazilian market. Among ingredient suppliers, Solabia, the French company established in Brazil, showcased its range of ingredients derived from the biomass of different Brazilian regions (Amazonia, Brazilian pampas, Cerrado, Mata Atlântica). And SEPPIC presented its brand new application laboratory dedicated to the Brazilian market. As the historical partner of FCE Cosmetique, the ABC (Associação Brasileira de Cosmetologia) jointly held its 28th Brazilian Congress of Cosmetology. Both professionals and scientists were able to spend the three days of the show discussing the main themes inherent to the technical developments of the industry: regulation-related issues, the increase in importance of the sun care segment, and the boom of nanotechnologies. Although it is challenged by the recent advent of specialized shows (In-cosmetics Brasil, MakeUp in Sao Paulo), FCE Cosmetique features all the segments of the industry and is to remain a key annual event for most Brazilian professionals. “This event has a huge potential; it is relevant to the market and information on all levels is available here”, underlines Ligia Amorim, Managing Director of NürnbergMesse Brasil, the event organizer."
"Hair care: Sales in independent salons confirm the granny and co-washing trends, finds Kline","According to data from Kline PRO, a product-level database published quarterly by market research and consulting firm Kline in partnership with the Professional Beauty Association (PBA), hair colorant sales within the bright and silver shade groups are up 46% and 14%, respectively, in 2014.  “The ‘granny trend’ of women of all ages colouring their hair shades of silver and grey is more than a media craze,” explains the market research firm. The Kline PRO’s panel currently features about 1,000 independent salons and 8,500 chain salons.  Kline said to plan to double the number of independent salons by the end of 2015, with the eventual goal being 3,000 independent salons.  According to Kline, the data on independent salons is of particular interest to the industry’s players, as this segment is harder to track and get a read on, yet is often the place where new brands and product trends appear first. Another trend validated by this data set is co-washing or “conditioner-only washing”, which is the practice of cleansing one’s hair with conditioner instead of shampoo.  The purpose of co-washing is to preserve the natural oils of the hair while still gently cleansing. Data from the Kline PRO panel shows that the clarifying segment of conditioners - a type of conditioner that co-washers tend to prefer - has been growing exponentially. “While still nascent and accounting for less than 1% of total conditioner sales in 2014, the clarifying segment posts the highest growth of all conditioner types in independent salons. Ouidad’s Curl Co-Wash is among the leading items in the segment,” highlights Kline. Functional hair care, or products that provide specific performance-oriented benefits like restoring hair or imparting shine, is another area where Kline PRO is reporting significant growth. In independent salons, products that address thinning hair increase by 22% in shampoos and 12% in conditioners in 2014. Nioxin, the leader within the thinning segment in the U.S., jumps 22% in shampoo sales. Sizable gains are likewise recorded by the Kevin Murphy Plumping line, ranking it third in dollar share in the thinning segment of both shampoos and conditioners. Other products contributing to growth in the functional hair care space include Pureology’s Strengthcure in the repair/condition segment, the launch of Oribe Gold Lust Repair & Restore collection, and Redken’s Blonde Idol and Color Extend lines in the colour care segment. Meanwhile, hair oils is an area that is losing some steam, with sales down 6% in chains and 5% in independents in 2014. Although the segment, which was pioneered by Moroccanoil, has reached maturity, some items experience rapid sales growth in 2014, including Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser’s Invisible Oil, which triples in dollar volume."
"“We must determine the type of customer experience needed in the digital world”, William Koeberlé","Premium Beauty News - You have announced modernizing the selective distribution contract would be your priority throughout your mandate. What are your challenges? William Koeberlé - The regulation came into force in 2012 for a period of ten years, which takes us to 2022. It may seem far ahead, but one has to start working on it now, because it is the one element that structures our whole business. To me, the main challenge is customer experience: the same quality criteria must be satisfied online and in-store. Customers have already changed a lot compared to the time when we were discussing the current regulation, and they will keep changing a lot. The number of online buyers and customers that check websites before they buy in-store has significantly grown in five years. More than 70% of selective distribution customers use the Internet to get both information about products, prices and new launches, and advice, in particular via blogs. We have found that the more customers go online, the more they buy in-store and online. In addition, we have worked a lot with our suppliers to standardize product technical sheets, especially to homogenize the information available. The conditions are now in place for us to determine the type of customer experience needed in the digital world. How should products be presented online? How should the tips given on products be provided? If we do not work on this, the only variable will be the price, and we will destroy the dream created by our products. Premium Beauty News - The current regulation requires for an online retailer to also have at least one physical store to be accredited. Do you think this requirement is threatened? William Koeberlé -  The question will inevitably be raised. To us, it is an important guarantee of service quality. Selective distribution provides products, but also advice, which means customers are listened to and can test products. But we have also found that customer behaviour changes very fast. Besides, the world of pure players is quite heterogeneous, and some of them are doing a good job. Our priority is to maintain the quality of customer experience, including on the web. As an example, the “click&collect” solution can be a very rich experience, if particular attention is paid to individuals, and personalized tips offered, when they pick up their orders from the store, or, by contrast, very poor and anonymous, if they have to collect their purchases from a box at a station. Hence the importance to define the criteria that will guarantee the quality of the buying experience in any circumstances. Premium Beauty News - You are saying the online customer experience is heterogeneous. But it seems selective distribution in Europe is very heterogeneous too! William Koeberlé -  The level of the services supplied is not even, but it is quickly getting more uniform. One has to be aware of the fact that traditions vary a lot depending on the country; sometimes the drugstore-perfume shop background is extremely far from the French standards from which the regulation was inspired. But everyone is catching up with France. Moreover, brands contribute to this levelling upwards. By opening subsidiaries in most of the European countries that used to be entrusted to agents, they were able to control their distribution channels more easily. And it also allowed for a certain convergence in terms of selling prices. These changes were all the more essential since our customers travel more and more. Premium Beauty News - Your other main priority is training. William Koeberlé - Here is another key element of customer experience. Again, the fact that customer behaviour changes a lot is a real challenge! What can we offer to customers that already deeply searched the web before they came to the store? How can behaviour and point-of-sale digitization be integrated? It is important to go back to a “training programme” strategy, and maybe draw inspiration from the excellent results of apprenticeship and systems where school courses are combined with work experience in countries like Austria or Switzerland. Premium Beauty News - How do you think the market is going to evolve? William Koeberlé - In 2014, the French market declined (according to NPD) by 0.6% in value, and 4.2% in volume. But it should always be reminded that these figures neither take into account online sales, nor those achieved by private labels – although they are the ones that have risen the most.  As for online sales, they have increased from 2% in 2008 to 5 or 10% today, depending on the brands. So, the market is actually showing some resistance, and is tending to grow in value, while remaining rather stable in volume, despite the arrival of new entrants like Kiko or textile brands, and the competition of players such as Yves Rocher or L’Occitane. Premium Beauty News - Don’t you think prices have increased a bit too much in selective perfumery? William Koeberlé -  The premium brands that have simultaneously increased their added value and prices are still growing in importance. They have managed to return to their DNAs, while reinventing their own codes and providing added value to their customers. Any rise must be justified by added value. However, the brands that were not able to do this, those that did not work or invest, but still increased their prices, are now bearing the brunt of the competition of private brands, whose offering has considerably widened, with very high quality ranges."
Hair care market shows healthy growth in the UK,"While the number of hair care products targeted at men has seen a sharp decline in the past year (-46% between 2013 and 2014 alone), new research from Mintel [1] has found that despite this, the men’s hair care market is continuing to grow. Sales grew from £59 million in 2013 to a predicted £60 million in 2014 (USD 92 million or EUR 83 million). This healthy growth is expected to continue with value sales forecast to rise to £68 million in 2019. Long hair has been a mainstay in men’s fashion and looks to remain. “This trend has resulted in increased revenue for the sector and offers further opportunities for the men’s hair care market to respond to changing fashions, with products designed to stimulate growth as well as manage longer hair. Styling brands could also offer tips and advice to encourage experimentation,” said Roshida Khanom, Senior Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. However, when it comes to hair, the top three concerns amongst men is thinning hair, with over a quarter (27%) claiming this is a concern, whilst 24% say they’re concerned about hair loss and one in five (17%) are worried about hair that is difficult to style.  Highlighting these concerns, Mintel’s research shows that when it comes to product innovation opportunities, a quarter (24%) would like to try products that stimulate hair growth, 23% would be interested in products that make hair easier to style, whilst one in five (21%) would be interested in products that thicken hair. “Hair loss is a universal concern for men, although the reasons for being concerned about hair loss may be different. Younger men may find it harder to retain hairstyles, or experiment with different hairstyles as they lose hair. For older men, being concerned about hair loss may be more about not wanting to look older. Products that stimulate hair growth will therefore appeal to men of all ages,” Roshida continues. When it comes to the women’s hair care market, Mintel’s research shows that consumers are trading up, with sales of prestige hair care products rising by 6% from £380 million in 2013 to £403 million in 2014 (USD 623 million or EUR 558 million). What’s more, this has followed an increase in prestige product innovation with the proportion of new product launches with a prestige price point increasing to 29% in 2014 from 18% in 2013. Overall, the women’s hair care market in the UK rose 2% in 2014 to £ 1.44 billion (USD 2,22 billion or EUR 2 billion), up from £ 1.41 billion in 2013. “Women are willing to spend money on perceived better quality products. The growth in online retailers in particular is facilitating a move to more expensive products, as women use price comparison sites to find luxury products at reduced prices, sparking a ‘spend money to save money’ mentality,” said Charlotte Libby, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. However, women are trading up to products with premium price points, the factors they feel have the biggest impact on appearance of hair it seems are primarily internal. Over half (57%) of UK women agreed that health, for example hormone levels, have a big impact in determining the appearance of hair, whilst a matching proportion (57%) said the same of diet, for example the consumption of fruit or vegetables or drinking enough water. In comparison, just a third (33%) agreed that the quality of ingredients found in hair care products had an important impact.  “Innovation in hair treatment claims can appeal to women looking to counteract and repair the effects of poor diet on the hair,” Charlotte concludes."
"The first ""MakeUp in Action"" will take place in Los Angeles on 10 and 11 February 2016","A one day and a half event, articulated around conferences in the form of plenary sessions, focused on information, but also specialized workshops - real training sessions on all current key issues related to the make-up sector today - and finally, of course, high-level B2B meetings.  ""An event, clearly, much awaited and even overwhelmingly supported by the entire professional make-up industry,"" highlighted officials at Beauteam. ""It’s true that we had also strongly anticipated the move,” explained Jean-Yves Bourgeois and Sandra Maguarian, “by organizing some months ago, conferences at MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York, on the West Coast exception.  A region, which has continued to prove in recent years, its dynamism and innovativeness. Truly a laboratory of its own, where startups have continued to flourish, to become major companies, eventually often acquired by large international groups. So much so, that a day does not go by without the opening of the sales office of a particular formulation company or a particular packaging manufacturer."" ""Four MakeUp in..., with a three-month interval: the formula looks consistent, efficient, inexpensive and convenient,"" highlighted Jean-Yves Bourgeois. ""And it is not about to change! On the other hand, there are other regions in the world that, one way or the other, prove their originality and dynamism in terms of research and developments. This make-up sector is anything but static. It is constantly evolving. The concept of MakeUp in Action is indeed the response matching this type of situation, with more than ever, this desire for exclusivity."" This first MakeUp in Action in Los Angeles should therefore reflect this hot bed of ideas and innovations that never stops on the West Coast. The exact venue and the full program will be announced in the next few days."
Distribution is key to the success of green brands,"In spite of high consumer interest, most sustainable products have low market share. For instance, natural products represent just 3% of personal care product sales in Europe. Organic foods generate 4% of total food sales in North America; the market share of ethical textiles and green household cleaning products is even lower in these regions, below 2%. According to Organic Monitor, a major factor behind the low market share is most green brands are focusing on specialist outlets. “Few natural personal care products are in mass market retailers, whereas the channel generates over a third of cosmetic and toiletry sales in the US.” Green brands need to ‘think outside’ specialist retail channels if they are to broaden appeal. Aveda, for instance, has also been successful in the natural personal care industry because of its distribution strategy. Aveda is positioned as a professional hair care brand in salons and Organic Monitorresearch shows it is the premier brand of natural personal care products, with distribution in over 7,000 salons. A major challenge for green brands is channel selection: what outlets to focus on? To add complexity, the success of sustainable products in some channels creates competition. For instance, private labels marketed by mass retailers often ‘cannabilise’ branded product sales. Indeed, in many cases, the leading brands of organic products in North America are owned by retailers. In Europe, DM drugstores’ Alverde has taken up high market share to become the leading private label of natural personal care products. Eventually, the complexities associated with distribution have led some green brands to set up their own retail networks. In the wake of The Body Shop, which pioneered the ethical retailer concept in the 1970s, a growing number of green brands such as Melvita and Korres are opening stores across the globe. Pioneering green brands / companies will be participating at upcoming 6th North American edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which will be hosted by Organic Monitor in New York on 14-16th May; they include Aveda, The Body Shop, Burt’s Bees, Léa Nature, Hain Celestial, etc."
Over 60 year olds still have to be convinced by anti-ageing products,"The highest number of “Later Lifers” can be found in Asia Pacific, where in 2014 there were 508 million people over 60. Much of this can be attributed to China, which is the fastest growing ageing market with over 60s forecast to grow by more than 46 per cent between 2014 and 2030. Japan already has the oldest population, with a massive 33 per cent aged over 60. Japan is a model on the impact of this demographic shift. Western Europe also has a number of older populations, with Germany just overtaking Italy in 2014 in this regard. While most developed markets are relatively old, the US remains quite young, due to high levels of immigration. As far as beauty and cosmetic products are concerned, a range of socioeconomic indicators, including growth in the population and stable disposable income, highlights the growth opportunities that the over 60 year old consumer group offers. Although a growing number of claims from skin care, hair care, sun care and colour cosmetics target signs of ageing, Euromonitor’s survey found that in the over 60 year old age group, bigger proportions of consumers use facial and body moisturisers without explicit anti-ageing claims. Only about 35 per cent of respondents on a global level stated that they used anti-ageing products in the three months prior to the survey. According to Euromonitor, there are gaps in the anti-agers market to address certain signs of ageing.  “Anti-ageing portfolios need to clearly segment the prevention / protection stages to target more mature consumers’ needs through reversing the signs of ageing and offering cell renewal properties, as, for example, L’Oréal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renew Night Cream has done.” Furthermore, only about one third of over 60 year olds have adopted a complex anti-ageing routine, and there is significant room to expand usage frequency in this growing and relative affluent consumer base.

"Skin care, Brazil and Asia drive the global cosmetics market, finds Euromonitor","The beauty industry remained largely resistant to strong economic and political headwinds, generating US $465 billion in sales in 2014, according to Euromonitor International latest data. With 5 per cent growth, the global market saw continued penetration of staple products in emerging markets, consumers upgrading to more superior products and the adoption of more extensive beauty routines across all product segments. China and Brazil remain the most promising markets with absolute growth expected to exceed US $10 billion by 2019.  However, strong growth is also expected in Indonesia and India, as well as in the United States and Saudi Arabia.  Argentina, Iran, Mexico, Thailand and Turkey also show excellent prospects for further growth. Skin care remains the largest segment across most markets, with global sales expected to reach over US $ 130 billion by 2019. “Of all beauty segments, consumers continue to spend most on skin care items at $15 per person annually, compared to US $10 for hair care and $7 for colour cosmetics,” said Euromonitor International’s Head of Beauty and Personal Care, Irina Barbalova. “One third of global beauty revenues by 2019 will come from skin care, compared to 23 per cent between 2009 and 2014.” Asian markets remain the main growth driver for skincare products.  According to Euromonitor, 80 per cent of global skin care revenue gains by 2019 will come from Asia, with China set to account for 75 per cent of the total regional absolute growth. “ Indonesia and India  will be the next growth frontiers to watch, with Indonesia expected to enter the top 10 global skin care markets by 2019,” added Barbalova. However, the skin care market is not only growing but also transforming in terms of product diversification and exploration of innovative growth concepts. According to Euromonitor, technological developments have encouraged a demand for personalisation and unique product engagement, and Asia continues to inspire innovation in terms of new formats, textures and product benefits."
Record attendance for the second edition of MakeUp in Seoul,"The organizers of the 2015 edition of the MakeUp in Seoul tradeshow can congratulate themselves!  Their forecasts, based on pre-registered visitors were confirmed by reality.  The tradeshow dedicated to the suppliers of makeup brands welcomed 2,300 visitors (+28% compared to 2014), with a very sharp increase in the number of international visitors coming not only from South-east Asia (including China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, The Philippines, Hong Kong, etc.) but also from Europe and the North and South American continents. “MakeUp in Seoul has become in just two editions, ""THE"" international meeting of the Asian make-up industry,” highlight the organisers, who were also extremely satisfied by the number of participants at the different conferences and round tables. “All major Korean and international brands had answered the call, at the level of speakers but also in terms of audience,” they add. Furthermore, on the occasion of this second edition of MakeUp in Seoul, a jury of experts awarded fourteen innovative products, which were presented to visitors during the two days of the show, hanging from the branches of a “tree of innovation” specially built for the occasion. Visitors entering the venue could not miss this tree, which set the tone of this second edition of MakeUp in Seoul. “Innovation was the one expected at each stand and at the heart of meetings and conversations between professionals. They had all made the trip for that and were not disappointed. Innovation, which was expressed on all stands, be it in terms of formulas applicators, packaging or accessories,” say the organizers. For the second consecutive year, the Amore Pacific Group, through one of its most prestigious brands, Hera, successfully organized its presence and animations at the heart of the show. Many international leading brands, both European and American, took advantage of the event to organize during the event and also at the event their R&D and marketing meetings. Because Korea has become in a few years ""the place to be"" not only in Asia but also in the world for a sector in search of innovative and quality products. During the cocktail organized on the evening of April 15, Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, the organisers of the event, did not fail to express their gratitude to the Korean people for “their welcome, enthusiasm, and the support they provided these past two years in the setting up of what has established itself as ""The"" unmissable appointment in the Asian beauty industry.”"
Anti-wrinkle creams increasingly target bright young things,"This week UK retailer Boots in-house brand No 7 is launching its new ""Early Defence Skincare"" range, which has been specially designed for women aged 20-35 who don’t need to worry about anti-aging just yet, but wish to keep young skin looking younger for longer. Consisting of Day, Night and Eye Creams, the series has been designed as a ‘stepping stone’ to help in the transition from everyday skincare to proactively delaying the signs of ageing. It features the brand’s patent-pending daily protection technology, ‘Double Defence’, which works in combination with UVA technology to protect skin from the sun and environmental stress. The technology contains a combination of ginseng and mulberry to combat superoxides produced as a result of exposure to sunlight or pollution, vitamin C and lipochroman and Vitamin E which are effective against singlet oxygen, an incredibly damaging free radical produced by UVA exposure. The creams also contain rice peptides and alfalfa, which are effective inhibitors of age-accelerating enzymes (MMPs) in the skin. ""Protecting your skin from the sun and environmental stress is really important, particularly if you want to proactively delay the signs of ageing,"" says Dr Mike Bell, Skincare Scientific Advisor for Boots UK. ""With Double Defence technology we have created a powerful and broad-spectrum antioxidant complex which has been designed to neutralize damaging free radicals that cause the skin oxidative stress, helping you to keep your skin looking younger for longer."" Women in their twenties and thirties are becoming an increasingly important target for beauty brands when it comes to anti-aging. L’Oreal Paris has proven that it’s never too early to start protecting skin with its Youth Code range of night and day creams, aimed at women aged 25-35 who want youthful-looking skin. Additional launches in recent years aimed at the demographic include Shiseido’s Ibuki range, designed to help skin resist the stresses of daily life, and Nuxe’s Nirvanesque range of ""First wrinkle creams"" for a pre-emptive approach to anti-aging."
"In the digital era, sample remains the most effective enrolment driver","In order to make a picture of typical buyers of prestige beauty consumers, vente-privee chose to focus on brand loyalty behaviours. In March 2014, the ecommerce company therefore interviewed 6029 women aged 18-54 years, in France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. All of them were vente-privee customers who purchased prestige cosmetic products during the last 12 months. The survey revealed two main types of consumers: the ""brand ambassadors"", who are rather loyal to brands and to the same skin care and makeup products, and representing 29% of the sample, and the ""brand explorers"", 32 % of the sample, who are more interested in new products. Mixed profiles, sharing characteristics of the two main types represent 39% of women surveyed.  ""There is no correlation between age belonging to one category or the other,"" said Catherine Spindler, Vente Privee’s Marketing Director.  ""Brand ambassadors tend to consume fewer products that brand explorers, and their purchasing behaviour is more thoughtful, while explorers are more impulsive,"" she added. The vente-privee survey also unveiled the central role now played by digital sources in consumer information. ""For the categories of consumers, digital is now the main source of information for getting information on prices, new products, and the opinions of other women,"" explained Catherine Spindler. Apart from purchasing, 85% of ""brand explorers"" and 76% ""brand ambassadors"" said they surfed the web in order to compare prices. Furthermore, 79% of ""brand explorers"" read the opinions written by other consumers, vs. 62% of "" brand ambassadors "". The behaviour of the two groups mainly differs in their choices regarding information sources. ""Ambassadors"" first head to the brands’ websites  (30% vs. 17%), while ""explorers"" prefer paying visits to communities (blogs, forums, tutorials, videos). Regarding enrolment drivers, the survey confirms the key role of samples: 71% of ""brand ambassadors"" and 77% of ""brand explorers"" say they would switch products after testing a sample that pleased them. ""Testing new products with samples is the first enrolment driver. Tests top consumers’ preferences for all product categories,"" Catherine Spindler said. Furthermore, makeup appears to be the most effective enrolment driver for loyal consumers. Indeed, 42% of “brand ambassadors” declared they would accept to change nail polish (vs 58% of ""explorers"") but only 10% would be ready to change from day cream (vs 40% of ""explorers""). More generally, the ""explorers"" are very sensitive to innovation, they watch advertisements, read magazines and blogs, and discover new products through boxes (21%). The ""ambassadors"" are more sensitive to the brand and look for reinsurance. However, price is an important issue for all women. The ""explorers"" are very sensitive to promotions, but even the most loyal ""ambassadors"" would consider changing product if it becomes too expensive. Eventually, vente-privee highlights that the results were the same in the four European markets which were surveyed."
Brazilian cosmetics market grew by 11% in 2014,"With sales of R$ 101.7 billion (USD 32.5 billion or EUR 29.6 billion), the sector recorded a nominal growth of 11% in 2014, compared to R$ 91.9 billion in 2013.  ""This performance is associated with important factors driving the country’s industry such as investment in innovation and advertising,” says João Carlos Basilio, President of the ABIHPEC. Brazil remains the world’s third largest consumer market for toiletries, perfumes and cosmetics, behind the United States and China, and far ahead from Japan, which ranks fourth. The Brazilian personal care industry represents more than 1.8% of the country’s GDP and 9.4% of the world’s consumption. As far as Latin America is concerned, Brazil’s market share exceeds 53%. ""Without a doubt, Brazil is a major power in Latin America. The main customers for Brazilian exports of cosmetic products are Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia, and hair products are the most exported ones,"" adds João Carlos Basilio. The perfumery segment totalises more than R$ 17.1 billion (5.4 billion dollars or EUR 4.9 billion). While sales of deodorants reached R$ 11.5 billion. The Brazilian population is becoming increasingly aware about risks linked to sun exposure, thus contributing to strong sales of sunscreen products, which reached R$ 4.1 billion (1.3 billion dollars or 1.2 billion euros) in 2014. Mintel estimates that the category will grow by 14% in 2015. ""Although Brazil was already a leader in sunscreens, last year we expanded our leading position to the entire sun care category,"" highlights João Carlos Basilio. Among the main categories in which Brazil stands as the world’s 2nd largest consumer products are men’s, children’s and hair care products. During the last five years, children’s products achieved a compound average growth of approximately 14%, raising sales to R$ 4.5 billion in 2014. For instance, Brazil is the leading consumer of hair care products for children, representing 24% of world’s consumption. Men’s grooming products account for almost 11% of the whole personal care consumption in Brazil. Sales doubled in size in the past five years and reached R$ 11.1 billion in 2014. The performance of the hair care market was similar. Driven by hair conditioners, hair colours and shampoos, which together represent 90% of the hair segment, Brazil recorded net sales of R$ 21.2 billion in 2014 (6.8 billion dollars or 6.2 billion euros), an increase of 11% compared to 2013."
The French cosmetics industry confirms its global leadership,"With a trade surplus of around 8.9 billion euros, the cosmetics sector is now France’s second biggest net exporter behind aeronautics (23.6 billion), but ahead the food industry (6.5 billion), according to figures released by the French trade association for cosmetics and beauty products (FEBEA) [1].  With an increase of 4% compared to 2013, exports of the cosmetic products are also those that have experienced the strongest growth in 2014, compared to the two other leading sectors (+2.5% for aeronautics and -8% for the food industry). For many years, France has been the world’s largest exporter of cosmetic products. The country held 15.9% of the market in 2013, ahead of the United States (10.8%) and Germany (10.7%). France is the leading European exporter in this sector, far ahead of its competitors. French cosmetics exports account for almost a third of all European exports, far ahead of Germany. Another example is the size of the French trade surplus in the cosmetics sector, which is more than 5 times bigger than the Italian surplus (1.16 billion euros in 2014). According to the FEBEA, these excellent results reflect “the richness and quality of the French cosmetics offer, which can meets the needs of a wide variety of markets and consumption patterns.” But where are French cosmetics shipped actually? Mostly to other European countries. Indeed, the European Union remains the first destination (48.2%) of exports. After Europe, Asia is the second destination for French cosmetics, with 16.9% of exports. Shipments to this region recorded the strongest growth (+11.7% in 2014, compared to the previous year) with China leading the way (+16.5%). France thus remains the largest cosmetics exporter in this region, despite intensive competition from other major players including Japan, Korea and the United States. Exports to the Middle East and to the United States also recorded significant increases: +7.1% and +7.6% respectively. Africa is growing slightly (+0.4%). By contrast, exports to Russia, Turkey and Latin America have decreased, in a context of ""economic and / or political and regulatory uncertainties,” said the FEBEA. Unsurprisingly, skin care products and perfumes represent 2/3 of French cosmetics exports (42.3% for skin care and 33.8% for perfumes) in value. They are followed by shampoos and hair preparations (for a total 6.6%) and by eyes and lips colour products (6.5%). ""This growth is driven by the dynamism of a whole sector and an industrial network including SMEs, intermediate-sized companies and large groups. The results recorded by the French cosmetics industry abroad in 2014 show that the reputation and quality of made in France cosmetics, often at the edge of innovation, remain appreciated worldwide,"" said Patrick O’Quin, President of the FEBEA. However, the dynamism of the French industry on international markets is also another indication of the increased dependency of the European cosmetics industry from external demand. While most European markets record a sluggish growth or a recession (sales of cosmetic products decreased by 0.8% in 2013 in Europe), European manufacturers have no choice but to seek growth where it is located."
Beauty Success opts for Africa to accelerate its international development,"Beauty Success, the fourth selective beauty network retailer in France, already operates a dozen stores outside metropolitan France. Without slowing its development in its home country, the company wants to carry on the expansion of its network by focusing on internationalization thanks to its concept, now ready for export. The partnership with CFAO should enable Beauty Success to open about twenty new stores in the coming years in different countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The shops will be open primarily in shopping centres operated by CFAO in countries such as Cameroon, Congo, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Senegal. The first beauty shop will open in September in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. For its international development, the company said it had given priority to “emerging countries recording high growth rates and structuring their retail environment.” The company intends to achieve this development in the same way that succeeded in France: by relying on local entrepreneurs interested in the franchise and master-franchise model and with a good knowledge of the perfume industry and beauty salons. For these African shops, Beauty Success will keep the architectural design as well as the same codes than in France. However, the product offer will be adapted to the country’s specificities and to local consumption habits. To ensure the transmission of its know-how, the company will provide the same training than in France, and will also propose intensive training periods in its French sales outlets. The partnership with CFAO will enable Beauty Success to settle in luxurious shopping malls alongside other European retailers who also joined the company’s brands pool, such as shoemaker San Marina, chocolate seller Jeff de Bruges, or food chains El Rancho and Baïla Pizza."
Seasonality is becoming a key trend of the beauty market,"The growth of cosmetic products developed to offer a targeted defence against the effects of specific weather conditions has been considerable over recent years.  According to Mintel, over the past three years, seasonal products accounted for as many as 11.1% of all beauty and personal care launches in 2014, up from 9.8% in 2011.  What’s more, seasonal facial skincare launches rose from 0.5% of global launches in 2009 to 1.2% in 2014. “Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of - and concerned about - how changes in the environment are affecting the condition of their skin and hair. Already, beauty manufacturers have started to go beyond taking simple seasonal approaches geared to public holidays or gifting occasions and instead are taking on the elements within their product innovation,” explains Jane Henderson, Global President of Mintel’s Beauty and Personal Care Division at Mintel. Highlighting a gap in the market, Mintel’s exclusive consumer research reveals the strong global consumer demand for skincare launches that tap into changing seasons. Some four in five (80%) German consumers claim their facial skin needs change throughout the year and almost half (48%) of Chinese female facial skincare users choose products from different brands in different seasons. “A new generation of winter care products offer additional care and hydration for the skin. These tend to target dry or very dry skin and mention cold, dry weather. However, the future will see the arrival of boosters that address cold, damp weather as well as the extremes of dryness,” highlights Vivienne Rudd, Director of Insight, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. Furthermore, there are also strong demands for hair care launches that tap into the seasonality trend, with three in 10 (30%) Brazilian hair care consumers claiming they would pay more for products to protect their hair from sun damage. The seasonality trend also looks set to shape the future of the personal care market.  Currently, nearly half (48%) of US sun care users express interest in gradual tanning body washes and 44% of US women who use soap, bath and shower products look for extra moisturisers in the winter months. According to Mintel there is also scope for products that appeal to the altered emotional needs of consumers as the seasons change.  “Conditions such as Seasonal Affective Disorder and the Winter Blues are now widely understood by consumers and the time is ripe for innovations that appeal to these ailments as well as products that appeal to people’s optimism during the warm weather,” Vivienne Rudd continues.  Indeed, over a third (36%) of UK consumers said they felt less positive during the long, cold winter of 2012/2013 and 23% said the return of warm weather would prompt them to treat themselves to a new look. In particular, Mintel’s research shows that this could hold real potential for fragrance manufacturers. Today, two-thirds (67%) of US fragrance users would be interested in scents that influence their mood or relieve stress and almost a quarter (23%) would pay more for them. “The seasonal issue will have an impact on global launch programmes. With the seasons arriving in different geographic zones at different times, colour cosmetics brands will have to take a more time-sensitive approach to their seasonal colour stories, while skincare and hair care brands may have to stagger their launch programmes more accurately. Beauty brands will also take cues from localised seasons such as the Monsoon in South East Asia to launch relevant and eye catching products,” concludes Vivienne Rudd."

Premium Beauty News - How is the Chinese cosmetic market evolving? Sang Jingmin - The Chinese cosmetic retail market is constantly growing. The market reached RMB 334 billion (USD 54.40 billion) in 2013.  According to iResearch’s forecast, it was projected to hit RMB 404.41 billion in 2014. The growth rate will be more than 20% for the next 5 years with a market projected to reach RMB 700 billion in 2017. As far as market trends are concerned, all forecasts announce that facial mask products will remain hot and the competition will be very intense, BB creams are expected to progressively take the place of foundation. Furthermore, the demand for high-end toiletries should increase strongly among Chinese consumers."
Which part of their bodies are Chinese and Brazilian women willing to invest more on?,"Although the relationship with beauty cannot be defined the same way in the two countries - it is all about pleasure and sensuality in Brazil, while China focuses on control and safety - several common features actually bring these two countries’ consumer profiles closer. According to the study, the cosmetic market in China is growing fast and offers more and more sophisticated products, analyzes Laure Friscourt, Head of Consumer & Beauty  Division at Ifop. It is to be noted that anti-aging products are widely represented, with 60 per cent to 70 per cent, and that the local, more and more premium Chinese brands are strongly developing. In addition, women mainly seek naturalness and guaranteed safety as a result of the high impact of pollution. Brazilian women expect these same benefits from cosmetics, in a country which possesses the largest wealth of natural raw materials and cosmetic actives. Brazil is unique in its approach of body hygiene and beauty. It is characterized by a great ethnic diversity, and it is also the country where the hair is king.  Just like in China, it is a market that counts more and more premium brands and whose consumers expect to get a lot of advice. In Brazil, beauty lies in the way people seek both wellness and/or social integration, while it still often has to do with achieving a status of one’s own in China, while finding an ‘internal health-external beauty’ balance. The study identifies six women profiles in both countries, ranging from over-committed women, who are quite numerous in Brazil and would do anything to achieve perfection, to the health-natural group, which gathers 21% of Chinese women. Then, in the middle of the mapping can be found two interesting profiles of women with a relationship with beauty that has not matured yet, in particular for 25% of the Chinese. The women were surveyed on the body parts they are the most satisfied and dissatisfied with, and those on which they are the most willing to invest. The results unveil the areas to be studied by cosmetics brands. And it comes as no surprise that the first clear result is the importance of the hair in Brazil, and of the eyes in China. Yet, when Brazilian women are asked which body part they are willing to invest more on, 58% of them answer their bellies. Then 40% mention their hair, followed by the lower part of their bodies (bottom and legs). By contrast, Chinese women declare they are willing to invest more on the upper part of their bodies: 70% of them mention their faces, 30% their chest, neck and shoulders. This contrasting approach can be explained by the different lifestyles and cultures, but again, it also conceals a common preoccupation. Indeed, even if they say they are not ready to invest more on this area of their bodies ‘yet’, most Chinese women also admit they are not satisfied with their bellies. A study of Russian and French women conducted in April 2013 by Ifop revealed identical preoccupations. The belly was mentioned as a main concern by 52% of French women, and by 40% of Russian women."
U.S. beauty shoppers increasingly tempted by other product categories,"The majority of U.S. women, 8 out of 10, shop for beauty products, but a 4 percent drop in 2014 brought the industry to its lowest level of shoppers since 2008, according to the Annual Beauty Consumer Economic Indicator, the latest beauty report from global information company The NPD Group. “Consumer attitudes have changed, and beauty is viewed differently than it was in years past. Today, there is more competition among beauty brands and retailers, and more competition between beauty and other products, services, and even experiences, such as vacations, entertainment, and dining. The consumer’s desires outside of beauty have become just as important as those inside,” said Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. NPD conducted an online survey in November 2014 based on a nationally representative sample of women aged 18+, who were screened as beauty shoppers.  The market research firm found that women continue to have a strong emotional connection to beauty products. Over the past seven years, the top driver for purchasing has been to feel confident, followed by feeling sexy. However, most beauty shoppers are moderately engaged in the category, reporting they “regularly put some effort into their appearance so that they at least look presentable.” The study found an important dichotomy when looking at beauty shoppers’ attitudes toward shopping and purchasing in today’s economy. While about 50 percent of women report beauty products are the first thing they would cut back on if money got tight, an almost equal proportion say they would continue to buy beauty products in such a situation because the products make them feel better about themselves. Similarly, nearly half of women indicate they usually shop for beauty products that are on sale, while the other half reports that price is not the most important factor when shopping for beauty products. The contrast continues when looking at individual categories. Spending cuts in makeup and fragrance occur 1.5 times as often as in skincare and hair care, because the products are seen as for special occasions; however, if women were given an extra USD 100 of disposable income to spend on beauty, most would purchase makeup or fragrance products. “These distinct differences among beauty shoppers keep us, as an industry, on our toes and can also be seen as a positive because they pose a big opportunity for the industry,” added Grant. “If the industry responds to the consumer in new and exciting ways, these opportunities will drive growth in 2015.”"
Brazilian brands soon to capture the global market?,"Natura Brasil and Boticário, the two leading Brazilian groups in the industry, dominate the local market, in particular thanks to their direct-selling networks. They are ahead of the sector’s world’s giants like American company Avon, another direct-selling specialist, but also L’Oréal, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever. Despite their sizes, the variety of their offers, and the quality of their products, these brands are still little known or not known at all in other global markets. “That’s true, opportunities on the global scale have not been exploited enough by major brands yet, and not at all by smaller ones”, confirms Helen Kupfer-Haas, consultant and distributor of luxury brands on the French and Brazilian markets. “They have been focusing on developing on their own market, which is tremendous, and in the booming Latin American market. That was their priority,” she explains. These choices are confirmed by Nazish Munchenbach, Marketing Director at Granado, the historic and iconic brand of the country that has just made a noticeable entrance at the Bon Marché department store in Paris. “We have only just started developing on the global level. We are only working with a few trustworthy partners for now, such as the Bon Marché, or Palmers in Greece, and we also have a few clients in Italy and Great Britain, but we are still focusing on Brazil, and most of our resources are dedicated to the local market”, she adds. And yet, Natura has embarked on an adventure outside the Brazilian borders on one of the most famously harsh markets: France. The brand entered the French market in 2005, where its products are available in a store, but also via a network of 2,000 direct-selling advisors and a website. It has a long-standing presence in the country, but it still remains relatively discreet in terms of visibility. Even if, because of logistics costs and constraints, conquering the world was never a priority until now, the slowdown in growth and the ever-fiercer competition on the local level seem to make brands think. By purchasing Australian brand Aesop, Natura Brasil has laid its hands on a company sharing similar values and possessing a network of wholly-owned stores on several continents. Today, the group declares it is ready to increase the number of its points of sale in France. However, Thierry Aubry-Lecomte, Managing Director of Natura Brasil in France, qualifies the idea of spreading all over the place: “Humility and wisdom make us connect with the rhythm of the Earth and take shape on a sustainable basis”. Granado also prefers to remain cautious: “a 145-year-old company can afford to take the time to do things the right way, without any hurry”, confirms Nazish Munchenbach. But what chance do these brands have to win the hearts of women consumers all over the world? No doubt they can, according to Nazish Munchenbach. “Brazil has a huge potential. It is a country that not only inspires by its beauty and the richness of its culture, its nature and size, but also by the kindness and accessibility of its people. All this brings endless possibilities”, she explains. And Helen Kupfer-Haas confirms that “thanks to its cultural mixing, Brazil has a universal appeal. It can reach all continents and, most of all, it rhymes with joie de vivre. As a matter of fact, beauty around the world is mainly personalized by Brazilian women today. They are the most beautiful ambassadors, starting with Gisele Bündchen, and the most well-known models come from Brazil. It is a true breeding ground. And it is not just their beauty that is appealing, as they have this ‘brasilidade’ aura of well-being, joie de vivre – a healthy mind in a healthy body that grabs people’s interest all around the world. Major Brazilian brands should use this.” A universal beauty that embodies joie de vivre, a biodiversity that is unique in the world and rich in endlessly varied, natural ingredients, little-known beauty rituals… everything seems to show Brazilian beauty has everything to conquer the world. “But in order to succeed, a Brazilian brand must focus on quality and innovation, and make no compromise on these two key success factors”, Nazish Munchenbach warns. The massive arrival of international suppliers and subcontractors in Brazil together with the growing sophistication in production tools and means should contribute to enhancing the global competitiveness of Brazilian cosmetics."
"MakeUp in Seoul, a catalyser","Premium Beauty News - More than thirty journalists attended the press conference you had organized last week in Seoul. A real success! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Yes indeed! And this year it was a surprise to welcome a strong Chinese delegation. Many articles have already been published on the internet. A press conference, which was, precisely, organized on the venue, where in a few weeks, will take place what promises to be the main event in the make-up sector of this beginning of year 2015. An opportunity for us to announce a 30% increase in the number of exhibitors and also a sharp rise in the number of visitors registered compared to last year at the same date. An opportunity also to recall the unique positioning of this event that enables visitors, originating mainly from brands’ Marketing, Purchasing, and R&D teams, to get a grasp, in the most effective way, of the main innovations and trends in a ever-changing industry. Premium Beauty News - This second edition promises to be a great vintage! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Undoubtedly, yes! We will be welcoming this year first-time exhibitors from China, Europe and the United States during the two days of the show at the Conrad Hotel in Seoul. And I can already tell you that many high profile managers from major international brands have already announced they would make the trip. Some of these major brands said they would make of the South Korean capital city the centre of their make-up innovation and development laboratory. MakeUp in Seoul will be the perfect place for them to make their official announcements. During two days, the Korean capital city will be at the cross-roads of the best Asia has to offer in terms of make-up. Not to be missed... Premium Beauty News - The choice of organizing your Asian trade show in South Korea was therefore a good choice? How many visitors are expected? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Certainly the best Sandra Maguarian and I ever made. This country, every day, is proving its dynamism in the make-up sector, be it in the field of formulas, packaging or accessories. Many new products will be introduced during these two days. Innovations that will amaze visitors. Visitors, who, I insist, will be as usual the ones who really want to see our exhibitors, namely real decision makers. This is what makes the difference with other large-size international beauty trade shows. And this second edition will be the proof of the pudding. Because it is not the number of visitors that countsbut their quality. MakeUp in Seoul = Quality!"

Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2015 to open its doors next month,"The world’s biggest trade fair in the beauty sector is still growing and welcoming new international exhibitors.

In the Perfumery & Cosmetics section, the Extraordinary Gallery will bring together renown international firms exhibiting high-end products and new luxury cosmetics trends, while new start-ups will be exhibiting in their own special area, Spot on Beauty. For the first time, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna will be organising a “Perfumery Forum” on Friday 20th March.  The event will feature workshops and seminars for operators in the perfumery sector, focusing on the future of the perfumery market in Italy and in the major markets worldwide. The organizers also announce several new features at Cosmopack, the “show within the show” dedicated to the beauty sector’s production chain. This year, a special emphasis will be put on eco-sustainability, a vital aspect of industrial production which will be the subject of workshops and special initiatives.  Cosmopack will also be hosting the second edition of its “The Wall - Eco-Beauty” competition, which will reward the most innovative items regarding environment protection. The products will be exhibited on the “Eco-Beauty Wall” in the corridor between pavilions 15 and 18.  The jury, made up of experts from Acqua di Parma-LVMH, Carlin Group, Certiquality, Comfortzone, Domus Academy, Italia Imballaggio and Wired, will award prizes to the most innovative products in each category. The Cosmopack Factory project will be returning for the 2015 edition. This is a special exhibition area where the manufacturing process for the most famous and widely distributed beauty products is reproduced live. The project began with lipstick, then moved on to the technological development of face powder in the most recent edition. In 2015, it will focus on mascara. Eventually, the Cosmopack Forum programme, will host workshops and presentations from suppliers, certification bodies, trend forecasters and universities including Beautystreams, Centdegres, Nelly Rodi, Peclers Paris, Certiquality and Information & Inspiration."
"Korea, the new cosmetics giant?","The South Korean trade balance for beauty products was in surplus for the first time last year.  According to South Korea’s customs office, cosmetics exports reached 1.92 billion dollars in 2014, that is, an increase of 50.4% over the previous year. This is a spectacular reversal, considering that from 2001 to 2012, the annual deficit exceeded 400 million US dollars and only started to decrease in 2013. With imports totalling 600 million US dollars, mainland China is the top destination of “Made in Korea” cosmetic products.  Other key importers are Hong Kong (USD 410 million), the United States (USD 160 million), Japan (USD 150 million), and Taiwan (USD 120 million), followed by Singapore and Thailand. Actually, the popularity of K-Beauty remains primarily an Asian phenomenon.  However, the number of destination countries of Korean cosmetics is increasing regularly. After BB creams, cushion products are the new Korean trend to draw worldwide attention in the beauty sector. The term “cushion” refers to a makeup compact built with a specially designed urethane foam that contains and preserves a makeup liquid (usually a foundation, blended with sunscreens and skincare actives) applied with a dedicated sponge.  Main advantages: it is easy to use and easily transportable. A pioneer in this product category, the Amore Pacific group started working on cushions in 2007.  The group has 13 registered patents for cushions in Korea, China, Japan, the United States and Europe.  In 2014, AmorePacific succeeded in automating the entire cushion production procedure. In 2014, AmorePacific sold 26 million cushions through its several brands (Laneige, Etude House, Innisfree, Sulwhasoo, etc.).  According to a recent TNS Korea survey, 75% of Korean women have used or are currently using cushion products.  However, these products also appeal to consumers from other countries.  In 2014, AmorePacific’s cushions increased by 140%.  Once again, China is the main destination country: approximately 1.17 million units of Laneige BB Cushion were sold in China in 2014. Korean cosmetics manufacturers have patiently built their reputation by relying upon a highly competitive but quickly growing domestic market.  “Many Korean manufacturers have managed to seize this opportunity to create absolute jewels in terms of R&D and manufacturing capabilities,” said JKH Wang, president of FS Korea, a supplier of packaging and makeup applicators. When asked by the organizers of MakeUp in Seoul, which will open its doors on 15-16 April 2015, JHK Wang added that Korean manufacturers now offer products whose quality and sophistication can not only appeal to Chinese consumers, but also US or European ones. “The Korean beauty industry is very responsive, competent and passionate. To become leaders on the global market, we create and constantly look for new ideas and new products to create. We want to mark our time with our footprint in terms of creativity. To achieve this we need to strengthen partnerships between us and the various international market players,” adds John Kwon, consultant for Cosmecca, a Korean contract manufacturer of colour cosmetics."
Cosmetic 360: the Cosmetic Valley details its ambitions,"""The market is driven by new product developments and launches with a strong desire for innovation and where there constant new challenges: within a 4 year span 30% of new products appear on the market and half of the products that will be on the market within the next five years are unknown today,” said Marc-Antoine Jamet, President of the Cosmetic Valley. ""Innovation is essential and this new event will be a showcase for French innovation."" The Cosmetic Valley’s leading team is convinced that innovation is the key to the attractiveness and international fame of made in France cosmetics. Building up on an increasing number of members, a network of 800 companies and eight universities including a total of 200 laboratories and 8,600 researchers over a territory covering three French regions (Centre, Normandy and Ile-de-France), they want to gather under the same roof what the best innovations of the cosmetics supply chain, from France and the rest of the world. Highlighting the originality of the concept, Jean-Luc Ansel says that ""each stand will be equipped with a hoarding describing the showcased innovation and not the name of the company.” Contrasting with the recent trend toward increasingly specialized events, Cosmetic 360 aims to gather a wide span of cosmetic innovations: functional packaging (digital packaging, antimicrobial packaging, interactive packaging combining LED and microprocessors...), new materials (ceramics, bio-based materials), new actives (molecules from the cosmetopea, anti-microbial natural raw materials, anti-pollution actives...), new testing and measurement equipment (contact free acoustic rheology, high-resolution ultrasound for cosmetic applications, ex vivo objectification...), new manufacturing equipment, new products (alcohol-free perfumed balls, customised cosmetics, connected beauty, augmented reality...). Managing more than a hundred research projects involving SMEs, large groups and academic laboratories, the Cosmetic Valley also intends to promote exchanges between these various operators. The organizers of Cosmetic 360 thus offer leading cosmetics groups the opportunity to participate in the event through dedicated open innovation spaces where they can have pre-arranged appointments to discuss innovative projects with companies picked up from a list produced by the organizers. For the other participants, ""start up desks"" at 2,500 euros, 4.5 sqm mini stands at 3,300 euros or 7.5 sqm stands at 5,200 euros should allow all categories of companies to take part to the event. Scheduled on 15-16 October 2015, Cosmetic 360 will be held at the Carrousel du Louvre on 3000 sqm and is expected to host 100 to 150 exhibitors for its first edition and about 4,000 French and foreign visitors, according the organizers’ forecast."
Latest cosmetics trends from the USA,"“North America remains number one in the luxury business, and prestige beauty is also doing well with a +3% growth in 2014, according to NPD data,” declares Leïla Rochet-Podvin. The latest acquisitions by Estée Lauder in prestige brands and by L’Oréal, with Carol’s Daughter, can only confirm the fact that large groups share an interest in the premium market. “The luxury beauty world is evolving significantly”, she comments. Makeup appears as the leading segment, with a +6% rise and dynamics that have shifted to the eye (+10%) and lip (+13%) segments, as the NPD Group confirms. Leïla Rochet-Podvin has noticed a change in the offer: “What we have seen with nails is now expressed in the eye segment, with more sophistication in the eye makeup, a multitude of products designed to prime the area, and plenty of bold colours, graphics, perfect lines… After Nail Art, here comes Eye Art!” She also notes that the customization phenomenon, which has already reached the mass market and the fashion and cosmetics sectors, is inviting itself in the makeup world. As an example, the Bite Beauty Lip Lab now makes it possible for New Yorkers to create their own lipsticks by choosing the finish, colour, taste, and packaging. Products from Asia have a growing influence and presence on the American market. These brands mainly come from Japan and Korea, entered the market through Lifestyle stores such as Urban Outfitters and are getting settled with wholly-owned stores in the large cities of the East and West coasts. Just like in Seoul, Tony Moly, The Face Shop, Club Clio and Nature Republic stores are sprouting up from Manhattan to San Francisco. “Asia is a guarantee for American consumers: it is shown in the media as a centre of expertise, and rhymes with innovation and sophistication in beauty rituals. Given the substantial media coverage observed in 2014, some brands do not hesitate to focus their communication campaigns on Asian models,” Leïla Rochet-Podvin analyses. Eclectic Beauty is the signature of this prospective vision divided into six universes and presented in the form of inspiration boards. “‘Eclectic’, because there is a true desire to live a life of changes and self-staging. We have witnessed the birth of a chameleon beauty which gets shared and staged,” explains Leïla Rochet-Podvin. The phenomenon is intensified by a younger generation fed on social networks, YouTube, and especially Instagram. “Brands do not represent the major part of expression on YouTube: it is mostly content creators who speak up. Instagram is now playing a significant role, and all this puts an emphasis on self-image,” she concludes. The agency has drawn six inspirational universes from this Eclectic Beauty to reflect both various visions of femininity and emerging products, niche brands, harmonized with these new lifestyles and consumption patterns."
France: Wide gaps in selective perfumery,"As the INSEE (the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) has found household expenditure decreased in 2014 for the second year in a row (-0.2% in 2014 after a -0.3% decline in 2013), it seems the perfumes and cosmetics sold through selective distribution channels [1] did not benefit from the recovery in the consumption of manufactured goods (+0.7% in 2014 after -0.6% in 2013). According to the NPD Group research firm, selective perfumes and cosmetics sales reached 2.9 billion euros in France in 2014, which corresponds to a -0.6% fall in value. Despite a disappointing month of December compared to 2013 (-0.6% in volume), perfumery is the only sector whose turnover has increased (+0.2% in 2014), and there was no important launch this year to support this growth. If prestige makeup sales show a -0.1% global decline compared to 2013, the situation in this category is far from homogeneous. Indeed, there is a strong increase in multifunctional makeup products sales (+128.4%), which cover makeup palettes comprising eye shadows, blush and sometimes even gloss, or lipsticks which also feature a blush function. Likewise, complexion products are quite popular among French women (+2.1% in 2014), contrary to boxes (-14.7%) and eye makeup (-4.6%). Selective makeup is enhanced by constant innovation and should thus grow again in 2015, if companies manage to attract young consumers, who see it as a major seduction tool. According to a survey carried out by beauty and wellness treatment booking specialist Balinea.com, almost half of women (47%) consider makeup as their main seduction tool on a date. And this idea is mostly shared by younger ones (57% of women aged 20-30, 55% of those aged 30-40). On the other hand, after keeping a high level for several years, skincare proved less trendy in 2014 (-3.8%). The cosmetics the most concerned by this decline are moisturizers (-7.2%), treatments designed for the eyes (-6.6%), and anti-aging skincare (-3.1%). According to the FFPS, once again, downtown and local perfumeries are those that suffered the most this year with a -5% sales decline in 2014, following the -9.8% collapse in 2013. However, their market share remains quite significant (14.5%). As for the chains that entered a new era in terms of concentration, with Douglas buying Nocibé, they still represent 76.6% of the market. According to the FFPS, they managed to curb the decrease of their turnovers in stores (-0.1%). All in all, it is actually the department stores (8.7% of the market) that show the best performance (+2.6%). By offering an ultra-luxurious customer experience, in Paris in particular, they seem to have managed to meet the expectations of well-off customers or of those that are willing to pay the price for an exceptional buying experience. The success of department stores on the ultra-luxury segment and the difficulties of traditional independent perfumeries also highlight the relative lack of data regarding the differentiation strategy adopted by some independent retailers that have chosen to specialize in alternative perfumery brands. Today, only few French cities do not have a perfume shop specialized in this segment, and all of them do not seem to have to fight to survive. Ombre Portées now counts an e-commerce website and five perfumeries throughout the French territory, and has announced the opening of a new store in Brittany for the first quarter 2015. As for Sens Unique, the iconic alternative perfumery based in the Marais quarter in the heart of Paris, it has just inaugurated a new branch in Caen, France. That is enough to justify further research!"

Premium Beauty News - How is the British packaging market evolving, in particular the prestige packaging market? Alison Church - The British packaging market is constantly evolving, it never stands still and this is definitely most evident in the luxury and premium markets. The packaging of a luxury item is almost as important as the product itself inside the pack. Where companies were looking to cut costs during the recession, the luxury and prestige goods markets were creating even more luxurious and eye-catching packs. The packaging of a luxury product isn’t just to protect what is inside, but has to persuade the consumer to part with more money and has to represent the quality of the product. Prestige packaging is also moving towards ‘the all round experience’, trying to play on all of the senses, rather than simply focussing purely on the look and feel. It is becoming a common occurrence to find that sound and smells are intertwined within the packaging experience, introducing a whole new aspect to the industry. This may not be entirely new, but it is very much growing in popularity as an important consideration to all premium and luxury brands."
"U.S.A.: Prestige beauty sales grew by 3% in 2014, driven by the makeup category","The U.S. prestige beauty [1] industry reached US$11.2 billion and grew 3 per cent in dollar sales in 2014, compared to 2013, according to global information company The NPD Group, Inc.  Makeup experienced the healthiest gain, 6 per cent, while fragrance dollars grew 2 per cent and skincare increased by 1 per cent. Over the full year, North America proved much more dynamic than Western Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom. Prestige makeup, skincare, and fragrance in the U.S. all experienced 2 to 4 per cent growth in average price. The lip segment was key to makeup’s growth, driven by lip colour. Of the top 100 new shades on counter in 2014, pink surpassed red as the leading colour, bringing in 23 per cent more dollars. Sets and kits drove the growth for skincare, with anti-aging sets serving as the catalyst. Juices experienced the largest increase for women’s fragrance, while for men it was gift sets. “Beauty is an industry where consumers are willing to spend, and where the majority of them - more than 80 per cent of U.S. women alone - invest,” said Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group.  “While there is brand loyalty, consumers at the same time are always on the hunt for products that will perform better, and are willing to add to their routine if a product proves worthwhile. The industry is at an advantage in the U.S., a crossroads, where world beauty comes together in one place, and the innovation and types of products that connect with consumers, and satisfy their needs and desires, show themselves in a natural light.” The growth of the U.S. prestige market outpaced the mass [2] channel, where sales remained flat for total beauty in 2014, versus 2013, as per Nielsen. The skincare category, with 2 per cent growth, buoyed the overall mass market, while fragrance and makeup experienced dollar declines, by 4 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively. “The beauty industry had a solid annual performance in a somewhat difficult retail environment, but there’s still plenty of room for improvement and development,” added Karen Grant. “We saw that fewer consumers, especially beauty shoppers, cut spending in 2014. At the same time, 2014 reported the fewest number shopping for beauty in six years. This tells me that beauty shoppers are happy, but some may be seeking happiness elsewhere. This ‘elsewhere’ is in other products and services, as well as experiences; consumers today are not just pursuing ‘products for me,’ so much as they are seeking ‘experiences for us.’ The challenge for the beauty industry, therefore, doesn’t lie solely in the products, but in fulfilling this sense of experience, and having both play together in harmony.”"
The natural personal care market moves to truly natural products as sales continue to grow,"Sales of the global natural personal care market increased by nearly 10% in 2014, finds consulting and research firm Kline & Company in its imminent Natural Personal Care Global Series report. All regions continued to surpass the overall beauty market’s growth during 2014. Brazil and Asia-Pacific remained the fastest growing regions during 2014, with both expanding at double-digit rates. However, growth in China is restricted due to formulation challenges, as well as animal-testing methods. Several Western brands, such as Weleda, Lavera, and Pangea, among others, have withdrawn from the Chinese market in protest. According to Kline, growing consumer awareness of synthetic chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries and the desire for truly natural products will continue to propel the global natural personal care industry. This segment’s growth is projected at a CAGR of slightly less than 10% through 2019. However, the market research firm says products with natural claims but formulated with a high proportion of synthetic ingredients dominate the global natural personal care market, accounting for nearly 75% of the total market share in 2014. These natural-inspired are particularly popular in less mature markets, such as Brazil and some Asia-Pacific countries, where disposable income and consumer awareness regarding product ingredients are low. Even in mature markets, products that are only natural-inspired continue to prevail.  However, consumer’s awareness is growing, leading increasing numbers of consumers and retailers to select products containing predominantly natural ingredients. Following this trend, marketers have increasingly been reformulating with a higher proportion of natural ingredients in their products. In the United States and Europe in 2014, Kline’s ratings system, which analyzes brands’ naturalness on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being completely natural, uncovered shifts in the natural positioning in several U.S. and European brands, including Avalon Organics, Jāsön, Annemarie Börlind, and Melvita, all receiving higher ratings in 2014 when compared to prior years. “These reformulations are the next natural step for companies aiming to establish strong natural concepts with high importance given to the trust between the brand and the consumers. Moving upward in the natural ratings is a great way for natural brands to gain acceptance from a larger consumer base in the mid- to long-term,” explains Agnieszka Saintemarie, Project Manager, Consumer Products at Kline & Company. To cater to consumers’ desire to be able to easily select the right product, some marketers are becoming more transparent in their communication about the quality level of ingredients, certification, and the company’s values. However, consumers are willing to invest in these often pricey truly natural products but only if they deliver effective results. Therefore, marketers are increasingly focusing on product efficacy, highlights Kline."
Eyes and lips record the fastest growth of the U.S. prestige colour cosmetics market,"According to data published by the market research firm, sales of prestige eye colour products have grown by 10 per cent from November 2013 to November 2014 in the United Sates, while sales of prestige lip colour products grew by almost 13 per cent to 1.1 billion US dollars and 417 million US dollars respectively. “The shift in where women focus their colour needs and desires is a natural one, and it will no doubt change again,” said Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. “Colour is key when it comes to makeup. It’s the area where consumers play with fashion and are willing to experiment, as they seek ways to make bold statements and refresh their look.” Eyebrow makeup and eye shadow are two areas that saw the most growth within eye makeup in the 12 months ending November 2014 (34 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively), while lip colour grew by 13 per cent. In contrast, colour enamel prompted the nail segment’s dollar decline, with a 10 per cent drop in sales. However, it is important to note that most nail colour products are sold in the mass and professional channels. “Consumers are paying attention to the marketing focus around eye and lip colour, and responding to multi-colour pallets that have become more prevalent, but that is just part of the dynamic at play,” added Grant. “Marketers and consumers are seeing that makeup and colour are affordable ways to try what’s new and in vogue. Much of the power lies in speed of response and putting that in the hands of trendsetters as well as the early adopters. This responsiveness to the consumer environment will continue to shape the future of colour in beauty.”"
The growing influence of YouTube beauty vloggers,"Influence4you - a media and communication agency specializing in the relationship between brands and social media, blogging, and vlogging influencers - attempted to measure the impact of French YouTube beauty vloggers on the web. [1] The agency scrutinised several key data: the time spent watching videos or reading articles, the presence and influence in social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. From a strictly quantitative point of view, the balance struck is heavily tilted in favour of YouTube vloggers. The time spent (in thousands of minutes) on the main websites for women and on major YouTube beauty channels is roughly equivalent. Shortly speaking, the media influence of the leading French YouTube beauty vloggers is now as important as the leading websites for women. However, their audience is overwhelmingly aged 15-35 years, while websites for women connect with a much broader audience. The comparison of the number of followers and of engagement rates on Facebook, also shows that YouTube beauty vloggers are on equal footing with leading websites for women. However, as far as other social media measured by the study (Twitter, Instagram) are concerned, YouTube vloggers clearly dominate.  ""Twitter is a privileged and popular communication channel for YouTube vloggers and for their viewers, which are younger than that of largest women’s sites. Therefore, they are fully invested in social media that allow direct communication with their followers,"" say the authors of the study. Regarding Instagram, the difference is even more marked, with hardly any female sites having a number of followers matching the numbers reached by YouTube vloggers. Beyond the comparison between websites for women’ and YouTub beauty vloggers, Influence4you also compared the influence between bloggers and YouTube vloggers. Once again, from a purely quantitative point of view, the preponderance of YouTube vloggers is undeniable: their influence on social networks seems much higher. However bloggers, which are somewhat older, have an established relationship with their readers and attract wider age groups. Bloggers also massively invest social media and many of them became influential YouTube vloggers. From the brand’s perspective, blogs also have the advantage of an easier integration of advertisements. According to Influence4you: ""Bloggers and YouTube vloggers should be opposed as they appear as being somewhat complementarity.” To summarize, YouTube beauty vloggers now have a large audience and an unparalleled presence in social media. These quantitative assets add up to the unique characteristics of video media, which is rather well suited to the beauty and fashion sectors, and to the personal endorsement and intimacy, provided by the YouTube vlogger. However, their audience is highly targeted on the 15-35 years. For most mainstream brands, a media strategy that would only target YouTube vloggers would therefore not be optimum, as they may lose touch with large part of the market."
France: Perfume and makeup sales drive the prestige market,"“Once again, the French beauty market shows that its ability to resist in a difficult economic environment,” said The NPD Group. According to the market research firm, sales of selective cosmetics decreased by -0.6% in 2014 (vs. -0.9% in 2013) and achieved a total turnover of nearly 2.9 billion euros. The year was marked by two major phases. The first half was marked by a significant downturn (-1.5 per cent), followed by a rebound in sales from August, thanks to a trend shift on perfumes and makeup in the second half which closed with a +0.1 per cent increase, despite the fact that December sales failed to reach expectations. ""The good news came from the perfume and makeup that were back on growth trail in the second half, in particularly with strong performances of women’s fragrances driven by successful Autumn launches and by new additions to classic lines,” said Mathilde Lion, beauty expert for Europe at The NPD Group. Fragrances, selective beauty’s main category of (2/3 of total sales in value), drove the market with sales increasing by +0.2 per cent in value over the whole year. Despite a number of launches higher than in 2013, men’s fragrances have not been that successful (-0.6 per cent in value over the whole year). On the contrary, women’s fragrances have found their way to growth (+0.6 per cent), boosted by new launches and the success of flankers. “Women’s fragrances is the only category driven by innovation this year and brands’ strategies were more focused on the launch of flankers - such as Black Opium by YSL, La Petite Robe Noire Couture by Guerlain and Kenzo’s Kenzo Jeu d’Amour - rather than on the emergence of new concepts,"" added Lion. While the overall prestige skincare market decreased in 2014, makeup broadly maintained its sales with a limited decline (-0.1 per cent). The year also recorded a return to growth for complexion enhancers (+ 1 per cent) driven by foundations and concealers. According to The NPD Group, other smaller segments also met really enthusiastic consumers, such as eyebrow products, gift boxes, facial brushes, lip-glosses and multifunctional products. ""The French market is very mature and we cannot expect it to grow very strongly. However, with a lot of launches scheduled at the beginning of the year, we expect 2015 sales to be in line with the second half of 2014, but celebration periods such as Valentine’s Day, Mothers Day, Fathers Day and Christmas) will be challenging and will give the mood for the year,"" concluded Mathilde Lion."
"Beauteam announces its first ""MakeUp in Action"" in Los Angeles in February 2016","Premium Beauty News - Why “MakeUp in Action“ in Los Angeles and not simply ”MakeUp in Los Angeles”? Jean-Yves Bourgeois -  Simply because the format of this new event will be different. It won’t be, strictly speaking, a trade show in its traditional form, but a formula that is best suited to the atmosphere that characterizes the beauty sector on the West Coast, a real melting pot in terms of innovation with a real business incubator, from which start ups continue to emerge and with some of them who can literally change the traditional background of the make-up market. “MakeUp in Action” in Los Angeles will take place on one day and a half. The first half-day will enable professionals to meet and discuss, clearly, do business. All day next, will be an opportunity to take part to several highly specialized workshops led by consultants, brands managers and suppliers. For those interested, business meetings will also be organized in parallel during the day. Premium Beauty News - Will suppliers be allowed to showcase, strictly speaking, their products? Sandra Maguarian -  The cornerstone and leitmotiv of this event is innovation. Companies wishing to exhibit (on a voluntarily limited floor space) will be allowed to do so, on to the condition of only showcasing their most recent innovations. The core of the concept also stands in the richness of themes addressed during the various workshops and plenary conferences. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose to inaugurate this new “MakeUp in Action” formula in Los Angeles? Jean-Yves Bourgeois -  Because it is the region in the United States and probably in the world, the best designed for it. There are lots of very innovative small and medium companies. They need a platform to open up to the outside and, at the same time they are looking for new products, new applicators, new formulas, and new accessories. Yet surprisingly, this region of the United States is a bit closed in on itself. Yet it is open to the Pacific region, which has become the most dynamic area in the world. And then we must not forget the fantastic dynamics of make-up dedicated for the movie industry... Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Action in Los Angeles can only increase your international legitimacy in the BtoB make-up sector? Jean-Yves Bourgeois -  The objective, for the Beauteam team is of course to increase the legitimacy that the sector has granted us so far. A legitimacy based on a true understanding of the market and its needs and as always aimed at being an efficient platform to discuss and do business. The huge advantage we have today, is this fantastic network that we have built across the world and that we can share. In Los Angeles, like in all our other events, professionals from around the world already meet and will meet more and more..."
Brazil: 60 new points of sale in 2015 for instant nail polish colours maker Esmalte Machine,"Freire invested in research and technology to develop the first machine in the world able to manufacture custom nail polish instantly. ""Esmalte Machine is the most modern, simple and clean way to create thousands of nail polish colours on the spot,"" says Cesar Jansen, expansion manager of Esmalte Machine, which was founded in 2011, in the Brazilian state of Paraiba. With a clean and futuristic look, the patented device is a portable and automated feeder that uses pre-made basic colours to create new colour combinations. Customers can choose from a catalogue of over 100,000 shades available in different versions, including creamy, shimmering and metallic - with or without glitter. The “5Free” version is free of the five top substances that may cause allergies: toluene, formaldehyde, dibutyl phthalate, formaldehyde resin and camphor. The empty bottle is then positioned inside the machine, the operator enters the number corresponding to the selected colour on the touchscreen display and, after three minutes, the nail polish is ready to go. Despite working with chemical components in high-traffic public spaces such as mall corridors, Jansen ensures there are no safety risks. “There is no handling of chemicals. What happens during the process is a mixture of nail polish colors inside the machine. Neither the customers nor the machine operators have physical contact with any of the components.” ""Initially, our idea was to supply only the machine and its ingredients, but the business model has been so successful that we decided to turn it into a franchise network,” says Jansen. Today, Esmalte Machine has 12 franchises operating in nine Brazilian states: Para (Belem), Paraiba (Joao Pessoa), Parana (Foz do Iguaçu), Pernambuco (Recife), Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro and Niteroi) Rio Grande do Norte (Fortaleza), Rio Grande do Sul (Porto Alegre, Pelotas and Santa Maria), Santa Catarina (Lages) and Sao Paulo (Sao Paulo). ""We are currently implementing four new franchises and our forecast is to inaugurate another 60 by December 2015,” says Jansen.  The initial investment to open a franchise ranges from R$ 70,000 to R$ 135,000 depending on the point of sale selected (from 4 m2 micro-kiosks to 25 m2 stores). Monthly sales are estimated between R$ 12,000 and R$ 30,000. One of the main advantages for the franchisees is the ability to deal directly with the market demand - there is no need to stock products or invest in colours that may not be sold. They also have the possibility to work as direct sales consultants by selling Esmalte Machine products to their customers via catalogue and delivering straight to their place. Nail polish prices range from R$ 12 to R$ 18 in the traditional version, which are sold in 8 ml containers. Slightly larger, 5Free products are available in 10ml containers and cost R$ 25. There are also gift package options with two, four and six bottles of nail polish. The nail polish category recorded sales of nearly R$ 600 million (EUR 197 million) in Brazil in 2013 according to Euromonitor - a 16% share of the global market, which totals US$ 5.9 billion."
"The Cosmetic Valley launches Cosmetic 360, the Parisian show for cosmetic innovation","The “competitiveness cluster” based in Chartres, France, has taken the plunge. A new trade show dedicated to cosmetic innovation and research & development should take place next October 15-16, 2015, at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris. “It has been long since manufacturers started telling us a reference trade show was missing in Paris, an event that would be worth the reputation and quality of French cosmetic products,” explains Jean-Luc Ansel, Director of the Cosmetic Valley. In other words, the current shows in Paris are thought not to completely meet the cosmetics industry’s expectations. “To me, it has to do with positioning. We need a show that highlights French know-how in cosmetics and concentrates on innovation, trends, and research,” he adds. This new event is called Cosmetic 360, and will thus focus on innovation in all its forms: product innovation, packaging innovation, but also innovation in services and marketing. “Everything that contributes to the success of the cosmetics industry, with a particular emphasis on open innovation and outsourcing,” Jean-Luc Ansel specifies. The Cosmetic Valley has already booked 3,000 m2 at the Carrousel du Louvre in the heart of Paris, and is expecting between 100 and 150 exhibitors for its first edition. The show will be open to all companies of the industry with innovations to showcase, whether they be ingredient or packaging suppliers, full-service companies or even research service providers, whether they be French or foreign, and members of the Cosmetic Valley or not. The date was chosen to make Cosmetic 360 an extension of COSM’innov, the scientific and academic event organized every other year in Orléans, France. “We do not aim to host a big show, but a qualitative, highly technical, high-standard show. We will be selective when choosing the exhibitors,” explains the Director of the competitive cluster. “In the long run, we want all companies seeking cosmetic innovation around the world to know that this is where they will find it.” In order to succeed in this launching, the Cosmetic Valley relies on its network of international partners, among others. The Japan Cosmetic Center (JCC) and the Italian Polo Tecnologico della Cosmesi are said to have given their support. And the cluster’s partners in Colombia and Quebec have also been approached. In France, the Cosmetic Valley endeavours to unite the profession around its project (FEBEA and the Société Française de Cosmétologie, the French Federation of Beauty Companies and the French Society of Cosmetology, are part of its board of directors), but given the tight deadlines, the competitive cluster has chosen to go ahead and not wait. And the support of a few French cosmetics giants seeking to highlight their excellence in research constitutes another advantage. “It is really a new trade show concept. We have thought about a new positioning adapted and open both to the large groups willing to present their research projects and interested in open innovation, and to the SMEs willing to showcase their technologies. Of course, there will be a substantial conference programme, but also B2B meetings organized beforehand,” Jean-Luc Ansel concludes. Now it remains to convince everyone of the relevance of the Cosmetic 360 concept, as the event schedule is already quite busy. There are numerous competitors indeed: Cosmeeting and Creative Paris are scheduled next September 15-17, 2015, and still rely on brands-suppliers synergy. Informa, the organizer, recently restructured its teams, which are now managed by Claudia Bonfiglioli. As for the Luxe Pack show, which will be held in Monaco less than two weeks after Cosmetic 360, it seems unassailable in the prestige packaging sector. And PCD (February 4 and 5, 2015 for the next edition) is already claimed as the show for packaging innovation and cosmetics distribution systems. To be continued."
Top three fragrance trends in 2015,"Niche fragrances to become more popular According to Nicholas Micallef, the rising popularity of niche fragrances is the first noticeable trend for this year.  “Consumers will continue to look for an effective identity and ability to relate emotionally and personally to a fragrance and in line with this, industry players are formulating fragrances with alternative ingredients,” says Michallef, mentioning sea salt and saffron among such ingredients.  Estée Lauder’s recent acquisitions of Le Labo and Frédéric Malle illustrate the attempt of big players to tap into this market segment. However, the explosion of niche fragrances in the market also means that competition is intensifying. In order to address this challenge, Nicholas Micallef recommends fragrance players “to sustain their niche intent and avoid commoditising the scent.” Increased personalization Increased personalization is the second trend identified by Euromonitor International.  Referring to the recent My Burberry launch by Burberry, which allows consumers to monogram bottles of the fragrance with their initials, Micallef notes that brands increasingly allow consumers to personalise fragrance bottles.  We recently pointed out similar initiatives from Serge Lutens, Atelier Cologne and Guerlain. Innovations in retail experiences Eventually, the third trend pointed by Euromonitor International is the increased competition between department stores and specialized retailers to enhance the consumer purchasing experience through new retail formats.  According to Micallef, an illustration of this trend is the fragrance library opened at New York’s Saks Fifth Avenue. In the library, consumers can learn more about fragrances and the heritage behind them. Euromonitor’s analyst also points out standalone stores of brands such as Chanel and Dior where consumers can find a wide product mix featuring key heritage fragrances, as well as fashionable new items or best selling ones. We could also add the exclusive collections that top fragrance brands have been developing during recent years. Watch the video here below our at: blog.euromonitor.com"
Double-digit growth for prestige lip colour products in the U.S.,"“The trend of women seeking to make a bold makeup statement continues as marketers showcase lips more prominently than seen in prior years,” said Karen Grant, vice president and global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group, Inc. “A red lip is both ‘on trend’ and classic at the same time. For the holiday celebrations, it is not only bold, but also fun, festive, and can’t be missed.” With total lip makeup sales being up for the 12 months ending November 2014, growth in lip makeup is not limited to lip colour or a single month. Lip products are among the primary drivers of total prestige makeup growth, which is the overall prestige beauty leader. According to The NPD Group, the use of lip colour has risen with younger women in particular, and the appeal is based on both fashion and function. Sales gains in this category are driven primarily by increases in unit sales, as the average price spent on lip colour has remained relatively flat over the past year, pointing back to spending behaviour of a younger consumer.  In November 2014 alone, almost 1.8 million prestige lip colour products were sold in the U.S., a 22 per cent increase over November 2013. According to NPD’s 2014 Makeup In-Depth Consumer Report, lip colour is currently the preferred lip product among consumers, and 33 percent of women use it more than once a day. “Lip colour can totally transform a woman’s look, and even affect their mood; that’s a lot of benefit for something that costs around $20,” added Grant. “The value proposition of lip colour is very emotional, as well as practical, even for women on a budget. Messaging that taps into the consumers’ desires can capture them, regardless of the season.”"
German men seek skincare to defy signs of aging,"According to the report [1], German men are increasingly image-conscious, leading them to seek skincare products that meet their age-based needs. Both anti-wrinkle formulations for older men and milder formulations for sensitive younger skin are growing in popularity, as is the desire among 25-44 year olds for preventative products to delay the initial signs of aging. Men are becoming more aware of the need for skincare as part of a daily ritual, and manufacturers have responded with a range of products designed to help men look and feel their best. “The German skincare market is evolving from being more female-oriented to presenting a sizeable opportunity to target men with products that meet both their individual and age-based needs. However, manufacturers will still need their products to offer great value, as men are more likely to seek functionality over indulgence and will opt for effective skincare products,” says Sam Allen, analyst at Canadean. Canadean data shows that the desire for better value is high among consumers in Germany. With sophisticated private label skincare emerging in the market, manufactures must ensure that they highlight the superiority of their products in terms of formulation and ingredients. By reassuring consumers of the effectiveness of any claims their products make, such as anti-aging and anti-wrinkle formulations, brands can encourage consumers to seek value through trading-up for the best experience. Consumer perceptions of private labels are changing, highlighting the need for brands to promote value, both through lower pricing and premium offerings.  “Many consumers now believe there is little difference between more expensive and premium branded skincare and private label alternatives, and manufacturers must defend their market share from further erosion,” Allen concludes."
2014: Year of the strong brows,"If fashion and beauty fads come and go in endless cycles, strong eyebrows are a good example of this. During the 1980s, Brooke Shields wore hers proudly, just as Cara Delevingne does today, inspiring teenagers everywhere to copy the look.  The trend should reinforce the surge of eyebrow products, already pointed out by The NPD Group. As early as last year, the craze was well underway in the UK as the Scouse Brow, the dark, thick yet overly manicured style worn by a certain type of British reality TV star. But the trend truly took off in the rest of Europe in 2014.  Between January and October 2014, French women have spent about 4 million euros in eyebrows makeup products (+22% compared to the same period last year) [1]. This year, strong brows were all over magazine covers and runways, and in light of the Spring/Summer 2015 shows - from the rainbow brows at Badgley Mischka to the abundant brow piercings at Rodarte - the trend shows no sign of stopping. Clearly, thin and subtle brows are out, at least for now. Like any major beauty fad, strong eyebrows have been good for makeup brands’ business. Total sales of brow products rose 31% in the US, 52% in the UK and about 20% in France in the first five months of 2014 (compared to the same period in 2013), The NPD Group reports. While most cosmetics makers have always had a few brow pencils in their catalogs, the selection is now more impressive than ever. Eyebrow kits and palettes are the new must-have items, and new services are popping up everywhere to train clients on how to shape and perfect their arch (Benefit’s Brow Bar, for example). For even more proof that big brows are all the rage, one simply has to type ""Cara Delevingne brows"" into Google. In addition to multiple blogs and social network posts paying tribute to Burberry’s favorite supermodel, makeup fans will find a host of tutorials on how to achieve her look."
Perfumes: Combining fragrances for even more personalization,"The mix & match solution by Comptoir Sud Pacifique was a pioneer in the 70s. These creations usually contained only one flower and few ingredients, which made it possible to recreate an olfactory pyramid, and enabled well-informed people to compose as many of their own creations as they wished. When Valérie Pianelli bought out the brand four years ago, she brought the concept back to the forefront and offered smaller, 30 ml sizes for a multitude of combinations. Jo Malone’s Fragrance Combining™ is inspired by the same concept: one chooses their favourite Cologne among the fruity, floral, woody, or another category of the collection, and then combines it to another, fresher or warmer, to vary the effect. And with their creations made “in situ” and on demand, Le Labo or Ex Nihilo also bank on perfume personalization. The recent acquisition of Le Labo by Estée Lauder shows the growing interest in these concepts that cultivate the difference. Their public often yearns for olfactory emotions, and enjoys both seeking a differentiated perfumed identity and getting involved in the creation process. “We live in a hedonistic society, and creating one’s own perfume puts people in a good mood”, Valérie Pianelli emphasizes. Sophie Roger, of Parfums d’Orsay, notes that “the concept is intended for customers able to understand what this can reveal”. And among them can be found Middle East women consumers, who represent a flagship market in prestige perfumery, and for whom fragrance alchemy is a tradition. The Arabic origin of the word Alchemy is actually Al Kimiya, the name of the new Parfums d’Orsay line of combined fragrances. Amber & Musk and Oud & Wood, two extracts with intense hints to be matched or not, depending on the moods and the seasons. Whether they target curious customers or others familiar with the concept, all these brands share the fundamental notion of guidance. “Even if some mixtures are more obvious and well-known than others, we ought to give customers the means to learn how to make them”, Valérie Pianelli concludes."
"UK self-tan market driven by youngest generations, reveals Mintel","UK young men are amongst the country’s highest fake tan users.  Over a quarter (27%) of 16-24 year old men have used this product category.  According to Mintel [1], fake-tan usage is only slightly higher amongst women aged 16-24 (29%) and 25-44 (24%). Moreover, it seems male interest in self-tan doesn’t stop there - across all consumer groups, males aged 16-24 are the most likely to have used salon spray with tan (20%), compared to a national average of just one in ten (9%). Meanwhile, over the last 12 months, almost a quarter (23%) of 16-24 year old men say they have used a pre-tan accelerator, while the same number (21%) have used a sunbed or tanning salon. Some 12% of the same group have used gradual tanner, while 8% have used oral tanning supplement - again proving to be the highest group of users. “High usage of self-tanning products amongst young men suggests that they may be aspiring to recreate looks inspired by celebrities. With summer becoming a distant memory, and as the nation gears up for a wet winter, our research suggests that young men are looking to extend the summer look with a year round tan,” said Roshida Kahnom, Senior Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. In terms of overall usage of self tanning products, on average 16% of Brits have used self tan in the past twelve months, followed by gradual tanner at 15%. One in ten (10%) have used pre-tan accelerator, while the same number (10%) have used tanning oil or lotion without SPF. Just 7% have used oral tanning supplements. Mintel estimates the UK self-tan market at £60 million in 2014.  “With self-tanning products traditionally associated with unnatural results, older people may be less willing to try it. Additionally, self-tanning products can be tricky to apply, which may make it difficult for older people who tend to have looser and less hydrated skin. Product innovations in self-tanning for older people, designed for looser skin, could make it more appealing to older people,” Roshida continues."
"Perfume, 10 tips for a successful launch","1 • Pay particular attention to coherence Price, positioning, creation, distribution channel… everything should be measured, calibrated, and mutually dependent. It is essential to ensure a good mixture of these elements. 2 • Define your target If you know your target, you know your customers: it justifies everything. The market research should be accurate. 3 • Do not neglect distribution Before initiating the project, it is crucial to consider your distributors as committed partners. If they do not highlight the product, it will not come out, nor will it sell… 4 • Be clear Not only on the appearance, but also in your message. The bottle and the name should be easily recognizable and related to a specific story. 5• Create an identity It is very positive for a juice to be instantaneously recognizable, but it is also very rare, as Angel, N°5, or Shalimar are… Above all, a perfume’s identity is olfactory, so the creation should stand out to exist. 6 • Tell a story The point is to create an emotion in relation to the fragrance. Great perfumes take us on a journey that means something to us. 7 • Stick to your time Being at the forefront is a good thing, but you should take into account it can take time for the product to position itself on the market. It is essential to evolve with your time, because a product that is TOO innovative might be judged a bit TOO retrospectively. 8 • Be legitimate Many brands originally not in the perfume sector are stepping out of their traditional sphere to reach this new Eldorado. Beware not to try and shake up the codes too much: make sure you are legitimate in your olfactory world and avoid “business at all costs” or “SKUs for new” strategies. 9 • Do not ostensibly copy your competitors! In the perfumery sector, it is very hard, even impossible to identically reproduce a formula. But openly trying to get close to it reveals a lack of creativity, which usually fails. Juice, bottle, concept… you should ensure you know your competitors to avoid unintentional copies (everything is known, everything is felt). 10 • Choose the right moment! It is better to wait for the right moment to make yourself heard or… to know how to be cheeky, but it is risky!"
Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong: Simply huge!,"This show is a phenomenon of its own..., which once again, this year, has demonstrated the overwhelming rise of the Asian subcontracting industry in all areas, whether in the packaging, formulation or full service sector. Probably never before have so many plastic processing and filling specialists been seen together before across all sectors, not to mention the plethora of electronic manufacturers, who are fully investing the sector of connected beauty, and never before foreign pavilions have brought together so many exhibitors from around the globe. During the first two days of the show the aisles were packed with visitors and finding one’s way right from the entrance hall at 9:30 a.m., most of the time was nothing short of a miracle. Stands were everywhere. You could see that organizers had struggled to meet demand. To keep up with the flow of visitors, many temporary lanes had been hastily set up with barriers. Organizers had also opened a new hall called ""Spot On Beauty"" with some 150 new exhibitors spread over 3700 sqm. First observation, the impressive surge in the number of suppliers in the make-up industry with an obviously steadily growing number of packaging converters trying to outdo one another in ingenuity with airtight compacts, mascara, lip gloss or lipstick applicators. Not to mention make-up accessory suppliers of all kinds. And competition promises to be tough! Second observation, the number of full service companies that have mushroomed everywhere and offer the full array of services expected by hundreds of new brands that have emerged on Southeast Asian markets in recent months. The same phenomenon can be seen in the skincare market with an ever increasing number of new players. A much coveted Southeast Asian market, to say the least! Wandering in the halls dedicated to foreign pavilions, was enough to be convinced. The centre of gravity of the growth of the global beauty industry has truly moved to Southeast Asia and probably for a long time. Industry players in the United States and Europe will have to be particularly inventive, flexible and dynamic, to withstand such a surge. Fortunately, the Asian regional market is active enough to monopolize this huge industrial power, but for how long? Especially as there is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of quality and productivity for local companies. For many European and American companies, this is no time to rest on one’s laurels. The Asian wave is already at the corner! For its next edition of Cosmoprof Asia will celebrate its 20th anniversary and open its doors on 11th-13th November 2015."
Italian consumers put on make-up to counteract signs of aging,"A recent report from Canadean [1] finds that desire for anti-aging products is greatest among Italians aged 45-54, with over a quarter of their make-up consumption motivated by this need. As the country’s population is aging rapidly, the number of consumers aged 45 and over will increase from 48.6% in 2013 to 51.3% in 2018, further driving demand for make-up with age aligned properties. “To ensure the effectiveness and longevity of make-up, Italian consumers look for products that match their skin best,” says the market research firm. For example, the skin of young adults tends to be more oily and prone to acne, but as consumers age their skin becomes drier and requires additional moisturising and nourishment. Moreover, aging skin is prone to age spots and fine lines that older consumers want to hide. According to Veronika Zhupanova, analyst at Canadean: “Consumers will demand for make-up with age-aligned properties. For example, the younger generation will seek for oil-control ingredients that give their skin a matte look and hide acne marks, while older consumers will prioritise products with ‘lifting’ and ‘firming’ functions. Older generations will also pay greater attention to the ingredients they already know, such as collagen and retinol that prevent skin from the aging process.” “To produce age-specific make-up, manufacturers should seek for inspiration in skincare products which explore these needs and provide constant innovations,” adds Canadean.  Currently, the demand for make-up that meet age-specific needs is greatest in facial care, which reflects how consumers associate healthy and glowing skin with a youthful appearance. To tap into the trend further, manufacturers should extend their anti-aging skincare products into eye and lip make-up. “Due to different age-related skin needs, manufacturers should consider designing products for different age groups more explicitly. However, they should not forget that consumers put on make-up for beauty reasons, which means that functionality of make-up should remain secondary to its decorative properties,"" Zhupanova concludes."
Emerging markets to impact FMCG trends,"According to Canadean, the next wave of emerging economies will have one of the deepest impacts on global consumer markets in the next five years. “Companies have already seen the value in setting up innovation centres in emerging economies to help tailor their products to consumer needs. However, innovations from emerging economies are now also transmitted back to developed countries,” says Ronan Stafford, analyst at Canadean. The market research firm values to up to US$1.66 billion worldwide in 2018, the impact of changes in consumer behaviour and industry practices in countries such as Mexico, Thailand and Egypt, and innovations from these countries that are transferred back to developed economies. Canadean also found that brands see the new markets in Latin America, Asia and Africa as a frontier for packaging innovation and exciting new flavours.  “We increasingly see pack formats developed to keep costs low in emerging economies used to target austerity-minded consumers in Europe. Meanwhile, consumers are now highly aware of global culinary trends and want more experiential flavours. This means that Far Eastern and African flavours and ingredients are high in demand,” Stafford says.  ""The more big brands invest in targeting consumers in Lagos, Jakarta and Hanoi, the better they will meet the value and experience-seeking needs of consumers in New York, London, Madrid and Sydney,"" he adds. According to Canadean, women aged 45 and over from low and middle income households in urban areas will be early adopters of innovation arising from companies investing in the next wave of emerging economies. Manufacturers therefore need to simplify formulations. “This includes strategies such as using fewer ingredients to lower costs or investing in lightweight packaging that is still robust enough to withstand poor quality supply chains,” says Stafford. “These opportunities in the next emerging economies need to be targeted now, or companies will lag behind their competitors on not just opening up new markets, but in better meeting the needs of their current customers,” he concludes."
High-end cosmetics in China,"Chinese consumers no longer see cosmetics and beauty products as an unaffordable luxury, dedicated to some the happy few, but as current consumption goods or even basic necessities. Today, the Chinese cosmetics market represents more than 134 billion yuans (more than 17 billion euros), compared with only 200 million yuans (26 million euros) at the beginning of the 1980’s. International brands are leading the industry: they occupy 54% of China’s cosmetics market. The American brand Procter & Gamble is ahead, followed closely by L’Oréal. Then come the Japanese group Shiseido and Unilever.  As a result of the tremendous rise of China’s cosmetics industry and despite the numerous barriers to trade, foreign brands are rushing into China and competition becoms ever tougher. The main foreign investors in the cosmetics market come from the United States, France, Japan, South Korean and Germany. Chinese consumers are fascinated by Western high-end brands and trust them. This explains the success of foreign brands in the cosmetics sector, and their domination on the market compared to Chinese brands. However, the Chinese market is evolving very quickly. Local brands are gaining ground and most of them aim to market high quality products as well.  Beyond their admiration and fascination for high-end Western brands, Chinese consumers are, above all, looking for quality offers and the trend is towards cosmetics products based on natural ingredients.  Chinese customers are becoming increasingly demanding and desire to find products that perfectly meet their expectations. French and foreign cosmetics companies have an interest in penetrating the market by asserting a high end positioning: this strategy will allow them to develop their business under optimal conditions in China. Demand remains high and often unsatisfied in China’s second- and third-tier cities. In terms of cosmetics offers, make-up and perfumes seem to hold an untapped potential: according to some studies, about 90% of Chinese women use cosmetic creams, while only a third of them use make-up and less than 10% wear a perfume. Thus, Estée Lauder now focuses on make-up and perfumes to attract Chinese customers and gain vacant market shares. Estée Lauder is also preparing the launch of several fragrances, only dedicated to Chinese customers. Furthermore, the US group, well known for its specific developments adapted to the needs of particular countries, has already launched Nutritious, a brand dedicated to the Chinese market. L’Oréal, for which China has become one of the most important markets, aims to conquer 250 million new consumers by 2020.  The group has recently decided to stop selling its mass-market brand Garnier - which is its second brand in terms of turnover - in China.  Garnier had never been a great success in China: not high end enough to arouse the average and wealthy customer, and not low cost enough to attract other Chinese consumers, constantly looking for discounts and good deals. Unlike India, where L’Oréal has penetrated the market thanks to Garnier and its general public positioning, in China, the group has found its place on the local market thanks to a high end positioning strategy, by playing the card of affordable luxury. In terms of distribution, L’Oréal has decided to sell its products in major cosmetics distribution chains and hypermarkets, but essentially with a seller dedicated to customer advice, in order to be distinguished from cosmetics mass-consumption products and maintain its high end image in Chinese customers’ mind. The group adopts the same positioning strategy with its make-up brand Maybelline, leader in in China. Another illustration is the success of US group Amway in China, especially thanks to its cosmetics products offer, marketed under the brand name “Artistry”. Thanks to a wide range of skincare and make-up products, the high-end brand has succeeded in reflecting a prestigious image in the Chinese customers’ mind.  In China, Artistry does not play the card of affordable luxury. On the contrary, the brand aims to be only affordable for a very wealthy customer. Actually, this positioning strategy appeared very efficient in a country that records an increasing number of wealthy and very wealthy individuals."
Consumers turn towards anti-pollution cosmetics,"According to the market research firm, there was a 40% rise in the number of beauty and personal care products launched carrying an anti-pollution claim, between 2011 and 2013 in the Asia-Pacific region.  This has raised APAC’s share of global beauty and personal care launches holding anti-pollution claims from 22% in 2011 to 27% in 2013. Furthermore, Mintel’s research shows that many consumers are looking to wash away the effects of their surroundings in particular, as the number of soap and bath products launched in the APAC region carrying an anti-pollution claim grew 63% between 2011 and 2013. In addition, hair product launches carrying anti-pollution claims have grown 61% while skincare launched with anti-pollution claims grew 46% over the same time period. “As awareness of the effects of pollution grows, we are seeing the expansion of beauty products that shield from its effect, with an increasing number of consumers living more urbanised lifestyles, looking forward we expect to see a rising number of beauty and personal care products launched carrying more specific anti-pollution terminology, that specify the sources and composition of the pollutants,” commented Emmanuelle Moeglin, Global Fragrance and Colour Cosmetics Analyst at Mintel. Whilst the APAC region has seen particularly strong growth of anti-pollution beauty products, this claim has also posted strong growth globally. Between 2011 and 2013 there was a 10% rise in the number of beauty products launched carrying this claim around the world, with a 60% rise in the number of soap and bath products launched with this claim, a 31% rise in hair products with this claim and a 22% rise in skincare launches carrying this claim. Although demonstrating smaller growth in comparison to other categories, skincare products are still the most likely category to carry an anti-pollution claim, with 3.7% of skincare products launched globally in 2013 holding this, up from 3.2% in 2011. Moreover, there are a growing number of eye care products being launched carrying an anti-pollution claim with 7.2% of eye-care products launched so far in 2014 carrying this, up from 3.9% in 2012. Mintel has identified growing consumer awareness of pollution to be a key trend for 2015. Indeed, in the UK, 83% of adults feel lifestyle has a big impact on skin and 22% of women look to cleansers to protect their skin from the environment or pollution. Older consumers are a particular target, 31% of UK women who use facial skincare products use a moisturiser to counter the effects of pollution or the environment on the skin, but the figure rises to 48% of women aged 65 and over. ""In 2015, pollution will become a key media focus. The cosmetics industry in particular has been awakening consumers to the immediate, visible, personal effects of pollution. As a result, we can expect protective claims against PM 2.5 [1] and others to grow in product marketing in skincare and cosmetics in general,"" concluded Richard Cope, Senior Trends Consultant at Mintel."
Brazil’s obsession with image boosts make-up sales,"The value of the make-up market in Brazil will increase from BRL 7.1 billion (US$3.2 billion) in 2013 to BRL 13.4 billion (US$5.1 billion) by the end of 2018, found Canadean in a recent report [1].  Despite the stagnation of the rest of the economy, which has been registering negative economic growth in three of the last four quarters, the market of beauty and cosmetic products in Brazil is remaining buoyant.  “This shows that the Brazilian make-up market is booming - even in times of low consumer confidence and in poorer areas of the country,” says the market research firm. According to Canadean, the average consumer of beauty products in Brazil is young and female: Brazilian women applied a make-up product 24 billion times in 2013, accounting for 85% of all make-up applications. Moreover, women aged between 16 and 34 carry out 40% of make-up applications. “Young women seek a professional image in the workplace and are more willing to experiment for special occasions. They are also more likely to follow the fashion, regularly changing their make-up look to keep up with the latest trends,” highlights Kirsty Nolan, analyst at Canadean. Selling products directly to consumers away from a fixed retail location is very popular in the Brazilian make-up market. Direct sales provide an enjoyable experience for consumers, as they can take a little time out to browse the catalogue and build a good relationship with their local sales representative. Catalogue order companies such as Avon and Natura are leading in direct sales. Those companies can not only offer consumers a good range of products straight to their door at affordable prices, but they also have more control over profit margins. “International make-up brands need to adopt some of these principles in order to succeed in the Brazilian make-up market. Products need to be affordable and attainable for young women. Effective channels of distribution, such as agreements with established direct sellers or relationships with local shops and salons, are the key to success,"" concludes Nolan The dynamism of the make-up market in Brazil is promising for the organizers of MakeUp in São Paulo, a B2B tradeshow which will gather the suppliers and subcontractors of the makeup industry (packaging, formulas, full-service), for the first time in Brazil on December 03-04, 2014."
Luxury and digital: creating dreams while remaining down-to-earth,"Most luxury players initially viewed them with much scepticism - they were too often limited to online selling - which made it difficult for digital technologies to impose themselves in a world where customer satisfaction first has to do with giving advice and providing personalized services. In practice, and despite numerous attempts to make an impact, few tools and applications did revolutionize the buying experience in this sector. “Many experimental tools were launched, but most were not quite finalized yet, and they did not work well,” underlines Jean-Bernard Debreux, founder and CEO of The Illegal Factory, a production company specialized in digital marketing which works for Dior, Philips, or Toyota, among others. However, this specialist of augmented reality is convinced the technologies available now are mature. “The turning point came with the improved capacities of the smartphones used by customers today, which represent the most convenient medium for new functionalities.” Yet, brands still need to have a clear vision of the service they intend to provide customers.  “Technology for technology’s sake is just devoid of interest,” adds Jean-Bernard Debreux. Too many solutions are designed mainly for communication and are thus not efficient with consumers. There is often a discrepancy between the promises made by digital technologies and the reality experienced by customers. In the luxury sector, it is just not possible to make this type of risky experiments. Two great trends can be observed today: the installation of applications for customer service and follow-up in stores, and the dematerialization of the fitting phase. “In all cases, the digital tool must really create a new experience and represent an actual advantage both for customers and the brand.” For example, thanks to augmented reality technologies, a brand can send its VIP customers an invitation card so they can visualize the products on their mobile devices, smartphones or tablets, in real virtual stores that offer an ultra-realistic 3D version of the products, and in particular the correct perception of their real size. Beyond directly commercial applications, digital technologies can also contribute to building a brand’s world. To Ludovic Jokiel, co-founder of the MUTT sound design agency, the sound atmosphere in sales outlets is a key element of the buying experience. “Today, the technologies available make it possible to adapt the sound atmosphere to what is actually happening in the store, and even to the profiles of the customers present at a given moment,” he explains. However, as entertaining as they can be, these technologies often imply to collect personal data, some of which are rather sensitive because they concern physiological characteristics such as the skin colour, the nature of the hair, etc. “The companies that market or use this type of tool must pay attention to strictly abide by the law as regards the protection of personal data,” warn François Klein and Matthieu Bourgeois, associate lawyers at the KGA law firm. Here are some of the points laid down in the Loi informatique et libertés [1] in France: – Clear and loyal information for the user on the purpose of data processing and on the addressees that will receive them. Such information can be mentioned in the Terms and Conditions for Use the customer will be asked to accept before using the application
– The necessary procedures involved with the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), the French independent administrative authority for data protection
– The technical and legal safety measures to be taken as regards data processing and storage Similar rules are applicable in most European countries. If the digital dream has already come true for brands, they do need to remain down-to-earth to avoid any bad surprises."
Natural and organic cosmetics boom at Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech 2014,"The 2014 edition of the Cosme Tokyo (finished products) and Cosme Tech (suppliers) tradeshows, which were held on 20-22 October at the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition centre, gathered 542 exhibitors from 37 countries/regions and welcomed more than 20,700 exhibitors. “We grew the number of exhibitors by 50% compared to last year,” says Hajime Suzuki, Group VP International Sales & Marketing, at Reed Exhibitions.  “Furthermore, the number of international exhibitors has doubled,” he added.  This increased was especially noticeable in Cosme Tokyo, the event dedicated to finished products, with brands from Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Korea, the United Kingdom or Thailand. “This evolution is linked to the Japanese market itself. As the Japanese population is ageing and decreasing, Japanese companies are changing their mind with regard to foreign markets,” explains Suzuki.  “Both companies and consumers are increasingly interested in novelties coming from abroad.” This year all conferences therefore enjoyed a simultaneous English translation. And as per last year, the organizers invited several delegations of international buyers, mostly from ASEAN countries. Another amazing novelty of this edition of Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech was the dramatic surge of natural and organic products, both in the section dedicated to brands and in the section dedicated to suppliers. According to the organizers, this evolution corresponds to a real trend in Japan, where various outlets dedicated to natural cosmetics have recently opened, such as Cosme Kitchen, which offers European and Asian natural and organic brands, as well as its own line. ""There is a real interest from consumers,"" confirms Valérie Lemaire, Director of the certification company Ecocert Greenlife, for which Japan is a booming market. However, the subtle differences between sustainable, natural and organic products remain quite esoteric in the mind of the great majority of Japanese consumers who hardly know the different certifications. According to Minako Suzuki, Marketing Manager at Weleda Japan, ""the interest in natural products has increased considerably after the earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear problems, but Japanese consumers are very sensitive to trends and natural brands with a small notoriety need to invest in communication to enhance the loyalty of their clients.” Suppliers are also addressing the new demand but meet some difficulties in formulating organic and natural cosmetics due to the lack of certified ingredients available locally.  D.S.A. has been one of the first to focus on these products by importing made in France formulas adapted to Japanese needs. ""Currently, natural anti-UV are the products that interest the most our customers,"" says Alexander Saidot, President. Merry Do Beauty Products also opted for the importation of natural formulas from Italian, French and Polish partners.  However, the company recently created Organic Earth, a subsidiary dedicated to this market, which now operates its own factory. ""The phenomenon is new in Japan, but the late development of the market could turn as an advantage as the quality of natural formulations has made significant progress,"" said Junko Shiraishi. For the next edition, the aims of the organizers are to continue to strengthen the internationalisation of the event and, of course, to welcome an increased number of exhibitors, thanks to the growing popularity of the event, particularly in Asia.  In order to have a larger exhibition space, the dates of the combined events are changing again and the next editions of Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech will be held on 20-22 January, 2016."
Beauty Success and Passion Beauté join forces to weigh on the French market ,"Another step towards the increasing concentration of the French selective perfumery: the two biggest independent retail networks, Beauty Success and Passion Beauté, decided to create a joint venture, Beauty Alliance France, to consolidate their purchases and coordinate their trade marketing plans. Each of the two founding entities owns half the shares of the new structure, which will be co-managed by Philippe Georges for Beauty Success and Jean Pierre Dry for Passion Beauté and led by a steering committee of eight people, four from Beauty Success and four from Passion Beauté. Thanks to this alliance, the market share of the two retailers exceeds 10%.  “The required threshold to weigh on the sector,” said the two leaders. Beauty Alliance France, the result of the union of the two retailers ranks fourth in France, with a market share of about 11% in 2014 and 450 beauty shops, including 400 beauty salons, employing 2,400 staffs and a cumulated turnover estimated at 330 million euros in 2014. In a context marked by the recent acquisition of Nocibé by Douglas, creating the leading French retail network in terms of doors, Beauty Success and Passion Beauté probably had no choice but to agree on what they call themselves an ""alliance of common sense."" Today, the three leading beauty retailers in France - Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé-Douglas - represent 75% of the market, all of them enjoying a European or global size. Beauty Success and Passion Beauté also expect the competition from e-commerce to increase, in particular from pure players such as Amazon. ""The digitization of points of sale and the creation of an effective CRM also involve heavy investments. These are key issues and cannot afford to be left behind,"" says Philippe Georges. Beauty Alliance France also becomes a member of Beauty Alliance International, the European umbrella organization for independent beauty retail networks in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In Germany, the Beauty Alliance gathers 900 beauty shops, ranking second behind Douglas, and holds 22% of the market. Of course, this success inspired Beauty Success and Passion Beauté to create Beauty Alliance France. Both retailers intend to leverage on their assets (proximity, sense of service and entrepreneurship) to become a valuable alternative for beauty brands. ""Our two networks are mostly established in medium and small cities and enjoy a good geographical complementary. Strongly rooted in their territories, our entrepreneurs have a very good knowledge of their customers,"" highlights Philippe Georges. The two leaders bet on a significant growth in their market share from 11% today to 15% in 2019, with a turnover of 420 million euros. The obligation made to Nocibé-Douglas by the French anti-trust authority to sell 38 stores, including 25 franchisees, could help the Beauty Alliance France to reach its ambitious goal.  ""The new Alliance would be happy to welcome these entrepreneurs,"" commented the two managers."
"“Our ambition is to become the online beauty leader”, Flavien d’Audiffret, Amazon France","“At first, we intended to satisfy our customers who often look for high-end and prestige brands on Amazon.fr. So it is in a spirit of differentiation from the other Amazon shops that we decided to create Beauté Prestige,” explains Flavien d’Audiffret, Manager of the Beauté and Beauté Prestige shops on Amazon.fr. Right now, a thousand products and 40 brands, including 18 from France, are available online. Most of them are niche and/or very high-end brands rather than the usual big names of the selective channel: Parfum d’Orsay, Miller Harris, L’Artisan Parfumeur, Heeley, Frapin, or Erno Laszlo, Codage, and Argentum in skincare, and David Mallett and Massato in hair care. “We wanted to build a sales showcase of local brands to differentiate ourselves”, specifies Flavien d’Audiffret. While Euromonitor foresees a 3.3 billion dollar increase for luxury perfumes by 2018, and Harrods is inaugurating its prestige Salon de Parfums, Amazon aims at defending a voluntarist vision: making prestige products which are not widely distributed available to the largest number of people possible, with good service quality and delivery in one day. “We are proud to be able to make these brands more accessible, as they are distributed in a very selective way, and some of them are hardly or not present in France, like Rouge Bunny Rouge”. Each of them remains in its own world. “We endeavour to recreate the brand’s environment, its design and history, a description of its products, and to offer its whole range. It is not Amazon’s marketing strategy that prevails, but that of the brands we reproduce as best we can,” Flavien d’Audiffret declares. The initiative is under close scrutiny by independent distribution channels, as it conveys the American giant’s clear determination to get the first rank in online beauty. “This sector grows at a 30% rate per year on the Internet, and although our traditional categories (books, DVDs…) are still significant, Beauty is definitely emerging on Amazon. Our ambition is to become the online leader on this market, as is already the case in the United States”, asserts Flavien d’Audiffret, who promises to widen the brand selection over the next few months. As the first month has come to an end, the assessment is mostly based on the feedback from brands. Amazon affirms their partners are greatly satisfied and directly committed and associated with the future website developments. As they are limited by a narrow channel of independent perfumeries, these brands see in this new network a growth opportunity that is hard not to seize given the difficulty to solve the equation of economic profitability. However, not all comments were positive, as some brands consider the image of Amazon does not correspond to their positioning. Now Amazon still has to talk consumers into ordering products they do not or hardly know. “New customers who did not use to buy anything on Amazon are now led to visit our online store due to the buzz, which is really satisfactory,” notes Flavien d’Audiffret. Web users are guided by several functionalities and tips from beauty editors to make a choice, but for them to make a real discovery there is now a ten-product box available in both sales and miniature formats, and Amazon offers it for orders of 60 euros or more. This selection from the cosmetics and perfume brands present on the Beauté Prestige Amazon e-shop will be available until out of stock."
"Boundaries between mainstream and multicultural beauty brands to blur, finds Kline","The proportion of women members of the so-called “ethnic minorities” - such as African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and mixed-race people - is increasingly important in the United States and they are expected to become the majority around 2040.  According to Kline & Company, the rapidly growing ethnic populations have given way to intensified competition among beauty brands. Some multicultural beauty marketers are trying to break boundaries between general and multicultural beauty. For instance, brands such as Carol’s Daughter are positioning away from being an exclusive ethnic brand to target a broader audience, regardless of ethnicity. This holds particularly true in the natural personal care segment where ethnic hair brand Shea Moisture is now rebranding to become suitable for all consumers.  “This widening approach helps move multicultural brands beyond the ethnic section of the beauty aisle to sit side-by-side nationally advertised brands,” comments Donna Barson, Senior Associate at Kline’s Consumer Products practice. “However, this audience expansion needs to be done without alienating long-time consumers who might feel deserted if they feel like their brand no longer speaks exclusively to them.” Concurrently, mainstream brands continue to develop tactics to capture a growing percentage of the ethnic personal care market. While mainstream brands have long reached ethnic consumers via the use of spokesmodels and targeted advertising, many brands now use beauty advisors who speak the language of the local ethnic community, whether it is Mandarin, Vietnamese, or Spanish, to create a greater connection with these consumers. Thanks to globalisation, some also launch products targeting certain ethnic groups in the United States that are simultaneously released in that group’s country of origin. According to Kline, the movement of mainstream companies into the multicultural space will not only open possibilities of more mergers and acquisitions in the coming years, but it will also be beneficial for consumers as they will be provided with a wider array of products targeting their needs. Smaller multicultural companies will also need to innovate in order to gain sales and create a niche for themselves or position themselves for a potential acquisition. In the ‘Multicultural Beauty and Grooming Products: U.S. Market Analysis and Opportunities’ report, Kline forecasts the ethnic beauty market will continue to face intensified competition from general cosmetic and toiletry brands until the end of the forecast period in 2019, and the fine line between mainstream and multicultural markets will continue to blur."
Sales of natural cosmetics boosted by consumer awareness and innovation,"While their definition of the products category is different, Grand View Research and Kline are reaching the same conclusion: sales of natural and organic cosmetics are growing faster than the rest of the beauty market. According to a post by Kline’s VP of consumer products Carrie Mellage, the global natural and organic personal care market has registered double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive year since Kline began reporting the segment separately in 2007. “Growing consumer awareness and increasing efficacy of natural personal care products continues to attract consumers who are looking to move away from chemically processed personal care products. Plant-based ingredients were once enough to entice consumers; today a product’s function and efficacy are now regarded as at least as important as the ingredient source by many consumers,” she says. According to Grand View Research, skin care was the largest product segment in terms of revenue in 2013, accounting for over 32% of the global market.  Hair care was the second largest product segment and accounted for around 25% of market share in terms of revenue in 2013. “Increasing awareness among consumers regarding harmful effects of synthetic products on the body coupled with high appearance consciousness has fuelled the demand for organic skin care products. In addition, frequent product launches and widening of distribution channels is further expected to raise the demand,” confirms Grand View Research. While North America and Europe are currently the biggest markets, Brazil and Asia are the fastest growing regions both up around 15% in 2013, according to Kline - although these markets regularly enjoy high growth across the overall market.  “The steady rise of the segment in Europe and the United States, where the natural personal care market is one of few areas showing sustained high growth, is perhaps more notable,” underlines Carrie Mellage. According to Kline, in 2013, Europe saw a 6% uptick in natural personal care sales, more than double the pace of the total personal care market, which is estimated to have increased by about 3% in 2013. Likewise, the natural segment in the United States surged by 7% compared to a mere 2% rise for the overall beauty market."
Trends: Towards hair free bodies?,"For today’s men, hair removal has extended past a simple shave of the face. According to a new research from Mintel [1], 50% of all Brits admit there is more pressure nowadays for men to remove or groom body hair. Over the last 12 months, some 55% of men say they have removed hair from their head, this is followed by the pubic region at 29%, chest at 13%, underarms at 12%, back at 9%, bottom at 6%, arms at 5%, legs at 4% and feet 2%. Just 30% of men say they have not removed hair from their body in the last year. Additionally, a quarter (25%) of Britain’s men admit to removing hair from their eyebrows. “It is becoming increasingly commonplace for men, particularly under-30s, to remove hair from their body as behaviours once described as metrosexual are becoming increasingly mainstream,” said Charlotte Libby, Senior Beauty Analyst, Mintel. Overall, one in five (19%) men claim they feel expected to remove hair from their torso, while around the same number (18%) say they feel the pressure to remove hair from their underarms and 13% from their legs. Furthermore, it is younger men in particular who are feeling the pressure to achieve a hair free body, with some six in ten (58%) 16-24-year-old men agreeing they feel pressure to remove or groom body hair, compared to 22% of over-65s. And while 42% of Brits believe it is fashionable for men to have beards, almost the same number (39%) say they feel pressure from others to keep their facial hair neat and tidy. As many as six in ten (59%) consumers believe it looks unprofessional for men to have an ungroomed face in the workplace. Of course, it is not just men who are feeling the pressure to remove hair, almost three quarters (73%) of all UK consumers believe there is more pressure nowadays for women to remove body hair. Indeed, just 8% of women have not removed hair in the UK in the past 12 months. Some 82% of women remove hair from their legs, while a further 78% remove hair from their underarms and 57% from their pubic region. And it doesn’t stop there, the quest for a hair free body sees a further 15% removing hair from their arms, 7% from the feet, 4% from the chest, 3% from their bottom and 2% from their back. The impact of charitable and other initiatives such as ‘Armpits 4 August’ and ‘Hairy Legs Club’ that have tried to initiate a trend towards un-groomed body hair and a more natural look appears quite limited. In terms of sales, whilst the UK men’s shaving and hair removal market was impacted by price promotions and fashion leading away from a clean shave in 2013, it has returned to growth with sales of an estimated GBP 624 million (about EUR 794 million) in 2014, up 2.1% from sales in 2013 which reached GBP 611 million (EUR 777 million). “Innovation in the shaving and hair removal market continues to focus on male-oriented products, with a particular trend towards male body hair removal and a return to tradition-inspired shaving and facial hair grooming,” Charlotte Libby continues. The NPD Group also noted during the summer that sales of women’s grooming appliances, like electric shavers and many other in-home personal grooming and hair removal devices, are rising in the USA. “Inundated with promises of being hair-free by way of a plethora of products and services on the market today, women are compelled to seek smooth skin,” said Debra Mednick, executive director and home industry analyst, The NPD Group. “However, the cost and inconvenience of repeated waxing, laser, or other hair removal services outside of their home may have women looking for simpler, more affordable options.”"
Rare perfumes seeking recognition,"Although there have been numerous creations, there is a tough financial equation to solve for many brands. To David Frossard, distributor of niche perfumery brands under the Différentes Latitudes label, creator of the Liquides Imaginaires fragrances, and Director of Liquides, the Parisian independent perfumery, “very high-end perfumery definitely has a great potential”. However, the economic viability of a great number of brands launched over the past few years is actually an issue. “The market is getting more and more mature, and the suction effect resulting from the interest of department stores in this segment is over”, he explains. The difficulty to combine confidentiality and profitability thus forces brands to remain cautious despite the phenomenal development of niche perfumes over the past decade. Indeed, if it is now possible to create lines large enough and in small volumes, most of the time it results in prices exceeding 100 euros per bottle in store, which is much higher than the average price in a classic selective perfumery. For this price, the number of potential customers cannot but be reduced! And skimping on quality is just not possible. The main value of this perfumery segment is based on its choice of excellence at all levels. “Lovers of beautiful fragrances want flawless products, they expect small niche brands to position themselves at least on the same level as large groups’ brands, but to offer originality as well”, underlines Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, the creator of Parfum d’Empire. Yet, originality represents an additional risk. In order to reduce it, alternative fragrance brands widen their collections to try and cover as many tastes as possible. “We need to be original and segmenting. We do not do blockbusters that will please as many people possible, but a collection with very qualitative and really diverse scents,” confirms Brigitte Wormser, who works at Beauté Prestige as the manager of Atkinsons, a brand distributed in about thirty countries through a very selective network. The numerous French brands that try their luck on this market need to turn to export to be successful. Contrary to Germany or Italy, and despite the recent openings of specialized outlets, French distribution is almost entirely controlled by big chains. According to Nicolas Cloutier, the co-founder of Nose, a Parisian retailer specializing in niche fragrances and skincare products, other factors can explain the difficulty to distribute exceptional perfumes: “the wholly owned stores of several brands, the weakness of the perfumery concepts, the exorbitant rights to a lease, the social security contributions and operating expenses, which add to the already fragile profitability… Besides, the French used to be rather conservative when it came to their choices and values, while Anglo-Saxons were more driven by the risk and importance of being different. Things change, luckily!” Are they going to, with the arrival of Amazon as a new player? The online sales giant has just inaugurated a platform dedicated to selling confidential perfumery brands in France. “They’re just not the right people”, says Nicolas Cloutier. However, David Frossard disagrees and sees it as an opportunity to satisfy the “very connected” customers of the alternative perfumery segment. To Marie Huet, General Manager of Parfums d’Orsay, “it’s really motivating to see a player like Amazon get interested in us, and it’s certainly no coincidence.” Together with the four important personalities of alternative perfumery in France – François Hénin, founder of Jovoy, Ana Estevane, co-founder of Perfarium, Luc Gabriel, President of The Different Company, and Nicolas Chabot, President of Le Galion Parfums – Marie Huet will be very keen to federate, represent, help, defend, and promote the whole sector through the Comité Joséphine. The association is accompanied by a commission of experts (journalists, perfumers, conditioners, distributors), and is named after Joséphine de Beauharnais, Napoleon Bonaparte’s wife, who was passionate about science and botany. It aims at helping consumers choose better, helping brands communicate better, and helping distributors and outlets better identify the “authentic brands of rare fragrances”. Those that satisfy the criteria of the quality and commitment charter of the Comité Joséphine [1]  will be allowed to join the committee and obtain its quality label."
Makeup resists crisis and appeal to ready-to-wear brands,"Sales of prestige beauty products (brands sold in specialised beauty stores and in department stores) in France declined by 1.5% in value in 2013, after a drop of 0.9% in 2012. However, while sales of skincare products and fragrances declined by 1.7%, makeup ended the year on steady sales. Furthermore, as sales of makeup products grew by 1% on the first eight months of 2014, said the NPD research firm. “In the long term, it is the category that progressed the most in the selective perfumery channel, growing by 15% between 2006 and 2013,” says Mathilde Lion, beauty expert at NPD. According to NPD, sales of prestige makeup products in France are expected to rise by about 1% in 2014. Make-up sales remain strong despite the crisis.  “The rise is moderate in value, due to the development of low cost ranges by new players, but sales in volumes are boosted by numerous innovations and new products,"" says NDP. This is the case for mascara brushes or eyebrow gels.  While nail polishes benefited from a widening of ranges and colours driven by new fashion trends that encouraged repeated purchases from consumers. In addition, thanks to very low entry-level process, makeup products benefits from impulse purchases.  “Makeup remains a little and reasonable indulgence that one’s still considers as accessible,” said Ms. Lion. Finally, the last factor that helps these products resist crisis is that, thanks to make-up “one’s can buy luxury brands at a reasonable price,"" she added. Besides prestige brands, the French make-up market is captured by mass market brands (L’Oréal Paris ...), and by beauty retailers’ (Sephora, Nocibé ...) and mass market private label brands (Carrefour’s Les Cosmétiques Design Paris, Intermarché’s Labell Paris ...) as well as by the more recent brands launched by textile brands such as H&M, Zara, Camaieu or, lately, Etam. Impacted by consumption cuts made by French consumers, the ready-to-wear market recorded declining sales for six consecutive years, some brands therefore perceive the makeup market as offering alternative growth opportunities. Accessories (leather goods, jewellery and beauty) help read-to-wear brands to recruit new customers, to increase the frequency of store visits and to stimulate additional sales, and therefore to rise the average purchase. Eventually, “there is still room for new players in the makeup market, as illustrated the recent success of Italian brand Kiko. Clearly, there are market shares to conquer in France,” in particular in the low cost segment, deems Yves Marin, consumption specialist at Kurt Salmon."
Beauty & Cosmetics: Four trends to be followed,"Customization Helga Hertsig-Lavocah, Trend Manager at Hint Creative Consultancy, deciphered the agro-food industry, which abounds with concepts that it seems could be adapted to the cosmetics industry. The democratization of 3D printing offers unprecedented individualization perspectives. Practises such as adding a dose of actives or transforming a product through a mixture are increasingly used in the tin and drink departments, with launches such as Shake Me by William Saurin or Teavana® Shaken Iced Teas. Chrono-cosmetics and natural harmony Nature is more than ever an important source of inspiration. “We are getting beyond products stuffed with natural ingredients to turn towards seasonal concepts that can adapt to the skin’s specific needs in spring, summer, autumn, or winter, as can be seen with Dong Fang Ji Dao or Arimino Mint Shampoo. In addition, recovering a healthy, depolluted skin by imitating what Nature does best in this field constitutes a strong quest in Asia, but also in most large cities throughout the world. Specific ingredients like garlic, detoxifying mushrooms, or the lotus flower are getting widely used for their renowned depolluting action,” explains Florence Bernardin, the founder of Info & Inspiration. Communities revolution Today’s consumers, and in particular younger generations, are revolutionizing the buying act. “Women consumers look for disinterested opinions and advice on the Internet before they buy. Blogs’ influence on purchases is stronger than the women’s press: up to 23% compared to 7%. The democratization of the Do It Yourself also encourages women to watch tutorial videos and learn how to put on their makeup or do their hair. There are 14 million beauty videos on YouTube, and influential people such as Michelle Phan gather up to 7 million followers, whereas brands, despite a strong presence on the market, reach only 500,000, at best,” underlines Géraldine Cohen, founder of social shopping website The Beautyst. In the USA, the NYX makeup brand reached a turnover of 100 million dollars in ten years by investing neither in the media, nor in advertising, nor in offers. It is an example of success of a pure digital company, and it has just been bought out by L’Oréal. Older consumers On the other hand, women consumers are aging: “one woman out of two is now aged 50 or more,” explains Stéphane Soudillat, of Little Less Conversation. And “86% of them claim they don’t understand ads and conclude they must not be destined for them. Yet, the buying power of this age group is of 87 euros per year for a face care product: that’s 15 euros more than women aged 40-59 and 47 euros more than the 25-39 age group.” Whether in Asia or North America, a few great players in the cosmetics industry have already seized the opportunities arising from these new demands by offering innovative products and unique marketing concepts. To be continued…"
Haircare claims increasingly align with the skincare sector,"“Haircare has become an exciting space for new product developments, manufacturers are trying to convince consumers that they should adopt a haircare regimen to match their skincare regimen and they’re doing this by using a new lexicon, learning from other categories and extending formats into new segments. Claims inspired by skincare and colour cosmetics, such as anti-ageing and product featuring light-reflecting technology, offer exciting growth opportunities for the haircare market,” said Emmanuelle Moeglin, Global Fragrance and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel, in a speech at the Cosmeeting tradeshow in Paris. According to Mintel’s Global New Product Database (GNPD), “Brightening” and “Illuminating” is the fastest growing claim - with the number of new products carrying this claim globally shooting up from 21% of all global haircare launches in 2010 to 46% in 2014 [1]. The research from Mintel has found anti-ageing haircare has huge scope but is yet to match skincare in this arena – while 27% of facial skincare global launches in 2014 were anti-ageing, only 3% of haircare global launches carried this claim, suggesting opportunities for growth in the haircare sector. Indeed, when it comes to anti-ageing ingredients in haircare, Mintel reveals that almost half (46%) of UK consumers are interested in using them and an additional 19% would pay more for them. Meanwhile, a quarter (26%) of French haircare users notice some changes in their hair as they get older, but just 25% of users remain unsure of the benefits of using anti-ageing haircare products. “Anti-ageing will increasingly move into haircare and there is scope for a far higher use of biomimetic ingredients especially in stimulating hair growth, offering anti-hair loss and volumising solutions,” suggests Emmanuelle. The potential of the anti-aging claim in haircare is confirmed by another research focusing on haircare consumption habits of Black consumers in the US [2].  According to Mintel, 42% of Black consumers have tried or would be interested in trying anti-aging hair products. In keeping with the trend of combating the effects of aging, 30% of Black consumers have used or are interested in haircare products that treat baldness and thinning, while 46% have used or would be willing to try colour or tint products. “The movement toward natural hair - whether natural hair weave or all-natural styles - is making Blacks a lot more conscious about the ingredients they put in their hair. They are looking for ingredients that are natural, restore damaged hair, and make their hair healthy - and they’re looking for results. Anti-aging products that include natural ingredients and promise to deliver on restoration are sure to appeal to Black shoppers,” explains Tonya Roberts, multicultural analyst at Mintel. Finally, also taking inspiration from skincare, customisation in the haircare market is set to continue to grow in popularity as consumers show strong demand for these products.  Indeed, in France, three in ten (29%) women express an interest in buying customised hair treatment products designed for their hair needs. “New entrants in the haircare sector are responding to a rise in demand in customisation by offering customised shampoo, blending bases with concentrated serum and resulting in a made-to-measure haircare products. As consumers increasingly look for a personalised products, we expect this trend to expand into mainstream haircare in 2014 and beyond,” concludes Emmanuelle Moeglin."
"Mascara, the makeup star","“If there were only one, it would be mascara. It is the one essential makeup product to all women, even the most inexperienced,” underlines Hélène Lefur, professional makeup artist and trainer. And sales statistics are here to prove it. “Of our whole catalogue, mascaras are the best-selling products in the 40 countries where we distribute our brand,” states Anne Delleur, President of Arcancil, the French expert brand for eye makeup, whose story is closely related to compact mascara. “This represents over 24% of market share in value, in France and on the international scale,” she adds. The phenomenon is driven by the nude trend. “The craze for a polished, natural complexion urges women to highlight the gaze that intensifies personality traits. Lashes, and eyebrows as well now, which constitute a booming segment on all markets, and are also worked with mascara, must be treated almost in an artistic manner,” explains Leïla Rochet-Podvin, Director of Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation, the consulting agency in beauty innovation. Consumers are guided by blogs and tutorials, and are getting familiar with more and more accurate application techniques. Mascara is one of the essential elements of this collection. According to Euromonitor, worldwide sales increased by 4.6% between 2012 and 2013 (2.1% in Europe). Arcancil confirms this rise in all countries, except for Japan and Korea. “Yet, Asia is actually the continent that has been enhancing the impact of brushes on the market for about ten years, especially with colour brushes,” notes Florence Bernardin, Director of Information & Inspiration, and Cosmetic Market Analyst for Asia. “However, mascara is put under pressure by the boom of false eyelashes. They are very easy to put on for Asian women, and they offer many advantages. The real challenge for mascara is to obtain the same results in terms of effects and long wear”. Volume expectations remain the most significant, especially in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. Asians prefer curves and separation for a fan effect. And the main suppliers share this view. “Our best-selling mascaras are those that claim more volume,” declares Pilar Gonzalez Gomez, of Geka, which has just launched RunwaySTAR, a brush fitted with five nubs to increase volume, and four-edged bristles at the tip for a push-up effect. As for Albéa, the market leader confirms the volume effect represents “80% of the world’s demand on average, with variations depending on the region.” However, according to Aurélie Émond, Marketing Director for Cosmetic Rigid Packaging, “mascara has a special place in the kingdom of makeup: products get launched at a phenomenal rate, and promises for volume, length, thickness, curve, and all their combinations make women dream…” Hence the need to pay very close attention to every single product component, and to brushes in particular, which require real technical wizardry, though it remains too little-known. “Indeed, imagining or developing a new brush is always a technical challenge, whether it be made of fibres or plastic. The goal is to manage to create a perfect brush-formula-bottle trio.” At the last Cosmopack show in Bologna, Italy, the group unveiled My Style, a range of four fibre brushes adapted to the various effects of length, volume, definition, or curve wanted. “The brush is a vehicle for communication, it must express the mascara’s makeup promise,” Aurélie Émond insists. As for colours, classic black remains the star on all markets, although it is being challenged by blue or purple in a few countries keen on colours, such as Brazil. Fluorescent or neon colours have a marginal impact, and target the younger ones for occasional uses. The avenues for progress involve effects and finishes, whether sequined, shimmering, pearly, or tear, which the Japanese are crazy about. “There are many expectations, but the technological response is still disappointing,” Anne Delleur comments. The demand for volume is getting mixed with expectations for eye care mascaras, already available on the natural segment, as can be seen with the 100% natural Organic wear CC Curl + Care mascara by Physicians Formula, which Leïla Rochet-Podvin found out in the United States. To celebrate its 80th anniversary in 2015, Arcancil will relaunch their mythical compact mascara. The resolutely vintage Cake mascara will be enriched with a formula containing soothing, protective and repairing beeswax. “We are going to focus our launches on eye care over the next three years. It represents the future of mascara,” Anne Delleur concludes."
Mascara: a long tradition of innovation,"Mascara is probably For the past years, mascara constantly reinvents itself and continues to surprise and propose innovations. Here is a short historical overview on the main evolutions of the market. Since it was invented in the 19th century by Eugène Rimmel, who used a bulk made of petroleum jelly, mascara has been evolving and transforming almost constantly.  In 1923 appears the cake mascara, sold for the first time with a brush as applicator. In 1957 Helena Rubinstein creates a lotion-based cream formula. Mascara-Matic, the first mascara wand and tube applicator is launched. It is the “first automatic mascara that needs no brush”.  In 1959, Maybelline launched the first filaments twisted brush (spiral brush).  Then, in 1964, the American brand creates the first mass market tubed mascara: Ultra lash mascara. As for the first moulded brush using thermoplastic elastomer, it was launched in 2004 by the Beiersdorf group for its Nivea Beauty brand. One innovation has been succeeding to another at a fast pace!  Mascara is an area of intense innovation: there are actually more than 2,500 patents filled worldwide, be it for packaging, formulas or for new application systems.  Formula protection has been heavily investigated, with patents on the use of airless packs for mascara, or on antibacterial brushes. It is true that mascara is one of the most used makeup products in the world and the variety of tastes opens unlimited opportunities to manufacturers. In the U.S., where innovation drives sales, claims are getting increasingly sophisticated. The quest for perfection and eternal youth is also noticeable at the level of eyelashes. Even in Asia, where they compete with false eyelashes, mascaras are not outdone and are seeking to find a new dimension in particular by offering mini brushes to catch all the little lashes, or by treating lashes with anti-aging serum effects, etc."
MakeUp in New York is opening its doors today!,"Premium Beauty News - Figures posted regarding this fourth edition are impressive. How do you explain this ever growing interest one year after another? Sandra Maguarian - The evidence is there! The concept that we have developed in New York, Paris, Seoul and now Sao Paulo, corresponds better to the expectations of the entire professional beauty industry. An event, above all, professional but most of all personalised and friendly. This fourth gathering in New York, which promises to be a success is the result of many months of work and complicity with the suppliers in this industry but also our visitors, in this case their customers, so that each minute of their presence at the show is as profitable as possible. The high profile and the involvement of many big names in the industry, taking part to conferences is a big investment for us but an essential one. Premium Beauty News - From the outside, people don’t always realize the huge amount of work it requires. Jean-Yves Bourgeois - I think it’s actually does no harm to remind people of the work such an event involves upstream during the twelve months preceding it, and this, at all levels. Especially when you know that its concept is based on the idea of ""full service"". We take care of everything....: the booths, their furniture, the conferences, the events, meals and of course the cocktail party...., which this year will bring several hundred people together. All this mobilizes a lot of people, requires a lot of meetings and trips abroad. The success of MakeUp in New York is clearly the result of four years of work. It is also the result of a global work which started in Paris and continued in Seoul and now Sao Paulo. Premium Beauty News - What do you think of the operation organized by Cosmoprof that will start on the eve of your event to continue during the first day of your show? Jean-Yves Bourgeois -  You know, Sandra Maguarian and I have always been in favour of a healthy competition, and we always will. But clearly, this event does not look like it. Coincidentally enough, it was announced a few weeks ago and organized concurrently to MakeUp in New York. Coincidentally enough, it will address mainly themes that relate specifically to the make-up industry. Coincidentally enough, the organization has planned to take in charge, it seems, some of the participants’ hotel rooms, participants who, coincidentally enough, for the vast majority of them, happen to be our customers... That’s quite a lot of coincidences at once, don’t you think? Premium Beauty News - How is the year 2015 shaping up for your four events? Sandra Maguarian - It looks excellent! At a time when precisely other organizers continue to extend their reach to other areas, including ours, we are in fact going strengthen the ""exclusive"" aspect of our shows. MakeUp in Sao Paulo will be positioned exactly that way with the main stakeholders in this industry that are in the process of establishing themselves in this part of the world. MakeUp in Seoul is also looking extremely promising. Not only are Korean companies supporting the event (to note that the Amore Pacific Group has asked to be the preferred partner next year again!) but the share of ’foreign’ companies continues to grow. As for MakeUp in Paris, I’m afraid there isn’t much to say, aside from the fact that this new 2015 edition promises to be a huge success. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the exhibitors and visitors who everyday renew their support to us."
"Skincare: the future of personalisation is in the lab, Canadean says","Many skincare brands have already responded to the need for individualism by offering their customers in-store skin consultancies to detect their skin type and match them with the right product. Now the first movers in skincare are taking personalisation to a new level when they offer laboratory tests and individually labelled products. A new survey from Canadean [1] finds that many British customers are prepared to go far to find their personal skin cream match: 45% of UK adults say that they are interested in the laboratory approach to personal skincare, and many of these say that they are prepared to go to a specialised laboratory, and would even prefer this compared to getting their personal product from other channels such as department stores or filling out online questionnaires. Of those interested in personalised care products, 54% say they are ready to provide blood, skin and hair samples to be tested in a laboratory, 51% would be interested in giving a DNA swab samples, and 52% would like to go to a medical dermatologist consultation. Preparing skincare products according to individual recipes takes time, and consumers will most likely have to wait to get their products made. According to the survey, consumers are prepared to wait for up to a month to receive their product. 59% of consumers are also prepared to pay a premium for such products. “Over 22 % of skincare consumption by volume globally is driven by individualism, and with the development of new technologies, manufacturers have opportunities to take it to a whole new level. Factors such as allergies, genetic predisposal, nutrition, climate and exposure to the sun are all individual needs perfect for tailoring,” explains Veronika Zhupanova, analyst at Canadean. In Russia, I.C. Lab offers consumers individually-made skincare products, produced with personal skin characteristics in mind. The customers are invited to the laboratory, where their skin is tested, and in a few weeks they can collect the product made specifically for them that not only satisfy the needs of the skin, but it also features their surname on the package. At the moment, the brand is presented in Russia and the Ukraine. The cream is set at a premium price: Costs 3000 RUB for 15ml eye-cream (around 50 pounds or 63 euros). According to Canadean, the trend is also picking up slowly in the UK where Nivea launched last July its ‘Face Facts Boutique’ for the new Cellular Anti-Age range. The rolling booth was set up in a number of UK shopping centres providing consultations using a new technology to analyse the customers’ skin, advise on the best skincare routine and answer any skin-aging questions."
"Brazilian lifestyle inspires the cosmetics industry worldwide, Mintel reports","According to Mintel, 16% of the launches inspired by Brazil were found in France, and 14% in the UK between August 2013 and July 2014. Following them, are the US with 12%, and Japan with 10%. Brazilian influence in the cosmetics sector is seen largely on the ingredients platform, with products featuring one of four key claims such as “Brazilian”, “from Brazil”, “sourced from Brazil” or “inspired by Brazil”. The global hair care market also appears as increasingly inspired by Brazilian products. For instance, Mintel notes that while previously the vast majority of hair care product launches specifying the use of salt-free formulations were found in the Brazilian market, this is slowly changing.  In 2011, Brazil represented 95% of these launches, while the rest of the world accounted for 5%.  However, in 2013, Brazil accounted for 86% and the rest of the world, 14%. “Brazil has traditionally been seen as an incredibly rich source of natural ingredients but today it is an inspiring beauty market in its own right. The Brazilian determination to look as good as possible whatever the cost is driving the country’s beauty market forward. At the same time, blending elements of Brazilian culture and lifestyle with popular naturals such as açaí and cupuaçu is an attractive approach for consumers in other countries. The next two years will see the Brazilian influence spread even further and deeper as beauty companies build on the after-effects of the Fifa World Cup and the run-up to the Rio Olympics in 2016,” says Vivienne Rudd, Global Director of Insight, Beauty & Personal Care, at Mintel. While Brazil is showing its importance on the global stage, it still has scope to further grow its own market. For instance, the Brazilian skincare market is characterized by basic claims, such as moisturising and hydrating, present in 77% of the variants but only 66% of global launches.  Issues of sensitivity and safety will help to move Brazilian skincare forward as evidenced by the popularity of the dermatologically tested claim, present in 40% of skincare launches in Brazil but only 26% of global launches.  Meanwhile, claims like brightening and illuminating and paraben-free, which are popular globally, are found in 25% and 21% respectively of the global new product launches, are not even part of the 10 top claims in the Brazilian skincare market, when considering products launched between August 2013 and July 2014. In addition, Mintel’s research reveals that 27% of Brazilian consumers use facial skincare products mainly to improve the texture of their skin, 25% use them to treat and prevent acne and 23% to minimise the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  Indeed, the skincare market is performing well.  Sun care, growing on a rate of 12.5%, and body care, 12.4%, categories are set to be two of the country’s fastest growing subcategories between 2012 and 2016, well ahead for example of facial skincare (6.3%). Underlining the growing importance of sun care, Mintel forecasts that it will overtake facial skincare in terms of value by the end of 2014, recording sales of R$ 2,177 million (US$ 0.94 billion) compared to facial skincare sales of R$ 2,146 million (US$ 0.92 billion).  “There is clearly scope for more sophisticated claims in the Brazilian market. Dermocosmetics and hybrid products such as tinted sunscreens, sun protecting foundations and multi tasking BB/CC creams will increasingly use enhanced claims of protection, prevention and personalisation, unlocking the potential of the facial skincare category,” adds Vivienne Rudd. However, there are also opportunities to be found in hair care - the male consumer is very keen on looking after his hair. Indeed, Mintel’s research reveals that 61% of Brazilian men use shampoo daily, compared to 27% of women, and 61% of men use styling products everyday (compared to 41% of women). Furthermore, 44% of Brazilian men use a hair treatment every day, compared to just 23% of women. However while 33% of male hair care users choose male-specific products, only 2% of hair care launches in Brazil, in 2014 up to July, targeted men."
"Sample subscriptions significantly influence makeup purchases, reports NPD","Making consumers pay for samples may pays off long-term for manufacturers and retailers.  Actually, among women who subscribe to makeup sample subscription programs, 83 per cent were influenced to buy the full-sized product, according to the 2014 Makeup In-Depth Consumer Report, The NPD Group] from The NPD Group. “The idea of offering samples has been around for some time, but sample subscription programs are a fresh way for manufacturers and retailers to engage with interested consumers and monetize their sample programs, while consumers discover brands or products they may not have been aware of previously,” said Karen Grant, vice president and global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. “Women strive to find a makeup product that works for them, and when they do, that is the primary reason they become loyal to it.” Most women like to self-test products without pressure, and samples give them that ability. Take home samples are the second most popular makeup shopping preference, over things like salesperson explanation and personal consultation, but retailers are finding new ways to incorporate samples into the shopping, and even purchasing, experience. According to the market research firm, one in five makeup users have received a makeup sample in the past year, primarily from retailers (17 per cent). Women under the age of 55, specifically the 18-34 year olds, are most likely to report receiving a makeup sample in the past year. Makeup samples strongly influence purchase decisions for about one-third of women, while over half are somewhat influenced by these samples. The 35-54 age group is the most likely to be influenced by samples, indicating opportunity that goes beyond the youngest generations. “Sample subscriptions are still relatively small in their reach, but their potential impact on the makeup industry is significant. Incorporating this method of product discovery into a marketing and sales strategy can uncover new consumers and expand on target audiences,” added Grant."
US lip cosmetics market set to reach $1.4 billion this year,"After experiencing a 2% decline from 2011-2013, the US lip cosmetics segment posted gains of nearly 9% between 2012 and 2014, with sales poised to reach nearly 1.4 billion U.S. dollars (1.06 billion euros) this year [1], according to new research from Mintel. While lip cosmetics still account for the smallest percentage of total colour cosmetics sales, it is currently the strongest performing segment in terms of growth, compared to 6.4% growth for the facial cosmetics market ($4.8 billion) and 4.2% gains for eye makeup ($3.4 billion) during that same time period. Lip cosmetics are used by the vast majority of US women, with nearly nine out of 10 (87%) reporting usage. Lip balm has the highest overall penetration, with 60% of women using it, followed by lipstick at 58%, although there is a definite generation gap. The 18-24 demographic uses lip balm to lipstick to the tune of 72% vs 50%, while the over 65 senior set uses lipstick over lip balm 82% vs 45%. Of those who use lip cosmetics, 67% look for moisturizing/hydrating claims while 61% seek out long-lasting lip wear and almost half (48%) are swayed by lip softening properties. “Lip cosmetics have the highest overall reported use among colour cosmetics. Lip balm, lipstick, and lip gloss all have similar rates of penetration, suggesting that many women rely on a suite of lip products depending on the occasion or desired look,” says Shannon Romanowski, beauty and personal care analyst at Mintel. For lip cosmetics as for other colour cosmetic products, users strongly rely on mass brands.  However, prestige brands are gaining ground in the segment of facial products.  “Forty-four per cent of highlighter/illuminator users purchase from a prestige brand compared to only 24% of lip gloss users who bought prestige,” points the market research firm. “Facial cosmetics, in general, are viewed as higher-risk purchases - women want to be sure that products are appropriate for their skin type and tone and therefore rely on in-store samples and consultants for guidance. On the other hand, users of lip cosmetics, especially lip balm, are more inclined to purchase from budget brands in comparison to users of facial and eye cosmetics. Lip products are likely perceived as low-risk purchases. Ultimately, retailers are challenged to help women navigate the sometimes overwhelming colour cosmetics category, especially when it comes to higher-risk-and higher-priced purchases such as facial cosmetics,” Shannon adds."
Women pay more and more attention to their eyebrows,"Sales of eyebrow products are skyrocketing in the UK, the USA and in France, according to recent figures published by The NPD Group.  Sales of prestige brow products accounted for £6.5 million in the period January to May 2014 in the UK, reporting a rise of 52% on the same period in 2013.  However, the growth of the brow market is not confined to the UK as a similar trend exists in the USA where sales reached $57.6 million over the same period, growing by 27% compared to 2013. In France, sales of brow products reached almost 2 million euros from January to May 2014, a growth of about 20% compared to 2013. In comparison, the next star performer in the make-up category in the UK is lip liner, which grew by 27% and is followed by eye shadow which grew by 19% compared to the same period last year (YTD May 2014). ""Falsely abandoned, eyebrows are now the subject of a real attention and of sophisticated beauty rituals, both on the catwalks and at home. This is a relatively new makeup habit for French women compared to other markets such as Asia and this is great news for the industry,"" said Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. Both in France and the UK, brow pencils remain the most popular products in this category. In the UK, aside from two powders, 8 out of the top 10 selling brow products in 2013 were brow pencils. In France, 9 of the 10 best selling brow products were pencils. In France, ""there is a craze about eyebrows beauty and it goes beyond what products can offer, it impacts the entire industry with, for example, the proliferation of eyebrow bars and corners (Benefit, L’Atelier du Sourcil) and of beauty offering to dye and to makeup women’s eyebrows, and addition to simply shape,"" Mathilde Lion concludes. Much more than a fad, we may be witnessing the emergence of new beauty practices."
"Beauteam settles its ""MakeUp In"" concept on four continents and launches “MakeUp in Action”","Premium Beauty News -You achieved a remarkable performance in just five years! Jean-Yves Bourgeois -  Nothing can be taken for granted! However, we demonstrated that there is room for a professional event dedicated to the make-up segment. A concept of its own where quality was one of the main founding criteria: quality of exhibitors, quality of visitors, quality of the organization, of conferences, of animations. Contrary to the natural tendency of some show organizers, we don’t intend to ""grow for the sake of growing"" and especially not to disperse ourselves too thin. This strategy ""of being global and of encompassing everything"" only benefits the income of organizers and certainly not that of exhibitors who placed their trust in a concept, and deserve to be supported on the long-term in their markets conquest. Premium Beauty News - Can we speak of a selective event concerning MakeUp in Paris, New York, Seoul and soon, Sao Paulo? Sandra Maguarian - I prefer calling it ""exclusivity"". Visitors and exhibitors are the ones who tell us so every year: ""Don’t increase in size!""  They are right. This is what makes and will continue to make all the attractiveness of our events.  And we have already indicated that we would limit next year the accessibility to our four MakeUp In events, whether in Paris, New York, Seoul or Sao Paulo. Premium Beauty News - Why not diversify the show, like others do? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - I am convinced that it would be a strategic error! Our unique positioning - the exclusive gathering of suppliers of makeup packaging, applicators and formulas - allows us to attract an overwhelming majority (65%) of visitors coming from brands’ marketing teams. This is what makes the originality and value of exhibiting at the ""MakeUp In"" shows. In the field of make-up, which is in itself very close to that of fashion, what matters are the marketing teams, because they reflect on the product and design it, for the year to come or even the year after.  It is a wining strategy on the mature and innovation driven markets where we are settled.  In particular because it puts packaging and applicators and brushes under the spotlights. The R&D and purchasing departments of beauty brands therefore enjoy a unique opportunity to have a 360° view on the whole chain of suppliers in the makeup industry. As a rule, we will refuse to set foot in a field that isn’t ours. It is always risky for organizers: ""Grasp all, lose all."" There is a risk of losing your soul by tackling too many goals at the same time. Premium Beauty News - Why is your concept so different than others? Sandra Maguarian - The assets of the ""MakeUp In"" concept, that can be summarized in a few words: ""Targeted, Close to customers, Efficient, an Optimum Cost/Contact, Service"". This notion of ""service"" has also become fundamental. Exhibitors when they pay for their stand, are expecting more than just a booth space. They want a ""comprehensive service"", with the assurance of being well treated with all due respect. A ""comprehensive service"" which includes their stand and a specific environment, as well as meals, conferences, animations. Everything is important. The end with ""Take your stand and please don’t comment on it!"" Premium Beauty News - You’re also launching “MakeUp In Action”. Jean-Yves Bourgeois -  We have been working on it for several months. The idea is quite simple.  Our four events in Paris, New York, Seoul and Sao Paulo are and must stay dedicated to one continent.  However, there are sometimes, in some of these continents, one or several areas where there are enough business opportunities for the make up industry and where it would be useful to organise business meetings.  The first MakeUp in Action will be held at the beginning of 2015. Where? It will be a surprise…"
United Kingdom: Mass-market colour cosmetics to challenge prestige products,"With 93% of UK women using colour cosmetics, total sales grew to £1.5 billion in 2013, an impressive 6% increase on 2012 sales which reached £1.4 billion. According to Mintel [1], Sales of mass-market colour cosmetics in the United Kingdom are set to hit £1 billion in 2014, with prestige sales additionally predicted to reach £552 million. Notably, it is prestige sales which have seen the biggest growth, holding a 35% share of the market in 2013 (£531 million), up from 34% in 2012 (£491 million), highlights Mintel. Mass market’s share on the other hand has fallen from 66% in 2012 (£939 million) to 65% in 2013 (£986 million).  “However, as savvy shopping behaviours continue in the beauty market - and innovation is matched by mass-market brands - the prestige share of the market is unlikely to see continued increases by the end of 2014,” says Charlotte Libby, Senior Beauty Analyst at Mintel.  “Prestige brands can encourage consumers to trade up with smaller size products, offering a more purse-friendly method of trialling products. Mass brands can also focus marketing communications on their product formulations, dissuading consumers that more expensive products are the only choice for advanced formulations.” Within the prestige sector, it is eyebrow definers that top the colour cosmetic choice with one in five (22%) users choosing a prestige branded product over a mass-market or budget brand. Sales of eyebrow products reached £28 million in 2013, an impressive 42% increase on 2012 sales which were valued at £20 million. With a quarter (25%) of UK women now using eyebrow definer, this growth looks set to continue with sales predicted to reach £31 million in 2014. Further to this, Mintel’s analysis shows that brand loyalty amongst prestige colour cosmetic users is strong, in particular for foundations and base products. Despite its low penetration in the prestige sector, as the creativity of nail polish has become increasingly fashionable and accessible, the nail colour cosmetic segment continues to grow from strength to strength. Sales of nail polish surpassed lip colour for the first time in 2013 with the former reaching sales of £244 million and the latter £242 million. Whilst this marked a 6.6% increase for nail polish sales, they are predicted to reach £284 million by 2014, with the lip sector expected to grow to just £244 million in 2014. Seven in ten (69%) British women now use nail polish, compared to just six in 10 (59%) women in 2013. Today, usage peaks at 16-24 year olds with four in five (81%) of this age group using nail colour. Rather than having a firm favourite, almost half (48%) of nail polish users wear four or more shades, with purple being worn by half (48%) of nail polish users, closely followed by baby pink (45%) and dark red (42%). In the rest of the colour cosmetic segment however, the palette is becoming muted with a third (33%) of UK women who use eye, lip or nail colour cosmetics saying they only use natural-look products, with this attitude having no age bias (32% of 16-24-year-olds and 33% of 55-64-year-olds). “In 2013 fashion began to move towards a more natural look with ‘no-make-up-make-up’ becoming a popular trend. This has continued into 2014 with the #NoMakeupSelfie nominations on Facebook and products to enhance natural skin instead of covering it,” Charlotte Libby concludes."
"“The natural cosmetics market needs strong brands”, Elfriede Dambacher","Natural and organic cosmetics have had ample growth rates for years. The segment is growing globally. How do you evaluate this trend?  Elfriede Dambacher [1] - Natural and organic cosmetics have become a self-evident part of the cosmetics market. So it is not a trend which will ease off, but a trend that clearly depicts that natural and organic cosmetics have arrived amidst our society. To what do you attribute these changes?  Elfriede Dambacher -  The requirements of consumers are changing. What was once an ecological avant-garde looking for alternatives to the usual cosmetics products has turned into a widespread social current. These consumers live by new values and are looking for products that work for them, are harmless, health-wise and also do not pose a risk to the environment. This is affecting the markets and has alerted the entire cosmetics industry. How much influence do natural and organic cosmetics have on the development of the cosmetics market?  Elfriede Dambacher -  In the beginning the influence was limited, because the natural cosmetics market was not of interest to the entire cosmetics industry. In the last few years more activities were noticeable. The entire cosmetics industry was experimenting. Products were green-washed, natural brands bought out. What is necessary for success?  Elfriede Dambacher -  Consumers expect natural and organic cosmetics to work as well as other cosmetics, but also have the additional benefit of “nature”. To achieve this, much research was done. New products were developed, which today convince with texture and effectiveness. Skincare now offers modern textures providing a pleasant sensation on the skin, all without silicone oils. Today, natural products are convincing, but consumers also pay attention to the authenticity and credibility of a brand. Transparency is needed and the story behind the products is important. Are natural and organic cosmetics going to continue to grow?  Elfriede Dambacher -  The cosmetics market at large is going greener and natural and organic cosmetics have gained new customers. This affects the entire cosmetics market. But the market requires strong brands, implementing new ideas in retail. The classic marketing strategy is not sufficient anymore. What is put in the shopping basket is determined only by the consumer.  The challenges for natural and organic cosmetics will increase. Therefore the emphasis of the next Natural and Organic Cosmetics Conference [2] will be future-oriented solutions. International experts and futurologists will take a closer look at the natural and organic cosmetics industry, the challenges it needs to meet and how to successfully master these challenges."
Russia: sales of cosmetics keep on fast-growth path,"Experts interviewed by the organizers of InterCHARM Moscow, the largest trade show dedicated to the beauty industry in Russia, CIS and Eastern Europe, estimate that sales of cosmetic and perfumed products in Russia have kept the same pace in the first half of 2014 compared to the same period last year. “As far as Professional Hair Products are concerned, the Russian market has been constantly growing over the last few years, and with this growth all problems and issues related to mature markets naturally followed,” said Barex Italiana’s Carlo Baiesi.  “Nevertheless the cultural attitude towards cosmetics, the curiosity for novelties and the openness to new techniques and products still make Russia a market where investments and efforts are well rewarded.” According to RBC research, in 2013, the Russian cosmetics and perfumery market grew by 11% and approached USD 15 billion (EUR 11,1 billion).  Figures provided by Rosstat, the Russian Federation’s State Statistics Service draw a similar picture: sales of perfumery and cosmetic goods would have grown by 14.1% in 2013 versus 13.2% in 2012. Such outcomes are really impressive particularly when compared with the European market where sales of cosmetic products showed a 0.8% drop in 2014.  Figures in some individual EU member states are even worse: the Spanish and Greek markets declined by 3.6%, the Italian market by 1.2% and France by 0.4%, while Germany, the biggest market within the EU, has demonstrated a modest upturn of 0.6%. In the context, exports have become the main growth driver for cosmetics makers in the EU.  The importance of the Russian market has progressed accordingly.  Russia accounted for 3.4% of the global cosmetics and perfumery market in 2013, reported AT Kearney. Imported personal care products accounts for over than half of the Russian market and in the luxury segment imported cosmetics and perfumes represent between 70 per cent and 100 per cent of the market.  The main importers of perfumery and cosmetics goods in Russia are France, with a market share of 24.4%, Germany (11%), Poland (6.9%), Italy (6.8%) and the USA (6,2%).

"Cosmetic innovation: China - Brazil, the winning match","“There is certainly a lot to put and think in common, from a very global standpoint”, Florence Bernardin underlines, “Chinese and Brazilian women both have an oily skin that is exposed to the sun and pollution, they have the same desire for naturalness, and a very strong relationship with water and hygiene”. There is thus a great need for light, fluid or aqueous textures resulting from these common protection and purity expectations in Asia. These non-greasy textures are also popular in Brazil. As an example, sun care ranges now offer very specific “toque seco” products with a dry skin feel, such as those by La Roche Posay, Avene, L’Oreal, or Vichy Capital Soleil Toque Seco SPF50… Mists and light sprays are ubiquitous on sun protection markets in China or Korea, and have become so in Brazil as well, though they are mainly destined for the body (see Sundown, Oboticario, Natura, Neutrogena, Dermage, Nivea, Golden Plus…). Foams are extremely popular in Asia, and are now appearing in Brazil, where they provide lightness, sensoriality, but also homogeneity, because they are tinted. This is an interesting aspect that may, this time, be applied to Asia (see Dermage Photoage Mousse FPS50+, or Vichy Capital Soleil BB Aera-Mousse FPS30). The anti-dark spot approach, already firmly established in Asia with the whitening ranges, is being mass-marketed in Brazil with the arrival of Vitamin C-based formulations, which even out the complexion while increasing the skin’s elasticity. Whitening and anti-aging are thus joining here… (Granado Loção facial Hidra C FPS 15, Dermage Improce C20, L’Oreal Revitalift Clareador, Vichy Liftactive Serum, or the new RoC Serum/Gel Creme C-Supérieur Concentrado 16 %). Following the example of Asia, the Brazilian market is also very concerned with dark circles: we should soon see new vitamin C and/or retinol-based products, such as Natura’s Chronos Pharma Serum Intensivo Clareador Antissinais. Florence Bernardin notes that, in order to offer Brazilian women mascaras worth their lashes, a next step may be inspired from the Asian smudgeproof formulas that resist against lower lid sebum (preventing panda eyes), but also against ambient humidity, and which are to be removed with hot water. From a more global standpoint, she foresees a very promising momentum in this segment. “It is still a small market, but its creativity and product diversity are very interesting”. With Quem disse Berenice?, the Brazilian Kiko which belongs to the O Boticario group, customers can buy different brushes for different effects, but for the same mascara. “This multi-directional approach reminds us of the Korean creativity on the segment”, and of course, “the huge nail varnish market links the two continents”, Florence Bernardin concludes."
"Customization of perfume bottles, a trend of the times","The success of rare and exclusive fragrances, which are available in a limited number of outlets, has demonstrated the desire of some purchasers of luxury perfumes to regain the feeling of exclusivity that modern perfumery has lost with massification. According to Nathalie Pichard, consultant and founder of the company [TopNotes], ""there is a real trend to get back to the basics of luxury that are rarity and exception, but also remarkable craftsmanship and know-how."" French fragrance brand Serge Lutens, for instance, likes to do things big. The brand offers its customers the services of an engraver to write down their initials or their name on the bottle of the perfume they selected. The price is 31 euros for one initial, 46 euros for two initials, 61 euros for three and 77 euros for a name, plus the price of the perfume. At Atelier Cologne, it is possible to engrave its initials or its first name on the leather case of travel size fragrances (30ml), which is given for any purchase of a 200 ml size. For 20 euros, the customer can select the colour of its case from seven colours. As for the engraving there are two fonts available. Customers can also opt for golden or silvered letters and a vertical or horizontal engraving. However why only write initials or a name when one’s can write anything else? That may be the theory of Guerlain regarding engraving. The legendary fragrance brand, which has been offering this service for many years, has indeed become a reference in this field. The number of characters that can bee engraved depends on the size of the bottle but the price of the service (25 euros) remains the same whatever the customer decides to write. Up to him to find inspiration. “Ultra customization is a strong societal trend, boosted by social networks and the selfie phenomenon is one of its manifestations,” says Nathalie Pichard. The generalization of this trend is expected to continue, driven both by the growing consumer demand and by technological innovations that will reduce the cost of customization and lead to more variety and sophistication. From this point of view, the advent of 3D printers opens new horizons."
"For Iran’s women, makeup speaks volumes","Everyday wearing of makeup is probably more common in Iran than in some liberal western countries. It is a rare opportunity to parade one’s beauty without fear of official censure.  ""Iranian women wear makeup as soon as they get up in the morning. Even if they feel ill, they know that they must look beautiful in the street,"" says Tina Zarinnam, 30, a fashion designer. The French luxury brand Lancôme recently announced a return to Iran after decades away, inviting around 400 industry insiders and artists to one of the biggest hotels in Tehran to celebrate its comeback. It was the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that a major Western brand - Lancôme is the number one luxury line of the L’Oreal group - had been launched with such fanfare. No American cosmetics brands have been sold on the official Iranian market since the US imposed a trade embargo in the 1980s. US and EU sanctions on oil and other industries remain in force in Iran despite an interim deal aimed at eventually ending the nation’s nuclear standoff with the West, but many foreign businesses have blamed the restrictions for hampering trade. Makeup professionals estimate that Iranian women buy approximately one tube of mascara per month, dwarfing the one every four months bought by the French. Lancôme is presented in Iran by the Safir perfume chain, a leading official distributor of beauty products. Created in 2010, the chain now has nearly 20 branches across the country. ""It’s a booming market, which is roughly several hundred million dollars,"" a brand representative says, adding that this amount is split between its own distribution and the grey market. Only 40 percent of Iran’s market is controlled by official distributors. The rest is divided among bootleggers who operate in parallel in bazaars and small shops that import cosmetics and makeup illegally, says Pegah Goshayeshi, Safir’s chief executive. Imports are costly as regulations are strict and various government officials must approve a product before it can be placed on the market. Wearing makeup does not violate the laws of the Islamic republic, however, because Islam does not prohibit perfumes or cosmetics.  ""The Prophet Mohammed himself used perfume,"" Goshayeshi says. Makeup is also a form of personal expression in a society where compulsory wearing of hijab requires women to cover their hair and their body in loose clothing when outside, regardless of their religion. Tastes in makeup vary in different parts of the country. In northern Iran, a coloured mascara and perfumes with a flowery fragrance is preferred, while women in the south tend to buy black mascara and stronger, more musky perfumes. Iranian men are also gradually leaning toward using more cosmetics.  ""They take better care of their skin, because they want to look younger,"" Goshayeshi adds. In a country affected by a severe economic crisis, partly because of Western sanctions, makeup is considered expensive but it is often a small salve to help forget everyday problems.  ""Makeup has an impact on the one who wears it ... I put on makeup because I love it. I enjoy wearing it. It makes me feel fresh and calm,"" says Forough Heidari, a 42-year-old physiotherapist. And the Iranian market is by no means saturated.   ""There is still room for luxury goods in the medium or low-end market"" despite the presence of 20 Iranian and foreign brands, says Vista Bavar, founder and director of the Caprice brand.  ""Iran has a large youth population, most of whom still live with their parents. They do not have to care too much about expenses"" and can spend a lot on beauty products, she adds."

Beauty according to Millennials,"Premium Beauty News - In the wake of a previous study of Generation X in 2012, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation is now investigating Generation Y. Can you picture it for us? Leïla Rochet-Podvin -  Indeed, in 2014 the spotlight is on their 18-25-year-old daughters, representing the youngest of the so-called Millennials or Generation Y. [1] They are young adults, who grew up in a world of Internet and mobile devices, they consider social networks as part of their everyday lives and do not make a clear distinction between what happens in the real world and what happens virtually.  They have been affected by the economic and environmental crisis that impacts their future outlook and prospects in life, compared to their parents.  Let’s not forget, for instance, that in France 24% of young workers aged 24 or less are unemployed, nevertheless their amazing resilience (and LOL state of mind) leads them into a new consumption model more focused on experience sharing and entrepreneurship. Those intending to appeal to this generation have to renew the old marketing models. Premium Beauty News - What makes its perception of beauty so different compared to previous generations? Leïla Rochet-Podvin -  Women belonging to this generation have a very specific relation to femininity, since their image is easily shared on the net. Their relations with beauty and beauty products widely differs from earlier generations, since most of them were applied skincare products during their youngest years.  They are hyper-informed, they appreciate singularity and have their own information sources. As far as personal care products are concerned, they also have specific expectations in terms of beauty, and brands do not always address their needs correctly. Generation Y is also a strategic target because its members are fond of beauty products, despite limited budgets.  We have even asked them about the contents of their purse and their bathroom to better understand the ""social beauty"" picture of this target. Premium Beauty News - The report deals with France, the USA and South Korea.  How did you collect the information? Why are these different areas so illustrative of today’s beauty? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - First of all, we collected data from the source as we visited New York, Los Angeles and Seoul in order to better understand this generation and see how brands or retailers interact with these women.  In addition to various expert testimonies (nutritionists, dermatologists, bloggers, …), the study results from extensive literature research, and includes a survey conducted online among 300 young women aged 18-25 in France, South Korea and in the United States.  There were many open questions that helped us to better identify meaningful insights.  We chose to focus on three areas: France because it is our country, Korea because K-Beauty has a strong influence worldwide, and in the USA because its is a one of the main markets for the cosmetics industry. Premium Beauty News - Could you provide us with a short description of the study’s contents? Leïla Rochet-Podvin -  The study features the following chapters: 1/ #Who is Gen Next - Their sociological portrait, 2/ #Brands & Luxury - Their relations with branded and luxury products, 3/ # Femininity & Beauty - Their relations with femininity and beauty, and, 4/ #Boards & Prospective - A prospective outlook on four visions of femininity and beauty in the future.  To discover the study, we propose a one hour and a half presentation at our client’s office, together with an optional creativity workshop."
MakeUp in Sao Paulo in six months! ,"Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Sao Paulo! Some would be tempted to add: At last! Sandra Maguarian - The concept had proven its worth in Paris, New York and Seoul. It had become absolutely necessary to organize MakeUp in SaoPaulo. Especially since players in the sector, were often asking us... ""So, when are you organizing something in Sao Paulo?"" Premium Beauty News - What has changed over the past two years, to enable you to eventually organize MakeUp in Sao Paulo? Sandra Maguarian - In the space of two years, many international manufacturers decided to set up a foothold in the country with this argument in mind: ""we need to settle here to help develop the market!"" With the ""MakeUp In...» concept, in a way, we support them in this ""market creation"" strategy. It was the right time. Premium Beauty News - More than 2.7 billion dollars! This is the most widely accepted figure for estimating the make-up market in Brazil. Quit enough to attract the attention of many companies.  Sandra Maguarian - Two hundred million inhabitants, among which slightly less than a half are women, Brazil is more than ever at the centre of the global development of the make-up sector. And it’s not just Brazil. The entire South American continent is concerned with this development, with in particular, countries like Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Argentina. Premium Beauty News - With still very specific distribution channels in Brazil? Sandra Maguarian - That’s right, today, the bulk of sales still relies on door to door sales, but other distribution channels are developing rapidly. There are about 7,000 chain stores and more than 53,000 independent. A network that several leading international brands have decided to invest systematically and successfully! There is also the power of communication represented by the internet. You should see the number of bloggers who express themselves, for example, on nail polish. Maybelline in Brazil now has over 300,000 fans on its Facebook pages. The potential is there. 85 million Brazilian women use make-up products every day and they are using them increasingly! They are much better informed and have rising incomes. But it is important to note that MakeUp in Sao Paulo will be the MakeUp trade show intended for the whole South American continent."
Ecommerce: Strong growth expected for FMCG by 2016,"According to Kantar Worldpanel,  ecommerce will account for USD53 billion of global FMCG sales by 2016 - an increase of USD 17 billion (47%) on the current USD 36 billion. [1] The report, which is based on an analysis of the purchasing habits of 100,000 shoppers in ten of the biggest online consumer packaged goods markets, forecasts that ecommerce will account for 5.2% of global FMCG sales by 2016 - up from 3.7% at present. The report predicts that Asia will be the next major growth market. South Korea will continue its lead position with online accounting for 13.8% of FMCG sales by 2016. “Today, 55% of Korean shoppers buy online, an exceptionally high figure that is not matched by any other country in the world. Online FMCG market share will continue to grow rapidly in Taiwan and China to achieve 4.5% and 3.3% share of the total FMCG market respectively,” Kantar explains. At present, the UK is the trailblazer of the European online FMCG market. British online shoppers buy on the internet once a month and their carts are five times bigger than offline (in most countries online shopping carts are twice as large as their offline equivalents). However, the impressive growth of the click and collect offer in France, referred to as “Drive”, will see France overtake the UK by 2016 with 6.1% vs. 5.5% of market share respectively. These forecasts present a prime opportunity for retailers and brands. Current online shoppers, typically middle and upper class, tend to favour branded products over own-label making it an ideal platform for brands. In France, 55% of online consumers re-use the same list for each trip making its essential for brands to secure a place on shopping lists if they are to benefit from this forecasted growth. “Although online only makes up a small share of FMCG sales at the moment, all countries are witnessing considerable growth. The future belongs to retailers and brands that see the bigger picture and leverage the opportunities provided to broaden their target markets. Being a slow adopter has the potential to significantly damage sales and erode market share,” highlights Stéphane Roger, Global Shopper and Retail Director at Kantar Worldpanel. In order to win market share in very different local retail environments, retailers and brands are deploying various strategies to impulse purchases, to make online retail more fun and the latest techniques in convenience shopping."
USA: Ultra-gentle skincare products on the rise,"U.S. consumers are highly interested in ultra-gentle skincare products and, consistently, the whole category is shifting toward more products positioned as gentle or appropriate for sensitive skin.  According to Mintel’s Global New Products Database (GNPD), sensitive skin claims represent 25% of total skincare claims thus far in 2014 [1], compared to 15% in 2009. Furthermore, 71% of facial skincare users say they are interested in ultra-gentle products. Sales trends also reflect this move towards gentle skincare products. Mintel estimates that sales of sensitive / gentle skincare products are more than USD 202 million (EUR 148 million), with the majority of sales coming from the facial cleanser and facial moisturizer segments. Sensitive and gentle skincare products are also capturing a greater percentage of facial cleanser and moisturizer sales. “While facial skincare products have typically highlighted the addition of ingredients such as vitamins and botanicals, the category appears to be moving toward highlighting what’s not in the formula - fragrance, dyes, etc.,” says Shannon Romanowski, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. “This move toward gentle skincare is a reflection of consumers’ desire for performance combined with increased concern and awareness regarding what is being put on their skin.” Consumers seem to be big fans of the pared down approach, as almost a quarter (24%) of facial skincare users say they look for products with natural, organic ingredients. 22% seek out products that are free from certain ingredients like parabens or fragrances and 21% are interested in items that are designed specifically for sensitive skin. “While future growth is expected to remain slow, there are opportunities for more customized and convenience-driven product options. Value-added products that enhance health and wellness, extend usage occasions, or tap into the convenience-driven mindset of male and multicultural shoppers stand to gain,” adds Shannon Romanowski. “In addition, a consumer shift toward gentle skincare benefits also reflects an opportunity, especially among women and Black consumers.”"
Rise in exports helps European cosmetics sales to remain stable,"Sales of the European personal care sector have decreased by -0.8% in 2013 compared to the previous year.  Total sales for the 28 member states of the European Union, plus Norway and Switzerland, reached EUR 72 billion in 2013. Sales in Spain and in Greece decreased by 3.6 per cent, and by -1.2 per cent in Italy.  In France, sales of personal care products declined by -0.4%.  On the other, the German market grew by +0.6 per cent. Germany (EUR 12.896 billion), France (EUR 10.542 billion) and Italy (EUR 9.936 billion) remains the main EU markets for cosmetics (retail sales prices). All the market categories declined within the EU in 2013, with fragrances recording the strongest fall (-2.3 per cent). Simultaneously, extra EU exports increased strongly to reach EUR 16 billion for 2013 [1].  In total, the European market represented almost one third of the global market. “2013 was a pivotal year for our association,” Cosmetics Europe Director-General Bertil Heerink said. “In a year of economic challenges, the European cosmetics and personal care industry remained economically stable.”  Considering the value of the Euro, the strong level of exports was a good surprise for European leaders.  “That made us convinced that the quality of European cosmetics is still very much in demand all over the world,” Mr Heerink told Premium Beauty News."
"Austerity is the watchword for affluent Americans, study says","The luxury market in 2014 might be more challenging that initially anticipated.  “My read of the outlook and attitude of affluent consumers says marketers should hope for the best, but plan for the worse,"" cautions Pam Danziger, president of Unity Marketing and author of a new report, The Luxury Report 2014. ""In particular, Unity Marketing foresees American affluents adopting a new attitude of austerity with a trend toward simplicity and making due with less, rather than aspiring for extravagance and indulgence.” Unity Marketing’s latest Luxury Report 2014 tracks affluent consumer spending and purchases of luxury and high-end goods and services since the recession in 2008 through 2013, based upon surveys conducted among more than 1,200 affluent consumers every three months.  The survey analysis shows that throughout 2010 and 2011 affluents went through a recovery period where so-called pent up demand boosted affluent spending on luxury.  However, since 2012 spending has been slowing as affluents’ consumer confidence has taken a downward turn. Despite the rising values of their houses and stock portfolios that measure wealth, affluents are choosing to conserve those gains, rather than spending extravagantly like they did in the run up to the recession and immediately afterwards.   For example, the average amount affluents spent on luxury goods and services in any three-month study period during 2013 was down 23.2 per cent from 2012 levels.  And the prospects for 2014 show affluents remain cautious about future spending on luxury, with nearly 80 percent of n=5,001 affluents surveyed in 2013 predicting they will spend the same or less on luxury during 2014. "" Austerity is the watchword  for affluents’ attitudes in the current market, which reflects a return to simplicity and a back-to-basics lifestyle.  Luxury marketers need to position their brands with respect for this new attitude.  They must demonstrate how their brands deliver a values-based return on investment,” added Danziger . While the developing countries have enjoyed the most attention from growth-hungry luxury brands, U.S. households remain the largest buyers of luxury goods and services in the world.  However, the wealthiest U.S. consumers are giving up conspicuous consumption and status symbols that proclaim one’s wealth to embrace brands that give them bragging rights to how smart a shopper he or she is.  “Marketers can no longer assume that affluent consumers are willing to spend up without a compelling reason and luxury marketers need to modify their positioning and branding to match the new normal luxury lifestyle.  The recent recession has reshaped the American economy in ways that will affect us for decades to come. Affluent consumers no longer feel like wearing a symbol of wealth, knowing that the American middle class has been severely weakened from the recession. Most affluents, both the HENRYs [1] (income $100-250K) and Ultra-affluents ($250K+), would rather throw their lot in with the 99 percent and avoid the conspicuous consumption that characterized luxury in previous years,” Danziger concludes."
"Makeup trends: Faster, simpler, prettier","It is essential in all makeup cases, and a flagship eye makeup product: mascara has shown to be recession proof, and is used every day by a great number of women. Whether they prefer a curl or longlash effect, the main thing they wish to do is intensify their look with mascaras that can draw people’s attention. For Luxcos, the trend is definitely towards seeking an immediate and fast effect, with greater simplicity and an easier application. “The first benefit consumers seek is volume, most of the time with an additional effect,” underlines Christophe Delas, Director of Luxcos. “All-in-one formulas are also increasingly popular: our best seller formula, Lash Attract, is part of this category.” Days are increasingly punctuated by professional, family and leisure activities, therefore people are constantly trying to gain time, and consumers want efficient and simple products. “ Mascaras with immediate effect  are thus extremely popular, that’s why we developed Plump My Lashes, a formula that instantaneously curves lashes. Our R&D laboratory is currently focusing on new formulas to apply more product even faster,” continues Christophe Delas. Consumers also like products that can be removed with hot water, which again has to do with gaining time and simplifying the makeup ritual. The mascara colour also plays a significant role. According to Luxcos, consumers want blacker and blacker products enriched in pigments for an even deeper look. Objective: maximum seduction in less time. So the Luxembourg company now holds a patent for the use of an ingredient able to intensify the colour of its mascaras: the “black maker”. Naturalness seems to be to the fore this summer, with mascaras in line with the natural colour of eyelashes: brown and amber are back, as well as mascaras for lashes and hair. At MakeUp in Paris, Luxcos will thus showcase fluid, gliding textures for supple lashes, or various finishes (wet, matte, vinyl) in line with this need for discreet sublimation. Eyeliners have not been left behind, with the ever fashionable black ones adorning themselves with vinyl reflections, or ultra-bright colours for an unforgettable style. At MakeUp in Paris, Luxcos will reveal the Bahia collection, formulated with rich shades of intense blue or pearly green pigments. As for lips, Luxcos considers consumers mainly aim at differentiating themselves with innovative textures that are pleasant to wear and last long. “As for lipgloss, we are done with sticky formulas: the trend is now towards comfortable and creamy textures. Liquid lipsticks, long-lasting lip lacquers and glosses such as our Everlasting, which can be worn for eight hours, have not been left behind, nor have double effect hybrid formulas,” underlines Aurélie Ignaccolo, Marketing Manager at Luxcos. Lip inks make a good compromise between lip colouring, a light texture and long wear, and are also very trendy. “They offer an alternative solution to classic red lipsticks, and maximum comfort,” concludes Aurélie Ignaccolo."
Top perfume brands are multiplying collections,"The first exclusive “collection” proposed by a famous brand was discreetly launched by Prada in 2003, and it did not make the headlines. However Dior, with Colognes, Armani Privé, or Hermès, with Hermessences, quickly followed, and so did Guerlain, Estée Lauder - up until the latest one - and L’Atelier Givenchy, with a collection that now counts seven “haute perfumery” fragrances as a tribute to haute couture. There are now almost 25 collections available for only 14 brands, including 7 for Guerlain, 4 for Tom Ford and 3 for Armani, which makes it 169 perfumes to this day. However, the variety of references does not prevent the creation of a common world in which rare and precious scent lovers recognize themselves: an identifiable olfactory world, a discreet marketing campaign, premium ingredients, minimalist packaging with dominant shades of white, black and gold… The olfactory world of these collections is dominated by flowery (40 %) and woody scents (24 %), but there are also many oriental (21 %), hesperidia and Chypre fragrances (5 %). By definition, and out of a desire for more variety, they cover all nasal fields, except maybe for marine scents. Isabelle Ferrand stresses the favourite raw material in collections is iris, which can be found in numerous compositions. As for olfactory trends, it is the Oud that is the most frequent: it is inherent to all collections, except the collection by Chanel. Leather, incense, patchouli, rose and jasmine have also greatly inspired composers. Makeup ranges, skincare creams, candles, new perfume substrates… The collection offer is getting more diversified now, and brands are opening more and more wholly owned stores with VIP services. This is the birth of a new luxury dimension in which the great names of perfumery manage to maintain their positions."
MakeUp in Paris will held its fifth edition next week,"In five years, MakeUp in Paris has managed to carve a name for itself. While there were 31 exhibitors in 2010, for the first edition, the 2014 event will gather 111 companies, out of which 22 never missed a single edition. The main reason for this success, according to the organizers, is that “an entire industry, from ingredients to formulas, including packaging and accessories, had a strong desire for it to happen.”  Today, MakeUp in Paris has grown as the unavoidable annual event for the makeup industry and the organisers are determined to celebrate this fifth year! On this occasion, the Polo Cosmesi, the Italian association gathering the main Italian players in the make-up industry, will invite visitors to taste regional culinary specialities at their bar located in the Delorme hall. To note that the Kusmi Tea brand whose teas, through the delicacy and subtlety of their flavours have been a delight to gourmets since 1867, will also have its dedicated bar set up in the Lenôtre hall, inviting visitors to discover the many possible variations around tea. Not to mention the Vitacoco water, an ultra-moisturizing coconut water that will be offered for tasting at the bar located in the Gabriel hall. Also, Strand Cosmetics Europe will be celebrating 50 years of innovation and creativity, in particular through a participation in the private tour of the Louvre Museum, and Oekabeauty will be recalling, among other things, its hundred years of activity on a dedicated panel in front of the conference area. About 12 conferences on topics as diverse as intellectual property, microbial protection, the power and influence of blogs, the make-up codes in Japan, Korea and France, or, intuition as an aid to decision-making and a driver for innovation. For instance, a conference hosted by Marielle Belin and Jean-Louis Prata will be devoted to ""Neuroscience and Innovation"" or ""How to innovate and keep clients passionate on the long term?"" (Thursday June 12th, 11:30 am - 12:15 pm). Facing highly individualized consumers, how can R&D and Marketing teams take advantage of this new deal? To offer its participants a comprehensive overview of the make-up industry, MakeUp in Paris will be opening for the second year in a row its “ingredients” area, MakeUPigments, a pole of presentation and animation exclusively dedicated to make-up ingredients suppliers. As per last year, exhibitors and visitors will be invited to an educational and sensory discovery of make-up colours. Eventually, the organisers of MakeUp in Paris are expecting about 3,000 visitors, which would be a new record!"
Marionnaud extands its Click and Collect service throughout France,"After having launched digital applications, in particular in its Champs-Elysées flagship store in Paris, in store delivery is a new step forward for Marionnaud, which wants to become an omni-channel retailer. ""Consumers are changing their shopping habits and Marionnaud is taking care of them in this move,"" the retailer underlines. The main lines of the new service are quite simple: the consumer orders her (or his) products on Marionnaud’s online shop, then chooses the store where to get the products delivered. When the products are delivered, the consumer receives an email and can pick them up. All the 8,000 references of the online shop can be delivered through the click and collect service, which “entirely free.” Once in the shop, the customer does not leave with a postal parcel but with a Marionnaud bag, just as after a shopping session.  ""We opted for a personalized approach to Click & Collect,"" says Carole Barkatz, e-commerce manager at Marionnaud.  The shop assistants that hand over the order can thus provide all the information the clients may need about additional products. According to Marionnaud, within a few weeks, the new free service was a resounding success with Click & Collect representing more than 20% of all online orders in March. Marionnaud sees this service as a customer loyalty tool but also as a way to recruit new clients and as a good opportunity to enhance traffic in many of its outlets."
World luxury market to enter a maturity phase,"The reports presented last week in Milan by the Altagamma Foundation and consultancy firm Bain & Company confirmed the world luxury market has reached a maturity and stabilisation phase with moderate growth expected this year, around the same level as in 2013. Healthy growth trend “We are entering a new phase for the sector, one I would define as a new normal,” said Claudia D’Arpizio, Director of Bain & Company’s Milan Office.  “The absence of explosive phenomena in the short term, as China has been in recent years, and at the same time the greater capacity to react to the crisis in the mature markets is resulting in a more stable and healthy growth trend, of between 4% and 6% at constant exchange rates in the next few years"", she adds. The growth rate was +6.5% at constant exchange rates in 2013 (+2% at current exchange rates) and +5% at constant rates in 2012 (+10% at current exchange rates). Altagamma forecasts a constant growth rate of around 6% for 2014, similar to that of last year. US and Asia drive growth As for the geographical markets, the US is once again the engine for growth while Europe is bolstered above all by tourist consumption, even if the consumption of the Russians has fallen on the domestic market and in the main European capital cities. Chinese consumers are increasingly important on both the domestic and overseas market (from Japan and Korea to Australia, South East Asia, the US and Canada) while the Japanese are finally spending again on the local market. Japan has demonstrated consistent real growth but with a negative exchange rate effect. Continental China is lacking in dynamism, Hong Kong and Macau are doing fine, South Korea is still not very dynamic, while South East Asia, and Indonesia in particular, is enjoying strong growth. “We expect a growth rate of +9% in Japan, +8% in the Middle East, +7% in Asia, +6% in the Americas and +4% in Europe, while for the Rest of the World we forecast growth of +7%,” comments Armando Branchini, Vice Chairman of Altagamma. The luxury market is increasingly guided by “consumer flows and segments of consumers influenced by tourism, by the behaviour of various nationalities, and by fluctuations in exchange rates which alter consumption patterns,” Altagamma concludes."
China Beauty Expo: main trends of the 2014 edition,"CBE features three major exhibition areas: Cosmetics China, dedicated to cosmetics, skin care products and perfumes, Cosmetech Shanghai, dedicated to equipment, packaging and ingredients, and Beauty Shanghai, dedicated to professionnal brands sold in beauty salons, spas and outlets specializing in nail and hair products. CBE is a unique opportunity to learn about new beauty trends in China. This year’s edition was marked by the emergence of several very ambitious Chinese brands, most often created by Chinese suppliers and subcontractors who have upgraded their expertise in product design and market knowledge by working for major Asian and global brands. This new generation of Chinese cosmetic brands are learning from the example of Herborist, the premium brand of Jahwa Group, the largest cosmetics company in China. Their strategy consists in promoting their products trough celebrities, investing and building up on the “made in China” and even “made better in China” claims. Eventually, we have seen about fifty emerging Chinese brands at the show. Besides Chinese brands many other Asian players participated in the show. Korean brands are the most aggressive in terms of packaging, branding and price positioning, while Japanese brands rely on sober, refined and elegant designs and claim their knowledge of the needs and expectations of Asian women. Compared to Asian companies, relatively few European brands made it to Shanghai to challenge the Chinese market. Regulatory and administrative barriers, as well as market access costs may have discouraged them. In order to facilitate the entry of new comers, Informa, the organizer of CBE imported the Zoom concept, which has been developed on the Beyond Beauty Paris show since 2003. Organised for the first time within the expo, Zoom Asia was dedicated to innovative fragrance and beauty brands from western countries whishing to tap into the Asian markets. They met with key Asian retail buyers and wholesalers in a dedicated space. ”We had approximately 100 potential agents and distributors for China who came to our booth during the three days of the show as well as lots of interest from direct buyers and from the local media. We would certainly recommend it as a great showcase for international companies looking to gain a foothold on the China market,” said Rocky Mammone, CEO of Majic Beauty. China Beauty Expo: Key figures 2014 – 252,200 visitors from 80 countries and regions – 6,433 booths up to international standards (+12.5% from 2013) 
– 1,837 companies (+10.9% from 2013) – 127,000 sqm of exhibition area, in 11 halls – Media coverage by over 80 local and international TV channels, magazines, newspapers, major websites and opinion-makers blogs – Increased presence of country pavilions exhibition area (France +53%, Germany +36% from 2013), several countries represented (Italy, Spain, Singapore, Thailand, Korea…)"
Makeup: What are the main growth leverages for prestige brands?,"“Our findings show that the same strategy cannot be applied equally to mature (mainly Europe), emerging (Asia) or specific markets (USA),” says Philippe Jourdan, University Professor and founding partner of Promise Consulting. The company focused on makeup brands sold in selective retail channels, defined as including brand owned retail networks (Kiko, Body Shop, Yves Rocher, etc.), department stores, beauty chains (Sephora, Marionnaud, Douglas, etc.) and Duty Free stores. A quick ranking of brands according to their  “overall business performance” - a composite indicator that takes into account penetration, market share and brand loyalty - shows a strong heterogeneity depending on the country where the products are sold. The performance seems to depend on the brand’s DNA: brands deriving from the fashion industry are predominant in Europe, while in Asia, those deriving from cosmetic brands and (or) from local brands prevail. In the United States two types of players are vying for market: brands deriving from the skin care world (Clinic, Estée Lauder) and those that can be described as “makeup pure player” (MAC) and, more generally, the makeup artists brands. In France and in Korea brands deriving from the haute couture world record a stronger notoriety in makeup than other brands, in particular because of the privileged position occupied by Dior in France and by Chanel in Korea. However, in the United States makeup artist brands (MAC, Bobbi Brown, Nars or Laura Mercier) are resisting to haute couture brands. As far as image is concerned, brands derived from the haute couture world - because of the prestige and quality associated with their name - sill enjoy a certain advantage over other brands, both in France, in the United States and in Korea. However, the haute couture origin does not guarantee a bigger market share in the make-up market in the United States due to the historical presence of Clinique, the leading beauty and makeup brand. Researches conducted by Promise Consulting also showed a strong correlation between makeup brands’ ability to attract (their image) and their market share, notably in France and in the United States. In France, makeup brands that have their origin in the fashion industry make the best use of their image in terms of sales. In the United States, the two performance indicators - image and sales - are at their highest level with makeup artist brands (MAC) and with brands derived from the world of skin-care (Clinic). Makeup artists are probably taking advantage of their partnerships with haute couture designers (Peter Philips in backstage of the Chanel fashion show, Pat McGrath with Dior, etc.). As of skin care brands, they have been innovative in bringing the two worlds of care and complexion (CC Cream). For selective makeup brands, as for perfume or skincare brands, image thus appears as the aggregation of product characteristics (quality) and statutory (""brand used by celebrities"", ""used by makeup artists”) and symbolic (""an iconic brand"") criteria, regardless of the country."
"“The Japanese cosmetics market is increasingly attractive,” Hajime Suzuki, Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo","Premium Beauty News - The dates of Cosme Tokyo and Cosme Tech were changed from Summer to Autumn in order to get more exhibition space available. What are your goals regarding the number of exhibitors and visitors? Hajime Suzuki - Our aim is to gather a total of 600 exhibitors at the next co-held editions of Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo, which represents an increase of 60 per cent compared the previous shows in 2013, which gathered 368 exhibitors.  With more than five months left before the show, about 80% of the exhibition space is already sold and we expect it to be fully booked before the show starts. We expect about 15% of the exhibitors to come from overseas, but the proportion could reach 30% for Cosme Tokyo, the event dedicated to finished products.  So far, registered exhibitors come from 26 countries or regions [1]. As for visitors, our aim is to host 30,000 people, which represents a 50% rise compared to the previous year.  It is an ambitious goal, but we have been achieving such tremendous growth ever since the launch of Cosme Tech. More international visitors are expected to participate in the event, especially from other Asian countries where made-in-Japan cosmetics are very popular. Premium Beauty News - What will be the main events and innovations of the 2014 edition of the shows? Hajime Suzuki - Within Cosme Tokyo 2014, we are launching an International Area that will become one of the main features of the event. Overseas exhibitors will showcase their products, besides made-in-Japan cosmetics. As per last year, Korea and Thailand will be represented in national Pavilions, but on a larger surface. This year, Belgium and Switzerland will also have national Pavilions and some more are still expected to join. In addition, there is a special pavilion for overseas companies who do not have importers in Japan, which is called “New Comers to the Japanese Market” Pavilion.  As the Japanese market is strongly rebounding and import cosmetics are becoming increasingly popular, more and more international companies want to test their products at the show. We help companies participating in this area by conducting special promotional actions targeting importers and distributors in Japan. Regarding Cosme Tech 2014, we are launching a new “World Ingredients Pavilion” dedicated to overseas companies that do not have a Japanese office yet. This area will gather new comers to the Japanese market, in particular start-up or smaller companies. We aim to encourage a wider range of overseas ingredients suppliers to challenge the Japanese market. Interests for new and advanced ingredients are increasing among Japanese consumers, especially in growing categories such as anti-aging and natural/organic. Thus, cosmetics manufacturers are eager to find new ingredients. The Japanese market is increasingly attractive. Premium Beauty News - What about organic and natural cosmetics? Hajime Suzuki - Actually, organic products are one of the fastest-growing categories at Cosme Tokyo 2014. There is a dedicated “Organic Zone” but organic cosmetics/toiletries are exhibited in almost every zones. Overseas products are dominant in this category, which is one of the reasons international exhibitors are increasing rapidly, especially from European countries and Australia, but also from the Middle East, Africa and Asian countries. The trend is also prominent in Cosme Tech: many ingredients and OEM suppliers will showcase innovative natural and organic ingredients or formulations. Premium Beauty News - The Cosme Tech show is dedicated to suppliers. How is this part of the event evolving? Hajime Suzuki - Cosme Tech 2014 is expected to account for about 60% of the total of exhibitors. It is almost fully booked already and we are trying to prepare some additional space by re-adjusting the layout. Cosme Tech has already become one of the largest exhibitions in Asia for cosmetics OEM and packaging suppliers, and it is still growing. Regarding the Container/Packaging Zone, 8 of the top 10 manufacturers of cosmetic containers in Japan have already decided to exhibit. Regarding the OEM/ODM Zone, more than 100 exhibitors are expected to present their services, including Japan’s top player Nihon Kolmar and Italian company B. Kolor Makeup & Skincare. Premium Beauty News - How is the Japanese market evolving for personal care products? Hajime Suzuki - Japan is one of the world’s largest cosmetics market and the world’s largest market for skincare. The Japanese economy is strongly rebounding and consumer spending is going up, especially for luxurious items including high-end cosmetics. The economic context explains why more and more European brands are exhibiting at Cosme Tokyo. Most of them have strong assets in categories that are growing in Japan, such as premium, organic and anti-aging cosmetics. The demand for premium ingredients and services from Europe is also increasing in Japan and could boost Cosme Tech. Quality is very important for Japanese consumers and European products have a very good image. I’m convinced more European companies will join us to challenge Japan’s attractive market."
What will be the face of the organic cosmetics market in 2025?,"After several years of double-digit growth between 2007 and 2011, organic food and cosmetic markets are now experiencing a slowdown. The prospective study, commissioned by Organics Cluster - an association gathering the different operators of the organic sector in Frances’ Rhône-Alpes region - and Cosmebio, aimed at helping industry players to better understand what are the propellers of these markets and to anticipate possible developments. The first scenario proposed in the survey (""Emerging Organics"") outlines an organic cosmetics market quite similar in 2025 to what it is now and still struggling to organize itself. According to this scenario, the increasing number of private initiatives, the complexity of brands’ claims, the confusing profusion of labels and the lack of mass marketing, will limit the development of the segment and small and micro organic businesses will face stiff competition from large marketers of conventional cosmetics. In this context, according to the authors of the study, the winning strategy is to provide consumers with more transparency and traceability. On the contrary, the second scenario (""Central organics"")  outlines the importance of the organic cosmetics markets betting that organic products will become a true safe haven amid repeated health and environmental crises. Widely recognized and supported by national and European authorities, the operators will successfully unite and organize themselves through virtuous contracting methods, driven by citizens willing to pay for good health. Social and environmental responsibility (CSR), as well as ethical approaches - in particular in the supply chain - will then become a factor of success. The third scenario (“liberal organics”) draws the lines of a liberal and financially driven organic cosmetics market.  Within a difficult economic environment, companies would join forces in order to become more competitive. Major cosmetics groups, increasingly involved in CSR, would massively buy small and micro businesses in the organic sector. Marketers would communicate on ""natural"" cosmetics and insist on the availability of their low priced products in nearby supermarkets. In this case, the winning strategy is to provide a more accessible and innovative organic cosmetics. The fourth scenario outlines a ""suspect organic industry"" with diluted principles and no real specificity. The assumption is that more stringent regulations will force conventional cosmetics to a greater respect for the environment. In parallel, scandals impacting organic cosmetics may also weaken the sector. Consumers would divert to other values, such as local purchase for example. In this context, the winning strategy is to maintain a close and trustful relationship with the consumer. While it is difficult to deem which one of the four scenarios is most likely to occur, each of them helps to discern what are the key issues and the main market drivers of organic cosmetics market and to better understand its current difficulties."
Exports drive the growth of the Italian cosmetics industry,"The recession of the Italian personal care market continued in 2013 to EUR 9,500 million, a decline of 1.2% compared to 2012, according to recently released figures from Cosmetica Italia. According to the trade association, this recession, which remains modest compared to the crisis the country has been facing since 2007-2008, confirms the counter-cyclical nature of the sector. However, some channels are particularly sensitive to the economic context and suffer more than others. This is particularly the case of professional circuits: sales in hair salons have plummeted by -8.4% and sales in beauty parlours declined by -5.5%. In this context, only the direct sales channel (doorstep sales or mail order sales) pulls out of the game, with an increase of 4.4%. Sales also rose in pharmacies (+0.3%). In this context, the turnover of Italian companies rose by +2.6% to reach 9.3 billion euros in 2013, mainly boosted by sales in foreign markets, which reached 3.2 billion euros in 2013, increasing by +11%. On the contrary, imports increased by only +0.8%. “Continuous investment policies in innovation and development have enabled Italian companies to gain competitive advantage in international markets, where there is a significant increase in sales, including in volume, indicating a competitive and reliable offer,"" says Cosmetica Italia. As far as cosmetics are concerned, France remains the largest customer and the leading provider of Italy, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain and Russia."
What do beauty bloggers expect...,"Capucine Piot (Babillages), Sophie Strobel ((dé)maquillages), and Alexis Toublanc (Dr. Jicky & Mister Phoebus), were gathered on April 18 for a breakfast with the communication, media relation and community managers of beauty brands. Organised under the auspices of the FEBEA, the meeting was conceived as an opportunity for the three bloggers to share their experience and expectations about the way beauty companies communicate with them. A blog primarily reflects its author’s personality, tastes and interests. The FEBEA’s three guests were the perfect illustration. On the Babillages blog - created seven years ago - Capucine Piot deals about beauty issues with a very personal point of view. ""I am very much of a girl next door,"" explains Capucine. She carefully makes the pictures illustrating her posts and regularly uploads beauty tutorials on her YouTube video channel. With over 10,000 visits per day, Babillages is one of the most influential French-speaking beauty blogs. Capucine Piot thus successfully monetized her blog, in particular thanks to partnerships with beauty brands. A trained biologist and cosmetologist, Sophie Strobel enjoys about fifteen years of experience in the beauty industry.  Her approach of beauty issues consists in deciphering them. She does not monetize her blog, which is much more ""a hobby, that adds up to an already busy work and family life."" Since 2010, Alexis Toublanc is one of the two authors of the Dr. Jicky & Mister Phoebus blog, fully dedicated to perfume. A very different world, considering its speech than beauty blogs: smaller readership, many exchanges with peers, slower publication pace, ""because it takes time to know a perfume and be able to write about it."" Customize relationships While Alexis Toublanc does not feel overwhelmed by the demands of brands - ""regular but not excessive"" - he nevertheless appreciates personalized relationship with brands.  Actually, he sees this as a key factor of success: ""It is obvious that a blogger enthusiastic with classic, traditional or historical fragrances will feel hardly pleased by an avant-garde scent,"" he says.  This is also a key issue for Capucine Piot and Sophie Strobel, even if their experience differs from Alexis’ one since they have to face countless requests from beauty brands, and may have difficulties - despite their efforts - to reply quickly to all of them. In such conditions, poorly targeted or inappropriate requests have many chances to be merely ignored.  ""When I’m called ’Babillages’ rather than by my first name, or when I’m sent shampoos for blonde hair, chances to emerge at the top of my priorities are obviously declining,"" said Capucine. ""Personal and friendly contacts are important things. And customization is the key to success. Some brands took the time to make a fact sheet on the needs of each of the bloggers they are working with. They know that I have dry skin and hair, and that it is useless to send me products for oily skin,"" she adds . ""We are also very active on social networks, it is important source of information for brands eager to better know the bloggers,"" says Sophie Strobel. An attitude that has nothing in common with ""the whims of spoiled little girls,"" points Capucine Piot. Simply, bloggers are not journalists and the most common error among beauty brands seems to treat them in the same way.  ""We do not have the same needs or the same expectations,"" insists Sophie Strobel. Bloggers are primarily consumers. For sure, they are expert, informed and skilled consumers, but they just test products, speak about products and give their opinion with their own sensibility as a consumer would.  ""While excessively scientific or technical contents generally bore them, as they bore their readers, they are nevertheless keen to identify superficial speeches,"" warns Sophie Strobel . Furthermore, most bloggers have another activity besides their blog and are not as available as journalists may be. Brands that target them must take that into consideration when organising events if they want to have a chance to see them. Of course things get a little more complicated when considering that some journalists are also bloggers. However, for Sophie Strobel that just demonstrates that ""they are two very different activities that can be complementary."""
Brazil: The cosmetics market boosted by hair care,"According to Euromonitor, despite the context of an economic slowdown, Brazil is now the third largest market on the global scale, all segments included, behind the United States and China. As the world’s largest market in the perfume and deodorant categories, Brazil’s growth is also boosted by hair care and the extremely dynamic conditioner segment in particular. According to Mintel, it represented 9 % of all hair care launches last year in the world, ahead of the United Kingdom (8 %) and the United States (7 %). According to the same source, this market is expected to achieve a two-digit annual growth over the next four years to reach US$12.45 billion in 2017. In 2013, shampoos and conditioners represented a market estimated at US$2.92 billion. The usage rate of shampoos in Brazil is amongst the highest in the world, as 91 % of Brazilians declare themselves as users: that is as much as in France (91 %), and more than in England (89 %). Christopher Lindlsey, the Global Skin Care analyst at Mintel, explains this partly results from a number of new product developments that was hardly ever seen anywhere else in the world, with an offer that is perfectly adapted to local diversities and specific regional claims. “Developing anti-aging claims could add value to the market in the future”, he adds. According to Euromonitor, Brazil is still dominated by the mass-market, though it is gradually turning towards the premium segment, particularly with the rise of perfume and skincare product sales. Lastly, direct sales are starting to lose ground to brands sold in stores, as can be seen with L’Occitane’s success, one of the fastest growths among international brands in Brazil."
Men’s cosmetics boom in BRIC countries,"What’s behind the global boom? Catherine O’Connor - Consumers in BRIC markets are experiencing increasing demand for men’s grooming and cosmetic products due to pressure to look good in the workplace and their personal lives. Needs vary by country, with men in China and India being more receptive to cosmetic products. How does the market look in India? Catherine O’Connor -  The use of make-up by males in India is startlingly high, with men consuming 46% of make-up by volume. This is driven by both cultural and religious phenomena; for instance, kohl is a common eye make-up applied by men on special occasions. Is the situation similar in China? Catherine O’Connor - Chinese men are similarly large users of make-up, accounting for 38% of consumption. Over a quarter of this consumption is motivated by a desire to meet the needs of their lifestage, with working men feeling a heightened pressure to look fresh and professional. Demand is high for products that minimize signs of tiredness, such as concealers and eye highlighters. What are Brazilian men buying? Catherine O’Connor - Brazil’s image-conscious culture is increasingly posing high beauty demands on men as well as women. Men account for 45% of the skincare market in Brazil, with demand for facial care and depilatories on the rise. This consumption is driven by a desire for products that offer beauty benefits to meet the needs of mens’ age, with anti-agers and revitalizing skin creams  proving popular. Is Russia the same as the rest of the BRICs? Catherine O’Connor -  In Russia, use of make-up among men is far lower, accounting for only 12% of the market by volume. This reflects a greater social prevalence of traditional notions of rugged masculinity, with the majority of Russian men viewing cosmetics as feminine products. Successful male grooming products in Russia will be marketed around their potency and convenience, as can be seen in the popularity of wipes and products with long-lasting claims. What are the global trends? Catherine O’Connor - Beauty trends that originated in Asia are now increasingly popular in Western markets, as can be seen in the recent launches of male BB creams from major manufacturers. The most successful products will, however, be marketed around function rather than beauty, with Western men more abashed about seeking beauty goals than their Chinese and Indian counterparts."
Clarins make-up wears Brazilian colours for summer 2014,"“Beyond the fact that the entire world will have their eyes riveted on this country this summer, choosing Brazil as a source of inspiration and creation made several reasons coincide, starting with the significant role of make-up in this country,” underlines Suzy Lebert. Cobalt blue echoes the typical vibrant colours of this country, and gives the pitch to the eye palette with bright coral and amber shades. Vibrant Black and Blue are also available in the Truly Waterproof range of 12-hour continuous hold mascaras. “In Brazil, everything is important in make-up, your look, mouth and complexion. We thus worked with this goal in mind, while remaining truthful to our will to sublimate women naturally, and not to transform them”. Lips can wear the Lip Balm Crayon, available as a limited edition in five colours, and which both provides a coloured transparent effect and hydrating care. The skin is lit up with a compact powder with lucky charm prints of Brazilian bracelets, and the iridescent oil nourishes and brightens without any excess. “But the more profound reasons that guided us towards choosing Brazil are elsewhere. As a plant expert brand seeking to preserve life and populations, Clarins’ DNA is naturally associated to this country. We source several of our ingredients in this region, and in 2013 we committed to responsible beauty practices by taking part in a programme aiming to protect a native community in Amazonia. The price of each The Essential palette was paid back to this community, as make-up is deeply rooted in their culture. Again, wearing make-up is part of Brazilian codes at all levels of the population,” concludes Suzy Lebert."
New challenges for marine cosmetics,"If the sea air strongly enhances the development of marine cosmetics, in particular through extensive research and the formulation of new, ultra-powerful actives, the breeze may well intensify, and winds may become even more favourable. Indeed, new markets are opening downstream, and there is a reorganisation in distribution channels. While Asia as a whole - and not only Japan - is culturally favourable to the beneficial effects of seaweed and other natural planktons, many other countries are getting increasingly interested in the sea’s benefits, including when they are available in the form of skincare creams. The claim of naturalness remains key to enter the market, in particular in Brazil and China, whereas people in Russia are more sensitive to fast efficacy promises. As for French brands, it is both the origins of the Label France and the historical expertise in thalassotherapy that make a difference. Thalgo’s growth mostly comes from exports. The brand is now present in 90 countries thanks to the development of their spas and day-spas. Similarly, Phytomer has achieved a two-digit growth over the past two years, with 75 % of their turnover resulting from exports, and a presence in 80 countries. The professional channel of beauty salons and thalassotherapy centres in France remains the main path to reach women consumers. “There is this idea that consumers are actually discovering the benefits of marine cosmetics, because these are not necessarily a first choice,” sums up Stéphanie Leclere, of the Bio Carnac brand. Nevertheless, distribution channels could get more diversified and gradually include selective counters, which are still poorly supplied in this type of products. “Marine cosmetics could be a growth-driver much beyond the professional channel, and it would definitely have its own place in selective ones because it has a truly different offer,” explain managers at Daniel Jouvance. The brand has been suffering from the decline of distance selling, its original channel, and is thinking about entering the retail business. They have had the same idea at Algotherm. “Although the relationship with consumers is closer in beauty salons, we are gradually opening up to pharmacy and healthcare networks,” highlights Angélique Labbé, Product Development Manager for Algotherm. The sector of marine cosmetics should be able to both rely on and give more value to its own differences. If it benefits from a favourable image, it does remain quite unknown to the public. “Deep abysses, skin dehydration… the sea both scares and attracts people. It’s up to us to explain and reassure them, as well as to come up with the right, convincing and differentiating arguments”, affirms Laure Courpotin, Marketing Director at Daniel Jouvance. “It’s up to us to make our microalgae more ‘glamorous’.” And this is exactly what the Breton brand is working on: at their customers’ request, they are now trying to add shapes and colours to these micro-elements in communication documents. Reluctance also comes from the quality of seawaters, and therefore of the ingredients derived from the ocean. This new concern results from the massive discharge of all kinds of pollutants all around the world. Manufacturers have been multiplying promises of meticulous sourcing to guarantee raw materials were taken or grown in the purest waters. At Thalgo, a brand that has otherwise undertaken to adopt environmentally friendly practices, actives are sourced according to the results of a scanning operation carried out to spot the most relevant areas, and are thus selected for their quality. Bio Carnac and Algotherm draw their own materials from the Iroise Sea, a world reserve of biosphere labelled by UNESCO, where the concentration in ions and minerals is quite high thanks to strong currents. Similarly to Daniel Jouvance, Phytomer has been working on the culture of marine microorganisms. “We manage to make microorganisms work in such a way that they can reproduce their active molecules in laboratory conditions, and all this is done using green methods,” explains Mathilde Lagarde, of Phytomer. Apart from the quality of raw materials, the sector of marine cosmetics also makes more and more commitments in relation to environmental protection. Algotherm’s newest solar range Algosun is the latest example of this trend: it protects the skin while preserving the ocean’s ecosystems. According to brand managers, 25,000 tons of sun creams are spread across the oceans every year, which threatens coral reefs and marine species. Therefore Algotherm has developed a partnership with French magazine Thalassa to raise public awareness of the toxicity of sun products. They also offer a unique, “Ocean Respect”-labelled line which they guarantee is harmless for the marine environment. Formulation, distribution, communication… the beauty of the sea is definitely sending promising signals."
High tide for marine cosmetics,"An increasing number of brands now pre-empt this territory, and their origins tend to get more diversified. Similarly to the leading French pioneer brands, most of which come from thalassotherapy (Thalgo, Algotherm, Biotherm, Phytomer…), other signatures are gradually settling in the various segments of the field: among them can be found Algenist, Bio Carnac, O2Mer, or H20+. Even the most premium segments are concerned, as can be seen with Crème de La Mer (Estée Lauder Companies). “It is a growth-driving trend because it provides a huge potential to be exploited,” declares Laure Courpotin, Marketing Director at Daniel Jouvance, one of the pioneer brands of the sector, which banked everything on the power of microalgae 30 years ago. Mathilde Lagarde, Marketing Director at Phytomer, underlines the revival this sector has been experiencing for four or five years: “Marine cosmetics have existed for a very long time, but they were a bit outdated. Now, scientific progress, especially in biotechnologies, has proven so tremendous over the last few years, that we have come to achieve more efficacy thanks to new actives and enhanced performance. We have observed a renewed interest in this field, and both the media and sales outlets are allowing it an increasingly central part.” Brands rely on the fundamental principle of the similarity between blood plasma and the composition of marine ingredients (seawater, seaweed, microalgae) to claim that cosmetic products based on marine actives exhibit unequalled affinity with the skin. This represents a major asset to stimulate research work on such biodiversity, whose properties and immensity make it exceptional. “Marine organisms are subjected to extreme living conditions which compel them to develop unique resistance properties,” explains Isabelle Guichon, Scientific Communication Manager at Thalgo. “It is possible to find sugars derived from particular marine bacteria which are three to four times more effective than hyaluronic acid”. And there is a vast territory still to be explored. “There are bright prospects in terms of discoveries, if we keep in mind there are from 25 to 30,000 seaweed species around the surface of the globe. Brittany shelters 800 of them, but only about fifty are actually used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food-processing industries,” comments Angélique Labbé, Product Development Manager for Algotherm within the Batteur group. As a result, while the marine cosmetics sector keeps claiming its naturalness, it is also becoming increasingly more high-tech. “We gradually offer a stronger technical value with more and more high-level benefits,” confirm Stéphanie Leclere and Virginie Rio, of new organic brand Bio Carnac. On the one hand, there is the argument of proven efficacy; on the other hand, there is that of naturalness. Marine beauty thus works in perfect harmony with the market’s core trends. The offer gets richer, and ranges get more diverse and position themselves on anti-aging expertise in particular. As an example, Crème de la Mer launched their Perennial Brown and Blue Algae-based Lifting Contour Serum (€265) at the beginning of the year. Algotherm also provides their own global anti-aging solution with the Algotime Expert range, a line composed of five products derived from a combination of four types of seaweed (Undaria Pinnatifida, Ulva Lactuca, Dictyopteris Membranacea, Alaria Esculenta). Ultimately, Daniel Jouvance offers a sea treasure with the Isochrysis microalgae, which they nestled within the Océâge Idéal products for a youthful appearance."
Cosmopack and Cosmoprof open their doors this week in Bologna,"“Rather than a ‘fair’, we prefer to talk about a “showcase” of trends, innovation and research, which are the cornerstones of the event, » explains Dino Tavazzi, CEO of SoGeCos Spa, the subsidiary of Bologna Fiere organising the event.  “We are investing a great deal in order to have an increasingly qualified audience of visitors in Bologna,” he adds.  For instance, road shows have been organized with the aim to promote the event abroad, specifically in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, United Arab Emirates, Japan, Peru and Singapore. For this edition, the organisers have working on setting up several international buyer delegations, in order to ensure an influx of buyers from India, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, the USA, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Iraq, Russia, South Africa and all of Europe. Thus, a total of 300 buyers have been invited to the event to attend pre-arranged meetings with more than 540 international exhibitors, with a total of over 1,700 planned meetings. The programme embraces all the sectors represented at the event. The organisers are also continuing their huge investments in Cosmopack, the event’s section dedicated to the suppliers of the cosmetic industry.  After having completely revamped the exhibition area dedicated to this section last year, they decided to move again its opening date.  Cosmopack will therefore open on April 2nd, two days before the rest of the event, “to help international visitors make the most of their visit and allow exhibitors to enjoy increased visibility.” Major events and installations are also on the agenda for 2014. Following the success of “The Lipstick Factory”, the special initiative which brought together the whole lipstick production chain at the last edition, 2014 will see the creation of a new installation: “The Powder Factory”. Visitors will be invited to a journey into the development and production of makeup powders, from manufacturing through to packaging. And the powder compacts produced during the event will be “carbon-neutral”, claim the organizers. Cosmopack will also offer riche programme of conferences in the Trend Forum area, including presentations on colour trends by Beautystream (April 3rd, 12.30 pm), on the future of retail, by Centdegrés (April 3rd, 02.00 pm), on Brand Image, by Dieter Bakic (April 3rd, 04.30 pm), Beauty In Brazil, by Nelly Rodi (April 4th, 2.30 p.m.), or What’s Next In Asia, by Information & Inspiration (April 5th, 12.00 a.m.)."
AS Watson restructures Marionnaud,"As sales prestige beauty sales continue to slow in several European countries, Marionnaud has initiated a drastic restructuring of its network. The retailer, which counted more than 1,100 stores in 11 countries in Europe, is closing several points of sale to focus on the most profitable stores. Marionnaud is therefore pulling out entirely from the Polish market with the closure of its 21 perfume shops in the country. Watson says the group wants to “focus its activities on other Central European markets, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania.” In the Iberian Peninsula, the group is dramatically reducing the size of its retail network.  Following negotiations with the employee representatives, Marionnaud Iberica has announced its intention to focus its business on 43% of its network.  As a consequence, a total of 73 stores - 69 in Spain and 4 in Portugal - out of 128 will be closed. At the end of the operation, Marionnaud will be present in Spain and Portugal through 55 stores and will employ 330 staff, compared to 660 previously. The crisis, which has hit the two countries since 2008, has led to a significant contraction of the selective beauty market and recovery is yet to come (sales declined by -7% in 2012 and by -2.1 % in 2013 according to The NPD Group). Conjointly to this restructuring, the group’s top management has entered a transitional period. In France, where Marionnaud has accelerated the renovation of its 531 stores and reopened its flagship store on the Champs-Elysées, Eileen Yeo has succeeded William G. Koeberlé as the new CEO.  Mrs Yo was previously co-CEO Marionnaud France since her arrival in the company in 2013. After more than 8.5 years in the Group, William Koeberlé will leave it definitively this summer to pursue “personal projects”. During this transition period, he will monitor public affaires issues for the company, according to AS Watson. The Marionnaud group was acquired in 2005 by the world’s leading retailer of health, beauty, fragrance and cosmetic products, AS Watson Group, a subsidiary of the Hutchison Whampoa-Group. At a press conference at the end of February in Hong Kong, Hutchison Whampoa’s Group Managing Director Canning Fok said there is no plan to sell this division in which the group will continue to invest. However, Hutchison Whampoa has indicated that the Marionnaud business would be excluded from the future IPO of approximately 25% of AS Watson & Co shares."
"After Paris and New York, the reasons behind the success of Makeup in Seoul","Premium Beauty News - So, what is this miracle recipe? Sandra Maguarian - The ingredients in this recipe were first, enthusiasm, passion, adventure... MakeUp in Paris, followed by MakeUp in New York and now by MakeUp in Seoul are clearly causing this ""special something"", this tremor, which are little or not at all felt in bigger events. It is true that the affective, almost carnal side of the event is easier to develop when you’re dealing with fifty or a hundred exhibitors. But the ""compact format"" of the event does not explain everything. Our industrial partners, who decide to embark on the adventure by renting some exhibition space, quickly find out that their presence is not just a matter of square meters. We really want to involve them throughout the duration of the event, which they accept enthusiastically. Workshops, special animations, conferences are among the many means they have available to take part to this great two–day celebration dedicated to make-up. The balance we chose between formula manufacturers, packaging specialists and accessory manufacturers is also no mere coincidence. By highlighting first the content, then the container and finally the accessories, it is the entire visitorship configuration which is targeted. It is clear that the content is what marketing services are mostly interested in and they prove it every year by massively attending our events each year. This is an important element! Not to say very important! It gives these marketing teams the opportunity to discover, touch, test, admire, what will make the uniqueness of the product they will be launching in the future. But that’s not all! The fact to keep on providing everyone with similar of very similar stands, by promoting finally what should really be, that is to say the product, is what seduces the visitor, namely the client. Focus on key points! Premium Beauty News - Figures alone are impressive if you look at the ratio on the number of visitors/number of exhibitors! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Yes that’s an interesting fact to highlight. This ratio is incredibly profitable to us. 2,600 visitors in Paris last year for 80 exhibitors...; 1,600 visitors in New York for 65 exhibitors and 1,800 visitors in Seoul for 32 exhibitors! A contact cost difficult to beat, don’t you think? Especially since the average cost of a fully furnished stand that includes, in addition, the food service for two days, and even the cocktail party on the first evening is particularly competitive. Premium Beauty News - The story of MakeUp in Seoul is in line with its two Paris and New York sister events? Sandra Maguarian - It’s true! In any case, what prevailed first was the speed of decision, the responsiveness of industry stakeholders who immediately decided to join us and, admittedly, the also very quick success of the event. In the case of MakeUp in Seoul, Jean-Yves Bourgeois and I wish to thank in particular the Korean men and women who helped us make a success of this first edition. We were very proud to organize MakeUp in Seoul and the feedback we had in terms of expressions of support and very concretely in terms of help, was particularly impressive. Everyone wanted this first edition to be a success and it certainly was beyond all expectations. This is a real concentration of innovation and professionalism that the 1,800 visitors were able to appreciate for two days in Seoul. Premium Beauty News - Paris, New York, Seoul....What’s next? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Our legitimate ambition is to make each of these three events, a major regional event. For MakeUp in Paris in June, the region is Europe, for MakeUp in New York in September, the region is North America and for MakeUp in Seoul in March, the region is Asia. There are already many events around the world... too many some will say! We mustn’t be getting too much of a good thing. Besides, we don’t consider ourselves as competitors to the rest of the event organizers! We are not in the same league, be it in terms of price or in terms of exhibition space, or, simply, in terms of concept. Even if we believe that our assets are real, the fact remains that the first quality that an event organizer must have is humility. And we are very attentive first and foremost to the wishes expressed by industrial partners who accompany us."
Top beauty trends in North and South America,"From Argentina to Venezuela, Euromonitor’s e-book highlights the 5 top trends in each of the 15 countries featured.  These trends include: the growing popularity of BB creams, the growth of nail products, the importance of skin care products, despite the variety of preferences, the key role of direct selling in many countries. BB Creams have seen increased popularity in countries such as Brazil and Mexico as multifunctional face cream debuted in the market. In Brazil, these creams can be more expensive but are still performing well because consumers perceive them as multi-functional and find it cheaper to buy one slightly expensive product versus multiple items separately. In 2012, L’Oreal’s Garnier brand launched the first BB cream in Mexico and since then several premium and mass brands have also launched BB creams, contributing to a wider product offering within the country. Nail Products are still very popular in markets such as Argentina and the Dominican Republic. In Argentina, nail colour has taken over lipstick as the guilty indulgence for women and nail products are the best performing category for beauty and personal care in the country. Despite a decline in beauty and personal care sales in the Dominican Republic, nail products are the big winner with growth in both volume and value with innovation and colour ranges strengthening the trend. Skin Care in Chile is seeing new innovation through product development and technological advances. New anti-ageing products are continually appearing on the market, targeted at both female and male consumers. Meanwhile, Canada’s growing immigrant population has a strong preference for products with skin-whitening properties and therefore is not satisfied with what Canadian retail has to offer. This is creating opportunities for imported brands and ethnic retailers to drive category growth. Within premium skin care, Costa Rican consumers use cleansers, toners and creams as part of their regular facial care process, which ranks them among the top three countries in terms of per capita consumption of these products in Latin America. Direct Selling in Bolivia is relying on traditional advertising strategies such as TV commercials, print media and billboards to promote their products to consumers. This new shift proved successful though, as many large companies continue to grow in the market. In Ecuador, direct selling is growing the fastest in actual terms of all channels in 2013 and it is the largest distribution channel among beauty and personal care products. According to Euromonitor, “direct selling will bring products to a wider range of socioeconomic classes over the next five years and will push consumers to try specialized products.”"
UK: an atypical distribution,"The first specificity is the considerable weight of mass market with the importance of Boots drugstore network. With more than 2,500 outlets throughout the United Kingdom, and a beauty-related turnover of 2.17 billion pounds sterling (i.e. 35 % of the health and beauty activity) [1] , Boots compels brands to offer endless discounts, thus making the market increasingly harder to access for newcomers. Boots also distributes premium brands in a few “more selective” stores. The distributor’s sales have even been strongly stimulated by this segment, in particular thanks to exclusive brands such as Smashbox. Lastly, they also offer a very wide variety of products under their own brands, which largely contributes to their success: their No7 line is the best-seller on the British market. As for the selective market, Debenhams remains the leader of the health and beauty segment. The department store chain is growing more and more ingenious to retain its consumers. Its strategy is to be present everywhere, all the time, and with new launches, both to adapt to the current culture of instantaneity and meet consumers’ changing needs. Debenhams is now very present on the web, in particular with a dynamic e-store, and they launched their own beauty blog three years ago to guide women consumers when buying their cosmetic products. “On the year it was created, the blog counted more than 70 million pages seen, and there are 350 million today… The idea with this editorial content is to provide readers with information on all product tests and all elements which may facilitate the act of purchase”, explains Sarah Sian, Beauty Editor of the British chain. Thanks to her educational software (videos, articles, etc.), Sarah invites women consumers to get familiar with products and thus avoids any deterrent to purchasing (fear of asking questions, of showing one’s skin defects to a shop assistant, etc.). The blog is linked with the store, which resorts to numerous sampling campaigns and, of course, accepts the Debenhams loyalty card. This strategy seems to be quite effective, since Debenhams online purchases increased by 46.2 % to represent 13.2 % of 2013 total sales (only 9.3 % in 2012). British women consumers globally seek and appreciate interactivity with brands. They like learning and searching for information themselves, and they look for efficacy promises beyond aestheticism. “Women are seeking more and more powerful products, and long-lasting, multifunctional ones represent the main trends”, underlines Sarah Sian. Therefore they prefer eye shadows that last longer, even though they are more expensive, and moisturizers which exhibit several properties such as BB or CC creams. Demand is also quite high for organic or natural products. “Hence the success of the bareMinerals brand”, explains Sarah Sian. All in all, the market is relatively dense and largely dominated by French and American groups’ brands (Procter & Gamble, L’Oréal, Chanel, LVMH, Estée Lauder, Coty, etc.). Newcomers often manage to emerge by using alternative distributors such as Space N.K. and/or very high-end networks. Others try to create a more direct and close relationship with consumers and are able to rely on the sales power of specialized TV channels in particular. Sarah Cross, one of the founders of young brand Code-Beautiful, aimed to “create attachment to the brand and ensure consumers’ loyalty from the start”. Given the overabundance of the beauty product offer, many women value recommendations and advice. Code-Beautiful has thus chosen to be distributed in beauty salons, on QVC, the teleshopping leader channel, and through a network of exclusive distributors as well. The brand also strongly invested in social networks to try and create a personal bond with its customers."
Brazil: fragrances sector set to continue growing rapidly,"By 2013 Brazil was already the most valuable fragrances market in the world, worth more than US$6 billion. This is built on the back of high per capita consumption as Brazilians use, on average, three times more fragrances by volume than consumers in the US, the next most valuable market. Not only is consumption of fragrances already high, it is also set to grow quickly with both men and women using high volumes of fragrances, and often looking to treat themselves to new and novel experiences. Meanwhile, Brazil’s population is young and increasingly affluent. “These three pillars - a broad consumer base, experience-seeking consumers and a young affluent population - will be the basis of the market’s continued rapid growth,” highlights Canadean. [1] According to the market research firm, opportunities exist to target men and women with both mass and premium products.  Actually, fragrances consumption in Brazil is broad, meaning manufacturers have a variety of consumer groups and price points they can target. For instance, men play a prominent role in the Brazilian fragrances market, consuming 48.7% of fragrances by volume. Furthermore, consumers in the poorest 50% of households consume almost as many fragrances as those in the richest 50% of households. This means there are opportunities for almost all product types and price categories to succeed in the market. Regarding consumption motivations, Canadean has found that when Brazilians come to select what fragrance to use, 25.5% of consumption by value is the result of consumers seeking to either affirm particular visions of femininity or masculinity, including the use fragrances to deliberately break gender stereotypes. Meanwhile consumers’ desire to experience new or novel scents are a key motivation behind the consumption of just under a quarter of all fragrances in Brazil by value, while the desire to treat oneself is also important. Almost 100 million people, half the total Brazilian population, are aged between 16 and 35. In addition to their large numbers, these consumers use fragrances more frequently than consumers in other age groups. “Add in their growing spending power, with GDP per capita in Brazil growing by over US$4,000 between 2007 and 2012, and young Brazilians will drive rapid growth in the market,” the market research firm concludes."
U.S. prestige eye makeup market grew 9 per cent in 2013,"While fragrance sales remained flat last year, skincare and makeup were the main contributors of the U.S. prestige beauty market growth, revealed The NPD Group.  Eye makeup products, in particular, benefited from consumers’ growing interest in less traditional items. In a dynamic U.S. prestige beauty market [1] that grew by 5 per cent in 2013, makeup experienced healthy gains of 7 per cent, with sales of prestige eye products reaching US$ 1.1 billion (+9% compared to 2012). “US consumers are embracing the art of eye makeup with the addition of products that go beyond the usual staples to their beauty tool boxes,” said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group Inc. “Today, less traditional items are emerging in importance. Eye brow products are leading growth and, in the larger segments within eye, enhanced benefits are the aspects fuelling increases."" For instance, multi-benefit (+9%), volumizing (+11%), and long wear (+18%) products helped to drive the 2013 dollar sales growth in prestige mascara. Primarily, eyeliner growth came from pencils (+7%), long wear (+11%), and waterproof options (+10%). “Long wear is a theme that carried throughout eye makeup, showing sales growth in the eye brow products (+21%), and shadow (+9%) as well,” highlighted the market research firm. In general, the average selling price of prestige eye makeup was 3 per cent higher in the 12 months ending December 2013 than it was in the prior year. Eye shadow (+6%), brow (+4%), and liner (+3%) products experienced the largest increases in average selling price. With the exception of mascara, long wear products are garnering higher average selling prices than their counterparts in all segments. “Definition that lasts is important to today’s beauty consumer, looking to enhance their eyes with minimal repeat application, and they are willing to pay more to get it,” added Karen Grant. “It has long been said that ’our eyes have the ability to make a statement without saying a word’ – eye defining makeup just turns up the volume.”"
Mature women drive French fragrances sector,"The fragrance market in France is dominated by the mature generation, particularly women aged 45 and over. Female consumers are responsible for 54% of fragrances usage by volume, with over 60% of female consumption by mid-lifers (45-54 year olds) and older women (aged 55 and over). This is a third of the total market volume. Meanwhile, consumers aged 45 and over also lead consumption by men, accounting for 40.7% of total male consumption and 18.7% of total consumption by both genders. [1] With an ageing population, the importance of these groups will only increase: by 2018, there will be 1.8 million more consumers aged 45 and over in France than there were in 2013. According to Canadean, this ageing population will also create opportunities to encourage brand switching. For example, over half of consumption by pre-mid lifers (aged between 35 and 44) is a result of using fragrances once a day.  In contrast mid-lifers and older consumers use fragrances far more often: over 60% of their consumption by volume is a result of consumers using fragrances more than once a day. This transition from less frequent consumption to more regular usage will be a key point for marketers to encourage consumers to switch brands. Indulgence is the most important of 20 consumption motivators Canadean tracks, driving 44.5% of consumption by value. The next leading motivation, consumer’s desire to use fragrances that affirm a particular gender identity, motivates less than half as much consumption. Consumers are looking for exclusive and high-quality fragrances that add a touch of class to their aspired image. “Despite the weak French economy, the country has witnessed little change in the top ten brands. This means that brand-loyal consumers continue to treat themselves with the brands they know and love, which makes it harder for new players, but creates an opportunity for limited edition releases of existing leading brands,” Canadean says. Meanwhile, health and beauty stores distribute half of all fragrances in France by value, over three times as much as the next leading channel. Specialized shops can provide an even more indulgent experience by featuring larger collections, consultants, and samples, so customers can examine scents themselves. “The perception of perfume as a significant part of appearance means that consumers, especially women, want not just indulgent and sophisticated scents, but those that match their desired lifestyle, status, or image,” the market research firm adds. This has helped established brands such as Dior and Chanel to continue to lead the market. In addition, 21.8% of fragrances by value were consumed because they helped consumers to affirm a particular gender identity. This includes fragrances that help both men and women to assert traditional styles of masculinity or femininity, but also those that help to break gender stereotypes."
MakeUp in Seoul in fifteen days: the first beauty event of the year 2014 in Asia,"Premium Beauty News - Comments seem to be unanimous! MakeUp in Seoul, it was the right choice? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Undoubtedly, it was the right choice! But this success will have to be attributed to an entire industry, which will have mobilized itself to make of this event the first beauty event in 2014 in Asia. Leading Korean and Western companies in formulation and packaging will be present as exhibitors. And with pre-registered visitors coming from Korea and from many other countries. Premium Beauty News - Conferences, round tables and make-up animations will follow one another for two days? Sandra Maguarian - This is in the DNA of our events. MakeUp in Seoul, in the wake of its older counterparts, MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York, will be both a very professional and fun event. As always, many conferences, but also plenty of make-up animations with the support of two prestigious make-up schools, the Soobin Academy and the Hera Academy. To note also, Damien Dufresne’s photo exhibition. Among the conferences and round tables not to be missed: “Parisian make-up style oscillates between identity assertion and fashion spirit”; “Make-up and Skin-Care, an increasingly less marked border. Where are the new developments heading to?”  The Sleever company will present the “Sleever Make Up solution to meet the current market trends in lipstick.” To note also the following conferences: “Ten years of experience in measuring cosmetic brands equity in Europe; America and Asia: Which lessons for make-up brands?” and “Make-up and applicators, a sophisticated interactivity that can transform Make-up!” Finally, on the second day, visitors will be able to attend the presentation “Autumn/Winter 2014 Key Runway Make-Up Trends, adapting the season’s main runway trends into product implications for the Asian Consumers.”  Not forgetting the two last themes: “How to successfully protect one’s intellectual property?” and “Make-up trends in Europe versus Asia.” Premium Beauty News - A great evening is scheduled on the first day. Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Indeed, this event is organized in partnership with the Amore Pacific Group who thus intends to celebrate with the entire industry the first Korean professional event exclusively dedicated to make-up."
USA: prestige drives beauty sales in 2013,"The US prestige beauty [1] industry grew 5 per cent in dollar sales in 2013, compared to 2012. Skincare and makeup each experienced healthy gains of 7 per cent, while fragrance dollars remained flat last year, unveiled The NPD Group. “Beauty is among a handful of industries showing growth in 2013,” said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. Looking beyond the prestige market, sales within the US mass channel also increased slightly, up 1 per cent for total beauty in 2013, versus 2012 [2]. The makeup category grew the most, at 2 per cent, followed by skincare at 1 per cent, but fragrance struggled with a 6 per cent decline in dollars compared to 2012. “Value is important to consumers, but premium-priced offerings are thriving in US prestige beauty,” notes The NPD group. Even though sales for the total prestige fragrance category were flat, fragrances priced $100 and over grew 30 per cent in dollars, while face makeup priced at $60 and up increased 28 per cent, and premium skincare for the face gained 15 per cent in dollar sales compared to 2012. Over the past two years, the average price of prestige beauty products has increased consistently. “Whatever the motivation, consumers continue to be more willing to invest in their beauty products,” said Grant.  “The willingness of today’s consumers to spend a little more on their beauty products is a continued opportunity for manufacturers and retailers. It is the right time for communicating the end benefit of investing in better products and service to get the attention of your customer, and delivering on those promises will do the rest,” she added. In addition to the premium segment, the direct-to-consumer channel helped to drive growth for the US beauty industry in 2013, growing 19 per cent [3]. Beside the rise of premium-priced prestige fragrances, The NPD Group also reports another important shift in the types of scents being purchased. Indeed, sales of woody oriental scents, the second largest fragrance family after floral scents, and smaller segments grew faster than the whole fragrance market in 2013. “Floral fragrances aren’t fading away, but less traditional scents are gaining more of the attention from female consumers than ever before,” commented Karen Grant.  “With the emergence of more artisanal scents on the market, women are welcoming the opportunity to experiment and explore different options.” The standalone oriental, woods, citrus, and fruity fragrances are still a small portion of the market, at just 7 per cent of women’s fragrance dollar sales, but they are growing at the expense of the larger segments, including the top selling fragrance family, floral. Woody oriental is the only one of the larger blended fragrance families to experience growth in 2013. Two of the top 5 women’s prestige fragrances sold in the US are part of the woody oriental fragrance family, while the other three in the top five are florals and a soft floral. “The recognizable classics remain strong, but new players are important rising stars to watch,” said Grant. “Today, the opportunity for reinvention afforded by a novel scent coexists with the instant indulgence provided by the classics.”"
"United Kingdom: Fragrance sales grew by 9% in 2013, boosted by the Valentine’s fortnight","The NPD Group Inc is predicting a bumper period for prestige beauty sales in the UK in the fortnight leading up to Valentine’s Day this year, especially for fragrances.  In 2013, UK fragrance sales were up 9.3% year-on-year, with 1 million units of fragrances sold, generating £31.6 million in value sales over these two weeks alone. “Valentine’s fortnight remains a key focus for prestige beauty products, with fragrance representing 2.7% of annual fragrance value sales and 3% of total beauty sales in the UK - beating both Father’s Day and Mother’s Day sales,” says The NPD Group. The market research firm notes there is an opportunity for growth in the UK fragrance market when comparing sales in other key markets.  “In France and the United States, 2013 Valentine’s fragrance sales represented 4% of annual fragrance value sales, generating just over £67 million and £81 million, respectively.” Trend data reveals that while fragrance sales peak around Valentine’s Day, at 42% of prestige beauty products sold based on 2013 figures, sales are less concentrated at this time of year compared to Christmas. However, sales across all beauty categories rise during Valentine’s fortnight as consumers take the opportunity to buy something special for themselves, such as facial skincare or make-up, as well as for their lover. “Men look set to be the winners in the fragrance stakes this year if the 2013 trend continues, with men’s fragrances for Valentine’s 2013 representing 35% of all fragrance value sales - up from 33% in 2012,” points out The NPD Group. Data from Valentine’s 2013 reveals that consumers may become more price conscious with their fragrance purchases. On average, both women’s and men’s fragrance sales were down £1-2 on the annual average price at £33 and £31, respectively. Leftover Christmas gift sets were also popular for Valentine’s 2013 in the UK. “As usual, we expect prestige beauty sales to peak around Valentine’s Day. This year, we predict that the Valentine’s fortnight boom trend for fragrance sales will continue, with the big brands creating the perfect setting for love in-store and online to leverage the growth opportunities in the UK market. Overall, we see that fragrance sales at this time of year are a key driver for wider beauty category sales as consumers treat themselves as well as their loved ones, with savvy consumers sniffing out the best deals,” commented June Jensen, Director for The NPD Group Beauty UK."
France: another year of decrease for the prestige beauty market,"After a decrease by 0.9 % in value in 2012, the French market for beauty products (perfume, skincare, makeup) sold in the so-called selective network - which includes perfumeries and department stores but not pharmacies and supermarkets - recorded another decrease in 2013, with sales dropping by 1.5 % in value. However, according to the French federation of selective perfumery (FFPS), which represents more than 70 % of the sector’s operators and nearly 1,700 sales outlets, including major national retail chains (Sephora, Marionnaud Nocibé ), groups and franchises (Beauty Success), department stores (Galeries Lafayette, Printemps, Le Bon Marché) and independent perfume retailers, the sector performed rather well, “compared to other sectors related equipment of persons.” Actually, the results are quite contrasted depending on retail and product categories. For instance, chain retailers and department stores recorded a better performance than independent retailers, and makeup and skincare performed better than fragrances. As far as retail channels are concerned, beauty chains, which represent 76% of the market, ended the year 2013 with flat sales. December sales progressing by +0.5% in value and the opening of 59 new outlets may explain these results. Department stores, which hold 9 % of the market, posted an increase of 0.5% of their sales, while the number of outlets almost unchanged (+ 4 stores in 2013), and despite bad performances in December (-3.8% in value compared to December 2012). Eventually, independent retailers  had to support the most pronounced effects of the crisis and recorded a decline of 9.8 % of their turnover. Regarding the products, makeup is the category recording the best performance in 2013.  Its turnover remained almost stable compared to 2012 (-0.7%), thanks to products for the lips and gift sets, which recorded strong growth (+5%). After an excellent year 2012, skincare products recorded a decline of 1.7% of their turnover in 2013. The year was mainly driven by the strong performance of anti-aging (+3.7%) and moisturizing (+2.8%) products. Finally, the fragrance market, recorded a decline of 1.7% of its turnover, while rising prices have partially offset a 4.2% drop in sales volumes. ""In a context where consumption declined throughout the year, our market held up rather well. However, we must draw lessons for the future because our products are not first necessities and customers can chose to prioritize other items. We need to improve the customer experience so that it does not give up to please others or to please itself with our products,"" said William G. Koeberlé, President of the FFPS."
"“Garnier’s withdrawal from China is a lesson of wisdom”, Florence Bernardin, Information & Inspiration","Premium Beauty News - How would you analyse these successive decisions, beyond economic reasons? Florence Bernardin - The problem for Revlon is mainly related to distribution and communication, which were not sufficiently focused on China. Their local sales only represented 2 % of the turnover. As for Garnier, at first I was surprised. This brand really had a history with this country, and actual legitimacy: a lot had been done for their international image as well as for the access to Western products. At the same time, I can understand the underlying economic, profit-related reasons. It is actually quite brave, and it shows the world anything is not possible in China today. It is not paradise. A lot remains to be done, but it is also necessary to appropriately position oneself, choose a distribution network and a competitive segment. So this withdrawal should be considered as a lesson of wisdom, economics and management, not as a cold shower. Premium Beauty News - Has the Chinese mass market become impossible to access for Western brands? Florence Bernardin - The mass market is hardly penetrable with export today. It has become increasingly complex to be competitive with first-price products on the mass market because of the local market. It is just not profitable. And it is hard to get sales to take off within such a competitive context, economically speaking. French brands in particular should keep focusing on masstige and selective markets. That is what they are good at. The luxury market is not really challenged by local brands because it is still associated with each brand’s culture and history. Premium Beauty News - How can the future be seen on this market then? Florence Bernardin - China is going to become a tricky market, just like other international ones can be. The future will increasingly be made of joint-ventures and partnerships between local manufacturers and international brands to favour know-how collaboration. This is one of the solutions to be considered a priority, since attention should be paid to achieving effective communication with Chinese teams. It must be noted that there are lessons to be learnt in intercultural management, and in knowing how to work with the Chinese, and listen to all their wishes. Many international brands, including Garnier, according to Chinese social networks, seem to have come up against management difficulties in China. This results in a lack of understanding, and then it gets all negative. Many companies still have not established adequate intercultural understanding, nor have they left enough responsibility to their local management. It is hard to preserve the strategic image of a Western brand, but concessions will have to be made. Success depends on actual collaboration with stakeholders who are familiar with the local market. Premium Beauty News - Which segments do you consider as growth drivers? Florence Bernardin - Midrange and premium products, but with brands that really make a difference, just like for other international markets. I also think natural and organic products will play a part. The health theme will be crucial because consumers are really looking for protection, cleanliness and safety, as they are exposed to sanitary scandals and pollution. The brands that will decide to focus on safety and transparency do have a key role, especially if they are Western brands, because they are seen as a guarantee of quality. Premium Beauty News - Do you think the fact that the one-child policy was abolished can have an influence on the birth rate, and therefore on the child product segment? Florence Bernardin - First of all, the law has not been voted yet, and nobody knows when it will be. Then I am not sure there will actually be a babyboom if it is, because real estate and education costs increase at the same time, and they are already part of the most expensive in the world. Having a second child will be very costly! So people will think twice. However, the baby market will change, and cosmetics for children will develop. Indeed it should not be forgotten that children are at the centre of the family there. In addition, demand for safe products will be high for this target."
Nocibé: new store concept dedicated to private brand and services,"Less than two years after the launch of its own brand, Nocibé is offering it and unprecedented setting: a new beauty concept store.  The first of its kind opened in mid-December 2013 in the Roubaix urban area, in Northern France, under the name: Les Bellista by Nocibé.  There are hardly any luxury fragrances or high-end brands here, but a large offering of makeup, toiletries, skincare and accessories by Nocibé as well as some products from brands under exclusive distribution. This new generation of boutiques promises to experience beauty ""on and off the premises.""  On premises, thanks to a comprehensive range of no-booking express services: nail and hair styling bars, makeup, depilation, express facial and body treatments, performed around the central bar or in the lounges. Off premises, thanks to a full range of Nocibé beauty products: a wide choice at an affordable price . ""If we should summarize this project, it is two-thirds of products and a third of services,"" a spokeswoman for the retailer told Premium Beauty News. Designed by French agency Rev Architecture, this new beauty retail concept will develop in parallel with existing boutiques.  ""While Nocibé and Les Bellista by Nocibé share the same values - generosity, free beauty, fun, service and expertise - they are consived as two different and complementary offerings,"" said the retailer. Of course, there are strong synergies between the two networks, for instance, Nocibé’s loyalty cards will be valid in Les Bellista boutiques and vice versa. According to Isabelle Parize, Nocibé’s CEO, ""this generation of boutique is inspired from the expectations of new consumers. It emphasises 1,000 SKUs of the Nocibé brand as well as the expertise of our beauty consultants. Les Bellista by Nocibé is a bet that we do because we believe in our strengths and our expertise, we are confident in our teams, and we trust our brand so much that we offer it a new setting. In particular, we trust in our ability to innovate and to have a long term and enlarged vision for Nocibé."" The next opening is scheduled in spring 2014, somewhere close to Paris. The retailer’s aims to have opened a total four stores by the end of 2014. Founded in Lille in 1984, Nocibé now operates 466 outlets, located throughout France. Despite unfavourable market conditions, Nocibé reported a 3% progression of its net sales in 2013 to 700 million euros, compared to 680 million in 2012. Nocibé’s current owner, Charterhouse Capital Partners, is currently finalising its sale to the Douglas group. The merger of the two networks would allow Douglas to rank number two in France behind Sephora."
Regional cosmetics seeking to capture the world,"The starting point is quite simple for many of these new brands: “Why travel the whole world searching for exotic ingredients, while extraordinary, often untapped raw materials can be found right here?” “I grew up with an orchard at the back of my garden, and nothing tastes better than fruit directly taken from the tree. Apples, especially the cider apple from Normandy, are extremely rich in polyphenols. France happens to be one of the main producers, with the most varied offer,” explains Fanny Marouani, founder of Pomarium, an organic line which makes use of all properties in the apple. “France is full of resources,” declares Julie Ducret, who founded Pulpe de Vie, an organic brand from Provence based on fresh fruit, which is already cherished by Japanese women. “For ethics reasons as well as to limit carbon footprint, I forced myself to define a maximum area of 350 km around the site to source my products”, she explains. This uncompromising philosophy concerns fresh fruit and all other ingredients alike: olive oil, bee wax, honey, floral waters, ochre from the Luberon… Given the growing interest of brands in local sourcing, ID Bio, a plant extraction laboratory, launched a brand named Terroir en beauté in 2012 to give more value to organic-certified raw materials from French regions: samphires from Western France marshes, highbush blueberry from the Vosges, carrots from the Alsatian region, dark red plums from Lorraine… The range already counts 18 references, and 6 are being developed. “Whether small or bigger, brands are now ready to commit in a specific regional origin, and we are able to provide this. We have quite a high demand for our standard range as well as for our tailor-made extracts,” affirms Alexia Machado Forestier, Marketing and Communication Manager. Apart from exploiting regional botanical richness, brands can also rely on the image of highly evocative regions. This is how Stéphanie Seznec founded Britanie, as she was willing to put forward the Breton lifestyle, all the while supporting local development. “This encourages our region to work on its own resources, which is not always automatic in the cosmetic industry,” explains Arnaud Fourel, founder of Nominoe, a brand of cosmetics developed thanks to the richness of Brittany’s biotope. Such an ethical approach does not always prove economical though: “packaging made in Brittany is much more expensive for us”, admits Stéphanie Seznec, “but we do intend to give priority to quality”. With about fifteen local partners on average, these brands prefer to favour a close relationship with their suppliers, whether they provide raw materials, packs or formulators. Such a relationship is often perceived as a guarantee of quality and product traceability. Julie Ducret went as far as printing pictures of her 25 fruit producers on Pulpe de Vie product packages, just to follow this principle. “Speaking the truth is only logical”, she believes. Corsican brand Solyvia partially finances the production of some plants, thus securing its own share of the harvest. “If you want to use the image of a region, it is only natural to invest in this region”, explains Christophe Fouilleron, one of its founders. And he laments the fact that he does not share this investment with big brands. “Corsica and its biodiversity are on a roll with major groups, which unfortunately take advantage of this without creating jobs on a local level.” He got together with eight other Corsican brands, and in 2012 he joined Corsica Cosmetica, the first cosmetic group on the island, which was founded by the Chambre des Métiers et de l’Artisanat de Corse du Sud - South Corsica’s chamber of handicrafts - to preserve and give more value to its beauty asset. “We have implemented a charter of good practices to protect rare plants such as the everlasting flower or the myrtle against any abusive exploitation, and to impose quotas”. These regional products are riding on the wave of the need for authenticity, local commitment and closeness of consumers who seek to give a meaning to their act of purchase. They also possess a considerable emotional power, playing alternatively on the feeling of belonging and the need to escape. Local sourcing is viewed as an act of solidarity, and a guarantee of quality. And when the region, such as Provence, enjoys strong tourist attraction and a significant popular support beyond borders, it can also become an important asset abroad. “Reactions are extremely positive in Asia, as the Japanese are great admirers of Napoleon. They know Corsica, they appreciate its naturalness, and it is increasingly part of their travel destinations,” declares Christophe Fouilleron. The local made in mark is popular abroad."
"Mixologiste is key beauty trend for 2014, Mintel says","According to the market research firm, blurred lines between beauty technology are becoming increasingly common, with overlaps between skincare, hair care and colour cosmetics. Manufacturers combine technology, packaging and marketing from different categories to create new products. “Mixologiste is fast becoming the stand-out trend that spans all beauty and personal care categories. This is a key mega trend, in development for the last year or so, but we are set to see it really accelerating in 2014. While manufacturers have worked with multifunctionality for a number of years, we are now seeing them take inspiration from completely different categories to create new products and marketing messages. The huge success of BB creams has led manufacturers to think about how they can build on their existing portfolios and add excitement to sometimes saturated sectors. New combinations will continue to evolve, resulting in new products, packaging, marketing and merchandising,” explains Jane Henderson, Global President of Mintel’s Beauty and Personal Care Division. Mintel’s consumer research highlights the popularity of multifunctional make-up in the US, with as many as 70% of US female consumers expressing an interest in multifunctional lip products, and 65% showing interest in multifunctional facial coverage products, for example those which combine the benefits of foundation and concealer. And while saving time and cost are highlighted as the benefits of these products, the research shows how time-poor US consumers perceive time saving (68%) to be a greater benefit than reduced costs (63%). In China, almost half (46%) of make-up users express an interest in trying new products with multifunctionality (such as 2-in-1 eye shadow and blusher), while almost one in three (29%) agree that multifunctional products (eg BB cream) perform as well as products designed for single purpose. Around four in ten (37%) say they like products which have cosmetic benefits as well as care for their skin. Reduced cost is seen to be a benefit for a third (34%) of Chinese consumers who say that buying multi-functional products is more economical than buying products separately. But while multifunctionality is popular in the US and China, it is not yet as popular in the UK where just a quarter (25%) of women say they are interested in products which have cosmetic benefits as well as care for the skin, such as BB cream and tinted lip balm. “Of course we saw this trend several decades ago with 2-in-1 shampoos, but these new hybrid products are becoming more ambitious and exciting. The success of hybrids such as BB creams has inspired manufacturers to explore different ways through which they can bring categories together to create something exciting for consumers. Instead of cannibalising sales, these products are acting as ‘add on’ products and not simply replacement products,” Jane continues. Looking to 2014, Mintel’s leading beauty and personal care analysts have examined how Mixologiste is impacting the haircare, skincare, colour cosmetics and fragrance markets. “ Colour cosmetics have extended their scope into some unexpected areas. Hair chalks blend make-up with temporary colorants, primers now extend to pre-styling treatments and CC creams have moved beyond facial colour cosmetics in to nail care, lipsticks and even haircare. The coming years will see even more developments as manufacturers build on the excitement and pique consumers’ interest in more adventurous formats and claims, ” says Vivienne Rudd, Director of Insight, Beauty & Personal Care. According to Mohamed Omer, Global Haircare Analyst, “newly launched hair BB creams that promise to protect and reinforce hair fibre are being inspired by the growth of skin BB creams. Hair perfumes offer both a standalone product and an extension to fragrance ancillaries and a bath & body collection. Besides leaving hair smelling fresh, they also protect hair against UV damage, colour fading, helping consumers retain maximum moisture, condition and nourishment.” As far as skin care products are concerned, there are opportunities to cross-over into any number of beauty categories. “We’ve already had BB, CC and even DD creams, with EE creams set to make an appearance too,” says Christopher Lindsley, Global Skincare Analyst. “The first treatment fragrances have already hit the market, and textiles and food and drink are making growing use of skincare actives too. In the future, we will see targeted skincare delivery systems through fabrics, fragrances and food, and further work on hybrids that bring together skincare, devices and diagnostics.” The fragrance market is no exception. “In the fragrance field, there is room to innovate by extending the category to new formats and added benefits. We expect hair fragrances to offer more than scent with targeted and time-release delivery of specific benefits such as antioxidants, vitamins, pigments and UV filters. Other formats like scented skincare products and fragrance for clothes are still untapped but have potential to grow the fragrance offerings. A third of French women report interest for skincare products that contain their favourite fragrance and four in ten Italian women are interested in fragrance for clothes, highlighting the potential to disseminate benefits between fabric care and the fragrance categories,” states Emmanuelle Moeglin, Global Fragrance Analyst. And, according to Mintel, it seems it is not just multi-use products set to impact the future, but also complementary categories. “New technology will offer even more exciting hybrid products going forward, innovation will come not only from beauty but from complementary categories such as textiles, devices, sensors, 3D and 4D printing, food and drink and automotives. Of particular interest are new delivery systems and packaging, both or which will see significant advances. These will impact most beauty categories, but the sharpest focus will be on skincare, haircare and fragrance,” concludes Vivienne Rudd."
"Moscow, a niche brands heaven?","Three chain retailers now dominate the distribution of selective perfume and cosmetic brands in Russia, particularly in the regions of Moscow and Saint Petersburg: L’Etoile, Rive Gauche and Ile de Beauté. The competition between the two leaders, L’Etoile and Rive Gauche, is based primarily on price, and exclusive and own brands.  Note that besides Chanel, Guerlain and Estee Lauder products, the two chains, also offer mass brands such as Garnier, Nivea or Gillette.  However, no trace of rare perfume brand. Among the three retailers, Ile de Beauté tries to stand out with a classier decoration and a high-end assortment. There are hardly any mass brands here, but attractively highlighted Sephora products in black displays.  Also, a fairly wide selection of the most famous niche perfume brands: Annick Goutal, Atelier Cologne, Byredo, Diptyque, Clive Christian, Rouge Bunny Rouge, Serge Lutens... But in Moscow, niche perfume and cosmetic brands from around the world have found their cocoon at Apetka Cosmotheca, the concept store created by Hayk Sargsyan and which opened at the end of 2012 at Galereya Moskva.  Fragrance brands such as Olfactory Studio or Humiecki and Graef are showcased alongside skincare lines such as Absolution, Erborian, Patyka or Tokyo Milk, makeup accessories such as Japonesque or the Japanese toothbrush brand Yumaki (on the pharmacy counter). [1]  Cosmotheca already runs seven outlets (shops or corners) in Moscow, a corner in St. Petersburg and now plans to expand in the regions. A few steps away, near the Bolshoi Theatre, the famous Tsum store probably offers the most luxurious frame to the numerous niche brands it distributes Aqua di Parma, Atkinson, Comptoir Sud Pacifique, Coudray, Clive Christian, Creed, Diptyque, Histoire de Parfums, Houbigant Paris, Jovoy, Le Labo, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Memo, etc.) alongside the most prestigious global brands. In addition are the numerous Articoli point of sales that also offer - in a very upmarket frame - a diverse vision of the high-end offering of perfumes and cosmetics."
Perfumed candles: a confident sector,"“Things have to be put into perspective”, says Sébastien Roy, R&D Manager at Bougies La Française, “the media have seized upon this announcement in a very alarmist way, but we still don’t know about the future regulation guidelines”. People globally seem confident and welcome this initiative which, while improving the quality of interior air, could also improve the offer. Audrey Haupt, Marketing Manager at Terre d’Oc and Guilhem Rousseau, founder of Manufacture Française de Bougies, both think “it’s good there is a demand for transparency, especially on import products”. According to Sébastien Roy, French regulations might rely on European work in terms of labelling and standardization. Some of the standards published in 2007 for information only might become mandatory within the next two or three years. In addition to these standards, which are related to smoke quantification, anti-inflammatory safety and labelling, a project for the standardization of analysis methods is ongoing. Sébastien Roy adds that “it’s actually about methodology, how to analyse a candle, given the fact that combustion variations may alter results, and how to extrapolate given the various parameters (size of the item, ventilation level, burn time…). This project aims at universalizing the analysis method, and the limit values will then be left to each country’s own free will”. The hypothetical limit values on benzene exposure laid down by the French authorities do not seem to worry manufacturers. “Our results on candles were obtained in accordance with the analyses in force, and they are much inferior to the values recommended by the WHO,” explains Sébastien Roy. “We constantly tool up to improve our tests and keep providing quality”, adds Julien Pruvost, Executive Director of CIR. Terre d’Oc claims the same, as they have conducted a two-year study, along with Natures & Découvertes, which was destined for real-time measuring of the impact of their candles in the CSTB’s experimental house MARIA [1]. Results proved inferior to risk values. As for olfactory compositions, Carla Romagnosa, Marketing Manager of Switzerland-based Cosmo Fragrances International, explains she has not received any specific request from her customers. Therefore complying with standards should not represent any obstacle to the great growth increase in the sales of high-end perfumed candles (+ 15 % per year since 1995). “Luxury candles are winning acclaim, and perfume brands are growing aware of the fact that it is a powerful image driver that is likely to generate some turnover”, explains Julien Pruvost. If Europe – mainly France and the UK – represents about half the market, Asia is increasing its share with an uncompromising demand for quality. “The market is mainly thriving in Japan but, paradoxically, awareness is being raised about the problems related to air quality in China, where consumers look for well-made products”, adds Guilhem Rousseau. We will have to wait until spring 2014 to find out about the content of the new regulation, which should reassure French consumers and reinforce the Asian clientele."
InterCharm Moscow: Where East and West meet,"With 1,022 exhibitors (+10% compared to the previous year) and an increase of 11% of the exhibition area, the InterCharm Moscow trade show continues to benefit from the growth of the Russian cosmetics market. A total of more than 3,500 brands from 32 countries were showcased this year.  According to organizers, the 2013 edition, which was held from November 27 to 30, welcomed 67,382 visitors, an increase of 9% compared to 2012. Let’s remind that 20 years ago, the Russian cosmetics market was still to build.  In 1994, the first edition of InterCharm was launched and gathered… 76 exhibitors. The Russian market has recovered from the various crises. Today it is the ninth global market for consumer goods and should be ranked 4th in 2020.  The large urban population (over 12 million inhabitants in Moscow and 14 other cities with over one million citizens) has been a strong propeller of the consumers’ demand. According to Euromonitor, the Russian beauty market grew to an estimated USD 13.9 billion (EUR 10.14 billion) in 2012, compared to USD 13.5 billion (EUR 9,85 billion) in 2011 and is forecasted to reach USD 15.6 billion (EUR 11,4 billion) in 2015.  Main segments of the market are fragrances (23%), skin care (22.6%), hair care (19.2%) and make-up (15.4%).  The Russian cosmetics market ranks 5th in Europe, after France, Germany, the UK and Italy. Despite this dynamism, the Russian market is everything but easy.  There is a strong competition, with a strong presence of multinational companies.  According to Euromonitor, 70% of the market belongs to 40 companies. Furthermore, the retail side tend to be increasingly concentrated, in particular with three major networks that dominate the selective distribution (L’Etoile, Rive Gauche, and Ile de Beauté). This is particularly true in Moscow and St. Petersburg but the chains are extending their networks at nationally. Actually, a major part of the future growth should come from the premium cosmetics segment, in particular with increased sales in the regions (beyond Moscow and Saint-Petersburg) boosted by online boutiques. From this point of view, a quick tour Moscow’s main outlets may be enough to convince to how the market has rapidly diversified to highlight the most advanced products.  The organizers of InterCharm have also understood it very well and thus have created an area entirely dedicated to rare and high quality brands.  Under the name “La Niche”, this area hosted perfume brands such as Mark Buxton, Parfumerie Générale Pierre Guillaume, Huitème Art, Phaedon Laboratorio Olfattivo, Scultures Olfactives or Mona di Orio, and also skin care lines such as UNA skincare, Soley Organic or Swisscode Bionic. “With a relatively short record on the Russian market, niche perfumery and cosmetics didn’t wait long to find their loyal admirers,” the show organisers highlight. Nevertheless, most of the InterCharm tradeshow is still devoted to professional retail networks (hair and beauty salons). ""The professional market and home consumption are overlapping in Russia,"" explains Anna Dycheva, Assistant Director of InterCharm.  “Many consumers prefer to buy products from a professional in whose knowledge they trust.”  On this segment, the strength of European brands, including Italian, French and Spanish, is obvious. As far as the retail segment is concerned, there is a strong participation of Japanese exhibitors in the show, and of Korean, to a lesser extent.  Similarly, Japanese cosmetic brands, and some Korean, also seem to hold strong positions in Moscow’s beauty outlets. “Russian women are known to value very highly European cosmetics, in particular from France, Switzerland or Italy, but the demand for Japanese cosmetics is rapidly increasing,” says Anna Dycheva.  “Consumers perceive these products as 100% safe and 100% effective, and based on sound scientific research.” Just like Russia, InterCharm appears as a crossroads between the European and the Asian cosmetic offers."
Alfonso Maligno’s “Pharmacy 3.0” puts the light on the cosmetic shelves,"About two years and multiple cross-disciplinary skills (twenty or so partner companies were appealed to): that is what it took the multidisciplinary teams at Alfonso Maligno’s firm - trend observers, designers, architects and graphic designers - to conceive and develop the “Pharmacy 3.0” concept. They mainly aimed at generating purchase pleasure in a place consumers most often go to because they have to, and not because they want to. The starting point is pretty simple: it is essential to generate purchase pleasure to develop customer loyalty and make pharmacy attractive and engaging. “Consumers will be much more tempted to buy and come back to a retail space where they have felt support, interaction, pleasure and well-being,” explains Alfonso Maligno, founder of the firm. And so it is the ambience that the firm has first chosen to work on, by favouring natural and cosy materials, with an autoclave-treated oak wooden floor, wooden and steel shelves, or raw metal coated with water varnish. The firm has not hesitated to create vegetated areas, with planters lit with UV lamps to renew with the tradition of medicinal plants. The rest of the place is lit with LEDs, which offers the double advantage of saving energy – 6 watts per square metre, that is, five to ten times less than traditional lighting – and providing softer, less aggressive light than traditional neon lighting. The cosy, relaxing atmosphere is reinforced by the dark grey paint on the walls and ceilings, which also shows up the white lacquered, laser-cut sheet metal for display signs, whose graphics evoke the 1950s. “Our research has revealed the steady progress of a movement in favour of green, environmentally friendly buying places that know how to preserve authenticity”, emphasizes Alfonso Maligno. The Pharmacy 3.0 concept by Alfonso Maligno’s firm is also focused on sound, with a choice of 165 relaxing or lively ambiences, and scents, with two original fragrances – Norway pine and mango – designed by two experts in sensorial marketing, and spread out in the atmosphere of the office with aroma diffusers. This is the end of medicine smell, for sure! Another key element with “Pharmacy 3.0” is the customer experience. Again, the aim is to maximize purchase pleasure, by facilitating strolling and product testing and touching. At the Pharmacie de l’Aquarius, in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, the central island is built around a herbarium of aromatic and medicinal plants, which thus puts the latest cosmetic launches and offers forward, in a mingling of wooden display stands and benches. The island guides customers as they walk towards the shelves standing against the walls and the counter of ethical products. In the end the modest, but newly arranged 80 m2 area now offers a longer linear surface, while avoiding the various displays that used to obtrude both path and sight. Some products are exposed on wooden tables, as can be found in latest generation bookshops. “Horizontal display makes purchasing easier, and creates small universes that are naturally attractive”, says Alfonso Maligno. In addition, Alfonso Maligno’s firm proposes to integrate an area dedicated to brand sales leaders, skincare and personalized tips to the pharmacy. The firm teams have done their best to reduce building costs by designing architectural furniture and accessories, and a lighting system that can be manufactured in batches, or even in series. The total cost thus amounts to around 1,200 euros per m2, apart from wiring and air conditioning. “Pharmacy 3.0 is a project that was built around consumers, with the possibility to make them interact with the product by creating “discovery and testing islands”. It stands out with the alternation of display structures, multifunctional interaction islands, and consultation areas used by chemists to help patient-customers throughout their 360° health and well-being experience,” sums up Salvatore Maligno, the main initiator of the project.  According to the architecture firm, about 15 projects are currently underway."
Informa wants to double the size of China Beauty Expo,"By partnering with British group Informa, Shanghai Baiwen Exhibition, the owner of China Beauty Expo, aims at internationalizing its event.  The two companies announced they will “combine networks and skills with the aim to expand the Shanghai beauty-based portfolio to a pan-Asian audience.” China Beauty Expo - which hosted a total of 1,657 exhibitors and 245,000 visitors in 2013 - comprises three co-located exhibitions: Cosmetics China, dedicated to cosmetics, skincare and fragrances (over 800 exhibitors), Cosmetech, dedicated to the equipment, packaging and ingredients (more than 500 exhibitors) and Beauty Shanghai, dedicated to professional salons and spa products (nearly 300 exhibitors). “Together, ‘Informa-Baiwen’ will offer the beauty business community new solutions in China and Asia, building on Informa’s existing portfolio run globally out of Paris, the world capital city of beauty, and on Baiwen’s strong offering in Shanghai, the epicentre of the beauty industry in Asia,” says David Bondi, COO, Informa Exhibitions Asia.  “Our goal is to transform this show so as it becomes more international and to grow Shanghai as the main hub for beauty professionals in Asia,” he details to Premium Beauty News. As a first consequence of this new partnership, the 2014 edition of China Beauty Expo will feature some key components of the Beyond Beauty tradeshow, which is held annually in Paris.  A new exhibition area - ZOOM Asia - will be created alongside the Beauty Challenger Awards Asia, both of them wit the aim to recognize new beauty brands attempting to expand in the Asian market. According to the latest figures from the China Association of Fragrance Flavor and Cosmetics Industries, cosmetic sales in China maintain an average annual growth rate of 10-20%.  ""Even if the market growth is expected to slow down in the future, it will remain strong as local needs remain strong drivers,"" adds David Bondi. Informa intends to build on this growth to grow China Beauty Expo as the first global event in the cosmetics sector, by doubling its size within the next four or five years."
Online beauty: A disappointing navigation experience?,"In order to generate a sustainable satisfaction and retain users, e-commerce platforms must now provide an intuitive navigation environment and adapt their ergonomics to the needs of visitors, including an easy access to the product ranges that are available online and to the customer service. To measure the quality of the browsing experience, the e-Performance Observatory published by Yuseo is focusing on the consumer’s experience. ""A simultaneous measurement of three dimensions - Access to the Product Offering, Access to the Customer Service and Ordering Process - for each of the tested websites, allows a comparison of the functioning of the main online players,"" explains Jean-Pierre Leborgne, Partner Manager at Yuseo. For the third edition of the e-Performance Observatory dedicated to online beauty retailers, Yuseo has selected a sample of more than 4,500 users that have been asked to browse the sites of the four market leaders in France: Douglas, Marionnaud, Nocibé, and Sephora). The study was conducted in two stages: first a comparison phase during which users were asked to perform the same task on each of the four websites, namely to find a specific product, then a phase called ""Site focus"" in which the websites were tested by 120 participants, different for each site, the participants being asked to perform three identical tasks. The comparison phase has revealed very close scores on several issues, in particular with regard to the product pictures. However, the gap is widening on certain key issues of online merchandising, including the home page clarity, the presentation of the offering and the effectiveness of searching tools. ""The importance of searching tools is well established on the Internet. It is a key component of the flexibility that is expected (or required) by users,"" says Yuseo. ""In this regards, the sector generates a pretty good perception even if two retailers are lagging behind."" With an average rate of success that reaches 50% for the tasks performed by individual users on each site and corresponding to three main dimensions of the online purchase experience (access to the goods, order process, and reinsurance / customer information), the quality of the browsing experience is mitigated. Furthermore, the score appears significantly lower than for the previous edition of the barometer: 60% in 2012. As far as the navigation experience is concerned there are strong differences between the various online retailers as the gap between the first and the last reaches 11 points. According to Yuseo, such a result demonstrates the “persistence of different types of navigation pitfalls depending on the site."" As per the satisfaction index expressed by users in relation to their browsing experience, the average score is 7/10, with a gap of 1.5 points between the first and the last website. In the end, Yuseo explains, ""in a highly competitive environment and with rising expectations from the users perception of these signs was negatively impacted by the browsing experience of users.  "" By entering a little further into the details, one can see that the customers’ main satisfaction criteria are: the large choice of products available, the clarity of presentation of the different product lines and the completeness of the product data sheets. With regard to these criteria, ""Nocibé and Sephora achieve pretty high scores regarding a wide and comprehensive range that meet all expectations. However, as far as the staging of lines, and the content and presentation of product data sheet are concerned, Nocibé clearly stands out of the mass,"" says Yuseo."
Perfume Trends: slowdown in the number of launches in France,"A closer look at the slowdown in the number of launches reveals some changes in the distribution: men’s fragrances are resisting, as their relative part has grown from 14 % of launches in 2012 to 20 %. Women’s fragrances still represent 53 % of launches on the period studied, and “non-positioned” fragrances derived from confidential perfumery are establishing themselves with 27 % of launches. Although trends are now favouring oriental (Aubade) and Chypre fragrances (Si by Giorgio Armani or Acquarosa by Fendi), flowers are still to the fore in the second period of the year: they represent 66 % of floral fragrances out of the 71 women’s fragrances launched (Elle L’Aime by Lolita Lempicka, Modern Muse by Estée Lauder, or Boucheron’s Place Vendôme). Favourites are white flowers such as Neroli, Ylang-Ylang, vanilla and jasmine, which can also be found in soliflores on the niche market. “The attraction to gourmand fragrances is still quite strong”, explains Isabelle Ferrand. “They remain focused on delicious, sweet, reassuring notes to meet consumers’ demand rather than perfumers’”. These reminiscent scents also explain the recurring presence of fruity notes in numerous compositions, especially pear, which can be recognized in Honey by Marc Jacobs, or Flower In The Air by Kenzo. Blackcurrant is also often used. After the fashion and food industries, perfumery is now plunging into the “Black Swan” ambience of the ballet world. This semester, touches of grace, flexibility and mystery are conveyed by olfactory designs for Repetto, or the new Iris Prima by Penhaligon’s, for which Alberto Morillas sought inspiration from the English National Ballet. The strong trend towards woody scents in men’s fragrances is getting confirmed: out of 27 men’s fragrances listed, 74 % belong to the woody category, compared to only 40 % in the first semester. They share the choice for ambery, woody fragrances (with cashmeran, cedramber, ambroxan, ambrocenide…), associated with strong concepts of success, as can be seen with bay leaves in Paco Rabanne’s Invictus. The growing importance of woody scents mirrors the decline of “Fougère” perfumes – 7 % of current launches, compared to 50 % ten years ago. Gourmand notes are also infusing intense flavours into men’s variants (1 Million Intense, Mont Blanc Intense…). Claims for strong, vivid scents driven by Eastern markets should be confirmed, in particular with the “fragrance” versions of Terre d’Hermès by Hermès, and Fahrenheit by Dior, soon to be expected. The powdery softness of iris and the mighty heat of leather are favourite notes in most launches in confidential perfumery. Not that it is still that confidential: with 30 % of launches, niche perfumery is actually visible. Faces are now appearing on marketing campaigns, which are still discreet, but used to focus more on bottle designs. Most fragrances to be launched by the end of the year are “new” (51 %), but leave a large share to variants (19 %), flankers (7 %), limited editions (4 %) and collections (12 %). However, the study mentions a renewal in old recipes. Though there were none in the first quarter of the year, re-releases from long-established perfumeries (Jean Patou relaunched with Joy Forever, Volnay, Oriza Legrand) are making their way back on the market, with a 7 % representation."
British women more cautious about premium beauty spending,"With the GDP growing by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2013, the fastest pace of expansion in just over three years, the threat to see the UK economy sliding into another recession seems now unlikely. However, uncertainty over the direction of the UK economy remains and is putting pressure on premium beauty marketers who have to address contradictory trends. On the one hand, the demand for targeted and niche luxury beauty products is growing and, on the other, most British women are becoming more cautious about how they spend their money on premium beauty products.  “Consumers are seeking bargains and value by shopping around and Christmas discounting is now the norm,” explains consultant and researcher Imogen Matthews, the author of The Premium Beauty Market Report. The British premium beauty markets were valued at just under £2bn (about EUR 2.4 bn) by The Premium Beauty Market Report / NPD Group in 2012. Growth slowed to +5% from +10% in 2011, however the category is still growing faster than the retail trade overall. The “Lipstick Effect” - or maybe the “Nail Varnish Effect” as sales (mass market included) of nail colour cosmetics are expected to overtake that of lip colour cosmetics in value in 2013 - still holds.  Actually, premium make-up was the most resilient category, posting +11% growth in 2012.  Moreover, according to The Premium Beauty Market Report sales of make-up at Christmas are becoming stronger, accounting for 18% of total premium beauty sales in 2012, a 2% point increase on 2011. Within premium make-up, the fastest growing sectors are eyebrow make-up (+41%) and make-up sets +21%.  Nail polishes continue to outperform market growth, at +15%, followed by foundations +14% in 2012. According to The NPD Group, sales of premium fragrances slowed in 2012 to +3.2% in value. Men’s fragrance slightly outperformed women’s at +4% compared to women’s at +2.5%.  Coffrets accounted for a third of all fragrance purchases. However, consumer demand for coffrets is changing in department stores, with a trend towards non-coffrets and discounted lines. In parallel, the niche luxury movement continues to thrive, with 331 launches in 2012 compared to 276 in 2011, according to The Premium Beauty Market Report. Although mainstream brands continue to account for the bulk of volume of fragrances sold, niche brands appeal to consumers demanding something different. Social media is helping niche brands enormously in gaining awareness through blogs, vlogs and forums. “The extent of growth from a number of these brands is encouraging,” comments fragrance expert Michael Edwards. “Certainly, niche brands are affected less by external market forces such as the state of the economy.” Sales of premium skincare grew by +4% in 2012 in the UK according to The Premium Beauty Market Report / NPD Group.  Anti-ageing skincare is the key driver for skincare, with a trend towards results-driven solutions, especially serums. According to Mintel, sales of targeted prestige facial skincare products increased by 9% between 2011 and 2012. “The antithesis of the BB Cream is targeted products, which offer consumers a more tailored, personalised skincare alternative,” comments Imogen Matthews.  “Skin diagnostics are becoming commonplace at point of sale.” The British premium beauty retail landscape has expanded with the arrival of several newcomers such as M&S Your Beauty, Harvey Nichols Beauty Bazaar in Liverpool ONE, Harvey Nichols BeautyMART and Selfridges The Beauty Workshop. “The growing number of premium niche brands now have more opportunities for distribution, especially amongst new retailers and through new retailing concepts,” says Imogen Matthews. Another trend is the rise of in-store services such as brow bars, nail bars, blow-dry bars and treatments, now offered in many beauty retailers. Online beauty sales continue to grow and were valued at £532 million (636 million euros) in 2012 (+13% compared to 2011), by Euromonitor. One in five women buy beauty online, according to YouGov SixthSense, which supplied exclusive research to The Premium Beauty Market Report. Several department stores have launched “click and collect” services, offering consumers increased freedom of choice as to where they purchase products. Dedicated e-tailers have emerged, such has Feelunique, which currently sells 18,000 beauty SKUs. “Online is a powerful alternative for niche brands which cannot afford the merchandising and promotional investment retailers require to be stocked in a physical store,” adds Imogen Matthews.

Marionnaud opens their international showcase on the Champs-Élysées,"Marionnaud belongs to the Hong Kong-based A.S. Watson Group, and owns over 1,100 stores in eleven countries. They are thus one of the leading companies in selective distribution of perfumes and cosmetics in Europe, and can be found in Austria, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovenia and Switzerland. In France, Marionnaud has a network of 535 stores, about 210 of which have been refurbished within the last 18 months. However, the distributor has used a completely unusual, new concept for their store on the Champs-Élysées. According to Marionnaud, tourists represent more than two thirds of the clientele there, among whom a great number come from the Middle East and China. “They want to go home with a French style, luxury souvenir from Paris. They wish to be given emotions and marvel at perfumes, iconic luxury brands and gift boxes”, highlight the brand’s managers. As a real international showcase, this store has thus received particular attention to the only aim of making it a spectacular place.  “We have designed this exceptional store thinking about the variety of its customers and the myth embodied both by Paris and the Champs-Élysées. It is our window to the world, designed by Marionnaud Paris”, underlines William Koeberlé, Managing Director of Groupe Marionnaud. As soon as they step into the store, visitors are plunged into the typical world of Haussmann mansions, as they walk around and rediscover all their codes: the entrance gallery is outlined by the huge, six-meter high art deco-inspired bookcase. The monumental hall is wholly dedicated to perfumes, and offers several hundred different fragrances, including a few special ranges, such as the Armani Privé collection. Theme tables display new launches as well as cult, designer perfumes, olfactory discoveries, etc. The company has also worked in collaboration with the brands to offer products that were specifically developed for foreign customers, such as mini-bottle boxes, gift boxes… The furniture was also designed as a nod to the suite, with the mezzanine, the makeup tables that remind us of dressing tables, the small lounge and the large windows opening onto the beautiful inner courtyard, the monumental stairs coated with a purple metal and ornamented with a pendant chandelier reminiscent of perfume bottles… “We wanted to create a brand new experience, to poetize the moment spent in the store and invite visitors to walk around and discover various universes of beauty”, explain architects Sophie Thuillier and Cristano Benzoni. The mezzanine is completely dedicated to makeup. It was added to the store, which enabled to gain over 100 m2. It also enables to catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the perfumes at the entrance. It comprises a series of makeup tables to recreate the atmosphere of studios and fashion shows in a luxurious decor. Brands’ professional makeup artists offer customers flash makeup sessions and personalized tips. Thanks to digital mirrors, customers can take pictures of themselves and post them on social networks. Marionnaud has also chosen to give priority to services at their store on the Champs-Élysées. The commercial workforce has been doubled, with eighty workers now instead of forty, including sales assistants, checkout assistants, stock team members... There is also a new floor manager who is in charge of skin care, perfumes, makeup and checkout. All in all, about fifteen languages are spoken, and the team was trained in particular to “the specificities of the store and the clientele on the Champs-Élysées, as well as to the art of “luxury attitude”, by learning how to use the right gestures and how to look, listen and pay attention to customers”. Nail, eyebrow and bun bars… they will all be available on a made-to-measure basis or by appointment. Moreover, the store still opens from 10am to 12am every day. Marionnaud has thus chosen not to take into account the obligation to close at 9pm, although its competitor Sephora, on the same sidewalk, had to comply with it. Marionnaud puts forward a house agreement, which was signed in 2001 and reviewed in 2002, with the agreement of trade unions."
Consumers in the US and Europe are spending more on lip colour,"Lip segments in the US prestige beauty [1] industry posted an 11 percent gain, generating $665 million in the 12 months ending August 2013 (September 2012-August 2013). In Europe, the UK gained 8 percent, generating £70 million in prestige lip sales. France held relatively flat during this time, and Italy and Spain experienced small declines. “In the US, lips are keeping in step with the nail color trend this year. Consumers are responding to the new options and innovations in beauty and what better way than with some bold lips that make a statement,” said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group, Inc. “US consumers are clearly willing to invest a little more in products that will deliver the look they want, and it goes beyond just lipstick, carrying over to liner, application tools, and all-in-one lip products. Throughout Europe, sales of lip products are outperforming relative to units sold, especially in lip color, so this is a phenomenon across the pond as well,” added Grant. The average price spent on prestige lip color in the US between September 2012 and August 2013 was $22, a 5 percent increase from the prior year. The average amount spent on lip color across Europe increased slightly as well compared last year. “The success of lip today actually has international appeal. Top brands that are bringing innovation to the lip category vary from makeup artists to legendary cosmetic brands, to top European designer names,” said Grant. “Innovations in lip are winning consumers over with the ability to provide rich color, as well as moisture and high shine - a perfect combination to enhance appearance while providing the benefits women are looking for.”"
Perfumery pumps: towards ultra-segmentation,"MeadWestvaco (MWV) is the company that has gone the farthest in segmenting the market of perfumery pumps.  At the latest edition of Luxe Pack Monaco, MWV showcased ""Emotions of Spray"", a range of six fragrance pumps, each of them having their own and unique spraying characteristics. “We view luxury fragrance much like fashion and beauty - each intended to make the consumer feel confident.  But it’s about more than just feeling good, it’s really about facilitating a transformative state of mind - moving to the sublime through an emotional connection,” said Sandy Gregory, fragrance marketing director, MWV Beauty & Personal Care. The specificities of each pump offer brand owners the opportunity to create a perfect match between the fragrance and the sprayer. The “Emotions of Spray” collection includes a total of six pumps.  The original Melodie pumps, Melodie Agile and Melodie Forever, which are already well known, plus three new sprayers that have distinctive spray characteristics: – Melodie Pure, which provides a perfect and fine atomization, even for water-based formulas, avoiding a wet feeling on the skin,
– Melodie Delicate, with its discreet and elegant spray and small, focused spray that is both soft and quiet.
– Maestro Extravagant, which offers a voluminous spray mist that is refreshing and airy, with a long and sustained spray pattern, providing an exuberant and indulging experience. Such a diversity gives brand owners even more options to tailor the spray to the positioning and personality of the fragrance and heighten the consumer experience. “MWV’s consumer insights revealed an opportunity to enhance that emotional connection through the spray,” adds Sandy Gregory. With its two launches, Aptar explores two different trends. On the one hand sensuality, with the pump Precious, of which a prototype was presented last year, which now adds up to Sensea and expands the supplier’s sensorial range.  Precious offers a voluminous and continuous spray: a light pressure from the finger is enough to activate the spray and let the perfume being diffused gradually and continuously (diffusion time is three times longer for the same amount of perfume) in a delicate mist that envelops the skin.  The mist effect can be achieved thanks to an extremely uniform spray combined with exceptionally fine particles. On the other hand discretion, with La Petite, dedicated to customers looking for a miniaturized technical product, in order to focus on the bottle’s noble forms and materials. Eventually, Albéa’s Panache pump, continues to diversify.  The very pump to control the size and dispersion of droplets and offer a real mist of perfume has participated in about 15 launches already. Beyond perfumes, Panache can be adapted to other formulations (sprays and body, hair care, deodorant) whether they are alcohol or water or oil based.  This Panache Pulse version, which contains no propellant, is a sustainable alternative to aerosols. “With its recognized expertise in the field of spray, Albea is the only supplier of cosmetic packaging to offer this technology for various applications,” highlights the company. Perfumers just have to make a choice."
New growth drivers in the premium beauty world,"The luxury market is still thriving in the globally gloomy economic context: according to the statistics published by Bain & Company, the sector grew by +10 % in 2012. Perfumery and personal care have contributed to this growth, whether in emerging or developed countries. The premium beauty market is booming in Asia as well as in countries on the American continent. Year after year, the “upper premium” beauty sector expands its offer and gets more and more diversified, as can be seen with the rise of the number of face care launches between $200 and $400 by +49 % in 2012 [1]. Desire for top-of-the-range beauty products is now more to the fore than ever, according to Rémy Oughdiri, Manager of the Tendances & Insights Department at IPSOS Public Affairs, and Leïla Rochet-Podvin, President and founder of the Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation agency. The World Luxury Tracking study carried out by IPSOS shows that beauty products buyers give more and more value to the most exclusive items: ingredient scarcity, limited editions, personalized brand-customer relationship… And exclusive rhymes with expensive. This trend is confirmed both on more developed markets (Europe, the United States and Japan) and emerging ones (China, Brazil, Russia). But why are women still ready to spend more when they can easily have access to overabundant, quality products? The main reason why is the ever-growing influence of self-image in our societies. This influence is enhanced by the unprecedented development of filming devices and ways to take and stage pictures, in particular on social networks. Within such a context, tools for people to stage themselves are becoming more and more sophisticated, and a growing number of people spend money on various means to show themselves off to advantage, including beauty products. The economic crisis even puts more pressure on this need in some countries. But beware; it is all about being seen, but not too much! That is the latest tendency: showing but not flaunting oneself, nor being too visible or trying to stand out. Flashiness is no longer in. We still want to be ourselves behind our desire to be seen, with our own style, a style that reflects our personalities. We are still anxious to contribute our bit, yet without being radically different. Then, beyond image lies protection. This is the other powerful luxury cosmetics lever. Protection against the deleterious effects of pollution, protection against ageing effects… The more people care about their health, the more ready they are to indulge in the best products, even the most expensive ones. Paradoxically, expanding offer also arouses suspicion. Counterfeited or poor quality products are often seized in emerging countries, which benefits luxury cosmetics brands. Customers are convinced that buying more expensive means buying safe. The premium beauty sector finds its roots in luxury values that are themselves experiencing a deep change. While still reflecting excellence and refinement, the luxury market is less material and tends to favour experience and values more extensively. If it used to embody social belonging and economic success, it is getting increasingly committed and tends to adopt a more participative approach to development. Its ability to arouse desire comes to a greater extent from thrill-seeking, whether it be exhilarating, uplifting or fulfilling emotions. “We have shifted from an appearance-focused society to one that praises hedonistic beauty and where a mosaic of people value difference”, highlights Leïla Rocher-Podvin. At the same time, ethics – emotions from the heart – has become a key value in our world. Thus for consumers seeking meaning, affinity has become essential. And echoing the values they have adopted has become a necessity. The statutory link with the brand has been substituted by an affinity, more human, even humanist relationship. We no longer buy a product, we subscribe to a brand. Given these findings, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation have presented a prospective segmentation used as the basis upon which to reflect on innovation. The agency encourages brands to add ideas that mirror society and luxury changes to their traditional performance arguments, in particular by reinforcing the brand-customer relationship. It has thus defined four prospective axes: – ArtKeting. Upgrading egos by strenghtening the brand’s creative and cultural values, which will both reinforce affinity and experience and awaken a sense of wonder through the beauty of the creation.
– 4Me. Finding a benefit or an experience that will increase the prestige of personal affinity with the brand, whether it be a service, a promise or a new quality to the product.
– Sentstory. Reinforcing sensorial discovery or the discovery of a new story, and positioning the brand as an « escape brand » that brings hedonistic happiness.
– Xhumaniste. Premium beauty’s main feature is to make consumers feel valued when they buy, and to touch their hearts, provoking affinity. Reinforcing the brand’s strong image as a sacred/human brand, and disclosing its ethics when facing societal challenges. The whole file comprising the cross analysis carried out by IPSOS and Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation was presented as a preview at the Beyond Beauty trade show (September 9 to 11, 2013) as part of a conference entitled “The Irresistible Desire for Premium Beauty”, and is now available from one or the other company: – IPSOS : Rémy Oudghiri, Directeur du département Tendances et Prospective Ipsos Public Affairs, Tel : +33 1 41 98 95 73 ; (E-mail : remy.oudghiri@ipsos.com)

"“Consumer expectations have changed regarding promotional items,"" Virginie Mazelier, Anaïk Beauty","Premium Beauty News - The core business of Anaïk Beauty, are promotional solutions for major cosmetic brands. What changes has this sector experienced in the past years? Virginie Mazelier -  Today I believe that the two main changes in the sector of promotional solutions  are, on the one hand innovation, in terms of products but also services offered to brands, and on the other hand, the integration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) principles into promotional campaigns. Since the inception of the company in 1973, we offer main beauty players around the world, gift solutions in terms of luggage, bags and cases, rigid boxes, jewellery, scented items (cushions, ceramics...) decorative objects and accessories. Adapting to changing consumer expectations, and therefore to brand requirements, has always been our main concern. Premium Beauty News - What are the innovations in this sector, in terms of services? Virginie Mazelier -  Generally speaking, our advisory activity tends to increase. We assist our clients in the structuring and setting up of heir promotional offer. Anaïk Beauty is organized around three core businesses: designers, buyers, and sales people. We create trend books and annual collections that we offer our clients with a customized advisory offer. We have also developed an in-house pre and post consumer tests service, which is an important addition to our product offering. We also carry out studies with our subsidiary Mode & Co, to better understand consumer expectations vis-à-vis promotional gifts. Premium Beauty News - And for products themselves? Virginie Mazelier -  Changes concern both the design and manufacture of products! Responsiveness has become a crucial competitive factor. Methods imported from the fashion world, and which consist in sticking as quickly as possible to the latest trends, and therefore produce and deliver quickly, and then quickly take account of the tastes expressed by consumers in stores (fast fashion) are becoming common practice in the cosmetic world in general and promotional solutions in particular. The first consequence is a trend towards the relocation of production within or close to customer markets. The time required between the design and manufacturing stages has been greatly reduced. And to be fast to market, you must be close to it. This is also what led us to develop Easy-sampling, a solution dematerializing the production of samples and which makes it possible to significantly reduce production time while minimizing the impact on the environment. We also have an express service offer which, combined to Easy-sampling, enables us to design, produce and deliver gifts in less than 3 months. Other factors contribute to this relocation movement with costs first: they have risen sharply in China, and then with the “made in France” or “made in Europe” label that give a true symbolic added value to products. At the core of this phenomenon, there is also a considerable evolution of consumer expectations especially in mature markets like Europe, the U.S. or Japan. With social networks and blogs, communication is much less on a one way brand-to-consumer mode and much more participatory. Consumers want to give their advice and they want to be heard. Taking account of this advice is essential and this can even lead to a process of co-creation and customization. Consumers therefore appreciate they are given the choice of the gift they will receive. And they want to receive it as fast as possible! Premium Beauty News - And regarding CSR? Virginie Mazelier -  Demand for ethics is becoming increasingly important in the design and sourcing process of promotional gifts. It all started with social audits carried out by our clients at our suppliers. The movement gained momentum when, in many countries, listed companies had to communicate on their achievements in terms of CSR. But it also meets a real expectation from consumers who need transparency, who want to know where products come from, how they are made. Today, ethical concerns cover all aspects of sourcing.  They  impact the choice of materials used, or the way to produce them. PET is a plastic which is appreciated because it is recyclable, paper must be certified (FSC among others), textiles are increasingly made from fibres originating from organic crops, or Oeko-Tex certified. But this ethical movement impacts the whole supply chain, it goes from the integration of disabled people in the production line to the quality of maritime carriers, with the Clean Cargo Working Group. For even more sustainability and also because surveys show that it is a true expectation from consumers, during the development of products we are thinking of the possibility of giving a second life to gifts, or the possibility of reprocessing them. In conclusion, the key to success when it comes to promotional solutions is differentiation and customization, while being clean, useful and responsible!"
Beauty packaging: Is relocation the new trend?,"“Made in USA”, “Proudly made in America,” “Rendez-vous en France”, “Origine France Garantie”: brands certifying the origin of manufactured products have mushroomed over the past 10 years, like so many signs of a growing worry, as much on the part of those struck by mass unemployment as of manufacturers threatened by international competition. In France, the so-called “Minister of Industrial Renewal” has launched a software making it possible to calculate the benefits of inshoring. The software is made available, free of charge, to companies through the Invest in France Agency (Agence Française pour les Investissements Internationaux). These initiatives, however, seem insignificant in view of a movement that, for years, has gradually extended on from the technological progress of Asian suppliers.
Today, even products with a very high added value are affected. “A few years ago, few luxury packaging suppliers claimed to have production lines in Asia,” explains Yannick Vermorel, president of Le French Cosmetic Workshop, a company specialized in the supply of “made in France” solutions for cosmetic private label brands. “Today, it’s the opposite that strikes you.” Actually, the increase in quality of Asian beauty packaging suppliers is impressive. Technology transfers from Japan to Korea or from Europe to China have facilitated the dazzling increase in know-how in emerging countries. The impressive growth of the Cosmoprof Asia tradeshow - 2,000 exhibitors and 55,000 visitors in 2012 - demonstrates that Asia is now a key area for the beauty industry.  The de-industrialization movement has reached such levels in Europe and North America that some products and accessories are practically only available in Asia.  “That’s the case, for example of standard makeup boxes and multi-material accessories like brushes,’’ explains Mr. Vermorel. However inshoring no longer seems exactly utopian and several cosmetics players affirm that it is indeed happening.  “The thinking of managers of major brands in Germany or France is that consumers are increasingly aware of the social consequences of their purchasing acts,” says Marie-Laure Viellard, in charge of marketing and communications at Leoplast, an Italian manufacturer of packaging and technical pieces in injected plastic for cosmetics products and a specialist of eco-designed products. Obviously, this concerns, in priority, the ethical segment.  “Certified organic brands in Germany or distributers such as DM are getting more and more questions from consumers on this subject,” adds Ms. Viellard. Aware of the contradiction between calls for environmental friendliness, on the one hand, and supplies in Asia, on the other hand, these brands have updated their guidelines for good practices by imposing that a minimum percentage of packaging products be made in Europe. Quadpack, a group until now exclusively centred on quality packaging sourcing, notably in Korea, has recently acquired the Spanish maker of wood ingredients, Technotraf. For its first manufacturing site, Quadpack chose Europe. Of course this involved guaranteeing that its customers would have access to innovative products of very high quality. But the acquisition can also be explained by “Quadpack’s desire to diversify its supply sources to ethical products: made in Europe from sustainable materials.” But are ethics and generosity enough? Other factors promote the inshoring movement: higher transport costs, delivery schedules that are too long, difficulties coordinating with teams located at a great distance, problems of quality, non-compliance and the risk of knock-offs.  “Asia is synonymous with huge quantities and unpredictable quality,” according to Vermorel. “Reliability and innovation are essential to success and are intimately related to proximity to customers,” thinks Olivier Salaun, CEO of PSB Industries, whose subsidiary Texen, the world’s 4th-ranked supplier of cosmetics and fragrance packaging, has sites in France and the
Americas. Proximity also makes it possible to streamline flow, shorten delivery schedules and thus customer stocks. In addition, the tightening of European regulations, with REACH and the new cosmetics regulations, is not neutral. For Laurence Mulon, an independent consultant, “these texts make it necessary for brands to get new information from their suppliers or even to modify some manufacturing processes, which Asian companies haven’t always anticipated.” But players agree on the fact that the growth, or not, of the phenomenon will necessarily be accompanied by adaptation on the part of European and North American suppliers. This is because costs don’t explain everything, notably in view of the Korean competition that is not necessarily very cheap but which has proven to be very flexible and creative. This is all the more so, as emerging markets are continuing to develop and the technological transfers required to serve these new customers will continue as a result. New factories will thus open in Asia and Latin America, new partnerships with local suppliers will be made and new competitors will gain power. A shift that Abléa has chosen to anticipate. Following the buyout of Rexam Personal Care, the group now has a network of 46 sites in 14 countries and is present in four different trade segments. Albéa is showing itself to be both local and global. And the strategy is certainly well adapted to the new challenges of a world that is more multipolar than ever, provided it serves also to maintain the group’s capacity for innovation, which remains the key to success for all players, whatever their size."
Italy: skincare and fragrances to slowly recover from recession,"Italy has been in recession since mid-2011, and the country’s Gross Domestic Product has fallen sharply since 2007. These factors have impacted consumer spending on both essential and non-essential products, such as fragrances and skincare products. As far as skin care products are concerned, the decline, however, is likely to be minimal at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of -0.1% by value up to 2017. Growth by volume is expected to be slightly positive and forecasted at a CAGR of 0.6% for the same time period. Skincare will continue to remain the largest sector in the health and beauty industry in Italy up to 2017, according to Canadean [1]. However, it is forecasted to rank only eighth for growth among the nine other categories in the sector studied during that period. Slow economic recovery and reduced consumer spending is expected to put pressure on value growth for all major categories in the sector. Facial care, the largest category both by value and volume share in 2012, is expected to witness a volume CAGR of 0.6%, but a slight negative value growth at a CAGR -0.1% up to 2017. The category is expected to maintain its stronghold over the market despite a decline in value. Depilatories, with only a modest contribution of 6.2% both by value and volume in 2012, is expected to be the fastest growing category by volume with a projected CAGR of 0.8% up to 2017. The rest of the skincare market is split between body care, make-up remover and hand care, with the latter forecast to witness stagnant value growth and a small volume CAGR of 0.7% up to 2017. Concerning the Italian fragrance sector, Canadean forecasts the market to grow by a volume Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of just 1.4% during 2012-2017, while value growth is forecast to be even lower, at just 0.8%. Although it is the largest category with over 60% of the sector, the female fragrances category is projected to show the slowest growth. The category will just meet average growth with a value CAGR at 0.7% and a volume CAGR of 1.4%. Male fragrances are expected to perform slightly better in both value and volume terms, with CAGRs of 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. The category commanded just above a 38% share in both volume and value terms in 2012. Unisex fragrances will be the best performing category, although possessing a much lower market share, with 1.5% for both value and volume in 2012. Growth in this category is projected to be just slightly above sector levels, with value and volume CAGR at 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively."
MakeUp in New York 2013: +50%,"All of them were really unanimous! The third edition of MakeUp in New York can boast of winning the votes of all participants, both exhibitors and visitors. First observation: the growth in the number of exhibitors was followed by a corresponding increase in the number of visitors, +50 % in both cases.  According to the organizers’ records, as of September 26 at 06.00 pm 1520 people attended the annual event of the makeup industry in North America: a figure well above the initial estimates of the organizers. ""However, once again it is not the number that has been most noticed, but the quality of the visitors. This has been a constant since the beginning of the event, just three years ago,"" observed the organizers, who also considered that ""the charm of the event not only continues to operate but is growing, such as its Parisian sister-event is doing."" Actually, the same ingredients seem to create the same winning recipe. Apparently, the North American beauty industry also bet on it. Thus, the Cosmetic Industry Buyers and Suppliers Association (CIBS) had wanted to organize one of its major annual evenings jointly with MakeUp in New York.  The result, according to the association’s President, a record number of participants, exceeding 500 people. The third edition of MakeUp in New York was also marked by a great interest in the ten conferences and half a dozen makeup animations that punctuated the two-day event. The conference room was almost always full from one session to another and the exhibitors’ booths were particularly lively, especially during the first day. Among the various novelties presented on this occasion, let’s mention the lipstick cases with magnetic caps developed by Axilone (Iléos group) for MAC and Armani, and the case developed for Marie Claire, with an opening device system on the top and a transparent background on the bottom to see the product’s shade. The Canadian company Crystal International presented, a series of double-chamber packs that not only allows to separate two components prior to their distribution, but also to mix them by varying the dose of each formula, a pack that is ideal for makeup bases and foundations. The German company Weckerle launched a surprising squared lipstick. And Livcer, a French specialist of thermoformed samples and unit doses, has showcased Touch Kiss, a new sample for lipsticks that can be used without a support card. The event also hosted an exposition of historic lipstick packaging designs, organised by expert collector Jean-Marie Martin-Hattenberg and Anne Camilli. ""Information, new products, exchanges, everything came together to contribute to the success of this third edition, the goal of which was to become THE main event in North America for the make-up industry,"" said the organizers.  It seem clear that the goal was reached and the organisers already announce an even stronger 2014 edition."
"Intimacy, ingredients and globalization: the new face of perfumery","Premium Beauty News - In recent years, a strong trend has driven the growth of a demanding perfumery, which has been attracting perfume addicts, tired of big launches, and looking for exception and rarity. What is the impact of this trend on the market? Armand de Villoutreys - We can observe an undeniable need for more intimate and personalized perfumes.  The so-called ""niche"" perfumes enjoy high growth rates, but figures start from very low. For the moment, in terms of volume and market share, niche perfumery is - one might say ""by definition"" - marginal. Especially because it still has to cope with strong distribution issues. In addition, the boundaries of this perfume category are now even more difficult to drawn since traditional brands have responded to niche brands by developing their own elitist strategy. They have launched their own intimate lines with market codes similar to those of small brands: standard bottles, highlight on the main ingredients and notes, restricted number of point of sales. Today, this market is very crowded. To succeed brands must redouble differentiation efforts and have a very strong concept.  For instance, a brand like Le Labo, has been successful in change the relation to perfumes by inviting consumers to smell their ingredients.  Frederic Malle’s idea - to create a publishing house for perfumes and to highlight their creators - is also truly remarkable. We can also mention Jo Malone’s combinations, or By Kilian’s hyper luxury, without forgetting Diptyque who pioneered the segment and has celebrated its 50th anniversary. But these niche brands have also demonstrated that a perfumery deeply rooted in the ingredients appeals to many consumers.  More figurative than conceptual, these brands give value to raw materials, focus their creativity in the concentrate, rather than in the bottle or advertising.  They helped restoring the quality of the concentrate, in which they invest a lot, and obviously it is something that we warmly welcome.  Actually, I do think too many savings have been made at this level. For many years, we have faced briefs setting tight prices for concentrates, even though it coincided with a sharp rise in raw materials prices. Premium Beauty News - More generally, the rhythm of major launches is apparently slowing down? Armand de Villoutreys - Yes the number slightly slowed down and I personally consider it a good thing. We had reached a kind of craze that created a strong pressure on the brands’ budgets.  The success of those who have slowed the pace, implementing the ""fewer but bigger” principle, showed that another way is possible. However, we must immediately temperate this observation because there are always so many flankers.  Furthermore, if there is a real slowdown in the prestige segment, it is less marked for masstige and mass. Simultaneously, the market share of the luxury perfumes has been steadily declining globally due to the rise of emerging countries, including Brazil, which are rather masstige or mass. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how is the global market evolving? Armand de Villoutreys -  First of all, the global market was transformed by the explosion of the huge Brazilian market. After taking first place in volume a few years ago, the Brazilian fragrance market has recently overcome the United States first in value. Also worth to note is the dynamism of the Middle Eastern market that represents a total of about 300 million consumers who are heavy perfume buyers. Besides, this market also has a great influence on the whole Muslim world, including countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, for example. In contrast, Asia - i.e. mainly China, Japan, and Korea - is not significantly taking off. As far as our organization is concerned, we opened creative centres dedicated to fine fragrances in Sao Paulo and Dubai.  We now have four of these units: in Paris, New York, Sao Paulo and Dubai.  We formulate locally, in direct contact with the local population. Finally, it should be noted that if our markets are highly globalized, it is also the case of our supplies.  Today our ingredients are sourced from around the world, with a growing weight of central India.  So far, we have eleven factories, nine of which are located in emerging markets."
Beauteam to launch MakeUp in Seoul in March 2014,"Recently interviewed by Premium Beauty News, Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, co-founders of Beauteam, had made no secret on the fact that this project was taking shape very quickly.  “Faster than expected”, they even admitted a few days ago, “given the success of both the editions in Paris and New York, it was logical for us to question ourselves on the opportunity of creating in Asia a similar concept.” Not that simple, however, to select the country and especially the city that would enable to recreate successfully this winning combination that calls for a few key ingredients: An upscale and friendly venue in the centre of a capital city close to main local make-up brands; a country where make-up is an integral part of consumers’ daily lives and where a subcontracting industry acts as a real economic force. Why faster than expected?  “Simply, Beauteam officials explain, because our industrial partners exhibiting in Paris and in New York, whether they are European, American or Korean, advised us to continue the adventure as of next year in Seoul.”  Good spots to exhibit in Asia are not that many: Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore?  As for the date? Not easy either! Simply enough, the success also lies in the proper choice of a date relative to other global events in the beauty industry, but also in the proper choice of the season.... Mid March seemed to be the perfect time. “The more we focused on the project”, explain the organizers, the more Korea seemed to be the perfect match. ”  A country where, as everyone knows, the “make-up culture” is particularly strong. The Korean cosmetics market is very polarized since about 65% of sales are shared by two product categories: facial (49%) and make-up (16%). [1]  “During the recent period, explained Richard Cymberg, in an article published on the blog of French Foreign Trade Advisors in Koera, the cosmetics market has been very dynamic, boosted by the increased purchasing power of households, the dynamism of department stores and the emergence of new distribution channels: the ’brand shops’, drugstores and the internet.” According to UbiFrance, South Korea is the third market in Asia-Pacific for cosmetic products.  “Korean women, but also Korean men, are highly aware of the personal appearance.  The market is characterized by a high consumption rate from consumers requiring cosmetic products of high quality and immediate effect in a beautiful packaging,” said the French foreign trade office. “Given the plethora of cosmetic brands in the Asian region and particularly in Korea, it seemed natural for a strong outsourcing industry to emerge and flourish in this country in recent years, ” said Jean-Yves Bouregois, Beauteam co-founder. A well established industry whose structure and messages, which have set the bar very high, in terms of quality, sophistication and environmental standards, clearly reflect its weight in the economic circuit and the challenges imposed by a highly demanding sector in terms of innovations. “A number of manufacturers were clever enough to seize this opportunity and take the lead in R&D and manufacturing capabilities,” he added. “So Seoul will be the place! A capital city with a winning combination! A two-hour flight from Shanghai and Tokyo,” concluded the organisers."
Nail polishes take the British make-up market by storm,"For the first time in 2012, the value of the UK nail colour cosmetics market equalled that of lip colour cosmetics.  According to a new research from Mintel [1], both segments posted a market value of £229 million respectively (about 271 euros at current rate). “While in 2011, the nail colour cosmetic market value stood at £221 million, compared to £224 million for lip colour cosmetics - continued growth in both categories has boosted the sector - but an increased passion for nail colour in the UK has ensured the nail market has clawed its way to level pegging,” explains the market research firm. What is more, the nail colour cosmetics sector is expected to carry on growing in 2013! It should therefore overtake the lip segment by the end of this year to reach an estimated £233 million (vs £232 million for the lip colour cosmetics market). This surge is also reflected in product innovation, with a record number of new nail colour products entering the market in 2012, up 400% compared to 2008. And the trend looks set to continue in 2013. “While new nail colour product launches accounted for 10% out of total new launches in the colour cosmetics category in 2008, the percentage shot up to 26% in 2012. This year (January to August 2013) they accounted for 27%, leading new development in the colour cosmetics category (this compares to 26% of lip colour cosmetics and with 23% of eye colour cosmetics),” says Mintel. The fact that the nail colour cosmetics market has equalled that of the lip colour market for the first time in the UK highlights the growing popularity of nail polish in most advanced cosmetic markets.  In France, for instance, the “nail polish mania” is affecting an increasing number of buyers (20% of French women), and with increasing quantities (2.4 units per buyer). “Nail art continues to be a driving factor in sales. An explosion of new textures and effects is emerging which allows young women in particular to easily personalise their nail look. Nail make-up is also relatively purse-friendly, offering a range of affordable options and results that do not need daily application, cementing its position as a go-to sector for all consumer budgets,” says Charlotte Libby, Household and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Figures are self-explanatory.  According to Mintel, nail polish is used by 59% of women in the UK, with usage peaking among young women, standing at 72% of 16-24-year-olds - compared to less than half (48%) of over-65s. In contrast, just 7% of British women use false nails. Concerning the overall colour cosmetics market in the UK, Mintel estimates sales to reach nearly £1.5 billion in 2013, an annual growth of 2% from 2012. The outlook for the next five years is positive too, with a growth expected at a more rapid pace, to reach £1.9 billion in 2018 (about 2.25 billion euros, at current rate). In terms of trends, the most popular new product claims in 2013 are colour cosmetics with long-lasting features (45% of total new product introductions in the colour cosmetics category to date in the UK). According to Mintel, the claim is most prominent in face (55%) and eye (52%) make-up, with 55% of products launched in the face make-up category and 52%. Brightening and illuminating claims (41%) follow. Mintel’s research also highlights that senior consumers are becoming a key demographic and a commercial opportunity for the makeup sector. Up to 36% of 55-64 year-old British women and almost two in ten (17%) of women aged over 65 say that wearing make-up makes them feel more professional. Furthermore, 69% of 55-64 year-olds and 54% of women aged over 65 agree that it makes them feel more confident. But it seems that while some British women are committed to make up, the same cannot be said for their cleansing routine. Today, some 21% of women don’t always take off their make-up before going to sleep, with up to 27% of those aged 25-34 doing so."
"“The olfactory sense is proving its true worth” Cécile Zarokian, perfumer ","Premium Beauty News - A first fragrance emerged when you were still learning your trade at Robertet, then shortly after you created your own company, with some twenty fragrances signed in two years. You haven’t lost much time, have you! Cécile Zarokian - It was now or never to get started. I did not want to wait too long and then not dare take the risk. And finally everything worked out fine. From the time my company was created, I engaged myself in an art project with the illustrator Matthieu Appriou. The project resulted in an exhibition in Paris in September 2011, which was part of the program “Rives de la Beauté”. The idea was to combine six perfumes with six illustrations, and establish a dialogue between the two universes, each giving birth to the other. Alternatively, the brush stroke followed the olfactory narration, or in turn the nose was guided by the brush. This enabled me to show what I could achieve aside from a customer’s specific request or business constraints. The exhibition is now going to take place in London this fall. [1] In parallel, I won some projects and signed several fragrances. The creation of Epic Woman enabled me to meet Francois Hénin, the President of Jovoy, who distributes the brand in his outlet. This meeting resulted in the creation of two fragrances for Jovoy Paris, the eau de parfum Private Label and the scented candle Ambre 1er. Creations then followed one another with two home fragrances and two scented candles for the waxmaker Perron Rigot: Carnet De Voyages and Soirée Câline. Then there was the eau de parfum Pink, a 100% natural composition for the brand Undergreen, some more candles, the perfume Mon Nom Est Rouge for Majda Bekkali, and recently, the three perfumes Vy Roza, Djélem and Albho for the Suléko brand. I also created the candles for the Château de Versailles. Premium Beauty News - Customers mostly come from the so-called niche perfumery sector. Cécile Zarokian - Yes, it is more a matter of choice. If I became an independent perfumer and created my own laboratory in the process, it was to be able to continue my work freely. From this point of view, working with smaller brands is very different. If they often have a smaller budget, they do not have the same constraints and when they turn to an independent perfumer, it is because they rely a lot on the fragrance. The creative work thus becomes both more interesting and is carried out in close collaboration. Premium Beauty News - An independent perfumer’s way of working is very different from that of a large fragrance house? Cécile Zarokian - We do not exactly address the same needs nor do we exactly offer the same services, we generally don’t operate on the same markets. Customers who come to me know that I love working on original projects, sometimes out of step with the conventional spirit of the fragrance industry, from visuals, emotions, colours, fabrics, sounds, while sticking to the brand’s universe. I am not systematically given olfactory directions, and enjoy a lot of creative freedom. And then there is also a direct relationship with the customer throughout the development process. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the evolution of the market of niche perfumery, referred to as exceptional and creative? Cécile Zarokian - In this segment too, launches have increased. On the one hand, this helps stimulate demand and the market is expanding, but on the other hand, one might ask whether the market is not already saturated. In the end, profitability is not always easy to reach and many brands do not rely solely on their perfumes to make a business. The positive side is that the olfactory sense is proving its true worth The power of scent has long been underestimated, but nowadays a lot of brands seem to discover the power of olfactory marketing, its impact on sales. We can see in the ready-to-wear world, brands like Abercrombie & Fitch or Zadig & Voltaire give a real olfactory identity to their outlets. On this market, which is also becoming very competitive, I think it is important to take the time to give a “soul"" to perfumes, it must be sufficiently differentiating to be recognizable by consumers, but not too much in order to not deter most customers. Originality is important, but it must be used appropriately. Premium Beauty News - Doesn’t this frenzy of launches, all segments included, facilitate the development of full service? Cécile Zarokian - This is an underlying trend of the market. More and more companies are offering turn key products. Depending of their customers’ request they can rely on a catalogue of perfumes or turn to a perfumer. In some cases, the customer may also express his desire to work with a specific perfumer. But of course this is only interesting when one wishes to engage in a genuine process of olfactory creation. Premium Beauty News - The strengthening of regulatory constraints also plays a role in these changes? Cécile Zarokian - Certainly. A small brand will need to rely on a growing number of experts. In such conditions, it is sometimes more effective to delegate a large part of the process to a company which already has a critical mass to withstand the costs involved. But as far as olfactory creation is concerned, the weight of regulatory constraints must not be exaggerated. I belong to a generation who has always worked in this context, and that does not preclude creativity. Sometimes it is also more the brands’ specifications that generate real difficulties than purely legal obligations. In my projects, I have never had any difficulties with IFRA standards. Conversely, when I developed Pink, a 100% natural composition for the Undergreen brand, we had to undertake a huge amount of research work on ingredients, to manage in the end, to create a complex and subtle fragrance in spite of a limited palette. And the biggest achievement of the project lies in the fact that this constraint is not reflected in the final result! In fact, the problem arises mostly for already marketed fragrances. If the regulatory changes include the requirement to reformulate a large part of what is already on the marketplace, costs will be astronomical and not bearable for small structures, not to mention the loss of our olfactory heritage."
A summary of the summer news,"Concerning the markets, The NPD Group highlights the impact of SPF on sales of prestige colour and skincare products in the United States.  Also regarding the USA, Mintel focuses on the importance of BB creams on the growth of colour products. As far as Europe is concerned, Canadean puts under the spotlight the contrasted evolution of men’s and women’s fragrances in Germany, the forecast growth of the skincare market in The Netherlands, as well as in Sweden.  Regarding the French market, The NPD Group points out the resilience of makeup sales while sales of overall prestige cosmetic products are decreasing, a situation contrasting with the dazzling sales of the British market. Eventually, according to Canadean, budget-conscious Australian consumers favour bulk deals and offers. Among the innovations and new products showcased during the summer, Premium Beauty News wrote about Lindal’s new actuator, which aims at eliminating the need for overcap on aerosols and the new mascara applicator launched by Avon, as well as Unilver’s choice to turn to crowdsourcing for trying to lower the environmental impact of our shower practices. Some other launches are featured in our “Summer 2013” gallery. On per ingredients, we can note the new range of natural exfoliants by Worlee Cosmetics and the development of new broad-spectrum UV filters inspired by corals and the way they protect from the sun. Also to be noted the acquisition by Lucas Meyer of new range of a new portfolio of botanical cosmetic ingredients. Companies news in Europe were marked by the some major shifts among the suppliers of nail polishes, in particular with the acquisition of Chromavis by Fareva and the one of Dropnail by Intercos.  Still on the supply side, let’s note the strengthening by Ateliers Dinand of their business in North America and the entry of Geka in Brazil. As far as brands are concerned, let’s mention among the several shifts that occurred during the summer, the acquisition of China’s Majic Holdings by L’Oréal and the one of The Colomer Group by Revlon. Eventually, on the retail side, the major event of the summer is probably the acquisition of Saks by the Hudson’s Bay Company.  To be noted also, the bet of Target regarding online retailing."
Germany: Female fragrances to grow slower than the market,"With a value CAGR of 0.9% between 2012 and 2017, the female fragrance category is only the seventh fastest growing out of the nine German Health & Beauty sectors monitored by market research firm Canadean. “German consumers are very price conscious despite having the strongest economy in Europe; German consumers perceive fragrances to be a luxury item, rather than an everyday product, and they are therefore careful when choosing their favoured product,” says the firm. Female fragrances held the largest share of the fragrance sector in 2012, with value and volume shares of 54.8% and 54.2% respectively. However, according to Canadean, the category will also display the slowest growth over the next five years at a value CAGR of 0.7% and volume CAGR of 1.3% to 2017; below the sector average for both measurements. In contrast, both male and unisex fragrance categories will grow at a value CAGR of 1.1% between 2012 and 2017, with male just growing ahead of unisex fragrances in terms of volume, at CAGRs of 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively."
Hudson’s Bay to acquire Saks,"Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) and Saks Incorporated have announced their merger at the end of July.  The takeover of all Saks share by HBC has been approved by each company’s board of directors and is expected to close before the end of the calendar year. This transaction will bring together three of the retail industry’s most iconic brands in North America - Hudson’s Bay, Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue.  The combined company will operate 320 stores, including 179 full-line department stores, throughout the U.S. and Canada, along with three e-commerce sites. HBC said it will continue to build upon Saks’ market-leading position and identity as a luxury retailer.  Hence, Saks will operate separately under the HBC umbrella, including its own merchandising, marketing and store operations teams, and will remain headquartered in New York City. It is also expected that Saks will continue to be led by key members of its existing management team. “This exciting portfolio of three iconic brands creates one of North America’s premier fashion retailers,” stated Richard Baker, HBC’s Chairman and CEO.  “This acquisition will increase our growth potential both in the U.S. and Canada, generate significant efficiencies of scale, add to our powerful real estate portfolio.” In particular, HBC intends to introduce Saks into Canada and to build upon saks.com on the international market. The combination will maximize existing e-commerce platforms across all three banners."
SPF claims boost sales of prestige skincare and makeup in the US,"Sales of makeup and skincare with a SPF reached 1.1 billion US dollars in US prestige department stores from June 2012 to May 2013, reports The NPD Group.  The market research firm notes it corresponds to a 24 percent increase from three years ago. “Whether it is health concerns, or a more superficial fear of looking older, the intensified focus on sun protection from the beauty and health care industries is having a real impact on consumers, and the market,” says Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. According to The NPD Group, most of the current growth in products with SPF continues to come from skincare, where dollar sales have consistently increased by double-digits over the past three years. Overall, dollar sales of makeup with SPF saw a boost in the 12 months ending May 2012 (June 2011 - May 2012). In makeup and skincare, products with SPF 15 remain the largest segment in sun protection with more than half of dollar sales. Growth of makeup options in the SPF 15 segment were driven by a 6 percent higher average selling price compared to last year, but it was options which offered slightly higher levels of sun protection, SPF 20 and 25, that saw double-digit increases based heavily on an increase in units sold. When it came to skincare, the majority of the growth occurred where the SPF was greater than 20. In particular, SPF 30, the second largest SPF segment in skincare at 13 percent of sales, grew significantly in the past 12 months ending May 2013. Sun protection products at the highest SPF levels of SPF 50 grew 24 percent from June 2012 to May 2013 and now account for almost one third of all in sun sales. “It’s been said that ‘a good sunscreen is the best anti-aging product you can get’, and not only are consumers buying more products with SPF they are spending a little more on them to get that higher SPF number for better protection,” adds Karen Grant. Also, it is important to note that products claiming to protect the skin against sunburns are classified as OTC drugs in the USA."
France: Sales down for prestige cosmetic brands but makeup resists,"Sales of beauty products in the selective channel in France (products sold in department stores and specialty chains perfume brands) continued to decrease in the first half of 2013, in the wake of the downward trend recorded in 2012. According to The NPD Group, sales of fragrances and cosmetics perfumes have declined by 1.5% in value in 2013 compared to the first half of 2012. Among the three main segments only makeup resisted (+0.2%), while fragrances dropped by 1.7% (-1.0% for women’s fragrances and -2.8% for women’s fragrances) and skin care products dropped by 2.3%. Compared to other European countries, the market in France is now very close to the Spanish one, which is declining by 1.7%, but is better than in Italy (-3.4%). In contrast, sales in the UK remain dynamic with an increase of 5.9%. “For the first half of 2013, makeup for the eyes clearly stand out from the mass with its dynamism, on the contrary, last year the nail segment was the most dynamic,” says Mathilde Puszka, Beauty Analyst at The NPD Group.  However, it is important to note that the NPD Group’s figures only cover nail varnishes that are sold by prestige brands (Dior, Chanel, Estee Lauder, etc..) and do not take into consideration varnish products sold exclusively in certain chains or department stores, or retailers’ private label brands. The NPD Group figures also show that, beyond makeup ""classics"" such as mascara, sales growth actually concerns all types of eye makeup products such as eye shadows and even smaller segments such as eyebrow pencils and eyeliners. These figures seem to confirm the trend towards accentuated eye makeup seen in the United States, which has been emerging in Europe since 2012. In the first half of 2013, the eye makeup segment was also the makeup segment showing the fastest growth rates in the UK, Spain and Italy."
Beyond Beauty Paris intends to be more than ever a springboard for emerging brands,"Premium Beauty News - What does the coming edition look like? Pradip Bala -  Out of the 480 exhibitors, more than 50% of the offer will be renewed: quite enough to surprise visitors! In 2013, the exhibition will host more than twenty U.S. companies and new Japanese and Korean brands, but also brands from South Africa particularly in the Cosmeeting Color area. For many international companies, Beyond Beauty is an important communication platform regarded as an essential step in a strategy of export development. Premium Beauty News - The discovery of small emerging brands has always been one of Cosmeeting’s strength? What does the coming edition of the Zoom look like? Pradip Bala - It’s going to be particularly rich in innovation! This year the number of “Zoomers” is up by 38%. The discovery of small emerging brands is one of the strengths of Cosmeeting, especially this year with the creation of prizes for each category (perfume, skincare, make-up ...) for the Beauty Challenger Awards. The Zoom area is a springboard for small brands with a promising future, setting foot on the cosmetics market. The year 2013 will present brands dedicated to women, whether they are pregnant, smokers or active; but men will not be left out... Premium Beauty News - Precisely, this year the theme of the BBLab, the innovation area of the show will be on men’s cosmetics. Can you tell us more? Pradip Bala - The BBLab, a true area of reflection on the major issues and challenges in cosmetics, will focus this year on masculine beauty. To paraphrase a popular image: man is not a woman like the others! Product offers and dedicated sales area are not always in line with the real expectations of men in terms of beauty. However, the strongest growth, all categories of cosmetics included, remains the “men’s segment” with an important potential for development, especially in emerging countries. That’s why, this year the BBLab will offer beauty professionals, the opportunity to enter – the men’s much expected – complex but fascinating world of cosmetics. Marine and mineral ingredients will also be highlighted in this area. The BBLab will gather 12 companies, 11 cosmetic brands for men, who will dress the shelves of the future, two research firms, Mintel and Information & Inspiration, a Make Up animation for Men organized by Toupie Make Up and the promotion of exhibitors on the Green path of the show, with a sustainable approach. This area was staged by the architect Alfonso Maligno, a specialist in the design of pharmacies and spas of exception. Premium Beauty News - What will be the other highlights of the 2013 edition? Pradip Bala -  First, the launch of the Perfume Zone, an area dedicated to the perfume world from its composition to its bottling, to perfumes ready to be marketed; this area presents the crafts of perfumery, the whole of it relayed in the conference room with two round tables.

Pradip Bala - The general economic situation is difficult in the whole euro zone. But the cosmetic sector, which is important in France, is resisting well, both with regards to exports sales but also domestic consumption, especially in differentiating segments and thanks to innovation. The French market is evolving, with in particular the development of independent retailers offering either more selective brands or lesser known brands with a unique positioning. It is the return of independent perfumery, which was almost condemned to disappear in France! This phenomenon, combined with the growth of e-business is a source of new opportunities for emerging brands."
Sainsbury’s to launch private label make-up brand in September,"Sainsbury’s recently introduced its new own-brand cosmetics range ‘Boutique’ and the relaunch of its skincare range ‘Skin Therapy’ to British press and bloggers. Both lines will be available in-store in September. “Boutique is set to transform the way women shop for their make-up bag essentials. From nail polishes, lipsticks, lip gloss, eyeshadows to accessories, Boutique has been created, trialled and rigorously tested by a collective of professional make-up artists,” the retailers says. Actually, Sainsbury’s approached Jo Saville and Sophia Price in early 2011.  The two established make-up artists have helped the retailer create a collection of colours that marries high pigmentation, easy application and brilliant staying power. Boutique shades feature fun, tongue-in-cheek names such as “Grass Is Always Greener”, “Tickled Pink” and “Cat Got The Cream”.  However, the collection focuses on classic shades. Sainsbury’s claims to have challenged its brand with the highest quality standards.  As a result: “blind product testing was carried out by 58 industry professionals, and the outcome resulted in over 90% of the beauty panel recommending Boutique.” The Boutique that will be launched in September 2013 at Sainsbury’s includes: – Boutique Nail Polish: Available in 16 shades including “Tickled Pink”, “Caught Red Handed” and “As Good as Gold”,
– Boutique Lipsticks: Available in 11 shades including “Rest on your Corals”, “Paint the Town Red” and “In the Buff”
– Boutique Eyeshadow: Available in 10 shades including “Grass is Greener”, “In the Limelight” and “Long Time No See”
– Boutique Lip Gloss: Available in 9 shades including “Lip Lip Hooray”"
Seen at CosmeTech and Cosme Tokyo,"With exhibitors coming from 15 different countries, mostly from Asia, and a range of products and services covering the entire sector (from ingredients to finish products), there was no shortage in surprises at Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo. Several brands were showcasing products with ingredients derived from traditional Japanese products. The Marubishi Soap Company, for instance, has launched a soap containing luxurious sake made from 100% rice alcohol and produced by a long-established sake brewery in Kobe. “Sake is rich in amino acid, which makes the skin smoother and whiter,” claims the company. As for the skincare line launched by Jozen Mizunogotoshi, a famous sake brand, it uses rice-alcohol fermentation technology to produce its main moisturizing ingredient. Similarly, Citrus Juno Ltd. has launched Yutsuki, a moisturising cream rich in essential oil of Japan-grown yuzu (a Japanese fruit from the citrus family). Korean suppliers and brands formed the main overseas participation at Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo, with several innovative, or simply original, products. In order to address the micro-needling skin stimulation trend, DTS MG offers a series of applicators with a dual mechanism that enhances product penetration and stimulates collagen production. Dermal L&H is using a double fermentation method that has been developed in Korea to produce the ingredients of its newly anti-aging line: Cóem. To be noted also, the success of snail mucus, a substance well known for its healing properties, among Korean brands such as instance Callicos (Hongwon Costech Co. group), with its Ultra Snail Series, or Elishacoy’s Skin Repairing Snail Cream. Other innovations of high interest, the new products showcased by Korean brands Beyon and Belif (LG Household & Health Care group). Belif is an apothecary brand proposing products conceived from the herbal recipes and philosophy of Duncan Napier, a botanist and herbalist who opened its first herbal shop and clinic in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1860.  Beyond is natural cosmetic brands targeting teenagers and young adults. As far as packaging was concerned, the offer was less diversified, probably because most of the Japanese leading suppliers were not participating, but the average quality was quite high. In particular, Honda Plus has showcased a wide and colourful range of packaging with an impressive variety of forms illustrating its know-how and creativity in terms of plastic injection. Katani Sangyo also demonstrated the high precision and quality of its metal leaves for the decoration of plastic boxes. Korean company S&P World has showcased a wide range of applicators for make-up and skin care, including some notable innovations. Regarding ingredients several innovative products were showcased. Est Pro, for instance, launched Silk Fibroin, a silk-derived substance that can replace surface-active agents. Or also Bloom Classic Co. that developed ranges based on organic certified seaweeds. Also not finally, the hyaluronic acid and micro-needles combined offer by Cosmed Pharmaceutical Co."
Make-up: Kiko takes advantage of the crisis and of the craze for nail polish,"The makeup is not spared by the reduction of French households’ spending in the health and beauty sector. However, according to Kantar Worldpanel, this category emerges unscathed as far as volumes are concerned, and the number of units purchased should increase this year. Thus, French consumers will purchase an average of 4.5 units of make-up products during the year. Among the categories that have the wind in their sails, nail polish enjoy the benefits of a real ""craze"", with an increasing number of buyers, 20% of French, and increasing quantities (2.4 units per buyer). As far as brands are concerned, the strongest contributors to the nail polish market growth are Yves Rocher, Leclerc, Sephora, Carrefour and System U.   In terms of retailers, and in terms of brands: Yves Rocher, L’Oreal Paris, Rimmel and Kiko. According to Kantar Worldpanel, Kiko is the brand that has the greatest impact on the French make-up market. Created in Italy in 2005, it still has a low notoriety as only 18% of French women who purchase beauty care products declare knowing it.  However, Kiko already has the highest purchase frequency in the makeup category, with an average 3.9 units purchased. It is the brand ""that generates the most additional volumes in the makeup market this year."" While it develops, of course, to the depends of some of its competitors, it is above all, according to Kantar Worldpanel, ""a great growth driver for the market."" In France, Kiko has captured 2% of the whole market, but already 11% of consumers aged between 15 and 24, and now equals the Sephora brand (in volume) in the make-up basket of the 15-24.  Furthermore, Kiko has achieved this score mainly in the nail varnishes segment, where are concentrated its breath taking offers. However, its sales of lips and face and makeup, or of facial and body care products could also increase. Kiko’s first advantage is definitely the attractiveness resulting from its low prices. Indeed, Kiko is one of the cheapest brands in the market, and in a period troubled by lower purchasing power, it could also attract older women. The brand has another advantage: its distribution network. Its products are available only in its own stores: around 75 outlets in France to date. Kiko thus enjoys the benefit of a huge growth potential linked to the possibility to open new stores."
Show report: Cosme Tech & Cosme Tokyo 2013,"With a rise of 60% in the number of exhibitors for its second edition, compared to 2012, Cosme Tokyo has grown as one of the major events in the cosmetics industry in Japan.  The show even became much more international, with a significant Korean pavilion participating for the first time. “The Korean participation is important for the show, as Japan and Korea are the most influent trendsetters for the cosmetics sector in Asia,” explains Hajime Suzuki, Director, Group VP, International Sales & Marketing Division, at Reed Exhibitions Japan Ltd. As far as Cosme Tech - the section dedicated to suppliers - was concerned, the number of exhibitors was also on the rise with a wide array of packaging and ingredients suppliers, as well as OEM companies.  Product showcases were completed by academic presentations in partnership with Japanese scientists, but they unfortunately only provided in Japanese language. Actually, the two shows combination offered a well balanced breakdown of products and services: ingredient suppliers (including participants in the Academic Forum) represented 12% of the exhibitors, OEM/ODM suppliers accounted for 22%, while containers and packaging suppliers for 21% and the manufacturers of finished products for 45%. “Furthermore, the number of overseas exhibitors has been growing a lot and now represents 25% of the participants. And we expect this number to continue growing for the next edition,” adds Hajime Suzuki. To encourage the participation of international players, the show’s organizers know they have to deal with the reality of the Japanese market, which is not reputed as being particularly easy to access. Several foreign companies participating in the show already had an agent or distributor in Japan. For Jacques Jourlait, General Manager of Coverpla, a French supplier of standard glass packaging, which participated for the first time in this event, “a key factor of success in this market, is to have the right partner.” Same advice from Aeneas Hall, Sales Manager at Manuka Doctor, a New Zealand brand proposing skin care products based on bee venom: “it is important to find the good distributor before coming here.” However, according to Mario De Luigi, the CEO of Italian supplier of make-up and skin care high end products, B.Kolor Make Up & Skin Care, who sells directly to Japan and participated for the second consecutive time in the show, it is above all necessary “to make a good preparation work before the show, and to hire someone speaking Japanese.”  In his opinion, if the market is “more difficult than in Europe”, it is because buyers “need to be surprised and mainly look for innovative and original products.” In order to stimulate the business during the show, the organisers have scheduled several business meetings between exhibitors without any local partners and the Japanese operators attending the event. “One of the most important evolution of the Japanese market is the shortening of the distribution channel. The time to market is faster and the feedback from the consumers comes earlier and is more accurate. As a consequence, there is a strong demand for innovation from all the operators, and this is a big opportunity for overseas suppliers and brands,” concludes Hajime Suzuki. The next editions of Cosme Tech and Cosme Tokyo will be held from the 27th to the 29th of August 2014."
Global market for organic personal care products to reach 13.2 billion US dollars by 2018,"“Organic personal care products market is growing at rapid pace across the world,” states a report recently published by Transparency Market Research. According to the study titled “Organic Personal Care Products Market for Skin Care, Hair Care, Oral Care and Cosmetics - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2012 - 2018”, rising concerns for health safety, increasing green consciousness and growing consumer’s awareness about the hazards in synthetic chemicals have fuelled the demand for organic personal care products worldwide. As a result, the global demand for organic personal care products, which was over 7.6 billion US dollars in 2012, is expected to reach 13.2 billion US dollars by 2018, growing at a CAGR of 9.6% from 2012 to 2018. Considering the regional repartition of the market, Transparency Market Research notes that North America was the largest consumer of natural and organic personal care products in 2011 and accounted for over 34% of the global consumption.  The North American market is witnessing growth partly due to increased awareness about the organic principle and mainly due to entry of new multinationals, which are making organic products more easily accessible and visible for the consumer. Europe followed North America in terms of demand and accounted for over 29% of the global natural and organic personal care product demand in 2011.  Germany and France were the primary consumers of organic personal care products in Europe together accounting for over 30% of the European demand. Japan, which is expected to register the fastest growth among all regions, accounted for over 42% of the total demand for natural and organic personal care products in Asia-Pacific.  “The belief in natural and organic remedies is already well ingrained in the Japanese culture therefore it became easier for the manufacturers to make the organic culture acceptable to the consumer,” comments the market research firm. Skin care products are the largest segment and accounted for over 32% in terms of revenue across all the product segments in 2011.  Transparency Market Research considers they will continue to dominate the organic personal care product market. The major factors contributing to the growth of this segment are launch of new products and widening distribution channels. Hair care was the next largest product segment accounting for roughly 25% of the total revenue in 2011. The natural and organic personal care products market is fragmented, with the top 10 companies accounting for little over 53% of the market share in 2011. According to Transparency Market Research, Bare Escentuals was the largest manufacturer for this product category in 2011 and accounted for over 7% of the market share by revenue. Estee Lauder, Burt’s Bees and The Hain Celestial Group were the next largest companies in the natural and organic personal care market accounting for over 20% of the market share together in 2011. “As the organic personal care products market show high growth potential many new companies are entering the market through mergers and acquisition route or through shifting their production line from synthetic to organic,” adds the market research firm. Despite good growth prospects, Transparency Market Research deems that low consumer understanding of natural and organic personal care products, curbing pseudo-organic products competing with authentic products, multiple standards creating consumer confusion are some of the few factors dampening the demand for these products."
Scent is the first purchase criterion for French women,"Strongly attached to her perfume, sceptical towards new launches, and mainly attracted by the fragrance, here is the typical picture of the French perfume consumer according to the study conducted among nearly 2,000 French women on the web by CCL Benchmark Institute. First observation, the penetration rate is quite high: over 90% of French women perfume themselves every morning, and 34% several times a day. The vast majority of French women (90%) are regular consumers who use two or three fragrances and buy perfume once a quarter to once every six months, with an average annual budget of between 100 and 250 euros. Furthermore, women have a strong affective relationship with products that are firstly perceived as pleasure purchases (76% of women) but involving their own identity. The scent is mentioned as the very first purchasing criterion for choosing a perfume (94% of women) before the brand and the name of a perfume. The fragrance’s ambassador is ranked far behind.  Such statements were received with some scepticism by a part of the professionals gathered for the presentation of the results. Indeed, several of them considered they were in contradictory with market experience. However, other experts pointed that the success of Guerlain’s La Petite Robe Noire, could be seen as a demonstration that style and the emotions are keys to success. Actually, although they mobilize a massive share of advertising spending, only few launches succeed in reaching the top 100 sales. French women also express severe judgements on new launches, 41% considering the offer as excessive, with rather negative comments about the lack of originality of new fragrances. According to the study, 60% of the French women have bought their latest perfume in a specialised retailer; only five per cent have bought it from the Internet. However, infrequent consumers are twice as numerous as the others to have bought their latest perfume on the Internet (looking for the best price, and because their purchase is not generally spontaneous). ""The role of the Fragrance Foundation France also consists in taking time to think about new challenges, and the tools that are available to move forward, and, contrary to a received idea, the fragrance industry generates few studies, and even fewer neutral studies not related to a brand. That’s why this is an unprecedented study,"" said Philippe Ughetto, President of The Fragrance Foundation France."
Luxury in the Middle East: kill off received ideas,"GCC nationals [1] are high spenders.  They spend an average of 1,300 US dollars monthly on clothing and accessories of which US$ 700 is on ready-to-wear and US$ 300 on shoes [2].  These figures can be compared with US$ 120 and US$ 15 respectively for the United Kingdom shoppers [3]. Similarly, according to the figures recently published by DMG Events, the organiser of The Life & Style Show UAE, to be held in Abu Dhabi on 5th-7th December 2013, one in ten United Arab Emirates residents is spending 60,000 dirhams (AED) a year on cosmetics, the equivalent of a small car. Eventually, according to Euromonitor International, forecasted daily spend on personal care will rise by 13 per cent per person by 2017 [4]. Generally speaking, the local environment is quite favourable but can the region be considered as an Eldorado for luxury businesses?  Actually, “a deep understanding of the region is a prerequisite of success,” warns the Chalhoub Group (8.500 staff in 14 countries and more than 450 retail outlets in the region). Despite a lot of similarities, the various Middle East markets cannot be fully compared.  For instance, some of them, such as Dubai, have a strong focus on tourism, while others (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) are mostly oriented toward their local market. Furthermore, if GCC countries usually have a population addicted to shopping, consumers’ patterns and preferences also vary.  According to the Chalhoub group, Dubai nationals are indulgent while those living in Abu Dhabi are elitist, viewing luxury as an exclusivity that only a certain social class can afford.  Koweiti nationals are assertive consumers, with 92% choosing a brand simply because they ‘like it’ (versus a GCC average of 60%) and Saudi Arabian national are yearning for individual expression but are strongly attracted to anchor labels and shop within a limited set of brands. They need ‘shopping guidance’ and strong relationships with the sales staff. Similarly, Qatari nationals yearn for individual expression, yet, like Saudis, tend to purchase from a narrow and accepted set of brands. Probably because of the importance of shopping as leisure, the use of e-commerce is low, with only 26% of GCC nationals buying products on-line.  In contrast, engagement in social media is very high. The white paper “Luxury in the Middle East: an easy sell?” is available from the Chalhoub group at www.chalhoub-group.com"
Seen at MakeUp in Paris,"With 90 exhibitors, including 60% from abroad, and more than 2,500 visitors (+18% compared to 2012, +110% for foreign visitors), MakeUp in Paris made the demonstration that it is now part of the most important tradeshows in the cosmetics industry, in particular thanks to its qualitative and friendly niche concept. The tradeshow, which aims to bring together all the players of the makeup industry, gathers a large variety of suppliers including packaging, accessories, or formulas makers, as well as full service players, who are able to offer turn-key products. This year, for the first time, MakeUp in Paris also hosted a selection of ingredient suppliers (BASF, Merck and Laserson), who came there to meet a different public, since marketing and R&D managers accounted alone for over 50% of visitors, according to the organisers. Also new in 2013, the “MakeUPioneer” trail, highlighting the innovations proposed by the exhibitors. Among the innovations that were presented during MakeUp in Paris, Premium Beauty News spotted: – The world’s first nail varnish sample or single-dose packaging with applicator launched by Bioplan (Ileos Group). – The brush-formula couples kit jointly developed by Strand Cosmetics Europe and Dupont Natrafil, with the co-operation of make-up artist Louise Wittlich. – The first ever magnetic applicators in the make-up market, supplied by Priminter for Lancôme’s Hypnôse palettes, injected and decorated by Qualipac. – The new “Cashmere” texture showcased by Aircos, obtained from its IPM technology. – Alkos’ Sixties Addict Eyeline Marker, a waterproof long-lasting eyeliner with various shapes of applicator tips: fine, brush-shapped or slanted. – Ancorotti’s back injected poured powders, for a sensually and tasty make-up. – Bomo Trendline’s new “Grand Eyeliner” water-resistant and paraben-free eyeliner formula and its various applicators. – Cosmogen’s new dual function applicator, Firm’Up. – HCP’s new Magnum range of lipstick, blusher and eyeshadow packs, using anodized aluminium and trendy coloured plastic trims. – ICC “No Tox Remover”, an odour-free nail-polish remover formulated without the use of standard solvents. – Oekabeauty’s new mascara brushes. – Sleever International’s Slever Make Up solution, with its wide range of colours and its 3D and glossy effects. – The laser etching technology showcased by Leoplast, which consists in removing material instead of adding it, thus enabling fine designs and decorations on any part of the pack."
New dates for Cosmopack and expansion prospects for Cosmoprof,"Premium Beauty News - What is your assessment on the last edition of Cosmoprof, which was held last March in Bologna? Duccio Campagnoli - We were happy about what we consider a very positive result.  The fair hosted new exhibitors and welcomed a lot of additional visitors, in particular from outside Italy (+22% compared to 2012). Considering the current economic situation in Europe, that was good news. Cosmoprof Worldwide, which is held annually in Bologna, Italy, is the most important trade platform for the beauty industry and a global hub for the European, Asian and North American markets.  Just considers that 69% of the exhibitors - 1,600 out of 2,300 - come from foreign countries.  This unrivalled globalisation is the show’s main strength. Another important asset is the Cosmoprof brand itself.  Cosmoprof is famous worldwide as the oldest and most important event for the cosmetics industry.  Whatever their main interest, beauty industry insiders know they will find what they are looking for among the variety of product categories and sectors that are showcased under one roof at Cosmoprof, which hosts several shows in the shows: for packaging, hair products, natural beauty products, etc. Premium Beauty News - On the occasion of the last edition you reorganised Cosmopack entirely.  What are your prospects about this part of the show? Duccio Campagnoli - As the rest of the show, Cosmopack is growing.  We consider that this section, that is to say the halls dedicated to beauty packaging suppliers and equipment manufacturers, deserves a specific consideration.  Therefore, we have decided to change the dates of this event so as it corresponds with the expectation of professional visitors.  As a consequence, Cosmopack will open and close two days earlier the rest of the show.  Actually, Cosmopack will be held from the 2nd to the 5th of April 2014, while the rest of Cosmoprof Worldwide will open its doors from the 4th to the 7th of April 2014. This change corresponds to a strong demand from most exhibitors and many visitors.  Actually, the policy of many European companies is not to ask the staff to travel on weekends. As a consequence, the attendance of Cosmopack was really decreasing on Sundays and exhibitors were considering it as a waste of time.  We also think the new dates will help visitors to better organise their stay in Bologna. Furthermore, the next edition of Cosmopack will be increasingly focused on R&D and innovation, with more conferences and technical workshops. Eventually, we are also extending our Buyers Programme to better cover the packaging sector. Premium Beauty News - What about Cosmoprof North America, which will open its doors next July 14-16 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas? Duccio Campagnoli -  With about 900 exhibitors, the next edition of Cosmoprof North America will be the biggest ever.  The show will host two new collective participations from Spain and Turkey, in addition to the ones of Brazil, China, Colombia, Italy, Korea and Taiwan that were already there last year. We are very happy with our partnership with Pro Beauty Association (PBA), which provide us with a prominent position in the industry. This show aims at becoming a more general platform for the industry, in particular through the development of the packaging sector.  There are strong opportunities in this area. Indeed, there is no tradeshow in the U.S. that really addresses the need of the largest variety of beauty packaging suppliers. Premium Beauty News - There are currently three Cosmoprof shows in the world. In the past, Cosmoprof was in Brazil, and made some attempts in Russia and in Turkey. What are your development priorities? Duccio Campagnoli - With our three shows, we are serving the needs of a large part of the global beauty industry. Cosmoprof Asia is the world’s second beauty tradeshow, ranking just after Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna. However, we keep looking for other opportunities, in particular in Asia. Bologna Fiere has opened a sales office in Shanghai."

Marionnaud launches private label makeup brand and refurbishes Paris flagship store,"In order to address the new expectations of quickly changing customers, Marionnaud continues to build on in-store purchase experience; the retailer considering outlets as “the main capital place for customer relationship.” With more than 1,100 outlets in eleven countries, Marionnaud is one of the leading European retailers of selective perfumes and cosmetics.  In France, Marionnaud runs a fleet of 545 outlets, of which more than 200 have been completely refurbished as part of a large renovation program to be completed in 2015. At the halfway point of this huge effort, Marionnaud has launched the transformation of its Champs-Elysées store in Paris. The works, which began just after Mother’s Day are expected to end in November 2013. The sales area will be increased from 500 to 600 m2, in particular through the creation of a mezzanine entirely dedicated to makeup. The new store, which will be clearer and more luxurious, will also host of new brands, especially niche perfumes. But the main purpose is to extend the range of services: makeup bar, manicure and nail care, etc.. According to Marionnaud, the Champs-Elysees store will be decorated with typical Parisian architectural features so as to become a symbol of French style luxury. The customer circulation will be simplified in order to provide opportunities to test and experiment and, when necessary, to get high quality sales assistance by a trained and multilingual staff. Furthermore, ""the store’s sales team will double to 80 people in November."" These recruitments are a prerequisite to ""the improvement of the staff’s current specific professional skills (fragrance experts, makeup artists, beauticians and international profiles,"" said Vocy Bloch, Director of the Champs-Elysées project. For Marionnaud, the Champs Elysees avenue is strategic, both in terms of turnover and in terms of image. Opened 7 days a week from 10 am to midnight, the Marionnaud store located at number 104 is group’s the first point of sales regarding the number of customers than the sales volume, it welcomes a mostly (54%) international clientele.  Most of clients are from abroad. Despite these heavy investments in outlets, Marionnaud carries on a careful exploration of synergies between on-line and street boutiques. “Today, over 60% of our clients consult our website before heading to an outlet, it is an unavoidable dimension of the purchasing act,"" said William G. Koeberlé, Co-Executive Director at Marionnaud France. Moreover, the e-boutique even became the group’s second outlet. Thus, the retailer completely revised its online sales strategy and is launching a new website featuring new applications in September. Among the innovations that are announced: a click & collect feature will allow customers to buy online and then to choose a store where picking up the product, and a store-to-door service will allow them order references that are not available in their store and to be delivered at home. According to Marionnaud, proximity also implies to be able to offer enough accessible products. The retailer therefore carries on developing its private label brand and is launching its first line of makeup. The short range (13 products, for the face, the eyes, the lips and a makeup remover) of the spring-summer collection 2013 thus completes the branded offering."
Natural Cosmetics: A first successful event in London,"Although the UK market of organic and natural beauty products is one of the most developed in the world, due to its very special structure, it is still poorly known by continental brands in this sector, most of whom are SMEs. “Our goal is to offer exhibitors and visitors a broader view of the organic and natural cosmetic expertise through a wide variety of exhibitors and a program of educational conferences to develop branding, networks, regulatory knowledge, and all other aspects, which are needed to create and market one’s brand of organic and natural cosmetics,” said to Premium Beauty News Philippe Gelin, managing director and co-founder of Shorex, the organizer of the exhibition. For its first edition, the show hosted 70 exhibitors, among which suppliers of raw materials or essential oils ( Cassan, Maharishi, Statfold, etc..), contract manufacturers ( N & B, Alban Muller, etc.), but also brands specialised in finished products for make-up, cosmetics and perfumery (Zao, Unica Cosmetics, BellàPierre, Luxsit, Neal’s Yard, etc..). The main institutional actors (like the Soil Association, Ecocert Cosmebio, Natrue, CTPA) also significantly contributed to the conference program. With 4,388 visitors (retailers, importers, distributors, pharmacies, beauty therapists, beauticians, spas...), the organizers consider also positively the outcome of the show. To attract as many professionals as possible, The Organic & Natural Beauty Show partnered with Natural Health, the number one wellness magazine in the UK, for the “Natural Health Beauty Awards” – which reward for the past 6 years the best natural and organic beauty products available on the UK market – to be organised during the event. “We’ve added six categories to single out distributors and retailers, in particular Department Stores, beauty salons or spas,” emphasised Gelin. As a result, the challenge of facilitating the access to the British market also appears to have been reached. “Some of our customers told us they had already found a distributor in the UK following their participation”, said Gelin. Several exhibitors confirmed to Premium Beauty News that they had met a large number of distributors, agents or UK importers at their stand, although others said they were disappointed by the modest size of the show even if they agree on the fact that the organization of a first edition is always very challenging. Hence, the atmosphere was very positive at the stand of the Norwegian company Maya Water, where officials said they were very satisfied with the number of distributors who showed a keen interest in the brand. “Now we just need to turn these opportunities into real markets, but we are very encouraged by the success we encountered in London”, said Maya Gulbrandsen. “We were indeed the only brand to showcase misters and it certainly worked in our favour,” she said. Concretely, this translates for the organizers into promises from exhibitors to take part to the next edition, which will be held on 1 and 2 June 2014. “Our goal now is clearly to grow in size and pass the 100 exhibitor mark as of next year,” concluded Gelin.  Luxsit, the Swedish brand founded in 2007, wanted to participate to The Organic & Natural Beauty Show to enter the UK market which is, according to Maria Boström, Artistic Director, “the most developed and exciting one in the world.” With fully biodegradable components, the brand intends to be soft to the skin and the environment. Mainly focused on hydration, Luxsit (“Let there be light” in Latin) has designed a black packaging, to associate a luxury and trendy image to its products, and uses clear and bright symbols in contrast. The brand has its own factory in Stockholm and uses ingredients coming mostly from the Swedish flora. It offers care creams for the face, body and hair and will be launching soon its BB Cream. Mostly distributed in Spas, Luxsit has just signed a contract with the W Verbier Hotel in Switzerland, which will be opening in December 2013. Zao MakeUp, a young French make-up brand created in January 2012. The concept is based on silica from bamboo, for its properties promoting skin elasticity. The brand has taken the concept of environmental protection, one step further by providing a wide range of refillable packagings, from lipsticks to cream foundations and will soon be launching its line of nail polishes."
"Women and their body in France, China and Russia","Ifop interviewed a panel of more than 8,000 women in France, China and Russia, to determine what they consider as the most important parts of their body, what are the ones they like the least, and the ones for which they would be willing to spend more. “The findings of this study help to explain some underlying trends, such as the dramatic increase of cosmetic surgery in China,” says Laure Friscourt, Director of the Consumer-Beauty Department of the Ifop group.  “They also bring to light real business and innovation opportunities, for instance regarding hair care products in Russia.” The Ifop study also shows that in the three countries, the face is considered as the most important part of the body by 60% of women. However, while 42% of French and 35% of Russian women consider hair as a priority, Chinese women consider it is minor concern. Additionally, more Chinese women than French and Russian say they are willing to spend more for the various parts of their body: 58% would spend more for their belly, 40% for their breasts and, above all, one Chinese woman out of four is willing to spend more for her face."
Skincare: premium brands that French women prefer,"Having selected 13 premium skincare brands available in France (Biotherm, Chanel, Clarins, Clinique, Dior, Estee Lauder, Givenchy, Guerlain, Lancome, La Prairie, Shiseido-Clé de Peau, YSL), Promise Consulting Inc. has calculated their ""index of desirability"" [1] and their reputation. The study was conducted on a nationally representative sample of 1,012 women aged 18 and over, between 19 and 23 April 2013. Three brands, Chanel (50%), Clarins (46%) and Dior (44%) top the survey. Being luxury fashion brands, Chanel and Dior (LVMH) know how to make French women dreaming - for instance by enrolling charismatic female celebrities (e.g. Anne Hathaway or Vanessa Paradis for Chanel) as spokesmodels. However, they also succeeded in developing credible scientific and technical approaches, both brands communicating extensively about their R&D efforts and investments: for instance, the opening by Chanel, of a new research centre nearby Paris last year, hosting about 200 researchers under one roof, or the construction by Dior of a new research centre near Orleans for about 30 million euros. In this context, the performance of Clarins, that ranks second, is particularly impressive since this independent brand has to cope with competitors belonging to much larger cosmetic groups. According to Promise Consulting Inc., Clarins enjoys the benefit of its ""technical know-how and also of its flawless reputation among women,"" as shown by its notoriety index (98%), which is the highest of the study. Ranking in fourth position, Lancôme (41%), the luxury brand belonging to the L’Oreal group, also relies on the work of many researchers, and is now trying to create a direct relationship with its customers, in particular through its website and its YouTube page. Guerlain, another iconic French luxury brand, ranks fifth (34%) on par with Clinique. Founded in 1828, the LVMH group brand relies on almost two centuries of history but also on a strong technical expertise, in particular in the field of cell regeneration. At the ninth position, Biotherm (20%) seems to lag behind. Based on the benefits of Pyrenean thermal waters the brand addresses the needs of a smaller and older core target, which nevertheless remains significant in a highly competitive market. ""However, says Promise Consulting Inc., without a spokesmodel, the brand will have difficulties to compete with luxury brands at the top of the podium."" ""The market is structured into two major poles: luxury on the one side, where prestigious houses use their notoriety and image to provide comprehensive skin care ranges at the forefront of innovation (Chanel, Dior, Guerlain, Lancome). Specialist brands, on the other side, such a Clinique, which provide the assurance of their medical knowledge and state-of-the-art R&D,” says Professor Philippe Jourdan, founding partner of Promise Consulting Inc. / On the Web Panel."
Beautyworld Middle East rides on a dynamic and premiumising market ,"With 23 international pavilions this year and a 32% increase in the number of exhibitors over the previous edition - 1,096 exhibitors from 52 countries participating this year as compared with 829 in 2012 - Beautyworld Middle East’s continued expansion underlines the vast potential of the regional market for beauty products. According to Euromonitor International, the per capita spend on personal care in the United Arab Emirates is set to reach 1,170 dirahms (AED) this year and grow to 1282 dirahms (268.4 euros or 348.9 dollars) by 2017, 13% increase compared to 2012. However, this average hides strong disparities, in particular a very high level of consumption for the 10% richest. Regarding Saudi Arabia, Euromonitor International forecasts that strong economic growth and a further increase in disposable income levels will boost sales in beauty and personal care by 5.8% by 2017. “The attractiveness of the region also lies in the different emerging countries that surround it, including Iran for perfumes, Pakistan for skincare,” says Philippe Durieux, area sales manager at Gerresheimer. The most advanced markets, in particular the United Arab Emirates, also benefit from the growing interest in specialised products and premium brands driven.  “With a multitude of brands already in the market, customers are very choosy about what they use. Niche brands are doing well, with the market growing to accommodate more of them and customers taking an increased liking to what’s different,” explains Mohammed Abdul Rahim Al Fahim, CEO of Paris Gallery Group of Companies. This is especially true for fragrances, with a market expected to reach US$ 33.4 million in 2016, in the United Arab Emirates alone. It is therefore quite logical that Epoc Messe Frankfurt, the organiser of Beautyworld Middle East partnered with Elements Showcase, the New York event specialised in niche and high end fragrances and cosmetics, to enable a series of emerging brands to showcase their products in Dubai. “Dubai is the perfect intersection of buyers and media from Europe, Asia, and, of course, the Middle East,” says Frederick Bouchardy, Elements co-founder. Among the participating brands: Cire Trudon, Illuminum, Bond No. 9, Yosh, Atelier Flou, Mona di Orio, État Libre d’Orange, Rouge Bunny Rouge, etc. The rise of niche fragrance brands in the Middle East is the consistent continuation of the traditional importance of scented products in the region. According to Euromonitor International, the per capita spend on fragrances in the United Arab Emirates is expected to reach AED 128 (USD 34.90) in 2017. This is 90% more than that of the US, which is only expected to reach USD 18.40 in 2017.  This expected to market be worth approximately AED 1.13 billion (236.5 million euros or 307 million dollars), in the UAE alone. ""It is a key market, with a strong local manufacturing and from time to time a quest for excellence that can result in peak prices,"" confirms François-Patrick Sabater, CEO of Technicoflor, a French supplier of perfumery ingredients and compositions. No surprise in such conditions that perfumery is the main sector at Beautyworld Middle East and that it continues growing. “Many customers create their own compositions,” says Viginie Gervason, Marketing Manager Ingredients at Firmenich.  “There are of course a lot of demands that are specific to this market: oud, wood or rose notes.” Of course, the local market is not limited to perfumery. Many exhibitors from the makeup sector have noted the growing demand in the region, in particular in Iran.  “There also a clear trend towards the creation of makeup private label brands by retailers,” observes My Driss Drissi, B. Kolormakeup & Skincare."
Nose licences its olfactive profiling technology,"The olfactive diagnosis created by Nose, the Parisian concept-store specialised in alternative perfumery and cosmetic brands, is now proposed in a license approach on digital tablets (iPad) to other high quality retailers around the world.  Skins Cosmetics will be the first retail stores to rollout this technology outside France. In a first step, two stores in Amsterdam will begin using the Nose perfume recommendation technology: Skins Cosmetics Runstraat (Runstraat 11, 1016 GJ Amsterdam) and Skins Cosmetics het Conservatorium Hotel (Van Baerlestraat 27, 1071 AN Amsterdam). Skins Cosmetics is a Dutch retailer specialized in niche cosmetic brands with 11 stores across The Netherlands and a carefully selected collection of renowned brands such as Creed, Diptyque, Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle, Maison Francis Kurdjian, Byredo, etc. Two and a half years have been needed for Nose to launch, on June 2012, a unique perfume recommendation technology, which aims to help anyone to find the perfect fragrance for oneself or for a relative. Built from thousands of perfumes qualified one by one by a team of very senior perfumers, it also leverages a very robust statistical algorithm. “The Nose diagnosis helps you find new fragrances through a short survey of seven questions on your profile and your existing and past perfumes. You can then access your ‘olfactive portrait’ (favorite scent families/notes), from which you will discover five recommended perfumes that suit your preferences. You will then be asked to evaluate each fragrance so that your ‘olfactive portrait’ always gets updated, with 5 newer recommended perfumes,” says the retailer in a release. This service was first implemented at the Nose outlet in Paris to boost in-store perfume advisor knowledge and help customers find their perfect fragrance. About 30,000 perfume diagnoses in less than a year. This tool is really at the centre of the Nose concept and of its first concept store that opened in Paris in June 2012 from a team of seven beauty professionals and enthusiasts (Nicolas Cloutier, Silvio Levi, Romano Ricci, Mark Buxton...)."
Recreated historical French fragrances attract the attention of Chinese media,"The archives of the Palace of Versailles, the principal residence of French kings from the time of Louis XIV to Louis XVI, retain a series of fragrance formulas developed in the 17th and 18th centuries by the perfumers of the King of France. The company Conservatoire Français des Fragrances et Cosmétiques (CFFC) has been is the only fragrance developer to have obtained the right to use these formulas and market them under license. The perfumes have been recomposed with antique natural flavours but also with contemporary synthetic molecules to create a range of perfumes directly inspired from this time: the Parfums du Château de Versailles. Many Chinese media hailed their arrival on the local market and Chinese netizens have been very curious about them. The profession of perfumer was recognized at the beginning of the reign of Louis XIV, who bore a passion for perfumes, which he inherited his mother’s taste. Perfumery was definitely one of the jewels of French refinement during the “Grand Siecle” (the 17th century and more precisely the period covering the reigns of Louis XIII, 1601-1643, and Louis XIV, 1638-1715) and the heyday of Versailles, where its development has been staggering. Indeed, for the first time, in the early 17th century, the profession of perfumer was granted an official title: “Maître gantier et parfumeur”  (""Master perfumer and glovemaker”). The heyday of the Court of Versailles thus marks the rise of French perfumery, thanks to lavish ceremonies of King Louis XIV and his court, and their political and cultural influence throughout Europe. The Château de Versailles is one of the most visited monuments in the world, and its gardens, halls and art galleries welcome every year many Chinese tourists. The association between fragrances and this monument seems very well received by Chinese consumers, especially as they are very fond of brand’s story-telling. Thus, the launch in China the Parfums du Château de Versailles has been an opportunity for the Chinese to debate in the media and the internet about the relevancy of a historical comparison between the French monarchy and the last Chinese imperial dynasty. “The Chinese people are very sensitive to the history and quality of the products from France. We are very confident on the perception of professionals and the general public on this new product,” says Michel Patrice, historian and Director / General Manager at CFFC."
Pack & Gift: towards an expanded edition in 2013,"With about 3,000 expected visitors, the 2013 edition of the Pack & Gift tradeshow looks promising, according to the organizers. “After five years of existence, PACK & GIFT has found its niche with a unique concept and relevant positioning enabling promotion and customer loyalty specialists to offer brands a range of exclusive packaging solutions, promotional gifts, and CRM,” they say. The show, which will be held on the 12th and 13th of June 2013 at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, will host 250 exhibitors (compared to 225 last year), including presentation pack manufacturers, samples, POS, promotional item distributors, specialists in printing, finishing, and CRM, and also advertising and design agencies. Back in Pack & Gift this year, the Pack & Gift World Tour exhibit, organized in cooperation with Jean Jacques Evrard, Pentawards founder, was conceived as a travel around the world’s most original event-based packages found these last few months in China, Japan, Europe and the USA. This year, Pack & Gift creates a new trend and innovation animation titled: "" Pack & Gift Trends - Material, colour, usage, eco-design"". A dedicated area will present future trends illustrated by the most telling exhibitors’ innovations in terms of materials, colours, usages and eco-design.  The organisers have entrusted Thema Design, an advisory agency in the fields of innovation, marketing and communication, for selecting exhibitors’ innovations and to showcase them according to the material, colour and usage trends, identified in its monitoring activity. In order to complete this analysis, Thema-Design will host a conference on the theme: ""Materials, sensations and emotions: prospective landmarks"" on Wednesday, June 12 at 1.30pm. This year, Pack & Green exhibition and competition, dedicated to eco-conceived innovations will be part of the Pack & Gift Trends exhibition.  An exhibition area will provide exhibitors with an opportunity to showcase their latest designs and innovations aimed at reducing the environmental impact of promotional packages. Along with the exhibition, the Pack & Green Award will honour the most sustainable packaging solution, both in terms of design, materials used and in terms of production process, transportation, product usage, not to mention the end of its life. The jury members [1] will assess the products according to the criteria and coefficients of the Pack & Green 2013 charter, given to each participant. The final deliberations in the presence of all jury members will be held during the fair, on Wednesday, the 12th of June, in the afternoon. The program of conferences at this 6th edition of the event attempts to cover a wide scope of issues: from packaging including QR codes to the constraints of packaging design for the travel retail, including a semiotic approach to packaging, the legal protection of packaging and gifts, as well as customer relationship management. Jean Watin Augouard, brand culture advisor and editor in chief of the Revue des Marques, Jean-Jacques Evrard, founder of the Pentawards, Catherine Meunier Losson, Head of marketing and sales development for High Co sales, Gwenaëlle de Kerret Director of qualitative and semiology studies at Harris Interactive or Henri Saporta, editor in chief of Emballages Magazine are amongst the experts that will participate in the various round tables together with representatives of brands such as: Brasserie de Bretagne, Motta, William Saurin, Pernod Ricard, Lascad L’Oréal."
Global luxury market to grow by 4 to 6 % annually through 2015,"Global luxury goods market grew by 10 percent in 2012 (at current exchange rates) and now tops 200 billion euros, according to consulting firm Bain & Company [1].  The market will continue to grow as much as 50 percent faster than global GDP, with an expectation of four to five percent growth in 2013 and five to six percent annual average through 2015, on track to break the 250 billion sales threshold by mid-decade. According to Bain’s spring update of the ""Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study"" conducted with Italian luxury trade body Altagamma, growth should remain sluggish in Europe this year, rising by a maximum of 2 percent, compared with 3% in 2012, at constant currency. Actually, Europeans, especially in southern Europe, are curtailing spending, while tourists from the USA, Asia and the Middle East are changing their habits, seeking out new destinations (e.g. Dubai, South East Asia, Australia) and showing more savvy in the items they purchase.  Chinese tourists, in particular, are reducing their purchases in Europe due to narrowing price gaps with goods at home. As far as Asia is concerned, Bain says that the growth of luxury sales in China is stabilizing to an expected seven percent, keeping pace with GDP.  In parallel, Hong Kong and Macau benefit from the shift in mainland’s tourist flows previously targeting Europe. Regarding, South East Asia, Bain expects a 20 percent growth driven by a wave of new store openings, and increasing strength and relevance of second-tier markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Japan is returning to a strong growth story of five percent as the country’s monetary policy depreciates the yen and boosts the economy and local consumption while discouraging travels abroad. High consumer confidence among the affluent, increased store openings in American cities, and intensive investment in linking physical and digital shopping are all fueling United States sales growth.  Combined with the strong growth of sales (+12%) across Central and South America (notably Brazil and Mexico), this positive environment will result in overall growth of five to seven percent in the Americas. Argentina, however, continues to conduct economic policies that impediment the development of the luxury market, which should grow at a limited 0.3% rate. Eventually, Middle East is growing at a steady pace, with Dubai continuing as the centre of gravity and the only city attracting foreign luxury consumers (e.g. Russians, Indians, Africans). ""We are seeing a more even distribution of global growth,"" said Claudia D’Arpizio, a Bain partner in Milan and lead author of the study.  ""In turn, brands are refocusing from short term, reactive hot spot thinking to long-term sustained growth strategies."" Over the long term, Bain estimates that the global luxury goods market in 2025 will likely be more than five times larger than it stood in 1995. ""We are entering a new phase in the evolution of the luxury market,"" concluded D’Arpizio.  ""More markets, more segments, and more diversity of tastes all combine to create more variables to solve for when pursuing the right strategy for growth."""
"Cosmetics packaging market to grow in 2013 despite uncertainties, says report","Visiongain forecasts [1] that the demand in emerging markets will boost unit volumes and that the premiumisation trend in developed markets will also contribute to deliver strong growth in the cosmetics packaging market, which will reach a value of 25.23 billion U.S. dollars (about 19.41 billion euros) in 2013. “Premiumisation of cosmetics and the anti-aging trend in developed markets is expected to increase the value of the cosmetics packaging markets, as cosmetics packaging becomes more innovative and expensive. Strong growth is expected to emerge from emerging and developing markets where consumers increasingly demand more of non-essential cosmetics products,” Visiongain comments. While the increase in premium packaging in cosmetics markets can be partly explained by the aging of developed societies, other consumer trends also drive growth: the environmental trend, which is heightening the demand for environmentally friendly materials, and the rise of male grooming that boost the demand for particularly facial skincare and hair care packaging.  Innovative techniques and integrated applicators, which are used to excite consumers in the increasingly crowded cosmetics markets, also contribute to the rise. As far as the growth in emerging markets is concerned, the demand for cosmetic products is driven by higher income levels and the ascension of the middle class and professional occupations.  “Appearance is becoming more important, and as consumers grow wealthier they are able to afford products previously seen as unattainable luxuries,” says the market research firm. However, there are also impediments to the market growth.  According to Visiongain, the main constraints of the cosmetics packaging market are the still-lingering effects of the global financial crisis and the doubts created by the current euro-zone problems.  “Reduced consumer and producer confidence restricts cosmetics packaging growth as consumers reduce purchases,” the firm explains. In such a context, some cosmetics packaging sectors are likely to maintain relatively good positions even during financial crises.  “Products such as hair care or facial skincare are widely seen as essential, and will be in demand regardless of the economic conditions. However, the less essential product sectors, such as decorative cosmetics, nail care or fragrances, are likely to take the impact of any double-dips on the horizon,” analyses Visiongain. Fluctuating raw material and energy prices are further factors potentially constraining the cosmetics packaging market growth, making cosmetics packaging more expensive and reducing profits."
Cosmetics and food: cross border trends,"""We have entered a hybrid society. By combining their information sources, drawing on many influences to satisfy their desires, consumers tend to question traditional segmentations,"" said Leila Rochet-Podvin, director and founder of Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation and co-author of the study [1]. In a context, marked by the rapid, and sometimes contradictory, evolution of consumers’ needs and desires, brands seeking innovation must open up their eyes as much as consumers do. The two agencies have completed their reflections by many examples of innovative products and retail concepts illustrating the numerous cross-references between food and cosmetics. For instance, they highlight the use of common ingredients or common references to the purity and benefits of certain waters as well as the power of the marine world. Food and cosmetics have also come together to praise sugar, but also fresh and local products, and even sensuality. On this basis, Leila Rochet-Podvin and Béatrice de Reynal suggest following ten trends that are likely to have a strong influence on these two sectors in 2013. The first two trends (GRIN’IFIC and iControl) refer to the increasing penetration of technology, science and information in the daily lives of consumers. The rise of homo numericus is also reflected in the consumer’s desire to seize power and become a strategist of its own personal affirmation and desires. The following two trends (Senstory Gamers and Hyperlife & SuperStress) highlight the quest for higher aspirations, customization, and calm in parallel to accelerating bulimic lives, with multiple sides and fully interconnected. The fifth (Clean & Pure) and sixth (Healthy) trends are two complementary sides of the same search for well-being and health, with in the one hand, the desire to preserve oneself from any source of poisoning, and a strong willingness to detoxify oneself, and in the other hand, the search for wellness and health, the willingness to feel good in one’s body, the quest for a new balance between health and beauty, as well as assumed healthy ageing. The next three trends reflect the major global economic and demographic changes. The rise of Asia results in a sort of Eastward rush, with the growing influence of Far Eastern fashion and lifestyle, including Japan and Korea.  ""What happened with BB Creams will not remain an isolated case,"" sayid Leila Rochet-Podvin.  ""Consumers in Europe and North America are increasingly sensitive to the ancestral values and roots of Chinese culture, even if they reject the current outrageous consumerism of the country,"" she added. Similarly, the increasing proportion of seniors in several societies (today almost 1 in 10 people are over 60 years old, by 2050 1 in 5 people will be over 60) and the growing ethnic diversity of populations should encourage brands to change the way they address these two issues. Eventually, Sustainably True, the tenth and final trend identified by the two agencies, continues the organic and natural trend but with an increased demand for transparency, stronger attention to communities and to the origin of products and their human signature. The resources of the planet are still perceived as exhaustible, but consumers have grown increasingly suspicious towards greenwashing practices and they demand more concrete actions. To be noted also, a rise of sustainability concerns among luxury brands. In conclusion, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation and NutriMarketing recommend putting consumers at the centre of the innovation process, to enable them to resume a meaningful purchase, allowing to express themselves, to realize their personality (""upgrade the ego ""), but also to provide them with a really attractive value (""desirable benefit""), while reintroducing the emotional dimension of the shopping experience (""re-enchant ""). ""This is more or less for brands to return to common sense and the courage to assume their role in society rather than talk about it, in short to achieve the role of the one who will shape its market,"" said the two authors of the study."
Euromonitor warns about the overuse of multi-functionality claims,"Euromonitor’s Global Head of Beauty and Personal Care Research, Irina Barbalova, and Beauty and Personal Care Analyst, Nicole Tyrimou discussed how 2012 was another year of strong performance for the beauty industry despite economic uncertainty and cautious consumer spending. The premium segment sustained its growth levels and continued to be driven by skin care and dynamic innovation in anti-ageing. After a spectacular year in 2011, North America still managed to achieve close to 6% increase in premium value in 2012, according to Euromonitor data. “Total industry growth bettered that of the previous year and reached pre-recession levels. Despite the strong performance of the premium cosmetics category, overall growth was boosted by mass cosmetics globally, with positive prospects shown by staple categories such as oral care, deodorants, and hair care,” said Barbalova.  “Hair care is experiencing a transformation and is increasingly inspired by skin care in terms of ingredients, as well as adopting a similar multi-step routine approach to hair treatment.” Euromonitor’s latest research also shows leading beauty companies are taking a more holistic view on products. This has also been driven by consumer demand becoming more complex in their expectations of product performance and benefits. “Anti-ageing is increasingly being associated with a wider portfolio of benefits. Moisturisation and sun protection are now expected in every product, thus added value has gone far beyond that,” explains Nicole Tyrimou.  “There is a greater alignment with enhancing the skin, rather than just treating wrinkles. Many of the new claims are about evening skin tone, brightening, illuminating and smoothing properties,” added Tyrimou. Multifunctional products are becoming mainstream, most epitomised by the BB and CC creams phenomenon. At the same time, the need for more personalised solutions and products targeting specific concerns are presenting further scope for innovation in this area.  According to Euromonitor, while multiple benefits are important even in targeted products, the overuse of multi-functionality and the BB/CC labelling of products could result in the blurring of the actual benefits and thus the ultimate brand credentials. “There seems to be room for both of these divergent trends.  While both targeted and multi-functional products are equally sought after by consumers, the need for preserving and promoting the specialised features of a product should remain key. Consumers need to be able to relate to a product that provides them a solution for their individual needs,” concludes Irina Barbalova."
Makeup: premium brands that French women prefer,"For this eighth edition, beyond the index of desirability [1] of premium makeup brands, Promise Consulting Inc. also measured brands’ awareness. The study was conducted from 19 to 23 April 2013 on a nationally representative sample of 1,012 people aged 18 and over. Chanel (57%), Dior (49%) and Yves Saint Laurent (11%) are the three leading brands. With a score of 57%, Chanel overcomes all competitors in this study.  “If this legendary brand knows how to rock the heart of French women, it is due to its DNA, which is the epitome of French luxury and elegance but also to more than a century-long history. More than a brand, Chanel is part of the national cultural heritage,” says Promise Consulting Inc. in a release.  Furthermore, the brand has made relevant strategic and marketing choices, whether regarding its faces or regarding new product developments inspired from the most glamorous moments of the movie industry. With a score of 49%, Dior is on Chanel’s heels. The flagship brand of the LVMH group, which will celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2016, also capitalizes on its history. This spring, the brand has chosen to pay tribute to pink, one of the favorite colours of designer Christian Dior. Dior is also putting great emphasis on innovation in particular with the ""Lip Glow Dior Addict Dior Chérie Bow Edition,"" a gloss that reacts to the moisture rate in lips; a highly relevant R&D axis since hydration is one of women’s main cosmetic concerns. Yves Saint Laurent Beauty (42%) ranks third. As a part of the L’Oréal group since 2008, the brand has developed ""a powerful and consistent marketing strategy that is carefully implemented over time."" With a score of 41%, Lancôme ranks fourth. The brand, owned by L’Oreal since almost 50 years, now wants to create a relationship with its customers, in particular through the use of its website and YouTube page. The brand with the famous rose thus offers a page devoted to makeup tutorials, a kind of tribute to the ""do it yourself"" trend that drives the blogosphere. Then Guerlain comes next (39%). The brand of the LVMH group offers real bestsellers such as the ""Terracotta"" powder, the ""rouge G"" for the lips, the ""Météorites"" pearly or compact powder, or the ""kohl"" pencil for the eyes… ""While haute couture cosmetic brands allow French women to get access to their share of the luxury world, a number of women want to associate skincare and beauty during a cosmetic purchase,"" says Promise Consulting Inc. Thus, Clarins (40%) ranks 5th in the study and Clinique (25%), ranks seventh. Makeup specialist brands, aiming at more expert customers, achieve lower scores in this study. For instance, Make Up For Ever (5%) only ranks in the 10th position, with the lowest brand awareness level (77%). According Promise Consulting Inc., ""Make Up For Ever is nonetheless a cosmetic company with a high growth potential.”  Acquired by LVMH in 1999, this makeup pure player, which was originally dedicated to the entertainment worlds, now addresses the general public through the notoriety of its Artistic Director, Dany Sanz, a reference in the makeup microcosm. ""In addition to luxury brands that draw their legitimacy from their image in the ready-to-wear fashion and perfume businesses, as well as in the high quality of their products, skin care brands are betting on the clear synergy with their proven expertise in the field of hydration, in anti-aging and in the correction of the skin’s imperfections. Eventually, professional makeup brands have been able to stand out thanks to the personality of their creators or art directors and an unconventional and uninhibited conception of makeup,"" concludes Prof. Philippe Jourdan, founding partner of Promise Consulting Inc. and Panel On the Web."
"US personal care market ripe for acquisitions, sees Kline","Both key and niche industry players are meeting significant sales success in the U.S. personal care market, according to a recently published report Cosmetics & Toiletries USA [1] by Kline & Company.  “Procter & Gamble (P&G) maintains its lead in the U.S. personal care market; however, its market share across multiple categories is being challenged. With the exception of P&G, major companies - in particular, L’Oréal and Estée Lauder - are enjoying steady growth. Of particular note, smaller companies are making strong headway and highly viable impressions,” notes Kline. However, the consulting and research firm considers it is at the macro level that the flourishing personal care market is offering the most promise.  “Within the presently fertile merger and acquisition climate, smaller companies are increasingly attractive acquisition prospects by larger, cashed-up, and savvy players,” says Kline. As a telling example, earlier this year, L’Oréal’s CEO Jean-Paul Agon announced that he was ready to make important acquisitions to maintain growth, and this has already been borne out by the recent acquisition of Interconsumer Products, one of Kenya’s largest manufacturers of personal care and beauty products. “Clearly, companies continue to emphasize growth agendas and make significant funding available – both strategic and financial sponsors – to realize such aspirations. Such an improving environment is increasingly attractive for merger and acquisition and a growing number of smaller, often privately held, cosmetic and toiletry companies are contemplating, developing, and/or executing exits. As such, 2013 portends to offer even greater deal flow as many companies look to invest in new growth opportunities,” remarks Eric Vogelsberg, Senior Vice President at Kline’s M&A Advisory. Thus Kline’s Minor Companies chapter from the Cosmetics & Toiletries USA report, consisting of almost 150 profiles of smaller and especially dynamic cosmetic and toiletry companies, reveals particularly promising companies that have been identified as positive net-value prospects and are also presently competing in segments that are expected to post higher-than-industry-average growth. Among the profiles are companies such as New York City-based Anthony Brands with the high potential for acquisition based on a solid presence in the male grooming market and a high level of innovative product launches. Similarly promising is Vogue International, a distributor of hair care and other personal care products in nearly 42 countries worldwide with a potential based on prolific R&D, mass brands with broad appeal and a recognized name. In terms of the overall cosmetics and toiletries market performance, the nail polishes category claims the most success, shining with 17.4% growth, fueled by continual innovation and high consumer demand. Additionally, skin care products for men show a strong performance in 2012, gaining formidable traction with innovative brands such as Lab Series Skincare for Men by Estée Lauder and Anthony Logistics For Men by Anthony Brands, performing exceptionally well and posting double-digit growth."
Can natural cosmetics break through the green glass ceiling?,"According to the market research firm, “a small group of consumers comprise most sustainable product sales, creating a glass ceiling to business growth.”  For instance, organic food sales have been increasing at double-digit rates in the USA however they comprise just 4% of total food sales. In Europe, natural and organic personal care product sales have shown similar growth rates, yet they have just 3% market share.  In Germany, where they hold the biggest share of the market, natural and organic cosmetics account for 6.5% of the market, not more.  Similarly, concentration of demand would explain the low market shares of fair trade products, ethical textiles and many other sustainable products. Marketing appears to be the solution. Indeed, brands that can successfully position themselves to attract broad consumer groups are breaking through the glass ceiling. In the food sector, Belgian firm Alpro is one such success story.  After initially finding success with its organic soya dairy alternatives, the Alpro brand has been re-positioned to widen consumer appeal. It is marketed as a well-being brand, attracting health-conscious and ecological consumers, as well as those suffering from food allergies.  Today, Alpro dominates the European functional foods and dairy alternatives market. Bio+ is another example.  Since its launch in 2005, Bio+ has grown to become the leading organic brand in the Netherlands. Its popularity is because it is positioned as a lifestyle brand, with organic not the main proposition. It was the fastest growing brand in Dutch supermarkets in 2012, and ranked 39 in the Top 100 brands in the country. As far as the beauty sector is concerned, Aveda has been highly successful in the US with its professional range of natural personal care products.  Launched in 1978 by Horst Rechelbacher when few consumers were aware of natural and organic products, Aveda products were marketed on their plant ingredients and performance. Like Alpro, Aveda leads in many areas of sustainability: it is the largest user of recycled plastic in the beauty industry and is one of the main buyers of organic essential oils in the world. Today, Aveda is the second leading hair salon brand in the US, with sales spread to almost every continent. Other organic brands, such as Hipp, Weleda and Green & Black’s, have also gained a mainstream following because they have not focused on the green consumer segment. According to Organic Monitor, retailers are also widening consumer appeal for their ethical private labels. The Naturaplan brand of Coop Switzerland now comprises almost half of all organic food sales in the country. Sustainable products - including textiles and household cleaning products - have over 10% market share in Coop Switzerland stores. In Germany, DM drugstores have successfully positioned the Alverde brand of natural cosmetics; it is now the premier private label of certified natural cosmetics in Europe. According to Organic Monitor, its also because of its broad customer base that Whole Foods Market, the largest natural and organic food retailer, has been successful. “Expanding the small green consumer segment will be fundamental to the long term growth of organic and sustainable product industries. In the interim, Organic Monitor advises brands to follow the pioneers and invest in marketing to reach out to new customers,” concludes the market research firm. [1]"
Next edition of MakeUp in Paris is set to break new records,"MakeUp in Paris, the trade show dedicated to the makeup industry, continues to grow and will host 85 exhibitors on the occasion of its fourth edition on 20-21 June 2013 at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris.  “Growing from 65 to 85 exhibitors MakeUp in Paris 2013 is taking an important step not only in terms of the number of participants, but also in terms of representativeness,"" says the organizers. Once again, the show will take place in the rooms Souffot, Delorme and Gabriel at the Carrousel du Louvre, which totalize 3275 sqm gathering the exhibitors’ stands, the entertainment areas, the conference room and the event’s catering area.  “The increase in the number of exhibitors has led us to reorganise the floor plan to maximize space,"" says Sandra Maguarian, the show manager. A reorganization that has not been sufficient to meet all demands since, according to the organizers, six companies are still on a waiting list.  ""We are considering all possibilities to find them a place, but it is unlikely that we can meet all demands,"" says Sandra Maguarian. As far as exhibitors are concerned, MakeUp in Paris is becoming more and more an international gathering of the makeup industry. French companies only represent 37% of exhibitors this year and the show is hosting exhibitors from 12 European countries - first and foremost Germany and Italy, and for the first time in Spain, Poland and Russia - but also from North and South America, Japan and Korea. Amon first time exhibitors are, for instance, AC Cosmétiques, Bao Sheng Corporation, Barbara Hoffman, Baralan, Bell, Chromavis, Confalioneri Matite, Cosmecca Korea, Dieter Bakic, Federico Ferrer, HCP, Leoplast, Toly, Yoshida, Shanghai Delviel Cosmetic, Cosmecca, Zignago Vetro.. For the first time ever, MakeUp in Paris opens its doors to ingredient suppliers, introducing a new area, MakeUPigments, where exhibitors and the visitors will be invited to didactic and sensory exhibitions and workshops.  The first edition of MakeUPigments will host 3 partners: BASF, Laserson and Merck. ""MakeUp in Paris offers ingredient manufacturers the opportunity to express themselves in a way that differs from what they are used to and to target different audiences, including brand marketing teams,"" explains Jean-Yves Bourgeois, co-founder of the event As in previous years, the organizers continue to pay particular attention to the several animations that punctuate the two-day event.  Thus, students from makeup schools and their models will participate twice a day to the MakeUp Parade.  They will stage the exhibitors’ products in the aisles of the show, among the exhibitors and visitors. In partnership with Schwan Cosmetics, Faber-Castell Cosmetics and Mobius & Ruppert, the MakeUp Painting area will offer visitors and exhibitors a funny, creative and recreational break to draw up the most beautiful makeup on a paper. MakeUp in Paris will also ask three young designers to design six decorative objects for the home, using makeup products and accessories. Their creations will be exhibited during the two days of the show. Furthermore, this year, MakeUp Pioneer, the show’s path for innovation and new products, will succeed the MakeUp Innovation Awards. The floor map distributed to visitors will highlight booths participating in the operation. A dozen round tables and conferences will also be held during the days of MakeUp in Paris. Among the topics to be discussed: – "" Make-up and skincare"" to explore the links between care and makeup products, 20 June 2013 (10.15-11.00 a.m.)
– ""Foundation, a concentrate of innovations"", 20 June 2013 (01.30-02.15 p.m.)
– ""Korea, a champion in make-up innovation"", 21 June 2013 (10.15-11.15 a.m.)
– ""Make-up and the strategies of luxury brands,"" 21 June 2013 (12.30-13.15 p.m.) The success of this “niche” show is also confirmed in the United States where, in order to meet the many demands of exhibitors, the organizers have chosen a new venue for the third edition of MakeUp in New York to be held on 25-26 September 2013. “The evolution of the makeup market strongly supports us, with an increasing reliance on outsourcing and full service, which is precisely the positioning of our events,” concludes Jean-Yves Bourgeois."
"“The Japanese cosmetics market is actively changing,” Hajime Suzuki, Cosme Tokyo","Premium Beauty News - Can you provide us with a picture of Cosme Tokyo next edition? Hajime Suzuki - Cosme Tokyo 2013 is an international exhibition specialised in cosmetics and toiletries au Japon. About 550 [1] companies from around the world are expected to exhibit at the second edition to find agents or expand sales channels in Japan and other Asian countries. The number of visitors is expected to reach 30,000 [2], almost doubled from the previous edition (16,936 visitors in 2012). Gathering importers, distributors, agents and buyers from various retailers such as department stores, life style shops, online shops and salons, Cosme Tokyo offers great sales opportunities to those targeting the attractive markets in Japan and in Asia. Premium Beauty News - What will be the highlights of the next edition? Hajime Suzuki - First of all, the number of exhibitors is expected to increase by 70% from the previous show. The first reason is the huge success of the initial edition where the show floor was always flooded with buyers, both from Japan and abroad, eagerly looking for hit products coming next.  Almost all the exhibitors who participated in the 2012 edition are coming back and many new companies are joining this year, encouraged by achievements of the previous exhibitors. Another reason is the launch of new specialised zones for each product category such as [skincare], [makeup], [hair & scalp], [bath & body], [tools & accessories] and [beauty drink/supplement]. This layout does not only contribute to attract more exhibitors from each category, it also helps to gathering increased number of visitors interested in those products. In addition, there are also zones reflecting the current trends in the Japanese market. The “Organic Zone” and “[Special] Anti-aging Cosmetics Fair”, in particular, are expected to gather a large attention as these two markets are rapidly expanding in Japan. The “Organic Zone”, for instance, is greatly expanding its scale, in response to the “organic cosmetics boom” in Japan. Premium Beauty News - How would you describe the Japanese cosmetics market today? Hajime Suzuki - As far as its growth rate is concerned, the cosmetics market in Japan - the world’s second largest market - has entered a stable period.  However, the market situation is actively changing. Now that consumers can access to a flood of information on the Internet and choose from numerous alternatives, many newcomers are entering the market, seeking chances in meeting the diversified consumer needs. While the competition is getting fiercer, the current market is full of opportunities to increase sales, even for newcomers or small and medium-sized companies. This remark also applies to overseas cosmetic brands, which are becoming increasing popular among Japanese consumers.  Another prominent feature in the current market is the success of overseas organic brands. Considering these situations as an opportunity, many overseas companies will exhibit at Cosme Tokyo 2013.  We have therefore created a special exhibiting area for overseas companies inside the show.  The dedicated zone will be called “New Comers to the Japanese Market Pavilion”. To support overseas companies who did not find an importer in Japan to enter the market, we offer extensive support services with exclusive price advantage. Premium Beauty News - Cosme Tokyo is held conjointly with Cosme Tech. What is this event about? Hajime Suzuki -  Showcasing ingredients, OEM, packaging and other products/services, Cosme Tech 2013 (4th Int’l Cosmetics Development Expo) is dedicated to suppliers of cosmetic brands.  The event is considered in Japan as the best and most efficient way for brand owners to source and compare all the key components required for developing a cosmetic range. These two concomitant shows have become Japan’s only exhibition covering the whole cosmetics industry from ingredients, OEM and packaging to finished products. Enabling visitors to grab both comprehensive overview on the whole industry and detailed information in each field, they have further enhanced their value as the must-attend event in the Japanese and Asian cosmetics industry.

"“Selective perfumery is at a crossroads,” William Koeberlé, FFPS","Premium Beauty News - With a decline in sales of 0.9% in value, 2012 was not an exciting year for the selective circuit in France? William Koeberlé - Unquestionably, the past year was rather disappointing. The selective circuit has declined, but it is part of a trend that began several years ago, with an erosion of sales volume, more or less offset by an increase in value. We can also observe that in the light of the current economic climate, this decline is not a cause for alarm. In addition, you must look at all the data. Figures provided by NDP take into account only part of the sales in our circuit. Neither sales of distributors’ own brands, those of exclusive brands, nor Internet sales are taken into account. While private labels represent a growing proportion of sales in selective distribution. If some brands in the selective circuit are indeed struggling, the ones which have innovated and managed to launch some interesting novelties have been very successful. I am thinking in particular of Clarins, Guerlain or Lancôme, but there are many more. Premium Beauty News - How do you explain the continued rise of private labels? William Koeberlé - The fact that they are very affordable makes them perfectly adapted to current needs. It is not only a question of price, they remain in the field of selective distribution with products that have a history and quality ingredients, but with a positioning which not challenged by major selective brands. In addition, for retailers, it’s a way of attracting customers from other distribution channels. Selective distribution in France is the predominant circuit for perfumes. Sales of cosmetics and skincare products are more challenged, either by supermarkets or by pharmacies. Own brands are an important asset to encourage customers who have entered selective points of sale to buy something else than perfume. Premium Beauty News - The openings of outlets offering alternative perfumes, brands little known to the general public, have mushroomed in recent years. Major brands themselves also launch perfumes with a very limited distribution. William Koeberlé - It is interesting and of course we are closely following this, like we are following more globally what is happening in the market. For now, sales figures in these outlets remain marginal compared to the rest of the market.  For the record, in France, 93% of women’s fragrances are sold in the selective perfumery circuit, versus 87% of men’s fragrances (according to NPD), and these openings reinforce this trend. Regarding the limited editions from major brands, this is not a new phenomenon. Brands have long since developed perfume ranges the distribution of which was limited to a few corners or owned stores. This is also an important element in the construction of their image. Premium Beauty News - On your arrival at the head of the French Federation of selective perfumery, you had set yourself three priorities: To maintain the regulation exempting selective distribution, the harmonization of practices in logistics, and negotiations on a new collective agreement to give new impetus to training. What is the situation like today? William Koeberlé - The renewal of the block exemption has been granted since 2010. The challenge now is to ensure that within this common framework, the same rules apply to all. I am referring obviously to pure players who sell on the internet, in particular fragrances, paying no heed of European rules. Regarding logistics, the joint working group set up with the FEBEA, (the French trade association representing cosmetic manufacturers) succeeded in adopting a manual of best logistics practices for the flow of goods and is continuing its work. This has allowed us to move ahead on traceability issues and on the procedures for the withdrawal of products in view of the entry into force of the new European regulation by July next, particularly to provide solutions to independent perfumeries. Finally, concerning the collective agreement, discussions with the unions are continuing. One of the issues is to decide whether we will continue to work under a separate collective agreement or if we consider joining an existing agreement. My belief is that this agreement should stand as the backbone of this specific business of ours and that is should give prominence to training issues. This is important especially for employees in independent perfumeries who are only trained by brands. Premium Beauty News - You mentioned online distribution, it was also the theme, during the last General Assembly of the FFPS, of the conference of the future of the sector, organised last October with the European federation of perfumery retail (FEPD). William Koeberlé - In France, online sales represent about 2% of sales in the selective circuit. It’s a rapidly growing circuit, even if its weight is not yet significant. Today, most of women from selective perfumery are active on the web: to compare, find tips and share views. The real change regards its position in the purchase cycle; 68% have visited a website before visiting one of our shops.  Internet is now an integral part of our business in terms of both communication and sales. But if the internet is a great tool for us, it can also represent a risk when websites outside the European Union behave like real pirates, with no respect for the rules in selective distribution or for those regarding the protection of clients or products’ traceability. Not to mention risks of counterfeiting and regarding product safety. The protection of our business goes hand in hand with the protection of our customers.  Customers, brands, players, internet: all of them contribute to the evolution of the old model of selective perfumery."
Russian beauty market expected to grow to EUR 15.6 billion by 2015,"The Russian cosmetics and personal care market is gradually recovering from the 2008-2009 recession. The Russian beauty market grew to an estimated USD 13.9 billion (EUR 10.75 billion) in 2012, compared to 13.5 billions (EUR 10.43 billion) in 2011 and is forecasted to reach USD 15.6 billion (EUR 12.06 billion) in 2015. The country’s new economic wealth is associated with rising incomes and increasing consumer expectations.  The main segments of the market are perfumed products (23%), skin care products (22.6%), hair care (19.2%) and make-up (15.4%). In parallel to the development of the market, the distribution was highly restructured in Russia. Open markets, with their amounts of goods of questionable origin, which had become emblematic of the post-communist era now account for only a fraction of the overall distribution of perfumes and cosmetics (7.2%).  Similarly, direct sales (internet excluded) carried on declining.  On the contrary, health and beauty retail chains and grocery retail channels saw continuous consolidation, with the largest retail players increasing their market presence. In October 2012, the number of beauty retail outlets increased by +24.2% (compared to the previous year).  The city of Moscow is the leader in specialized retail with some 800 point of sales and their number is expected to continue growing in the nearest future. This is accompanied, however, by a significant concentration of retailers.  In the selective distribution, the three major retail networks (L’Etoile, Ile de Beauté and Rive Gauche) are dominating the market, in particular in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and are extending their network nationally. Besides national retail chains some 25 regional specialized retailers operate in the market. The biggest are Seven days (Voronezh), Novex (Siberia), Podruzhka (Moscow), Alpari (Tatarstan). In parallel, the “Drogerie” format has been developing actively. In October 2012, the number of “drogeries” increased by +25% (compared to the previous year).  Among the biggest market players are Magnit Kosmetik, Podruzhka, Ol!Good, Yuzhny Dvor, etc.  This retail format is expected to be one of the most dynamic over the next years. As their familiarity with cosmetic products is increasing, Russian consumers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their product choices and tend to spend money more rationally.  The marketing strategies of specialized retail chains, based on discounts, have also simulated changes in consumption patterns.  This trend, which is forecasted to continue, is prompting retailers and manufacturers to explore new ways to communicate with their targets. To date, manufacturers are continuing to exploit natural claims that continue to be highly attractive for consumers."
Cosmoprof defends its global leadership,"In the context of a declining Italian beauty market, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is defending its global leadership, closing its 2013 edition with a 14% increase in visitors, including a 22% increase of visitors from abroad (48,823 foreign visitors out of 193,842). The whole show hosted 2,390 exhibitors, including 666 Italian companies and more than 1,500 from abroad (272 exhibitors from China, 161 from France, 143 from the USA, 125 from Germany and 113 from Spain.  “These figures are testament to the global mission of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna. Together with the platforms of Las Vegas and Hong Kong, it has once again shown itself to be the most important trade fair worldwide in the cosmetics and beauty sector,” claim the organizers. There was a new location for Cosmopack, the exhibition area dedicated to packaging, machinery and contract production. In order to address the specific needs of exhibitors in this area, the separation between Cosmopack and the rest of the show has been increased:  in space, with the reorganisation of the entire exhibiting area on the same floor, and in time, with the packaging show-in-the-show opening one day before the rest of the show, and closing one day before too. Furthermore, the organisers also stressed the role of Italy in the production supply chain of cosmetic products, reconstituting a lipstick production chain with the help of Alma Cosmetics, Citus, Coesia Group, For lab Italia, Inca Cosmetics, Intercosmografica, IDM Automation, Omnicos Group, TGM. As far as finished products are concerned, green cosmetics are still particularly in fashion, with an entire pavilion dedicated to the sector and 198 exhibitors focusing on eco-sustainability. The perfumery sector displayed a trend towards strong, spicy and sweet fragrances, with 40 exhibitors from the Middle East, and many other perfume brands with a clear focus towards this geographical area. According to Duccio Campagnoli, President of BolognaFiere and SoGeCos, the company that organises Cosmoprof, “the new Cosmoprof is increasingly international and professional.” The next edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna will be held from April 11th-14th, 2014."
France: the new players of luxury perfumery,"The situation is rather worrisome. According to the NPD Group, after a good year in 2011 (+3% in value), the French market for fragrances and cosmetics sold in the selective channel (high-end specialised beauty stores) recorded a slight decline in 2012 (-0.9% in value). However, selective retail in France is also suffering of a loss of buyers.  According to Kantar Worldpanel, 3 million buyers have left it since 2010.  Especially, for the first time in 2012 older and affluent consumers - the core target of selective retail - have begun to turn to other horizons. Actors of the French selective market must therefore find new growth drivers for 2013.  And fragrances are certainly a key factor for that.  Actually, on the one hand, this circuit seems highly (too?) dependent on sales of fragrances and, on the other hand, retailers have difficulties to differentiate themselves in this segment. In parallel to the traditional selective channel, which is dominated in France by Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé, small retailers are exploring ne avenues and are trying to bring about a new conception of luxury perfumery. Several perfumeries in French provincial cities - Parfumerie de l’Opéra in Bordeaux, Parfumerie Santa Rosa in Toulouse, or Parfumerie du Soleil d’Or in Lille - already proposed to their customers a real alternative offer, but they had no equivalent in Paris, where the offer was fragmented between brand owned stores, department stores and fashion concept stores such as Colette or L’Éclaireur.  But during the latest years, several new outlets have been filling this gap and seem to have found their customers: Jovoy, in the Rue de Castiglione, in the upscale and touristic Place Vendôme area, Sens Unique and Marie Antoinette, in the Marais, and Nose in the Montorgueil district.  ""Buyers of niche brands were already there, but nobody - or hardly anybody - was addressing their demand,” Nicolas Cloutier, co-founder and President of Nose, recently told Premium Beauty News. Nevertheless, marketing alternative perfumery products in France remains a hard job.  There are about 20 to 30 outlets in France - traditional stores or concept-stores - that propose an alternative to the standard offer. In Germany or in Italy there are 250 to 300 of them, and they have developed a specific knowledge about rare perfumery. One question remains: what is the weight of these products on the market?  About 4% of the global perfumery market, deemed David Frossard, co founder of Différentes Latitudes, last year during a conference in Paris. Actually, there are hardly any figures available.  NPD deems that, in the US, these brands strongly outpace the growth of rest of the market.  “The fragrance brands that are being sold in more selective distribution are experiencing explosive growth. We’ve seen this trend with high-end designer brands like Tom Ford and Jimmy Choo and this is also evident today with jewelry and niche fragrance brands,” said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. “Even though niche and jewelry brands make up only nine percent of the total prestige fragrance market they are creating a new dynamic in the larger fragrance arena. They are growing faster than any other type of fragrance in the prestige space and their combined sales are actually more than double the size of prestige celebrity fragrances.” Is the situation is similar in France?  This is, among other things, what will be discussed by the various speakers at the conference ""Parfums d’exception, parfums d’avenir?"" organized by Beauteam and Premium Beauty News in Paris on April 9, 2013.

Euromonitor decodes top five beauty trends in North and South America,"""The Americas [1] continued to be a dynamic hemisphere for Beauty and Personal Care products in 2012 with more potential for growth in 2013,"" says Euromonitor’s Latin American Research Manager, Sean Kreidler. ""Latin America is very active in expanding awareness with its consumer base by way of direct selling and expansion with modern store-based retailers. In North America, Canada and the USA lead product innovation and customer shopping experiences."" Another difference between North and South America: mass cosmetic products - or products at a lower price point - represent over 90% of sales in every country in Latin America, whereas premium cosmetics account for 35% of sales in Canada and the United States. According to the market research firm, direct selling represents over a quarter of all beauty and personal care sales in North and South America, which is the highest regional share in the world.  Direct sellers continue to expand in Argentina and lead the market in Bolivia. Brazil, on the other hand, is seeing a push toward store-based retailing, with the expansion of beauty specialist retailers such as Sephora. Several other Latin American countries are experiencing strong retail growth as pharmacies and hypermarkets are now reaching consumers where only direct sellers ventured before. Apart from direct selling, Euromonitor International identifies four other main trends: Middle income consumers benefiting from the economic growth drive beauty and personal care sales throughout Latin America, most notably in Brazil and Peru. On the other hand, Argentina and Venezuela are battling surging inflation that has eroded consumers’ purchasing power. Men’s grooming continues to shine in Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru and the USA; however, men’s grooming might struggle in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador where future potential lies in men increasingly making their own purchasing decisions. Premium products keep growing in Chile, Costa Rica and México and remain a priority for many consumers in Venezuela, despite poor economic conditions. In Canada, premium brands are recovering to drive growth. Product innovation is growing rapidly in Bolivia and México. Canada and the USA are seeing advanced skin care technology development, and the demand for products containing natural ingredients present growth opportunities in Colombia, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.

Marionnaud opts for nature,"For this new line, Marionnaud chose an original environmental positioning that was not really prevalent on the French cosmetics market so far, since ""natural"" there was more or less understood as ""organic."" Actually, the Marionnaud Nature skincare range claims at least 90% natural ingredients (fruits and flowers) and an environment friendly manufacturing process.  But it is not an organic line and its natural claims are not certified by an independent third party, as it was becoming usual. The products are free from parabens, silicone and synthetic dyes and, with the exception of shea butter, their natural ingredients (calendula flower, cherry blossom, clover blossom, cassis, physalis, etc.) are produced ""locally"", i.e. in Europe.  Also for environmental reasons, the retailer has selected European production sites (Alban Muller in France and Hampshire Cosmetics in the UK) for their performance and with the aim to optimize the carbon footprint of products sold in its European outlets. While in 2008, its first private label line was certified organic, the beauty retailer is opting for another radical choice today by making natural and environmental claims but getting rid of certification.  A choice that Marionnaud explains by its will to address ""the growing needs of customers increasingly aware of environmental issues,"" but who are not ready to ""sacrificing the quality of their cosmetics and the part of dream of beauty rituals."" In short: sustainable development, and pleasure, rather than organic. With this new range of 15 products (makeup removers, cleansers, moisturizers and well-being) for the face and the body, Marionnaud intends to strengthen the attractiveness of its outlets. ""60% of the French never push the door of a perfumery shop.  Actually, we are launching our own line of products in order to increase the accessibility of skincare products sold in perfumery shops. We want women and men to discover a shopping experience made of attention and advice,” says Fabrice Obenans, Marketing Director at Marionnaud. As for other Marionnaud private label brands (Bio by Marionnaud, launched in 2008, Les Essentiels Marionnaud, launched in April 2010, Swiss Apple Formula and Marionnaud Men, launched in 2011) products are unsurprisingly offered at quite affordable prices (from 4.90 to 14.90 euros). In 2012, Marionnaud private label skincare products accounted for almost 20% of the retailer’s sales volume. However, this is significantly lower than for its two main direct competitors in the French market, Nocibé and Sephora, which have invested more in this area when Marionnaud chose to focus on major brands.  “Customers are increasingly mobile and can opt for a retailer’s brand skincare while succumbing for a selective item at the same time. Our role as a retailer is to support this freedom,” says Fabrice Obenans. Marionnaud Nature new skincare range for the face and the body will be on sale as of March 21, 2013 in 288 stores (out of 1,100 Marionnaud outlets in Europe) and on the site marionnaud.com."
"China, India and Russia among the top 5 largest economies in 2020","By 2020, three of the world’s five largest economies will be emerging countries, accounting for 30.4% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms [1]. At this date, the world’s largest markets will be China, the USA, India, Japan and Russia.  “Advanced economies are being displaced by emerging market superpowers, notably the BRIC countries, which has been accelerated by the seismic effects of the global economic downturn of 2008-2009,” says Media Eghbal, Country Insight Manager at Euromonitor International. India overtook Japan as the world’s third largest economy in PPP terms in 2011 and its demographic advantage means the country could become the world’s biggest economy in the coming decades. Euromonitor International predicts that China will become the world’s largest economy in PPP terms in 2017 and will account for 19.0% of global GDP in PPP terms by 2020.  However, China is also facing big challenges, including rising labour costs, pollution, a potential real estate bubble and rapid ageing.  The market research firm predicts that China’s working age population (aged 15-64) will decline from 2014. Furthermore, Russia should overtake Germany as the world’s fifth largest economy in 2016, driven by its energy sector. The country also offers potential in its rapidly expanding consumer market, which Euromonitor forecasts will be the ninth largest globally in real terms in 2020. However, the lack of economic diversification and modernisation, as well as declining working-age population, remain key long-term challenges. “These shifts will influence global politics, business environments and investment flows while consumer markets in developing countries will rise in importance as the middle class expands,” Euromonitor notes. Actually, global cosmetic players, such as L’Oréal, Estée Lauder or Procter & Gamble are already anticipating the shift. L’Oréal for instance is investing heavily in India and recently inaugurated a new Research and Innovation (R&I) Center to study Indian hair and skin specificities.  The French cosmetics giant aims to quadruple its sales in this country.  “New markets” (Asia-Pacific, Eastern and Central Europe, Africa, and Middle-East) are already L’Oréal’s number one geographic zone, accounting for 40% of the group’s turnover.  Last November, the group inaugurated a giant factory in Indonesia to serve South-East Asian markets, and it will open a new plant in Egypt in 2013 to serve the Middle East area."
Nine in ten British consumers now on a budget,"The United Kingdom does stand away from the spreading of economic austerity over Europe and is bracing itself for another year of cuts.  In this context, budget Britain is in full swing with nine in ten (89%) Brits now on a budget, new research from Mintel reveals [1].  “For many, budgeting has become a part of daily life and it seems Britain’s affluent are feeling the pinch too,” says the market research firm. Mintel’s research finds nearly half (44%) of all Brits are budgeting more than they were this time last year.  Today, as many as nearly nine in ten (89%) Brits shop on a budget, and a further 9% don’t budget but are keeping a track of what they spend.  Indeed, proving the impact of post recession Britain, just 2% of Brits admit to not having a budget or tracking their spends. Families are the group most likely to budget, with nearly half (48%) of parents reporting they had a stricter budget over the past year. Meanwhile, it seems Britain’s women are the savviest shoppers - nearly one in two (49%) reporting an increase in budgeting over the past year compared to less than four in ten (39%) men. “The downturn over the last few years has changed spending and budgeting habits in the UK. We have gone from a nation of borrowers and over-spenders to a nation of savers and savvy shoppers. The constant reminders of the dire state of the UK economy, together with what we have seen happen in Europe over the last few years, means that budgeting, saving and discounts have become words ingrained in the consumer psyche,” said Ina Mitskavets, Senior Consumer and Lifestyles Analyst at Mintel. Mintel’s research also shows how consumers on high incomes (those earning £50,000 and above) are likely to jump on the “budget bandwagon” - with some 90% of high earners claiming that they budget.  Today’s high earners are particularly savvy with their shopping activities - leading the way in using discounts and special offers when shopping.  Indeed, while 70% of all consumers use in store discounts such as buy-one-get-one-free, this rises to 73% of high earners.  Rewards and loyalty cards are used by an average of 66% of Brits, again this rises to 75% of high earners.  Finally, percentage off total purchase is used by an average of 52% of Brits compared to some 59% of high earners. “Even the more well-to-do shoppers show more reserve with their finances in uncertain economic times. Budgeting is becoming an ingrained habit, as people are reluctant to flash the cash and appear to be taking pride in being more financially conservative than in the past.  Rising costs of childcare, coupled with austerity measures such as the slashing of child tax credits and the loss of child benefit for middle and high income earners, mean that the squeeze is only set to get tighter for families,” Ina continues. Some seven in ten (70%) adults have used discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free or 2-for-1 in the last six months.  Meanwhile, rewards or loyalty schemes are favoured by two thirds (66%) of shoppers while percentage off total purchase discounts by one in two (52%) consumers.  Coupons from the Internet (32%) and magazines (29%) are the next most popular ways for consumers to save money whilst shopping. Just under half (44%) of all discount users used them to buy clothing and accessories and 38% used special offers to eat out or to buy groceries in the past six months. “This shows that people are working to stretch their money not only to help make ends meet, but also to put a little pleasure into their lives,” Ina Mitskavets says. “The market has responded well to consumer demand for low prices. However, as shoppers get increasingly savvy, retailers will need to look beyond price points if they want to retain customers who are increasingly selective and less brand loyal,” she concludes."
Organic cosmetics deadlocked?,"The January edition of the Matinales de la Cosmétiques, the monthly event organized by SRC Consulting, was dedicated to the ability of the organic cosmetics to meet consumer expectations. Marie Alice Dibon (Alice Communications) and Sandie Jaidane (SJ Consulting) have investigated the gap between consumer expectations regarding natural and organic cosmetics and the real market offer. According to them, despite favourable market trends, which result in undeniably strong sales, natural or organic cosmetics did not succeeded to convince consumers they are able to meet all of their expectations. Despite double digits annual growth rates in many countries, the organic and natural beauty market remains a niche market. In France for instance, while sales rose at an average of 25% per year between 2005 and 2011, natural and organic cosmetics accounted for only 2% of the total market in 2011, according to Deloitte [1]. In Germany, where they hold the biggest share of the market, natural and organic cosmetics account for 6.5% of the market, not more. Paradoxically, the number of players in this narrow market has skyrocketed and launches have boomed. According to research firm Organic Monitor, the French market witnessed the highest number of launches in Europe [2].  Ethical SMEs that pioneered the market have been joined by other types of players offering new organic or natural brands for all the market segments, and also by conventional brands expanding their offering with organic lines. In such a competitive environment, the early signs of a market downturn are necessarily having damaging consequences. Thus, the group Clarins decided to put an end to the market life of the Kibio brand it had acquired in 2010. Despite significant investments, the brand never really succeeded to impose itself. Earlier in 2012, Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of L’Oréal, had already expressed its disappointment regarding the growth of the organic market as a whole and the results of its Sanoflore brand in particular. However, in addition to these iconic brands, many small brands have disappeared after two or three years trying to find a place in a quite limited market. Yet, despite the economic crisis, all studies show the persistence and progression of environmental and ethical concerns, and the high expectations regarding health and wellness among consumers. The trend remains strong in Europe and in North America, despite slower growth rates than in the past. According to Deloitte, the French market is expected to grow at a steady pace (around 10% per year), while marked ""by the stronger requirement of consumers in terms of corporate social responsibility and product benefits.” Indeed, even when they are highly aware about ethics and the environment, consumers are not willing to give up their demands for quality and efficiency. According to Marie Alice Dibon, the proliferation of logos and certifications has not been an adequate response to consumer expectations. ""Actually, none of the existing certification currently covers all of their main concerns: effective but healthy products, sustainable and environmentally friendly products, ethical products.” Another problem is that, in a market where dreams and pleasure are important parts of the shopping and consumption experiences, natural and organic brands have adopted a very basic positioning. For a long time, their main selling argument has been limited to the absence of supposed harmful ingredients in their formula. It was the famous ""free from"" trend:  free from parabens, free from phthalates, free from aluminium... In a competitive environment, which remains increasingly harsh, especially with the rise of retailers’ brands, organic and natural brands must strive to convince consumers about the sincerity and consistency of their approach, but also to reassure them about their effectiveness. Organic and natural brands, especially those with a high-end positioning must also develop an attractive brand universe in order to appeal to consumers and being capable of conveying the expected dreams. Actually, required investments in R&D and in marketing should increase significantly therefore leading to the exit of the weakest players and a restructuration of the market through alliances and buyouts. The year 2013 will also be marked by important regulatory changes with, in the one hand, the full ban on animal testing in Europe and, on the other hand, the entry into force of a new European legislation that is particularly demanding about safety. The increasingly stringent regulatory framework, combined with sometimes very ambitious sustainability initiatives from traditional players such as Unilever, could both increase the barriers to entry into the market while limiting the differentiation opportunities for new players. The development of an ISO standard to harmonize global definitions of natural and organic cosmetics may have similar effects. Eventually, according to Sandie Jaidane, “organic products are not becoming the standard, but the standards are becoming more organic and natural.”"
US prestige beauty sales up 7% last year,"Sales of prestige brands, those sold primarily in department stores, showed an increase of seven percent in dollar sales in 2012 compared to 2011, said The NPD Group.  The US market thus performed much better than the European one, where sales declined in France (-1%), in Italy (-4%) and in Spain (-7%) and progressed by 5% in the United Kingdom. “Coming off the wave of 2011, one of the most robust sales periods in over a decade for the beauty industry, 2012 has shown some great highs, along with some modest lows,” said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. According to the market research firm, all of the U.S. prestige beauty categories posted healthy growth. Prestige skincare sold in U.S. department stores generated the largest growth at 10 percent, followed by makeup at seven percent and fragrance at five percent, compared to 2011. “Even though consumer confidence continues to waver, there is momentum at both ends of the price and product spectrum. In 2012, along with smaller categories in beauty, we are seeing investment spending on premium-priced makeup, skincare, fragrance, as well as premium-priced sets, which lead in growth once again. Even in Europe, where the economic environment is more challenging, the major premium-priced category, fragrance, was positive. Premium-priced products remain one of the brightest spots in beauty and will continue to carve out market share across all categories and geographies in the New Year,” said Grant. In comparison, the U.S. Food/Drug/Mass [1] channel recorded a lower growth, recording nearly a three percent increase in sales for total beauty in 2012, versus 2011. Mass makeup sales posted the biggest increase at five percent, followed by skincare at three percent, while fragrance sales declined four percent in dollar sales, compared to 2011. Furthermore, in National Chain [2] stores, fragrance sales grew seven percent, reported The NPD Group. “In the U.S., although we have seen some tempering in sales performance, compared to 2011, growth remains positive for both the prestige and mass channels. The trend of prestige beauty outpacing mass beauty continues to be evident since the recessionary period of 2009 and will likely continue into 2013,” ended Grant."
Global male grooming market bouncing back,"Growing consciousness among men concerning their appearance and increasing awareness regarding the benefits of products specific to men are driving the growth of men’s skin care products worldwide, reveals market research firm Kline & Company in its recently published report, Male Grooming Products: Global Market Brief. While Europe is the largest market for male grooming products, Asia is posting the highest growth. The advanced markets of Japan and South Korea are benefiting from male grooming, including the use of cosmetics, as an entrenched socially encouraged practice wherein men are seeking to retain a youthful and appealing look. By contrast, within China and India, male grooming as a trend has only recently been developing its significant potential and is being assisted by greater disposable income among consumers. Although the European male grooming market is growing at a comparatively slower pace, products are generally more sophisticated and leading brands vary from country to country. The leading male grooming industry marketers in Europe’s strongest market of Germany are Nivea for Men, L’Oréal Men Expert, and DM’s Balea Men. “Our extensive research has revealed a myriad of exciting developments,” notes Nancy Mills, Kline’s Consumer Products Practice Industry Manager. “One that strikes most, revealed in the consumer part of the research, concerns the major cultural shift observed across all age groups of men in countries previously reluctant to extend male grooming beyond basic cleaning and shaving. Essentially, this is opening up a largely untapped market that consists of half the population.” The consumer research comprising of responses on the topic of grooming from over 1,500 males between the ages of 15 and 69 spanning six core countries also reveals actionable granularity, such as the least popular market for conditioners is Germany, while demand for hair styling mousse is highest in China. Category strength continues to vary between regions. Deodorants and antiperspirants is the largest and most fragmented category across the globe. Partly due to a tendency to utilize deodorant sheets instead of a Western style spray/solid/gel/roll-on formats, the category is weakest in some Asian countries. However, the category’s growth numbers in these countries also reveals a move towards Western-preferred formats. Regarding male grooming products distribution channels, the dominating popularity of mass merchandisers can be seen across all categories and countries. Alternate channels are also changing the male grooming products retail landscape, with Internet shopping making great gains. In China, men are also the highest frequenters of upscale department stores, with 29% of Chinese respondents saying that’s where they shop for skin care products."
France: high-end beauty market declined in 2012,"According to NPD Group, sales of perfumes and cosmetics in selective perfumery shops, which now generate 2830 million euros in France, recorded a slight decrease in value (-0.9%) in 2012 compared to 2011, which was a record year for the sector. The decrease is more pronounced in volume (-3%). Sales remained flat in December, which is a crucial month as it accounts for more than 20% of the selective channel’s annual turnover. In comparison, sales in December 2011 had experienced a very strong growth in value (+8%) compared to the same period in 2010. Under these conditions, the overall market decline is not a surprise. However, according to Mathilde Puszka, Beauty Analyst at NPD Group, ""the French market is still doing better than its neighbours, Italy and Spain, where sales in value will respectively decline by 3.6 and 6.7% in 2012.” NPD Group’s data show a decline of 1% of sales of fragrances in France in 2012. Women’s fragrances (-0.7% in value) are performing better than men’s fragrances (- 1.4% in value). Indeed, the impact of launches has been lower for men’s fragrances, while women’s fragrances have benefited this year from the successful launches of La Petite Robe Noire by Guerlain, La Vie est Belle by Lancôme, Manifesto by Yves Saint Laurent or Coco Noir by Chanel, Dior Addict Eau Fraîche and Eau Sensuelle by Dior. However these developments failed to stimulate an increase in sales compared to 2011. Makeup segments also recorded an overall decline (-1.4%), in context where new products, which usually account for 16% of sales in this category, had a lower impact in 2012. ""Makeup is highly dependent from innovations. In 2011, the market had benefited from the launches of major products such as Guerlain’s Terracotta or the Dior Addict’s lipsticks. Actually, more than new products, they were re-launches of iconic products. In 2012, there many new products but they were less appealing and therefore had a more limited impact on sales,"" said Mathilde Puszka. Skincare, which was traditionally the category that suffered the most in the selective beauty channel, succeeded to stabilize itself (-0.2%), mainly thanks to the dynamism of anti-aging sales that rose by 1.6% in value in 2012, with the launch or re-launch of innovative and sophisticated products. Brands have also invested heavily on specific products for the eyes, including including Clinique with the Even Better range, Dior with Capture Totale and Capture XP or Lancôme with Génifique et Rénergie Multi-Lift.  ""Innovation is absolutely required in the anti-aging segment as new products generate a quarter of sales,"" says Mathilde Puszka. Nail polishes [1] formed the other very dynamic segment in 2012, with sales progressing by 7.8% in value compared to the previous year. The NPD Group estimates that this market has more than doubled since 2006 in terms of revenue but also of sold units. Actually, with an average price of 17 euros in high-end beauty stores, nail polishes remain an affordable luxury."
The beauty industry bets on digital technologies,"A wide range of digital tools, the effectiveness of which has been more or less assessed, is available to brands that want to to capture the attention of consumers, turn their visits into purchases, or increase their loyalty. Students from ESCP Europe commissioned by the BeautyFULL Club [1] have studied a wide array of existing technologies and tried to assess them through a grid taking into account, their impact on visits in retail outlets, on the brand’s reputation and image, on the collection of customer information, or the return on investment. Then, they tried to investigate future trends. From augmented reality contests on mobile phones to e-mailing campaigns, through holograms within shop, interactive displays or YouTube channels: technical possibilities seem almost limitless when it comes to attracting the attention of consumers and highlighting a brand’s values. However, said the group of students, all of these techniques must be evaluated in terms of their impact on the reputation and image of the brands. Depending on brands’ market positioning, these tools can be used to preserve the brand image, to optimize the recruitment of clients or to build an interactive and immersive relationship with the brands’ values. In all cases, ""the aesthetic of the brand must prevail over purely technological issues.” Beyond their capacity to seduce consumers, digital technologies have already demonstrated their ability to generate significant sales. The e-commerce market share in cosmetics retail sale in France reaches 2%, to compare to 9% in China. In parallel, while the market for high-end cosmetics is growing by about 5% per year worldwide, online sales are progressing by 30% on average, but at very uneven rates, ranging from 12.5% in the United States, 45% in Russia and 66% in China, and 20% in France. At this level, however, it is necessary to take into account the particularities of each country, especially in terms of payment and delivery habits. However, if online sales of cosmetics are constantly increasing, 71.7% of consumers still say they prefer to buy in high street stores rather than on the web. However, they are almost as many (69%) to consider that the new digital technologies make brick and mortar retail stores more attractive. According to the ESCP Europe students, beauty retail trends are definitely proving to head towards outlet digitalization. New technologies are emerging clearly as a propeller for the acquisition of new customers and the transformation of visits into purchases: 87% of consumers believe that technological innovation contribute to upgrade retail stores, and 74% that they are timesaving. Once again, the list of available technologies is impressive: 3D without glasses, digital flasks, tactile holograms, applications for smartphones, indoor GPS, mobile cash desks, etc.  Their objectives vary from brand promotion, consumer education, purchasing and payment facilitation. Because of their low cost and a high equipment rate of consumers, smartphone applications rank first and are proliferating, in particular for consumer information purposes. For instance, noting that nearly one third of consumers are using their mobile phone at the point of sale, in particular to obtain information and advice, L’Oréal has developed InstantBeauty, an application that allows scanning barcodes of L’Oréal Paris products in order to retrieve information. For its part, Sephora has chosen to equip sales consultants in its 50 top stores in France with an application allowing them to better advise clients. New digital equipment is also entering outlets.  In the United States, Sephora has launched, in cooperation with X-Rite/Pantone, a system that measures colour values of customers’ skin tone to facilitate the choice of a suitable foundation. The same system is now being deployed in Boots stores in the UK. As far as payment methods are concerned, innovations are legion but have to cope with security concerns and the problems linked to their complexity. Many systems are being tested but, so far, current technologies lack of maturity are seem far from being able to revolutionize the act of purchase. System swap tested by Sephora in its stores in New York seems promising to relieve the shops and avoid the abandonment of purchase intentions as a result of waiting too long in body. Also note that some technologies may face hostility from consumers, for reasons of privacy protection, or may have to cope more stringent legal frameworks. Obviously, students from the ESCP also investigated the issue of customer relations. While 70% of consumers use social networks and 80% consult reviews published on the Internet, many brands have developed strategies at this level, in more advanced cases, these strategies may include the incorporation of social networks in ecommerce platforms, or the set up of online concierge services for the most important clients, or the co-creation of products. As far as technology is concerned, the dematerialization of the loyalty cards seems on track, as well as, especially for mass retail, mobile phone couponing. Finally, regarding the future, the study focuses on the potential of contactless technologies to streamline in store purchases, on outlets optimization based on the study of customers’ movements through GPS tracking (indoor-mapping), or even on holographic projections of customers enabling to test makeup on a virtual clones. Who said that traditional shops are no longer surprising anyone?"
Emerging countries to boost global fragrance market ,"Revenues in the fragrances industry are likely to continue to develop at dynamic rates in the upcoming eight years. ""We forecast global revenues of more than US$15.6 billion to be generated in 2019"", explains Oliver Kutsch, CEO of Ceresana, a market research firm headquartered in Germany. As the number of customers demanding fragranced products is rising all over the world, the study points out the importance the emerging countries in South America and Asia-Pacific as growth propellers for this sector. “Fragrances are becoming more important all over the world,” say the authors of the study. Indeed, due to the economic development of many emerging countries, an increasing part of the population has access to products enhanced by added fragrances, in éparticular because fragrances are used in a wide variety of products, from cleaning agents and detergents, to perfumes and the vast majority of personal care products.  In emerging countries, a growing middle-class disposes of an increasing income that allows them to purchase and consume such products. “Urbanization trends in already highly industrialized countries continue as well; consumption of scented products in cities is higher,” they add. As many producers offer a broad collective product portfolio that caters to both standard and niche applications, the fragrances industry is subject to strong competition and affected by a strong push for innovation based on extensive market knowledge as well as up-to-date research and development. “The general trend in fragrances is likely to continue to develop at the favour of exotic varieties. Customers that get to know these scents due to ongoing globalization are increasingly demanding such products. At the same time, the high pace of life many people experience also increases demand for harmonic fragrances that allow them to enjoy short moments of relaxation,” highlight Ceresana analysts. Sustainability results achieved through in efforts to optimize ecological, economic and social impacts are the other major demand  from customers.  Fragrance manufacturers are therefore encouraged “to develop and manufacture natural products that pose no risk to human beings and the environment.” In particular, products made from renewable resources that can be processed without hazardous substances are appealing to producers and consumers alike."
Ten consumer trends for 2013,"Euromonitor has chosen not to highlight so ubiquitous global trends such as “thrift, urban consumers and the consumer love affair with mobile technology.”  Nevertheless, even at this second level, the market research firm notes that consumer trends are increasingly globalised.  “The lack of a dedicated trend about emerging market consumers underlines the fact that our world is no longer experienced as ‘The West and the Rest’,” wrote Daphne Kasriel-Alexander, consumers editor at Euromonitor, in a blog post about the report. Euromonitor’s top ten consumer trends for this year: 1. Spending on convenience nudging into the quest for value The recessionary consumer’s dislike of paying for convenience is softening. Consumers are tempted by bite-sized brand offerings aimed at emerging and now developed market shoppers and greater novelty and superior niche services. Consumer reviews also cut the risk of trying something new. 2. Crowded house redux Multigenerational and other combined living arrangements are leading to shifting consumption patterns as the ‘floating generation’ stay or return home to economise while peers and even separated couples are forced to cohabit. 3. Downtime decoded Digital life is making ‘leisure’ harder to define and even as ‘digital detox’ periods are shared digitally, holidaymakers are ‘smoasting’ – using social networking to boast about their holiday fun. Meanwhile health-conscious consumers are working hard to stay fit. 4. Food - more than a life staple Food is now celebrated, avoided, greener, healthier, grown in more urban spaces and hopefully safer. 5. Gendered consumption RIP? Gender-specific consumption and outlooks may be fading – apparent in everything from unisex tech preferences, to new gaming audiences and traditionally female behaviour feted in business situations. 6. Local love Things local are capturing the consumer imagination as more prosocial consumers (those who care about others and society as a whole) reject ‘burbiness’ (a term that reflects commercialism and the prevalence of chain stores) and global brands court local cultural relevance and tastes. 7. Older and off to work and train More tech-savvy, active and image-conscious older consumers need and want to work and spend comfortably for longer as more governments and firms are raising or abolishing retirement thresholds. 8. Parenting lifestyles Parents buying to suit themselves and tomorrow’s generation - including ‘shopturnals’, yummy mummies, parents befriending their teens online, stay-at-home dads, ‘tiger mothers’, ‘idle parents’, parent bloggers and gifts in lieu of time spent with kids. 9. Shopping like it’s the future New tech-driven shopping culture reveals generational faultlines. Brands are focusing on interpreting consumer lifestyles to reach out to customers warming to innovation. ‘Showrooming’, gamification, Facebook’s piloted ‘want’ button and in-store digital information offerings are all part of this trend. 10. The roll call of consumer concerns A catalogue of often-disparate concerns preoccupies swelling consumer segments. These include bigger peoples’ needs, long tail via the net, the quest for simplicity and the grasp of consumer data as an asset to brands. There are even havens for smokers."
Emerald named Colour of the Year for 2013,"According to Pantone, a subsidiary of X-Rite, the global leader in colour science and technology, most often associated with brilliant, precious gemstones, the perception of emerald is sophisticated and luxurious, since antiquity, this luminous, magnificent hue has been the colour of beauty and new life in many cultures and religions. “This powerful and universally-appealing tone translates easily to both fashion and home interiors,” said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. The emerald vivid and verdant green succeeds to Pantone 17-1463 Tangerine Tango, the 2012 colour of the year, a spirited reddish orange. “The prevalence of green has been steadily rising for several seasons now, especially in the fashion and couture markets, and even on the Red Carpet,” Pantone observes. Emerald’s classic elegance makes for striking and irresistible women’s formal, everyday wear and accessories. Emerald also makes a strong statement in men’s sportswear, knitwear and ties. Fashion designers featured in the Pantone Fashion Color Report Spring 2013, including Tracy Reese, Nanette Lepore, Barbara Tfank, NAHM and Marimekko, are incorporating Emerald into their spring collections. “Balanced, yet sophisticated, Emerald enlivens all colors in the spectrum and will continue to make a statement beyond spring and summer into fall and winter.” On the cosmetic colour wheel, Emerald dramatizes all eye colours. It is compatible to blue eyes, emphasizes the green undertone in hazel eyes and intensifies brown eyes to make them appear deeper. “Emerald is also a perfect complement to peaches, pinks, roses, ruby reds and aubergines – offering a variety of lipstick and blush options. For those who want to sparkle and stand out, Emerald is the perfect punctuation point in nail color because of its complementary nature,” Pantone highlights. Whether in paints or accessories, the emerald touch of wellbeing and luxury will spread to entryways, powder rooms, dining rooms or studies. It will also extend to bedding, pillows, bath towels, accessories, kitchens and dining rooms, including dinnerware, stemware and appliances. Pantone and Tollens, a leader in the European paint industry, have already concluded a partnership to give birth to an exclusive paint collection, Tollens inspired by Pantone, available throughout France in 2013.  By March 2013, the Castorama DIY network will launch of a 40-colours ready-mix paint collection, followed by the launch of a 100-shades colour collection in Tollens exclusive professional network in June. Pantone 17-5641 Emerald will be the flagship colour in both collections. In order to select the colour of the year, Pantone’s teams quite literally comb the world looking for colour influences. This can include the entertainment industry and films that are in production, traveling art collections, hot new artists, popular travel destinations and other socio-economic conditions. Influences may also stem from technology, availability of new textures and effects that impact colour, and even upcoming sports events that capture worldwide attention. Past colours of the year include: – PANTONE 17-1463 Tangerine Tango (2012) 
– PANTONE 18-2120 Honeysuckle (2011) 
– PANTONE 15-5519 Turquoise (2010) 
– PANTONE 14-0848 Mimosa (2009) 
– PANTONE 18-3943 Blue Iris (2008) 
– PANTONE 19-1557 Chili Pepper (2007) 
– PANTONE 13-1106 Sand Dollar (2006) 
– PANTONE 15-5217 Blue Turquoise (2005) 
– PANTONE 17-1456 Tigerlily (2004) 
– PANTONE 14-4811 Aqua Sky (2003) 
– PANTONE 19-1664 True Red (2002) 
– PANTONE 17-2031 Fuchsia Rose (2001) 
– PANTONE 15-4020 Cerulean (2000)"
Fragrance brands that French like best,"The survey was conducted online from November 28 to December 15, 2012, on a representative sample of 1,082 people (including 1,000 perfume buyers), aged 18 and over.  On the one hand, Promise Consulting Inc. measured brand awareness and, on the second hand, calculated a ""desirability index"" and made a focus on the brands that men and women would like to buy for their own use and the women and men would offer to the other. The 10 fragrances women prefer for themselves: Actually, perfumes belonging to the ""floral"" family (Dior J’adore, Chanel n°5, Nina Ricci Nina, Lancôme Trésor) and those of the ""oriental"" family (Kenzo Flower, Dior La Petite Robe Noire, Lolita Lempicka 1er parfum) seem to be the ones that women like the best. The 10 most popular fragrances among men to offer to women: When it comes to offering a fragrance to a woman, men opt for traditional choices, with Chanel’s No. 5, Dior’s J’adore and Guerlain’s Shalimar topping the list. The 10 fragrances men prefer for themselves: When it comes to choosing a perfume, men appreciate brands that symbolize virility and that reflect their masculine identity, however, Jean-Paul Gaultier, with Le mâle, has succeeded to attract buyers with a more androgynous offer. The 10 most popular fragrances among women to offer to men: Finally, when it comes to offering a fragrance to a man, women also do opt for brands with an old history on the market."
"Alain Khaiat: ""Properly targeting the needs of Asian consumers is a key factor of success""","Premium Beauty News - You will lead, as part of the In-Cosmetics Paris trade show, a seminar on anti-aging. What will be its main lines? Dr. Alain Khaiat - The objective will be to address the whole range of themes surrounding this topic to provide a comprehensive update resulting from everyone’s knowledge on the latest discoveries in this field. We will review the latest developments concerning ingredients for anti-aging treatments; we will also take an interest in the development of scientific knowledge concerning the physiology of the skin during the aging process. We will examine the signs of aging as they can be observed on the skins of Europeans and on the ones of Asians. The seminar will also include an update on the latest techniques for the measurement of products efficiency, and also a presentation provided by Johnson & Johnson on the formulation of anti-aging treatments. In addition, the organizers of in-cosmetics have also asked me to participate to the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award for Cosmetic Science 2013, of which I was the laureate in 2010. Premium Beauty News - Are there really big differences between the aging of Asian skins and that of Caucasia skins? Dr. Alain Khaiat - I have been living and working in Singapore for the past 17 years now. This experience helped me understand how incomplete the vision of Europeans or North Americans was on Asian demand for cosmetics. We are aware that 80% of the market for facials consists of whitening products, but eventually I had to wait to be in Asia to perceive what it was all about exactly. This specificity of Asian markets is in large part due to differences in the skin’s aging process. When a European or North American person tries to make a first-hand evaluation of the age of an Asian person he is often wrong mistaken by 10 or 15 years. We’ve all experienced this. But it’s also true the other way around with Asians people trying to evaluate our age. On European people, the first signs of aging appear from the age of 20 in the form of small wrinkles that form around the eyes. With Asian people, they appear from the age of 16 in the form of pigment spots on the cheekbones. Premium Beauty News - This can be explained by different habits in terms sun exposure? Dr. Alain Khaiat - Undoubtedly habits from that standpoint habits are very different. Europeans and North Americans tend to expose themselves frankly while Asians are much more cautious, and will even try to avoid any sort of exposure. This obviously has an influence since sun exposure damages collagen fibres thus encouraging the appearance of wrinkles. But genetic factors also come into play. In any case, these differences obviously have an influence on the sunscreen market. In Europe or North America, they are seasonal products while in Asia they are systematically included into everyday products. Premium Beauty News - Asia is definitely emerging as the main market of the future for the cosmetic industry. What are its main issues? Dr. Alain Khaiat - First the picture must be qualified. Asian markets are complex. Hence, behaviours in Japan, Korea and China differ from one another and also from the ones observed in India, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. They are the result of very different psycho-social behaviours. But there are also some similarities, and I think the psycho-sociological factors explain the boom of the market for face masks in several Asian countries. Another important feature of Asian markets: a young population. Of course, there too there are big differences between aging countries like Japan and conversely very young countries like Vietnam. The main consequence is that in a number of these countries there is a very important market for teenagers, which is not so much the case in Europe or North America. In China, where the age distribution is showing its first signs of aging, still 22 million babies are born each year, which is the equivalent of the Australian population! And in India, the figure is even bigger. Apart from these aspects, I do, however, believe, that the main issue right now is the Chinese regulation. It is a major obstacle to the development of the cosmetic industry in this country: it hinders innovation, slows the launch of new products and challenges investments in both research and marketing."
French women increasingly go online to buy cosmetics,"Cosmetic brand État Pur, whose products are sold only on the Internet, joined forces with market research firm Come & Stay, a specialist of digital communication, to build a barometer on the behaviour of those ho chose to buy their cosmetics online. First of all, this initial barometer confirms the strong interest of French women in cosmetic products.  Indeed, 66% of them say they love to test new cosmetics and own dozens of products already. A majority of French women also claims to spend between 30 and 60 euros per month for purchasing cosmetics, and 47% of French women purchase between 30 and 60 euros, all retail channels combined. More over, the results confirm the increasing confidence of consumers towards online sales and the steady increase of the e-commerce, which gradually becomes as legitimate as physical distribution networks. In an area where personal advices as well as the need to test products before purchasing it were considered as major impediments to the development of online sales, the results of the study show, on the contrary, that this distribution channel is becoming as usual as the others. Actually, 30% of consumers say they have made regular online purchases over the last 6 months and two thirds of the respondents have bought online over the 6 months (to compare to 82% for brick and mortar perfumeries and 88% for brick and mortar pharmacies and drug stores). Regarding product categories, 61% of respondents have bought a face care product (moisturizer, serum, ...) online over the last 6 months and more than 47% have bought a body care product (cream, oil, specific treatment, ...). Over 40% of buyers say that they even get on the internet to buy a brand they did not know. These online shopping cosmetics are overwhelmingly made from home (about 96%), and most frequently during the evening (42%).  Furthermore, French women prefer massively  (71%) turn to the online shops of renown brands (Clarins, Yves Rocher,...) rather than on the merchant site of a specialized distributor (39%). Also note the good score of private sales sites (BrandAlley, Beauty Private ...) that almost score as high as with the online beauty stores (35% compared to 39%). As far as online drugstores are concerned, they appeal for 24% of the buyers. The main motivations of online shoppers include the opportunity to make ""good deals"" (69%) and to save time (64%). When purchasing cosmetics online, the most important criteria are: prices (66%) and product information (57%). The survey was conducted online between May 9 and June 21, 2012 with 1,230 women. The sample was adjusted according to the quota method, based on French demographics for the following variables: age and distribution by region."
Indonesia: a cornerstone of L’Oréal’s growth strategy in South-East Asia,"The inauguration, last month, at the Jababeka Industrial Estate, West Java, Indonesia, around 60 kilometers east of Jakarta, of what is to date the largest L’Oréal plant in the world, has focused attention on the beauty market in Indonesia. With an increasing proportion of households belonging to the middle class, the consumption is beginning to go beyond basic needs.  Also stimulated by a relatively young population and the rapid urbanization, the demand for cosmetic products has grown by an average annual growth of 10 - 11%. In 2011, the cosmetics market was valued at nearly 1.6 billion euros [1]. Indonesia is therefore a cornerstone of L’Oréal’s strategy to attract a billion new consumers by 2020. Despite a long tradition of beauty rituals, some of which are still perpetuated in a more or less modernized form, the younger generation is very sensitive to new beauty criteria: slenderness and a very fair complexion are considered as signs of modernity. “It has become very important to have a fair, luminous complexion and many young women use lightening creams. They are eager for innovation and novelty and are prepared to experiment with different hair and skin care products,” explains L’Oréal. However, the overall use of cosmetic products, of all categories, is spreading rapidly within the Indonesian population, leading to the development of a strong cosmetic industry. There would be some 700 cosmetics companies in the country, and would have recorded an average production growth of 12.5% between 2003 and 2007. Concerning the L’Oreal group, which has been present in Indonesia since 1979, it currently records over 39% market growth.  In particular, L’Oreal succeed in becoming the leader in men’s cosmetics.  “The latest brand launches have met with great success: with 11.9 million units sold since the start of 2012 the Garnier Men line topped sales win barely a year,” details the company. With 15 brands distributed in the country, L’Oréal is present in all distribution channels: from hair salons and beauty institutes to traditional shops, and from mass retail to selective channels."
"Beauty Success, reviewing its store concept and getting involved in drugstores","A logical continuation after the launch in 2010 of a new visual identity with a new logo in the shape of a ""butterfly rosette"" and a new ""Well-being & beautiful mind"" base-line, Beauty Success - fourth selective perfumery network in France on a par with Douglas and behind Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé - has just launched the renovation programme of its new store concept. In a sluggish market, competition continues to grow between the main actors in selective distribution in France, but also between the different circuits, since Beauty Success also confirms its desire to set foot in the drugstore segment. ""This is in line with our concept of ’global beauty’,"" explains Philippe Georges, the CEO of the brand. “We serve ’beauty pleasure’ with our perfumeries, ’beauty wellness’ with our beauty parlours and ’beauty health’ with our drugstores"". Beauty Success, which now consists of 280 stores (including 84 branches and 196 franchise stores) and which has achieved a turnover of 230 million euros in 2011, continues to have the ambition of posting 400 points sales and a 10% market share in France by 2015 (against currently 7%). The brand revealed last week an ambitious renovation program of its store concept that intends to be ""friendly, attractive, bright and warm."" A Project, matured over two years with the objective to rejuvenate (the average age of loyalty card holders is currently of 45 years of age) and to broaden the customer base. Two goals well on track to being achieved as the brand has announced a 20% increase in attendance and a 15% increase in sales in its renovated stores. Designed with the Versions and Raymond Interactive agencies, this new store concept intends to convey the values of the brand, especially proximity and accessibility. Wood provides its warmth to a store arrangement where furniture and light wall surfaces give a feeling of space and clarity. Colours provide a bright touch to the whole setting and enable to delimit the different perfume areas inside the store. Indeed, a special effort was made to make the offer much clearer, with in particular, a coloured Plexiglas signage, backlit by LEDs. The different areas being themselves segmented in brands. A dedicated sound signature was also developed by Mood Media. The new concept was tested in a pilot store in Bergerac and deployed since August in the franchised stores in Pont-Audemer, Rennes (Saint-Grégoire and Alma) and the retailer has set itself an objective is to implement the concept in at least twenty perfume-institutes each year. Dedicated furniture was designed to specifically enhance selective make-up brands in a harmonized atmosphere. Check-outs were designed to become an area fostering service, impulse purchases and to give extra visibility to loyalty cards and to the rates in beauty parlours. Service areas (makeup, nail care) are scattered throughout the store. Finally, the Beauty Success brand itself (approximately 400 references of bath and make-up products) has its dedicated areas, at the store entrance. The company has also undertaken a complete renovation of its make-up line which will be launched next year. Concerning beauty parlours, Beauty Success has imagined six different atmospheres (""bubbles""), tropical ocean, eastern, mineral, northern solar. Each point of sale, depending both on the number of cabins it has and of its customers can choose one, two or three atmospheres. More than 40 stores are already equipped with these new cabin concepts and Beauty Success has set a goal of reaching 250 beauty salons in line with this concept within 5 years. The company sees the beauty parlour, which is a key place for retention and value added, as a significant growth vector, provided services are made truly accessible. Currently, only 10% of the clientele of perfumeries also attended the beauty parlours. This is why, alongside its partnerships with major brands in the industry, Beauty Success has also developed its own skincare card and proprietary protocols claiming an ""excellent price/quality ratio."" In addition, the beauty parlour is also perceived as the natural link between the world of perfumery and the drugstore. One of Beauty Success’s other major challenge is to succeed with its development in the drugstore circuit. The retailer has already opened four outlets of this type, including a franchised one since October 15, 2012 at Claira-Perpignan. ""Depending of the catchment area and on the potential available space - an area of at least 250 m² is necessary to establish a drugstore in addition to a perfumery and a beauty parlour - we will explore all the opportunities,"" said Georges. ""This is a new activity for the brand, not additional shelf-space. There is a direct and separate entrance to the store; it cannot just be a corner. But the entire store is accessible with the same loyalty card."" To comply with the requirements of the sector, this area is run by a pharmacist. The architectural concept is based on the one of perfumeries but it was been adapted with simpler, more neutral showcases and gondolas. ""Beauty Success drugstores are particularly suited to the types of flow of people seen in shopping centres."" Outside France, the Beauty Success brand is already present in Morocco, where it represents before Marionnaud, the second distribution network dedicated to beauty. But by their own admission, retailer officials explained that the brand’s successful implantation in this country was more the result of a happy combination of circumstances than that of a strategy of exportation of the concept. However, it is seriously considered and expected to materialize as of 2014."
Natural cosmetics: Distribution is key to success in a slowing European market,"According to Organic Monitor, the European natural and organic personal care products market should record single-digit growth this year, for the first time over the last decade.  The latest research of the London-based company shows the growth rate has dropped from double-digits because of the “debt crisis” impacting retailers and consumer expenditure. The UK market has been the most adversely affected by the crisis. Revenues have been slowly increasing by about 6% per annum since the financial crisis started in 2008. The harsh retail environment - with some historical high-street players such as Woolworth going bankrupt - has led many UK natural and organic brands to target export markets for growth. Indeed, many British brands have made significant inroads in the Nordic market. Some like Bulldog have gone further a field, exporting to the US, Australia as well as to parts of Europe. Germany is showing sluggish growth this year.  This is a bad news for natural and organic beauty brands since the country has the largest market for these products and also leads in terms of market share; natural and organic products comprise 7% of total personal care products.  Organic Monitor also notes that private labels have had most success in the German market, with Alverde of DM drugstores being the third leading natural brand, housing over 300 products. In France, where the market has witnessed the largest number of new product launches in recent years, competition is at the highest. “Many large cosmetic companies have introduced natural and organic lines. L’Oreal is marketing a range of products under popular brands, such as Garnier, Ushuaïa, Biotherm and Mixa. Other multinationals, including Henkel and Unilever, have also developed certified organic lines for the French market. Although mass market distribution has increased significantly, the channel comprises less then 15% of natural and organic personal care product sales,” says Organic Monitor. Rising competition and slowing market growth rates are not only pushing brands towards export markets but also lead them to explore new retail channels. While specialist retailers - the traditional channel for natural and organic brands - still comprise most sales, with 40% market share, Organic Monitor observes that brands are making most inroads in drugstores, pharmacies, beauty retailers and department store. Dr. Hauschka, for instance, is targeting high-end outlets, including beauty retailers and department stores. The Jerodia group (Phyt’s, Bionatural, Gamarde, Françoise Morice, Institut Jerodia), through its Gamarde brand, tries to strengthen its position in para-pharmacies, whilst Primavera is targeting the spa channel. Many are taking the direct route and opening concept stores. Korres and Melvita are frontrunners with their international retail networks. As far as mass market is concerned, although many supermarkets and hypermarkets have launched private label ranges, the crisis is not boosting the organic segment in this channel and its market share remains below 10% at the European level. In its upcoming European market report [1], Organic Monitor expects market growth rates to recover as economic conditions improve. “However, competition is expected to remain intense as natural and organic brands increasingly jostle for shelf-space with large cosmetic firms. Brands that have a clear strategy in terms of product offering or distribution are expected to succeed in the changing market landscape,” explains the market research firm. Organic Monitor will also give an update on the European natural and organic personal care products market in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which will be held on 21-23rd November 2012, at the Crowne Plaza Paris-République hotel, Paris, France."
"Mascara, the flagship product of colour cosmetics","Language, power of conviction, self-expression, the look has thousands of facets and eye make-up, thousands of aspects. ""Eyes probably have the longest recorded history in make-up, all the elements have a role to play: the eye shape, eyebrows, eyelashes, the colour of iris are all factors that contribute to the specificity of make-up depending of countries,"" explained Florence Bernardin, General Manager of Information et Inspiration and Hélène Capgras, Director of Brain for Beauty at a conference organized in November 2011 by the CEW France Association on eye make-up in the world. And eye make-up very often involves using mascara, a product invented in its modern version at the beginning of the last century by TL Williams, a chemist by profession for his sister Maybel, which will give birth to Maybelline. We know what happened afterwards... Depending on regions, make-up habits are different and often find their roots in ancient traditions. ""In India, kajal or kohl according to Ayurvedic tradition was used to fix dirt and dust, as a sunscreen or to refresh and brighten the eyes, it was both a make-up and a skincare product. Women used to prepare it themselves from ghee or clarified butter,"" explains Florence Bernardin. Nowadays, this tradition is found in India in the importance placed in the eye make-up. The products used (kohl and mascara) must enlarge the eyes and accentuate their expression, Almond shaped eyes are idealized. In Japan, where the ideal is to have manga eyes, eyelashes should be XXXL but require, due to their scarcity and implantation, the use of specific mascara formulas. Recently, says Bernardin, ""a new solution has been found for the make-up of the eyelashes of Japanese women with the very popular use of false eyelashes. Applied using an expert hand, they can be removed in the evening without using a make-up remover, are re-usable and offer an infinite variety of looks."" However, mascaras are not outdone and are seeking to find a new dimension in Asia, in particular ""by offering mini brushes to catch all the little lashes, by treating lashes with anti-aging serum effects or by becoming an identifiable and statuary object,"" she added. In the U.S., a country where innovation is a sales driver for make-up products, claims are getting increasingly sophisticated. ""There is a quest for perfection and eternal youth that is also noticeable at the level of eyelashes. In 2009, Latisse was the first brand to launch a product designed to promote the growth of eyelashes. Since then, have appeared on the market, booster mascaras, booster serums and now booster eyeliners"" emphasised Capgras. On the contrary, according to the study conducted by Bernardin and Capgras on behalf of CEW France, eye make-up remains secondary in Brazil. ""To have accentuated eyes is extremely important, but eye make-up is recent and comes after the making up of the mouth and nails, Brazilian women are just beginning to use mascara,"" they added. In Europe, the mascara market could weigh 800 million euros and represent 50% of the eye products market and about 15% of the total make-up segment. European women are over 54% to believe they cannot do without their mascara, while they are only 18% to say the same about their foundation product! Even though it is hard to obtain an accurate estimate in volume of the global market of mascara, main players agree most often on the figure of around one billion units sold annually. While the ongoing success of this product could not be denied most manufacturers have announced plans to expand their production capacity. ""To meet the growing demand from our customers, we have increased this year by more than four the surface of our factory to reach 7000 m2 (75,000sq ft),"" acknowledges Renato Ancorotti, the CEO of the Ancorotti Cosmetics company founded in 2009 and specializes in the formulation of eye make-up products. A growth also visible in the turnover of the company with a 30% leap between 2010 and 2012 estimates. ""The mascara market is doing well and growth drivers still exist,"" underlined Ancorotti. At Luxcos, the entity of IL Cosmetics specialized in mascara, results also confirm the strength of the market. ""Sales for this product have increased by more than 40% between 2010 and 2011,"" confirmed Pauline Starck, Make-Up Business Developer. This point of view is shared by Geka officials, one of the world leaders in complete packaging systems for cosmetics including mascara brushes. ""We we are currently building a new unit to expand our capacity. Mascaras are enjoying a growing demand from our customers,"" confirms Pilar Gonzalez, Head of Marketing and Communication for Geka. Albéa, a leading supplier of mascara brushes, who has been operating in this field for more than 30 years, is also increasing its production capacity by grouping two Italian production units on the same site. ""We are planning to group two of our Italian based factories to increase our production capacity and thus absorb more growth. Mascara is a segment that represents 50% of our share in make-up and which is growing rapidly. We are heavily investing both in research and industrialization,"" added Aurélie Emond Creative and Innovation Marketing Director. If one takes a look at the figures concerning supermarkets in France [1] , the eye make-up sector has increased in 2011/2012 by 1.9% obviously way behind the nail polish sector with 17% but nonetheless a very honourable performance compared to lipsticks with a drop of -4.7% or foundations with -3.7%. Finally, the recent study undertaken by Mintel [2] on make-up habits of teens (9-11 years old) and tweens (9-17years old), clients-to-be, shows that mascara is the second most used product after lip gloss. 33% of girls aged 9 to 17 say they wear mascara every day against 37% for lip gloss, 27% for eyeliner and only 16% for foundation. Habits that augur good prospects for mascara which has not yet conquered all categories of people like men, for example!"
Cosmetics retail market in Central Europe to grow by 1.5% in 2012,"The economic environment in Central Europe remains dull, in particular when compared to the 2008-2009 period. According to specialised market research firm PMR Publications, the difficult and uncertain situation on the Central Europe labour markets, as well as fiscal austerity measures (wage and staff cuts in public administrations in Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, as well as VAT increases in Poland and Slovakia), constrained the income of households and their propensity to consume thus directly impacting the cosmetics market. Total sales of cosmetics in Central Europe grew by 2.3% (at local currencies) in 2011 and reached the value of EUR 8.6bn. The highest increase, of 3.2%, was recorded in Poland, which accounts for more than a half of total cosmetics’ sales in the region, as indicated in the latest PMR Publications’ report. [1] “In 2012 the overall value of the Central Europe cosmetics market is expected to grow further, though only at a rate of 1.5%,” says Patrycja Nalepa, Senior Retail Analyst at PMR Publications. Two countries, namely Bulgaria and Slovakia, are predicted to see higher growth rates compared to 2011. Romania and Poland will be growing the fastest with a rate of 2.2%. “In the case of Romania this is, however, much lower than previously predicted. The initial expectations of many players on the Romanian cosmetics market, who had indicated a growth of their sales this year ranging between less than 10% and others a two-digit surge, have been tempered during 2012,” comments Patrycja Nalepa. PMR Publications also forecasts that Czech Republic and Hungary will experience decrease in cosmetics sales in 2012. “In Hungary, macroeconomic indicators are again deteriorating in 2012,” explains the firm, and “sales by volume are not expected to grow during next years.” In the Czech Republic both economy and private consumption are declining and growth of wages does not offset rising prices. However, for 2013 and 2014, PMR Publications deem that sales of cosmetics will eventually increase in all the countries in the region."
Halal cosmetics gain popularity in Asia,"Halal is an Arabic word which means permissible or lawful, by opposition to Haram which means prohibited.  Therefore Halal (permitted) products are those that do not contain Haram (prohibited) ingredients.  The list of products prohibited under the Islamic law (sharia) includes pork or pork by-products, animals that are dead or dying prior to slaughter, blood and blood by-products, carnivorous animals, birds of prey, land animals without external ears, ethanol... As far as cosmetics are concerned, there are several ingredients that can be of concern to Muslim consumers eager to extend their respect of the Islamic law to this product category. Possibly problematic ingredients include: allantoin, ambergris, collagen, elastin, ethanol, gelatine, tallow and tallow derivatives, etc. According to Organic Monitor, “the Halal label has been gaining popularity in the cosmetics industry since the Malaysian government introduced the Halal cosmetics standard (MS 2200: 2008) in June 2010.”  The Halal label is given to cosmetic and personal care products that meet the Islamic religious rules, in particular regarding permitted and prohibited ingredients.  It “appeals to Muslim consumers seeking integrity and authenticity in their cosmetic and personal care products.” Depending on sources and their definition of what is a Halal cosmetic product, global annual sales of Halal cosmetics are estimated from 5 to 14 billion US dollars.  Focusing on Halal-certified cosmetics, Organic Monitor considers global sales can be estimated at above USD 5 billion. “At present, 57 certification agencies are authorised to certify products according to the Halal cosmetics standard. Although the highest adoption rates are in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, certification is also catching on in Europe and North America. In the latter regions, a growing number of Muslim consumers are interested in Halal certified products,” says the market research firm. Asia, which hosts more than 60% of the world’s Muslim population, is one of the first market for Halal cosmetics, together with the Middle East, (in particular Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates).  “A growing number of cosmetic and ingredient firms are taking up Halal certification in Asia. The highest adoption rates are in Muslim countries where multinationals that include Colgate-Palmolive and Avon have launched certified products. International chemical firms like BASF and CP Kelco are also getting ingredients certified for these markets.“ However, according to Organic Monitor, Halal personal care products often fall short in terms of their ecological credentials since, apart from ingredients prohibited by the sharia, the formulations are similar to conventional cosmetics. “Realising this, some companies have started to formulate natural / organic cosmetics with Halal certification. Saaf Pure Skincare was launched in the UK to appeal to Muslim consumers seeking organic skincare products that adhere to Sharia principles. The products are certified organic by the Soil Association and certified Halal by European Halal Services. The brand is developing an international presence, with products exported to Europe, the Middle-East and North America,” points out the market research firm. Organic Monitor sees high potential for such products in the Middle-East and Asia. In many of these countries, the market for natural and organic cosmetics is growing by over 20% a year. Rising consumer affluence, coupled with growing knowledge of cosmetic ingredients, is making consumers pay a premium for cosmetics that meet their ethical and religious beliefs. However, with a lack of local brands of natural & organic cosmetics in these regions, there is a clear gap in the marketplace.  “A major challenge is formulating cosmetic products that meet two or more standards, as many European brands have discovered.” The potential of halal cosmetics, and formulation challenges of developing natural and organic personal care products, will be featured in the Asia-Pacific edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit. Taking place in Hong Kong on 12-13th November 2012, the summit will discuss the growing role of labels (Halal, natural, organic, cruelty-free, etc.) in the Asian cosmetics industry."
Luxe Pack 2012: sensoriality under the spotlights,"Materials that have the appearance of something else, new tactile and visual experiences, pumps that cover fragrance users with a cloud of scent: the 2012 edition of Luxe Pack, which was held in Monaco from the 24th to 26th October 2012, was placed under the sign of the senses. Perhaps, as mentioned the experts of Luxe Pack Trends Observer, it is the result of a growing need for astonishment from consumers who have gained much more expertise. The trend has even conquered the Pack & Green prize, which for the third consecutive year, highlighted the environmental solutions and innovations presented by exhibitors.  Indeed, the jury [1] awarded Favini, the Italian paper manufacturer, for its Crush paper line.  Crush is a new eco-friendly range of papers made using process residues from organic products to replace up to 15 percent of virgin tree pulp. By-products from citrus fruits, corn coffee, kiwi fruits, hazelnuts and almonds, which would normally be processed as fillers in animal food and fertilizers or simply dumped as landfill, are among the natural materials used. Elements of each different material are visible on the surface of the paper giving it a distinctive texture and appearance.

Jewellery and niche fragrances shine in the US ,"According to The NPD Group, a market research company specialising prestige cosmetic products, the prestige fragrance industry showed robust sales of 1.6 billion dollars (1.24 euros) in U.S. department stores year-to-date (January to September 2012), with men’s fragrance sales growing slightly faster than women’s. Designer fragrances, which accounts for nearly three quarters of the total U.S. market, grew the same rate of the overall category performance, while jewellery and niche prestige fragrances almost tripled. Jewellery fragrance brands like Boucheron, Bulgari, and Cartier and niche fragrance brands like Creed and Jo Malone helped to take this segment of the fragrance category to double-digit growth in the first nine months of the year. “The fragrance brands that are being sold in more selective distribution are experiencing explosive growth.  We’ve seen this trend with high-end designer brands like Tom Ford and Jimmy Choo and this is also evident today with jewelry and niche fragrance brands,” said Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group.  “Even though niche and jewelry brands make up only nine percent of the total prestige fragrance market they are creating a new dynamic in the larger fragrance arena.  They are growing faster than any other type of fragrance in the prestige space and their combined sales are actually more than double the size of prestige celebrity fragrances.” In addition to niche and jewellery brands experiencing the largest dollar growth, they generate sales at one of the highest average price points in the prestige fragrance market.  While the average price in women’s and men’s for these fragrances are about 70 US dollars, selections in this space may be in excess of 350 US dollars and leading brands are often in the 200 US dollars range. “It is quite a compelling story that despite the economic uncertainties that prevail, we continue to see sizable pockets of growth in prestige fragrance.  And, when one considers the price, these fragrances are often treasures and truly an investment,” said Grant.  “Yet, if we were to compare the scope of the premium market in countries like France, the U.S. still has significant opportunity to expand sales further in this frontier. Consumers are continuing to invest where they see the value,” ended Grant. Source: The NPD Group"
The packaging of luxury brands tries to appeal expert consumers ,"Design, creative packaging and graphics professionals, as well as a sociologist and an expert in market research and forecasting, gathered within the Luxe Pack Trends Observer [1], have identified this year four major trends for luxury packaging: The Hyper Material, Pink Lights Up, My Little Show Off, Back to Front. In our hyper-visual technological environment, tactility becomes luxury and pleasure.  In the same time, technological advances enable industrials to give materials the appearance of something else: cardboard, thanks to complex printing, lacquering and embossing, transforms into wood, metal or leather. “Metal is transformed into leather or fabric, while glass and plastic are covered with ever more surprising tactile effects,” highlights Lan Vu, founder of Beautystreams. With increasingly demanding consumers, that have gained more expertise, who want to be surprised and need to dream, who spend a lot of time in front of screens and digitize their lives, industrial tools have become more efficient to address new sensory needs. Emblematic of a society that is not completely certain to have exited from the recession, but which is fed up with the gloom, pink - the colour of happiness - is treated on the mood of depth, sophistication, seduction and sensuality. ""We’re no longer in a girly regression,"" notes Rémy Oudghiri, director of the corporate strategy and trends & future studies departments of Ipsos Public Affairs. According to Oudghiri, ""the desire for pink is very strong today in mature countries.” Especially since, as highlights Jean-Paul Cournillou, director of the packaging and retail department at the Strate Collège, “pink can oppose to other senses, as in the case of the grenade Viktor & Rolf.” While the bling did not survive the recession, the normality supposed to succeed it might be too boring.  Actually, overt bling is rather being succeeded by controlled bling for those who want to give up overly eye-catching and fun, but rather do it more discreetly. “A new style of luxury is taking hold, less oriented towards the desire of admiration from others and more towards the search for experiential and aesthetic pleasures,” says Isabelle Musnik, content and editorial manager at INfluencia. Contrary to what we might think, this trend is not limited to mature markets but begins to spread to emerging ones. Thus, Rémy Oudghiri observes that in Russia and China ""the move towards greater measure of discretion, distinction” is growing. « The sacred has become no secret,  » laughs Béatrice Mariotti, vice chairwoman, Carré Noir. Like Replica, the three fragrances from Maison Martin Margiela, that show their ingredients on their front label and use it as the base of their decoration, brands are trying to define their expertise by displaying it.  Here again we find the expert consumers, who are, according to Rémy Oudghiri, ""increasingly fond of details and product culture.” Consumers that are not only looking for a status, but for expertise, knowledge, and experiences too."
Internet: a challenge and an advantage for selective perfumery,"In 2011 in France, online sales accounted for only 2% of the turnover of selective perfumery retailers. However, online sales of perfumes and cosmetics in upscale scores scored much higher in some other European countries such as: Austria (6%) and the Czech Republic (20%). While these figures show an important development potential, it is nevertheless important to remember that online sales are far from being the only big stake in this business. For William Koeberlé, chairman of the Marionnaud group and of the French Federation of Selective Perfumery (FFPS), internet is now fully integrated in a retailer’s business.  “Two-thirds of shoppers visit the web for information on the products and on innovations,"" he said.  An opinion which is fully shared by Franck Lehuédé, Senior Project Manager at the Consumer Department of Crédoc, a French research firm specialising in consumer studies.  ""Internet is about purchase, but internet is also, specifically, about purchase preparation."" Thus, both brands and retailers strive to follow their clients on Google, blogs, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or Pinterest. For Robert Leygues, President of the European Federation of perfumery retail trade (FEPD), the development of e-commerce fits quite naturally in the irreversible logic of an increasingly digital world: ""We must learn to live intelligently aside this form of commerce and take advantage of the web whenever possible.” For all the operators, “it is a permanent training process in order to invest these multiple channels and not lose sight of the consumer,"" said William Koeberlé. For retailers, there is no doubt: Internet will become a major media to influence consumers’ choices and preferences. In much of Europe, consumers are convinced that their purchasing power would decline in the coming years. They will have, in particular, to face with the continuous increase of their “unavoidable spending” - such as housing, food and energy - which now represent 33% of the budget of French households, against 25% in the 1960s. In spite of this negative outlook, the Crédoc’s researchers observe, among French consumers, a strong desire to invest in knowledge, not only in professional knowledge but also in personal knowledge, which is associated with ""a strong investment in self-image"" and eventually in personal appearance. Enough to leave rather high hopes to the industry of cosmetics. In order to succeed in the game, Franck Lehuédé thinks industry should place innovation at the centre of new product developments and be able to reassure consumers about “the ethics of products,” including consideration on issues such as climate change, biodiversity preservation and fair trade with small producers. But if the internet can be a great tool for placing consumer insights at the heart of a development strategy, it can also be used for harmful practices, especially in a difficult economic environment. Cybersquatting practices, purchasing of sponsored links, development of rogue websites [1] or illegal use of consumer-to-consumer commercial websites (such as e-bay, LeBonCoin.fr, dinkos.com.au, etc.) have contributed a huge development of the trade of counterfeit goods and parasitic grey markets.  So much so that ""on the internet, counterfeiters are always ahead of brands,” said according to Manlio Pizzorni, Regional Vice President Western Europe and Middle East, Coty Prestige. As far as the FFPS is concerned, the trade association recalls it fully supports the development of this new distribution channel provided it keeps strictly compliant with the rules of selective distribution. That would normally prohibit pure players to distribute high end products from being distributed in the selective network in Europe. ""That is why the French Federation of Selective Perfumery (FFPS), with the support of its members, while reaffirming its commitment to respect the free competition principle, especially in the field of online sales, has decided to raise the awareness and French and European authorities regarding the risk that may represent the development of e-commerce websites by pure players selling perfumes and cosmetics away from the European legal framework,” concludes William Koeberlé."
"""Emerging countries will soon represent more than half of the global cosmetics market,"" Muriel Lartigue, UBIFRANCE","Premium Beauty News - Can you describe UBIFRANCE to us, in particular its activity in the cosmetics industry? Muriel Lartigue - UBIFRANCE, the French agency for export promotion, aims to assist French companies in their efforts to export: from guiding them on the markets to linking with foreign operators and developing business relations. To fulfil this mission, we rely on our overseas offices that form a multicultural network now present in 60 countries. We have almost 880 employees outside France, of which a hundred at the disposal of French cosmetics companies. The main personalized services offered by UBIFRANCE include: the identification of potential markets, the information on industry opportunities and regulatory issues, the identification of potential business partners, boosting French companies’ visibility in the press abroad, strengthening human resources abroad through International Corporate Volunteering. Thanks to their dynamism, innovation and international reputation, the French cosmetics industry is a major asset for our trade balance. It is therefore very important that companies of this sector may enjoy the benefice from a personalized international support over time. Premium Beauty News - UBIFRANCE organizes business meetings (with the operators of the luxury sector in China, for example, in April 2013, or those of the cosmetics industry in South Korea in November 2013), how do they work? Muriel Lartigue - The collective support of companies is an important part of the services we offer to the industry. This can be achieved through the sponsorship of two types of events: French pavilions on major international and regional exhibitions (Cosmoprof Asia, Beauty World Middle East, Cosmoprof Bologna, Intercharm Moscow, In-Cosmetics, etc.) and the business meetings that provide an opportunity for companies to explore new markets. These business meetings are usually held on 2-3 days and gather around 8 to 10 companies. They consist of a common component (informative seminar, visits of outlets, etc.) and a program of targeted meetings with local operators, according to specifications previously defined with each participating company. The collective operations are undeniably generating business. A survey to measure the business impact of our services, which was entrusted to ISPOS, showed that in 2011, eight out of ten UBIFRANCE corporate clients identified potential customers, previously unknown to them, and that six have signed an order or established a business relationship with a positive outlook. Premium Beauty News - In December, UBIFRANCE organizes the “Rencontres Internationales de la Beauté” (International Beauty Meetings”). Muriel Lartigue - This is a first in this sector. Building on the success of the meetings that we organize already in the health and digital industries for instance, we deemed logical to duplicate the formula to support the beauty industry. The goal of this event is to enable companies in the beauty industry to meet during one day with industry experts from around fifteen different countries (Brazil, United States, Korea South China, etc.) as well as with our partners such as Oseo, Coface and INPI, to discuss the issues they have to solve when exporting. Also, it will be the opportunity to take on industry trends and the market access issues in these countries. The day will consist of a plenary session in the morning during which we will discuss major trends in mature and emerging markets with our experts and a panel of companies that will share their experience. Discussions will be continued during a networking lunch, before the second part of the day: face-to-face meetings between with our experts. Sponsored by STIO (a freight forwarder and logistics company), the event is free of charge for participating companies.  Our ambition is to grow it as a key annual meeting for international development in the cosmetics industry, thanks to the support of all major stakeholders in the sector. The entire cosmetic industry is concerned: manufacturers of finished goods, suppliers and service providers to the cosmetics industry, not to mention the manufacturers of dietary supplements. Premium Beauty News - UBIFRANCE thus appears as a true market observation tool. What do you see as the major trends and developments in the global cosmetics market? Muriel Lartigue - While the cosmetics market is also impacted by the current crisis, it remains dynamic and is expected to grow at about 4% in 2012. However, this good rate hides important disparities between geographical areas. Europe is certainly the area where the impact is the highest, but it remains the largest market for French cosmetics makers. Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy were still in the top 5 destinations of French exports of cosmetic products in 2011.  Actually, historic markets (Western Europe, USA, Japan) dramatically contrast with emerging markets in terms of dynamism.  In the short term, some emerging markets - first and foremost China, Brazil and Russia - will account for more than half of the global consumption. Russia already ranks as the 7th destination of French cosmetic products and China ranks 11th. As far as trends are concerned, over recent years we have observed deep movements affecting several countries at varying degrees: the growing importance of organic and natural products, strong market segmentation with the development of products for men, children / teenagers and elderly people. Furthermore, more technical products have emerged and distribution networks have diversified, in particular with the emergence of alternative channels. These underlying trends should not hide the strong specificities of the various markets that may be cultural, sociological, climatic and regulatory. They also have a significant impact on the opportunities offered by each market, in particular in terms of accessibility. Any company wishing to expand internationally should understand these characteristics. Similarly, the rise of competition cannot be ignored by French companies. I’m pleased to invite the cosmetics industry to discuss these issues on the occasion of the first edition of the Rencontres Internationales de la Beauté, which will be held on December 11, in UBIFRANCE’s premises."
Dassault Systèmes simulates consumers’ in-store shopping experience ,"The know-how acquired by Dassault Systèmes in the aviation industry, then in industries with high complexity products, became available in recent years to the areas of consumer goods and retail. ""We have adapted and developed solutions for businesses where knowing the consumer and its behavior is the main issue,"" explains Philippe Loeb, Vice President Consumer Packaged Goods - Retail at Dassault Systèmes. Precisely, in order to better meet the needs of these sectors the world leader in 3D design software has changed its organization to create 12 divisions corresponding to specific industrial sectors, including one devoted to consumer goods and distribution. Dassault Systèmes thus offers a software series designed to facilitate the marketing of consumer products [1], focusing on the complete social industry experience from “idea to consumer.”  Perfect Shelf is the latest product in the series ""the idea of the consumer.""  This new software leverages advanced 3D modeling and visualization to provide realistic views of retail aisles including shelves, fixtures, products, lighting and promotional materials, in order to ease and accelerate the design process of the consumer’s in-store shopping experience. Computerized modeling offers a great flexibility and extends possibilities at lower cost.  Thus, both brands and retailers can design virtual shelf layouts and stock them with realistic 3D product representations built from 2D pictures. Perfect Shelf industry solution experience incorporates, and connects digitally, many business scenarios in the areas of Category Management and Space Planning such as new packaging introduction, category assessment, consumer decision trees, in context assortments review, adjacencies and sales materials. Also, it quickly adapts shelving plans to store specifics and then helps store employees execute these plans ‘right the first time’. Another feature highlighted by Dassault Systèmes: the ease of use.  “Obviously we adapt our soft-wares to their users, as the expectations of a marketing specialist are not those of an engineer,” says Philippe Loeb. When both brands of consumer packaged goods and retailers want to ensure that every consumer, in every store can find what they want, when they want it - and do so quickly and easily, Perfect Shelf also appears as a conviction tool to recommend shelving scenarios that have the potential to enhance both the brand’s and the retailer’s category revenue."
"Indian cosmetics market to register a 17% annual growth up to 2015, says new research","The Indian cosmetics sector is expected to expand remarkably in near future, according to a new research report by RNCOS: Indian Cosmetic Sector Forecast to 2015.  Indeed, the influence of western culture, rising beauty concerns among both men and women and robust media promotion combine with rising purchasing power and growing fashion consciousness to boost the demand.  As a consequence, says RNCOS, the Indian cosmetic market is likely to register a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 17% during 2011-2015. Hair care should be one of the market’s main drivers along the very next years.  According to RNCOS, this product category is anticipated to register a strong double-digit growth during 2012-2015. “The Indian hair care market, which comprises hair oil, shampoos, hair colorants, conditioners, and styling agents, has shown strong growth over the past few years. Various factors, such as shift in consumer behaviour, growing purchasing power, gradually changing lifestyle, and product awareness continue to fuel growth in this market. Moreover, Indian consumers are becoming more conscious about their looks and showing promising purchase patterns which are further initiating strong growth in the coming years,” says the market research firm. RNCOS also notes that men cosmetic products are becoming popular in India where male consumers are willing to pay premium price for cosmetics products that are developed specially for them.  The men’s segment is estimated to occupy around one-third of the total cosmetics market and the increasing demand from men users stimulates the emergence of new players specialising in male cosmetic products. “Rising awareness, increasing influence of western world, product availability, and changing lifestyle are the main driving forces propelling the male cosmetics industry and the segment is expected to surge at a CAGR of more than 18% during 2011-2015,” forecasts RNCOS.  “From visiting parlours for manicures and pedicures to spas, Indian men are concentrating on every aspect of grooming. Face-care (skin whitening) creams and lotions, in particular, are catching attention of Indian men. Deodorants also play an equally important role in the male cosmetic market of India.”"
United Kingdom: Colour cosmetics market set to grow,"Eight out of ten British women feel more confident when wearing make-up.  In such a context, no surprise that sales of colour cosmetics are, once again, proved recession-proof.  “Sales in the market have continued to grow and will continue to do so for as long as the market delivers the feel-good factor even if the economy cannot,” says Vivenne Rudd, Head of Beauty and Personal Care Insight at Mintel.]. Indeed, according to latest research from the firm, UK retail sales of colour cosmetics put on a good performance in 2011, with market value up by over 8% from 2010 (when the market was valued at £1.28 billion) shoring up sales of £1.38 billion. Growth is expected to continue - albeit at a slower pace - into 2012 and beyond, to achieve an estimated market worth £1.44 billion (1.80 euros) in 2012. Face colour cosmetics remains the largest of the four makeup sectors (face, eyes, lips and nails), accounting for 38% of total market value at £526 million. The remainder of the sales are made up of “eyes” valued at £410 million (accounting for 30% of total sales), “lips” valued at £224 million (accounting for 16% of sector sales) and “nails” worth £221 million - accounting for 15% of the market. Although accounting for the smallest number of sales, nail make-up was the real star performer of the UK colour cosmetics market in 2011, posting double-digit growth to reach a value of  £221 million compared to £179m in 2010. Indeed,  Mintel’s research shows users of nail varnish have risen from 52% of women in 2007 to an impressive 61% in 2011. And it is not just Britain which has seen a rise in interest in nail colour cosmetics. Indeed, this has been the case across Europe as a whole. In 2008, nail colour cosmetics accounted for 10% of all colour cosmetic launches, by 2012, this had risen to 26% of all new launches in the sector. In terms of launch activity by region, the UK was the most active region, accounting for 29% of all new product activity in the colour cosmetics market during 2012, this was followed by Germany accounting for 22% of all activity and France which accounted for 20% of activity. “In terms of colour, nails have stolen the limelight from eyes and lips, and have become an arena for self-expression in the form of nail art. While the prim, ladylike look of French manicured nails is unlikely to ever go out of style, recent trends have covered less subtle, even outrageous looks ranging from two-tone manicures and classic red polish to ombre and metallic shades. Nail make-up has also witnessed one of the biggest increases of all core beauty sectors in its consumer base in recent years,” comments Vivienne Rudd."
Creative perfumery attempts to make its way in France,"Latest episode to date, the opening at the end of June, of a new perfume shop named Nose, in a pedestrian area in the centre of Paris, near the Place des Victoires and the Sentier, but a quite away from the main tourist hotspots. ""The customers we are targeting are the Parisians, the neighbourhood and the curious ones, those who are interested in niche perfumes. Of course, foreigners and those on the lookout for the latest trends and fashions are also paying a visit, but they are not our main target,"" explains Nicolas Cloutier, co-founder and President of Nose. [1] Does that mean there is room in France for alternative fragrance brands and retailers?  “Nose was born from the observation that most niche fragrance brands are French, but usually make more business abroad than in France,” says Silvio Levi, one of the seven co-founders of Nose and also the founder of Esxense, the annual event dedicated to artistic perfumery in Milan. The high concentration at the retail level in France (perfumery chains, such Marionnaud, Sephora and Nocibé, hold more than 70% of the market) makes the environment even more difficult for small brands.  A situation contrasting with the Italian retail structure where there is a much higher rate of independent operators, including an interesting proportion that is very interested in alternative perfumes.  The situation is quite similar in other European countries, such as Germany, The Netherlands, or even Hungary and Rumania. “There are 20 to 30 outlets - traditional stores or concept-stores - that take the floor against the standard offer.  In Germany or in Italy there are 250 to 300 of them, with a specific knowledge about niche perfumery,” explains François Hénin, President of Jovoy. Where French chain stores only see low-turnover products, these alternative retailers do see an opportunity to stand out from the mass and to capture demanding and rather affluent customers. Though, French consumers have repeatedly shown their interest in original brands, with a limited distribution, when they succeeded in gaining visibility, by entering in department or concept stores or by opening their own outlets.  According to Nicolas Cloutier, ""buyers of niche brands were already there, but nobody - or hardly anybody - was addressing their demand,” . A rather curious situation indeed, where an abundant offer was coexisting with a real demand but where structured intermediates were lacking. While some perfumeries outside Paris - Parfumerie de l’Opéra in Bordeaux, Parfumerie Santa Rosa in Toulouse, or Parfumerie du Soleil d’Or in Lille - have proposed a real alternative offer to their customers, they had no equivalent in Paris, where the offer was fragmented between brand owned stores, department stores and fashion concept stores such as Colette or L’Éclaireur. “We thought that this situation could led to the resurgence of alternative retailers in France and that there was a huge opportunity to rebuild a distribution network for niche brands in this country,” explains Silvio Levi. In order to expand the distribution and spread the culture of creative perfumery with both customers and distributors, Francois Hénin, imagined an original concept: the perfumery in a trunk. ""There are two barriers that prevent small niche brands from being accepted by traditional retailers: lack of cash on the one hand and lack of shelf space on the other hand,"" he says. To circumvent these barriers, he developed a wheeled-trunk capable of carrying 16 different bestselling items. The trunk occupies only a small space on the ground and the retailer only has to fund the purchase of a limited number of products. The trunk can also be placed in hotels or spas. ""It is an idea among others, but we are considering other potential concepts such as pop-up retail shops in a high traffic area, or the reproduction of our concept in the form of small size franchises, from 30 to 40 m2,"" concludes Hénin. In this market, retailers cannot simply differentiate themselves with their range of products. Since creative perfumery is refocusing on the fragrance rather than on packaging and advertising, customers needs a lot of education and assistance. At Nose, they have conceived a dedicated tool that helps choosing the right perfume, but always with the help and with the explanations of a shop assistant. An innovative tool that could appeal customers in search for different products and help to enter into a virtuous circle of market development. ""The more we improve the distribution network, the more demand will increase,"" insists Silvio Levi."
MakeUp in New York: number of visitors skyrockets,"After a very positive first edition in 2011, MakeUp in New York, which hosted 40% additional exhibitors this year, has kept its promises.  Indeed, more than 1,000 people (1,036 exactly, according to the organizers counts), came to visit the second edition of the event, which took place last week on September 12 and 13, two blocks from the Madison Square Garden. ""This 2012 edition was taking place on three levels, one more than the previous year, also representing 50% extra surface area. Far from being a handicap, the flow of visitors was very evenly distributed between the different floors. And icing on the cake, sunshine was also part of the show for the whole week in New York enabling visitors and exhibitors to enjoy the terrace available on the last level of Studio 450,” explain the organizers. The conferences organized for the first time this year also recorded high attendance and the small room planned for this purpose was packed during the two days with a total of more than 250 attendees. Moreover, the organizers were particularly delighted by the number of visitors coming from far beyond the greater New York metropolitan area. “The first statistics show that visitors came both from the east coast of the United States but also from Mexico, Canada and several countries in South America. MakeUp in New York takes full advantage of its specificity as a event exclusively focused on make-up, a unique characteristic shared on the European continent by its sister event, MakeUp in Paris.” A new appointment is set in September 2013, but this time in a new venue, success requires."
"""The image we have of beauty is very naive,"" Mona Chollet","Premium Beauty News - You show throughout your essay, how women’s relationship to beauty is ambivalent. It should be marked by pleasure, instead it is often marked by suffering.  Mona Chollet - When it comes to beauty, most women have an ambivalent attitude. Of course, some of them are not too troubled by their appearance. But among all those for whom it is a major concern, many question themselves. They want to look beautiful and attractive, and as such, this is no problem, quite the contrary, it is very positive! But this concern is accompanied by great frustration, involving permanent dissatisfaction. In front of the mirror, one is never beautiful or thin enough. How come what should be a source of pleasure, frivolity and of lightness of mind, becomes a source of worries and suffering? That is what Beauté Fatale [1] is all about. Paying attention to one’s appearance, trying to have a pleasant presence, ideally, this translates into a concern for others, a form of politeness, of keen interest to one’s entourage. Moreover, women sometimes blame men for not thinking enough of the show they offer! What is alienating, is not to want to look beautiful: it is that it should become the most important, the essential thing, that it should takes the whole place and that women’s identity and self-esteem should depend on that. This is what generates the feeling of moral decline if one does not reach his goal. A feeling all the more frequent that the standards of ideal beauty seem to be increasingly stringent and, as such, unattainable. Premium Beauty News - You say about this alienation that it is also a plus, a skill that many men are deprived of. Mona Chollet - It’s hard to say. An aesthetic concern is in itself quite positive, but it is one of those positive values in oneself to which women are confined, trapped. What the feminist discourse is stressing on, quite rightly in my opinion, is first confinement! Nevertheless, as part of this confinement, women have developed special skills. When one learns very early to take care of oneself and of his environment, but also to develop its sensitivity and subjects of interest in certain directions rather than in others, one develops skills which are different from the men’s. Let us be clear, this has nothing innate, it is merely the result of education, of transmission. The main strength of the fashion or of the cosmetic industry, just like women’s magazines, is to consider this ""women’s culture"" seriously. Premium Beauty News - Precisely how do you analyse, in this context, the breakthrough of men’s skincare products? Mona Chollet - I have the feeling that the desire to develop the men’s cosmetic market still faces many obstacles. The brands discourse still seems to have little influence on many men. When it comes to their appearance, women are in a situation of psychic insecurity which does not seem to have any equivalent in men. Concerning for example the use of cosmetic surgery, which remains a predominantly female practice, we observe that men have a much more distant, more technical approach than women. Women address cosmetic surgery as a much more intimate matter, like a truly existential, personal stake. In our society, it is primarily the role of women to embody beauty. Even if pressure is increasing on men, it is far from equalling the burden hanging on women’s shoulders. And since, at the same time pressure is also building on women, the gap remains! Premium Beauty News - You insist a lot on the this obsession with thinness and the increasing number of anorexia cases. Is there not a contradiction between this obsession and the desire to be attractive? For a number of men extreme thinness is not very appealing. Mona Chollet - According to the theories of American feminists, this obsession with thinness arises when women start leaving their traditional place to set foot into the domain of men. In short, when they leave their homes to enter the active work force. For them it implies conforming to an image of professional efficiency, forged by men, and which devalues the housewife, the mothering woman. To which comes in play, I believe, a element of female guilt, a feeling of not being in their place, and also some aggressiveness versus the female body. Premium Beauty News - You mention at the end of your work a broader conception of beauty which could reconcile many women with themselves. Mona Chollet - It seems to me that the image we have of beauty is very naive. In short, it boils down to a set of ideal physical criteria that must be met as closely as possible. It is pretty well summed up by the fetishism of measurements. All this ignores the reality of relationships where seduction comes into play or of the many ways of inhabiting a body. Often people reduce my discourse to a simplistic opposition between ""inner beauty"" and ""outer beauty"". But what I mean in fact is that boundaries between appearance and psyche are much more blurred than what is generally thought. Beauty, has obviously to do with outer appearance, but also in the way we express ourselves with our body and the way we interact with others. There is no joy in perfection and it is much more desirable to be fantastic than to be perfect!"
Male grooming: market grows at rapid pace but brands need to adapt,"All surveys point to the same phenomenon: the global market for men’s cosmetics is booming.  According to a recent study by Kline & Company, the male skin care market has nothing of a niche market anymore. In this context, even the term “metrosexual” - a portmanteau word that, throughout the first decade of the century, symbolised men’s new behaviour of towards beauty - has turned obsolete.  “It used to imply a certain niche group, whereas in 2012, all types of men, in urban and suburban areas, are using male grooming products,” explains Nancy Mills, Consumer Practice Industry Manager at Kline & Company. As far as sales are concerned, it is a real emerging market, with several segments recording double-digit growth rates.  Recent figures on men’s grooming tools and products [1]  released by The NPD Group, reveal men continue to discover the benefits of keeping up appearances.  “Men’s grooming tools are among the largest dollar growth drivers in the overall personal care industry and product categories like men’s facial skincare continue to grow at a fast pace,” says the research firm in a release. According to Kline & Company, sales of men’s cosmetics and toiletries in the U.S. could hit US$ 3.2 billion by 2016, up from an estimated US$2.6 billion this year and US$ 2.2 billion in 2006.  As far as the European market is concerned, sales of skincare products have boomed from 289 million euros in 2005 to 420 million euros in 2010 in the continent’s five biggest markets - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK - according to Mintel. The surge in sales is also affecting new markets. In China, the male grooming market should increase by more than 20% a year during 2012 to 2014, according to RNCOS. The rise of the men’s cosmetics market comes together with a strong growth in sales of electrical appliances especially dedicated to men. For instance, in the 12 months ending June 2012, U.S. sales of men’s electric shavers and men’s trimmers gained 9 percent and 12 percent, respectively in dollar sales.  According to The NPD Group, sales of facial trimmers grew 13 percent in dollar sales. Pen trimmers and nose/ear trimmers together accounted for 13 percent of men’s trimmer dollars and increased 22 percent and 19 percent in units, respectively. Body groomers gained nearly 16 percent in unit sales in the 12 months ending June.  Body groomers skew toward the under-35 age group and are even more popular among men under age 25. [2] There are several sociological changes concerning both mature and emerging markets that may explain this dramatic shift that has no reason to slow down: an increased number of men employed in the sector of services, increased competition in the workplace, ageing baby boomers eager to stay stylish, and the young generation influenced by changing standards of male beauty. However, the men’s market is not as easy to capture as it seems. As impressive as they are impressive, growth rates do not always match the initial expectations of many manufacturers. Especially as competition has increased greatly in this market. In the U.S., over nine in ten men use some sort of grooming products today, claims The NPD Group. [3] Nevertheless, apart from the usual toiletries and from perfumes, the progress is notable only regarding a limited range of face care products. At Sothys, the French brand specialised in skin and body products sold at beauty parlours, three separate categories of targets have been considered for renewing the men’s range: “beginners”, using the bare minimum of cosmetics; “amateurs”, they use men’s products but do not hesitate to borrow those of their wife, “confirmed users,” who appreciate the most innovative products and want a perfect result. Because of its positioning, Sothys is perfectly aware of how difficult it is to tap into this market. ""Although men are becoming increasingly familiar with beauty products, it is not easy for them to push the door of a beauty institute.""  The brand, which now generates 8 to 10% of its turnover in the men’s segment thus observes that if sales are taking off in spas, they remain marginal in beauty institutes; the latter representing 90% of the Sothys’ points of sale worldwide. Despite the huge potential of the men’s market, both brands and retailers still need to find the most effective way to communicate with these new male consumers. “They have still not developed specific communication strategies for men, and the sales universes are still very much women-oriented, especially in selective distribution,” recently explained Anne Césard, project manager at French market research firm Xerfi. As far as Sothys is concerned, the answer was to develop a range of products being both simple and practical, in order to convince men, but also to enrol Vincent Clerc, an international rugby player, world cup vice-champion with the French team in 2011, as the brand’s spokesmodel. The way brands speak to men is even more important as the beauty industry was historically built to address women’s needs.  “Men have become increasingly conscious of the perks associated with looking good,” says Karen Grant, The NPD Group. “They have a heightened awareness that looking good may provide them an advantage in the workplace as well as in their personal lives.  However, men have different skin than women and the men’s grooming brands need to continue educating them as well as make them feel comfortable in the shopping environment to gain sales in this category,” she adds."
MakeUp in New York opens its doors next week,"Premium Beauty News - Already the second edition of this event, which is already standing out as the major event of the make-up sector across North America! Sandra Maguarian - That’s true... In the wake of the success of MakeUp in Paris and numerous demands from exhibitors, we decided to duplicate the winning concept in New York.  Because of its size, the US market is highly attractive. Compared to the parcelling of the European market, it can be considered as the biggest unified market in the world. Due to the high concentration of beauty companies in the area, New York is the best place for suppliers to display and promote their products... MakeUp in NewYork is a true laboratory of innovations, with animations, demonstrations, debates, and of course with its very trendy exhibitors booth. With a total of 650 visitors, MakeUp in New York as of its first edition to be the future meeting spot for American make-up professionals.  During 2 days last year, dozens of managers of American brands coming from managing, marketing or purchasing teams have followed one another in the aisles of Studio 450. « A true festival of highly competent professionals, with many of them coming from the West Coast and even some from South America », agreed many exhibitors who had seldom seen during a professional event so many people of such high level. The second edition open its doors next week on the same location as last year, 450 West 31st Street, a few steps from Penn Station. The same location, but this time on three levels for a total of 1,500 m² (16,000sq ft) of exhibition space, that is, the double of what had been necessary for the 2011 edition! But it is not so much the increase in the exhibition space which is remarkable, but both the constancy with which almost all the exhibitors from the first edition have re-registered and increased their exhibition space, and also the arrival of new exhibitors just as prestigious. Premium Beauty News - And for the first time the New York edition will offer some conferences? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Yes, it promises to be a new colourful edition with a rich content in special animations and conferences. This year, the increased surface area making it possible, an auditorium will host eight conferences - featuring many American professionals from the cosmetic sector.

Boticario invests to tackle growing competition,"The Boticário group chose a typically Brazilian name for its new brand of makeup. Quem disse, Berenice? (in English, Who said, Berenice?) was selected after a consumer survey as emblematic of a Portuguese name which is easy to understand and to remember. Indeed, the aim of the launch, announced on the 9th of August, is to tackle the rise of international brands on the Brazilian marketplace.  The US makeup brand M.A.C, for instance, already operates stores in twelve cities across the country.  For its part, French beauty retailer Sephora (LVMH group) has opened its first retail store on July 13 in in São Paulo’s new JK Iguatemi mall. The group Boticário’s new brand is starting operation in São Paulo with the opening of six franchised stores scheduled during the month of August.  Furthermore, an online store will be available in September. The stores operate on a self-service system, quite new in Brazil, and are designed so that consumers feel free to try all the products, with the help of a shop assistant when needed. Quem disse, Berenice? is positioned as a very accessible brand thanks to the its diversified portfolio, fair prices, easy to understand language, stores located in high flow places and e-commerce store with delivery throughout Brazil. The brand features a portfolio of 500 products, including items for lips, eyes and face, as well as nail polishes, perfumes and accessories. Quem disse, Berenice? offers the largest choice of shades and colours among Brazilian brands. There are 100 colours of lipstick. Similarly, mascaras enable to freely combine various effects and formulas.  The line also includes a full range of makeup removers. “With Quem disse, Berenice? we further reinforce the Boticário group’s operations in the cosmetic and perfumery markets and we strengthen our position as a leading player in the market. We are addressing a profile of consumer who is not in the focus of O Boticário and Eudora,” says Artur Grynbaum, President of the Boticário group. Most products Quem disse, Berenice? are manufactured at the Boticário group’s plant in Pinhais (Paraná). They will be distributed by the group’s Logistics Center located at Registro, in the state of São Paulo. The Boticário group also announced it was investing 650 million reals (255 million euros or318 million dollars) for the development of its infrastructures in Brazil. BRL 380 millions will be spent on the construction of a new plant in Camaçari, near Salvador, in the state of Bahia. Once the building is achieved - 14 months of works are expected - the plant should have a capacity of 150 million units per year. In addition, 155 million will be devoted to the opening of a logistics centre in São Gonçalo dos Campos, in the town of Feira de Santana, in the state of Bahia too. The remaining 115 millions will be devoted to the modernization the facility in São José dos Pinhais near Curitiba (Paraná). BRL 85 million will be spend to expand the plant and double the production capacity of makeup products up to 75 million units per year.  The other 30 millions will be devoted to the research and development centre."
What did you miss (or not) during the summer?,"As far as markets are concerned, Organic Monitor noted that natural and organic cosmetic brands tend to open their own shops to enter in Asia. This topic will be developed further during the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit that will be held in Hong Kong on 12 and 13 November 2012.  Also concerning the natural cosmetics segment, the 2012 edition of the Natural Cosmetics Conference will focus on the desires and expectations of European consumers. This latter event is organized in Berlin (September 25 & 26, 2012) by Elfriede Dambacher, Director of publishing company Naturkosmetik Verlag, in cooperation with NürnbergMesse, Emerging markets continue to attract investments. Gattefossé has announced the opening of a subsidiary in Brazil, while Symrise announced the strengthening of its presence with the opening of new premises. French brand L’Occitane, which is listed at the Hong Kong stock exchange, has focused its attention on Asia, with the acquisition of French-Korean brand Erborian.  Korea is also in the focus of Coty, which is cooperating with LG to tap into this market. French group Yves Rocher oriented its development towards the growing markets surrounding Western Europe (Turkey, Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe) and acquired a majority stake in Turkish cosmetics maker Flormar. The London Olympics games in London were a major highlight during this summer, and were marked by the efforts of brands operating in the UK to take advantage of this opportunity to boost rather dull sales. MakeUp in New York and Beyond Beauty Paris, the two main shows in September, enjoy good perspectives. The organizers of MakeUp in New York, in particular, welcomed a strong increase in the number of exhibitors (+40%) compared to the previous edition. Among new exhibitors, U.S. supplier of disposable accessories and packaging Qosmedix announced that he would showcase several new products on this occasion. Among the innovations launched during the summer, let’s note the new 3D rendering service offered by Quadpack as well as the airless ampoules proposed by Yonwoo. Actually airless packs have confirmed their position as the important market drivers, in particular with the solutions presented by Lumson and Mega Airless. Regarding ingredients and formulations, Ashland has presented a series of sample formulations for makeup. Also worth to note are several financial transactions, including Burberry’s buy back of its perfumes and cosmetics license, the acquisition of HCP, a specialist of prestige cosmetic packaging, by a U.S. private equity fund, as well as Cosfibel’s acquisition of Solvpack, a company specializing in the manufacture of luxury boxes. As per Californian brand of masstige skin care and beauty products Physicians Formula is passed into the hands of Swander Pace Capital, a private equity firm specializing in the acquisition of companies with high growth potential. Regarding regulations, New Zealand has adopted the European requirement for the labelling of nanoparticles contained in cosmetic products, ISO has published two new standards for cosmetics, one on microbial protection and the other on the evaluation of UVA protection. Eventually, some new appointments to remember: Laure Mounier, as Director of Sales and Marketing at the Soupletube group, a leading European manufacturer of flexible laminated tubes, and Raoul Chaves and Florie Schawller respectively appointed Marketing Innovation Director and Sales Manager France at Cosmogen."
The Natural Cosmetics Conference questions consumers’ expectations,"This year’s Natural Cosmetics Conference will be held on September 25 & 26 at the Ellington Hotel, in Berlin, Germany.  The aim of the organizers is to offer a full overview of the stakes and current trade topics for the natural beauty market. “Natural has become part of the entire beauty market. Whether natural cosmetics will continue to influence the cosmetics market depends on several factors.  Aside from current market data and facts, interesting discussion forums, expert discussions, trend reports and Best Practice examples will be on the Conference agenda. For the first time participants will be offered two focal points: Forum A will centre on the international market and retail. Forum B will focus on questions concerning procurement, research, development and the commodity market,” explain the organizers. This year’s main speakers will reflect on the topic of sustainability from two points of view:  Michael J. Kolodziej, board member DM-Drogerie Markt, will present the topic as a holistic, strategic business concept. 
Based on his Cradle to Cradle® concept, Prof. Dr. Michael Braungart, founder and scientific manager of EPEA Internationale Umweltforschung GmbH, will demonstrate that intelligent and eco-efficient design can lead to new impulses for the entire beauty trade. A specific focus will be made on consumers’ expectations: Why are there so many occasional buyers?  What keeps them from becoming loyal natural cosmetics customers?  What do they expect at the POS? Consumer protection issues will also placed at the centre-stage of the conference. Experts and representatives of European politics have been invited to discuss central questions for future market development: How much regulation is needed? How can consumers more easily discern natural cosmetics? What is the significance of the POS? Why is shoppermarketing a relevant aspect today and how is a targeted introduction of consumers to natural cosmetics possible? On September 24, the day prior to the conference, the organizers offer a 4-hour trend tour in Berlin (from 2 to 6 p.m.), with the aim to discover innovative natural cosmetics shop concepts at different hotspots of the German capital city."
The assumed pride of beauty made in Brazil,"Premium Beauty News - There is an increasing number of International brands to try their chance in Brazil. Is it the new Eldorado of beauty? Leila Rochet-Podvin - Brazil has become one of the target countries in the internationalization of brands and its economic growth attracts each year more and more foreign brands. The country ranks fifth in the world in terms of its population, and there is a rising amount of middle- or higher-class people living close to the number of people in France and in the UK put together. It is also a very urban, (84% of the population lives in cities), and young country, since the median age is 29 years. Unlike Chinese people who save money, Brazilians have a high level of consumption. Opinion polls highlight a very optimistic population, confident in the future and proud of its country. Feelings that should be enhanced by the preparation of upcoming major sports events: the Football World Cup in 2014 and the Summer Olympics in 2016 in Rio. As a result, Brazil ranks first, ahead of Chile, among 30 emerging economies [1] in terms of attractiveness for retailing activities. Premium Beauty News - Beauty holds an important place in Brazilian culture. Leila Rochet-Podvin - It is often rightly said, that Brazilians women truly worship the beauty of the body : which must look simple, as natural as possible, but perfect. This is logical in a country where climate encourages body exposure. Therefore Brazilian women do not hesitate to invest to shape their silhouette, be it through sport, cosmetic procedures or through the use of cosmetics. For 91% of Brazilian women, being beautiful is important primarily for social life [2]. It must be noted that three of the five highest paid top models in the world are Brazilians. But things do not stop there. Because of its history, this market is very different from many other emerging markets, in particular regarding their interest for luxury products. Brazilians have their own brands, including in the upper end segment. Several Brazilian luxury brands have even emerged in fashion and jewellery. The tradition of design is strong in Brazil. What naturally comes to mind are the great Brazilian architects, but the country is also very dynamic in terms of fashion and also has several world-renowned contemporary artists. They develop a contemporary aesthetic inspired by Brazilian history, a mixture of modernism, closeness to nature and of indigenous influences. Unlike other emerging markets, sophisticated and knowledgeable, Brazilian consumers have great confidence in their local brands. An equally important feature of Brazilian culture is the art of living together: the importance given to human relationship, to cordiality. This has immediate consequences in terms of marketing. Thus, Brazilians are very demanding in terms of quality of service, of the quality of reception in outlets. The shopping experience in outlets must be up to expectations. Moreover, the country ranks second for the use of social networks. Beauty bloggers as such, play a pivotal role for the recommendation of cosmetics in Brazil. Finally, we cannot talk about beauty in Brazil without mentioning the country’s ethnic, religious and cultural mix, the ""mash’up"" culture that fosters tolerance and mixtures. Today, a minority of the population (48%) defines itself as ""white"", and 7% claims being ""black."" In Brazil can be found a multitude of skin tones, actually 136 different types. And this must be combined to an almost equally impressive variety of hair types. This obviously has an impact in the development of products, particularly hair care and make-up. Premium Beauty News - What are the main market trends? Leila Rochet-Podvin - The ideal Brazilian beauty favours a ""healthy"" and natural look. Skincare products are progressing very quickly (55% per year [3]), ""urban"" sun protection products are also fast growing, as well as make-up. We have summarized the trends and influences that we observed in Brazil according to two axes. On the one hand, that of urbanization and of country development confronted to its more authentic temporal link ([fast/slow}) and, on the other hand, the influence of Brazilian roots facing the standards of internationalization and of global performance. Which gives us four major trends: – Authentic’Link, with the enhancement of Brazilian ""mash-up"" culture as the root for a future style of life. Keywords are the reinterpretation of know-how, the enhancement of the country’s heritage and history. The cosmetic brands which are emblematic of this trend are Avatim, or Água de Alfazema de Phebo. – Graffiti’Play, that promotes vibrant colours, as an expression of the creative urban identity game. Keywords are the joy of living, experience and emotion, the identity mash-up, a rich culture. The cosmetic emblematic brands in this trend are Body Store, Ducha Cosmeticos or the make-up line Soul from Eudora. – Techno’Wise, an optimistic urban model hinged on products developed with the solid know-how of pros. The keywords are: sustainable architecture, technology of tomorrow, urban efficiency, praise of the pros, expert words. Among cosmetics brands emblematic of this trend: Duda Molinos, eos, Contem1g. – Green’Alchemy, where nature is seen as imperative source of future development, which values social harmony and the preservation of resources, and with the following keywords: ethics, biodiversity, natural chemistry, respect of Brazilian knowledge, preservation, upcycling. The Ekos line by Natura is the best known example. One can also mention the brand Amazonia Viva or Sejaa. On all market segments, local brands are flourishing and proudly wear the markers of Brazilian identity. To meet this competition, international brands who want to succeed in this market should be above reproach in terms of quality and find an appropriate distribution solution in a country where the retail sector is still underdeveloped, although the situation is evolving very quickly. The study ""Inspiration from Brazil"" is available from Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation. For more information, contact Leila Rochet-Podvin: contact@inspirationcreation.com"
MakeUp in Paris: record number of visitors,"“MakeUp in Paris is a must that is making its mark,” said the organisers of the show dedicated to the makeup industry. Indeed, the third edition of Make Up in Paris hosted more than 2,100 visitors, up 13% over the previous year, according to the organisers. As usual, marketing teams come out in the top positions with a rate of 35%, followed by R&D and Sales teams. The organisers particularly welcomed the strong rise in the number of foreign visitors: +45% over 2011. “They come from everywhere and ... from far! Many Americans (+ 75%), more and more Germans (+ 65%), of Spaniards (+ 45%), English (+ 31%), Belgians (+37%) of Swiss (+ 14%)... but also visitors from countries totally new to this event like Paraguay, Taiwan, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Ukraine.... Visitors from China, Japan and South Korea had also made the trip.” Overall, more than 40 countries were represented this year against 29 in 2011.  A figure that should consolidate MakeUp in Paris in its ambition to be the leading B2B make-up event in Europe. <album|id_article=4338>"
Instrumental beauty: strong growth confirmed by recent study,"The think tank BeautyFull Club provides a new contribution to an important issue for the prestige cosmetics industry: instrumental beauty. And this, through a partnership with Parisian business school ESCP Europe.  The study was entrusted to 6 students graduating in a Master 2 (Master in European Business) was presented with great success on June 20 before an audience of professionals. This is the second time [1] that the BeautyFULL Club entrusts students from ESCP Europe with a study. With the help of Raphaël Goumot, technological innovation consultant, Sophie Meyer-Ohlendorf, Maja Kambic, Daphne Philippou, Irina Poganaru, Diana Yanova and Archit Gupta, all of different nationalities, have strived for 4 months on the project, and made a remarkable presentation of their findings. In an amphitheatre perfumed on the occasion by Scentys. They were asked to analyse - globally - the emerging market of instrumental beauty for the selective cosmetic industry, and to specify the characteristics and attractiveness of this new market, both for cosmetic brands, and packaging manufacturers. Ultimately, the study helps understand how electronics provides consumers and brands an additional asset and new features justifying the extra cost of instrumental beauty and its adoption over time by consumers. More than fifty professionals, packaging manufacturers and cosmetic brands alike, were very impressed with the relevance of strategic recommendations. All the presentation material is available to members of the BeautyFull Club (downloadable from the website www.beautyfullclub.com). The market of instrumental beauty in the selective sector presents important differences depending of countries. The attractiveness of instrumental beauty was therefore studied in 11 countries: in Asia (China, Japan, South Korea), on the American continent (USA and Brazil) and in Europe (France, Germany, England, Italy, Spain and Russia). The study also listed the main marketed systems by distinguishing three categories of electronics used: embedded in the packaging, proposed as a complementary system or used for purposes of communication and customer relationship. One of the recommendations of the study is the strategic acquisition of companies with an electronic activity to help them develop creative high value offers for cosmetics brands. Because the global market of prestige instrumental beauty is bound to grow very significantly due to the benefits perceived by customers, eager to find ""instant"" and multi functional effects. True to its mission as a think tank, the BeautyFull Club will continue in 2012/2013 its collaboration with engineering, business and design schools, to develop a thorough understanding of the main issues in the selective cosmetic industry, and also to help attract young talents."
Men’s beauty market booms but retailers need to adapt,"The time where skin care products were targeting the specific “metrosexual” niche has come to an end.  With the growing popularity of men’s cosmetics the term “metrosexual” is even becoming obsolete.  “It used to imply a certain niche group, whereas in 2012, all types of men, in urban and suburban areas, are using male grooming products,” explains Nancy Mills, Consumer Practice Industry Manager for market research firm Kline & Company. Actually, men’s grooming is one of the fastest growing segments in the beauty business. According to Kline [1], in 2011, sales of men’s skin care in the U.S. have seen their best growth in several years.  The analysis is the same at Mintel.  The Chicago-based research firm forecasts sales of men’s toiletries in the U.S. to hit US$3.2 billion by 2016, up from an estimated US$2.6 billion this year and US$2.2 billion in 2006. As far as the European market is concerned, sales of skincare products have boomed from 289 million euros in 2005 to 420 million euros in 2010 in the continent’s five biggest markets: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK.  This growth is particularly impressive when compared to largely stagnant sales of shaving products and razors in the same area [2]. The demand is driven by social and demographic changes in both mature and emerging markets: an increased number of men employed in the sector of services, increased competition in the workplace, ageing baby boomers eager to stay stylish, and the young generation influenced by changing standards of male beauty.  New entrants on the markets, as well as technologically advanced products, expanded lines, and innovative packaging are also stimulating sales. According to Mintel, six in 10 (65%) European men consider their appearance important and almost half (48%) admit what they want most is to look attractive and well groomed. Just 15% of men admit that while it is acceptable for women to use skincare products, it is not acceptable for men to use such products.  It’s not only that it has become more socially acceptable for men to put effort into looking and feeling good, as for many women it has almost become a requirement. Brands are consequently creating new solutions for men, expanding their offering far beyond the traditional deodorant and after-shave.  Anti-aging creams, powders, concealers and tinted moisturizers are now entering in men’s beauty routine. Despite the huge potential of the men’s market, both brands and retailers still need to find the most effective way to communicate with these new male consumers. “They have still not developed specific communication strategies for men, and the sales universes are still very much women-oriented, especially in selective distribution,” argues Anne Césard, project manager at French market research firm Xerfi. Indeed, many men remain squeamish about products that seem too feminine.  Thus, as far as male products are concerned, some words and colours are considered taboo.  For instance, the term “make-up” as well as pink and gold colours must be avoided strictly.  “It is clear that brands cannot approach the men’s market as they do with the women’s one,” confirmed celebrity makeup artist Max Herlant, during a session dedicated to the enhancement of men’s complexion at the latest edition of the MakeUp in Paris trade show. As a consequence, brands specifically devoted to men may benefit from a competitive advantage as they can more easily adopt a strong masculine positioning than those derived from the women’s market. However, from that point of view, retailers are facing the biggest challenge.  As the market is growing they tend to devote more shelf space to men’s beauty products but still have to find the relevant environment.  In the U.S.A., department stores such as Nordstrom and Macy’s are creating separate sections dedicated solely to men, cosmetics chain Ulta rolled out in-store boutiques called the Men’s Shop, CVS Pharmacy has created Guy Aisles in its stores, and skin-care brand Kiehl’s is building Shave Bars inside its stores."
Make-up: a subtle global overview,"The round table on cosmetic markets in Brazil, Asia and the United States, which took place on June 21 as part of the third edition of MakeUp in Paris somehow prefigured the forthcoming appointments of MakeUp in New York, on 12 and 13 September 2012, and of MakeUp in Sao Paulo on 10 and 11 April 2013. For the organizers, it was not so much a matter of comparing a priori very different markets than to offer an overview of major trends at stake in these key areas. If Brazil is undoubtedly a country with a high growth potential for beauty manufacturers, ""it is a market where many things can be undertaken"" confirmed Helena Garcia de Gracia, Marketing Director of Eudora, a brand of the Boticário group. Brazilian women have a culture of sensuality and a power of decision over their beauty. The penetration rate of make-up products is about 35% and their share of the beauty market in Brazil is about 12%, with a perfect balance between nail polishes, lipsticks and face makeup (25% each). But in 2012, make-up products are still mostly sold by home beauty advisers. ""There are a lot of direct sales beauty consultants in Brazil, 2000 or 3000 women who sell make-up with only a basic training. This is the role of advertising and of social networks of doing the education work required to properly use the new products. There are in Brazil some beauty blogs which are very popular and where women describe their make-up experiences, the impact of the posts and comments is very strong,"" emphasised Helena Garcia de Gracia. To be noted also, the importance of ethnic diversity. In Brazil, there are no fewer than one hundred different types of skin tones while Caucasians-type carnations only represent 49% of the population: a specificity that brands must consider in their communication. Unlike Brazil, the U.S. is a mature market, but it continues to grow steadily. ""It is the first luxury and beauty market in the world, growth in 2010-2011 was of 9% in the premium make-up market and of 8% in the make-up mass market. [1] After years of crisis, this is a rebirth,"" explained Leila Rochet-Podvin, founder and director of the Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation Agency. According to Jamie Matusow from the American magazine, Beauty Packaging Magazine, ""purchases of beauty products are a small luxury that U.S. women treat themselves with, while sales of electronic products and solar panels have collapsed."" A cornerstone of the market, is the culture of innovation, particularly in marketing. Many new products appear in the U.S. before spreading to the rest of the world. It is from this country that originated the vogue for make-up artists, mineral make-up as a specific category, or Doctor’s brands. According to Rochet-Podvin, the growing diversity of the U.S. population is one of the major trends to consider: ""in 2050, those who are currently known as ’minorities’ will represent the majority of the U.S. population.""  Which is reflected in particular by an evolution of the beauty ideal. Other trends identified by Leila Rochet-Podvin: the eulogy of femininity with an explosion of colours, urban cosmetics and entertainment, which results in products suited to contemporary lifestyles, ethics and sustainable development, up values, and finally the emergence of the healthy look that puts health and longevity at the heart of concerns. Make-up is an important part of American culture, with 49% of women considering that it can help improves self confidence (IPSOS WLT 2011). The Asian market is still marked by the two heavyweights, China and Japan. For Caroline Moulin, President of NaO Design Trends: ""What is happening in China is what happened eight years ago in Japan, sales of cosmetics are completely going through the roof. Brands in China are the same than those found in Japan. But there are differences in tastes depending of regions and colours may differ, especially between Beijing and Shanghai."" But the Chinese market still has its make-up culture to build and, again in this case, beauty blogs play an important role. In China, the look is very important, a pale look that women are seeking to broaden, thanks to tips found on the social media authorized by the government. In Japan, the market is very different since it’s already very mature and bearing the brunt of the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster. ""But the market continues to innovate, especially in terms of packaging with very ingenious innovations in packaging and refilling systems,"" observed Moulin. ""Furthermore, electro-beauty is very present in outlets."" Japan’s culture of the flawless skin is very strong, the success of BB creams and the need for a radiant complexion exemplify this. Given these characteristics and the development potential offered by these markets, participants to the roundtable emphasized on the growing role of subcontractors, who, in the wake of brands, are also extending their global presence. Moreover, an increasing number of companies choose to focus on marketing and to rely on full service for the development of their products. ""Subcontracting is a professional service and with high value added, it is a fast way of bringing innovation to markets. In the U.S., more than 50% of beauty product’s come from subcontracting,"" confirmed Musa Pharand-Dias VP Marketing of the American firm Oxygen Developmentwho experienced a very strong growth in 2011. For his part, Thomas Weckerle, CEO of the German company Weckerle, guarantees the ability of his company to ensure in the whole world the same level of quality: ""Each market can benefit from the latest technologies and we can produce with the same tools in a global way."" Good news for markets like Brazil, where access to the latest innovations is more difficult and where the help of full service companies is therefore most welcome. ""Our customers are willing to pay the necessary price for a product with high added value, we make sure to take into account local needs, human diversity to offer innovative make-up products,"" underlined Weckerle. Finally, the main common point which was highlighted between these three regions is the importance of social media and their increasing role in consumerism."
MakeUp in Paris 2012: a mature edition ,"It works for all industry players, be they specialists in formulas, packaging or make-up accessories. A twist of friendliness with a few smart ideas like the distribution of soft drinks in the aisles of the show by a waitress on a delivery tricycle relayed by a permanent open bar, the whole of it in an upscale atmosphere due to the flawless design of mini showrooms and stands...exhibitors and visitors alike were seduced. They were also seduced by this original colouring workshop where everyone could practice on colouring, oops! make-up. Not forgetting the superb demos performed by students of make-up schools. Among the new features that have strengthened the professionalism of the event: the organization of more than twenty highly original conferences in the dedicated room crowded by hundreds of people, and, of course, the very first ""Innovation Awards"" which enabled to single out six companies in the ""formulation"", ""full service"", ""packaging"" and ""accessory"" categories. The awards ceremony, on the evening of June 21st, was particularly moving given the enthusiasm and emotion expressed by winners. Three years and already mature! But also the same comment expressed by professionals, visitors and exhibitors to the organizers, ""Please don’t grow!""  An attitude which is indicative of this atmosphere ""like no other"" that have managed to create the initiators of this event indeed ""like no other"" where operators in the make-up industry obviously enjoy meeting far away from ritual gatherings. This MakeUp in Paris is indeed quite a subtle cocktail, made of luxury, friendliness, warmth, professionalism and proximity. A successful cocktail too, since the next meeting will take place on 12 and 13 September in New York, while organizers have announced the holding of MakeUp in Sao Paulo on 10 and 11 April 2013. The New York edition promises to be an excellent vintage and the one in Sao Paulo is obviously highly anticipated, not to say eagerly awaited by suppliers and many managers of cosmetic brands established in South America. The adventure continues..."
The MakeUp in Paris Innovation Awards winners are...,"These awards have been created to honour the year’s most innovative developments for make-up products in four categories: formulation, packaging, accessories & samples, full service.

"""Our difference stands in the complementarity of the three shows constituting Beyond Beauty""","Premium Beauty News - The acquisition of Itec by Informa, last year, seems to have marked a strategic turnaround with both the increased number of complementary events to the shows, and the identity of each of the Beyond Beauty Paris components being put forward. A new start? Julie Cartigny - The acquisition by the Informa group is the recognition of the expertise of the Paris team which has been driving Beyond Beauty and its side events since 2002. This rapprochement enables to accompany the new growth dynamics that implies the creation of events and some acquisitions in all strong growing areas. We want to stay alongside Beauty industry leaders and continue to offer them efficient and profitable events. Informa represents a portfolio of exhibitions and expertises the world over, with some of them in direct connection with our businesses: Vitafood in Geneva is close to Creative Beauty in the segment of health/beauty oriented ingredients, the World Anti Aging Congress, a world leading congress in Monaco targeting medicalized beauty, Datamonitor has developed its expertise as a research firm. All the offices around the world are at the service of our projects and of our will to be even more focused on ’beauty’ in the coming future. Beyond Beauty remains the signature of all our initiatives and for more consistency and simplicity, we have strengthened the communication on each show Creative Beauty Paris, Spameeting Paris, Cosmeeting Paris...Paris has therefore found itself slightly shifted, but remains at the heart of our strategy. Premium Beauty News - In this new context, how is positioned Creative Beauty Paris, the event dedicated to beauty suppliers? Julie Cartigny - The 2012 edition promises to be very successful. To date, more than 92% of the total area is already booked, a 13% increase to compared to 2011 at the same time. With 13% more new exhibitors, we have noticed a significant increase of the Packaging sector, but also great enthusiasm from the ingredient sector, strongly represented on the BBLAB; the private label sector is not left out since we will be also welcoming this year new international players. With 71% of loyal exhibitors from one edition to the other, Creative Beauty remains a major business event where many take advantage of this autumn appointment to present their new products and innovations. We propose in autumn the largest European appointment for beauty suppliers. The complementarity of the three shows that constitute Beyond Beauty is a differentiating point from other events in the profession, since our exhibitors are just as interested in meeting international decision makers (marketing & purchase) from the distribution sector, than they are in meeting the CEOs of brands attending Cosmeeting Paris. Premium Beauty News - What will be the novelties and main highlights of the forthcoming Creative Beauty Paris? Julie Cartigny - Our goal is to rally the whole perfume and cosmetic industry The numerous actions implemented will guarantee a significant increase in the attendance of foreign visitors.

Through their synergy, the three Beyond Beauty events, have been attracting for the past two editions, decision makers from large groups and brands operating in the ready to wear but also luxury or lingerie industry which are diversifying for most of them in cosmetics, perfumes, make-up, by developing in particular ""Capsule"" collections or simply wishing to enrich their offer to female and male consumers! Some brands will develop new market segments: source of inspiration, search for ""white labels"", but also of different packaging solutions Fashion also visits us to find solutions during the Beauty Week!

Premium Beauty News - How do you ensure the consistency of this Beauty Week - which consists of three shows, Creative Beauty Paris, Cosmeeting Paris and Spameeting Paris - with exhibitors and visitors with so different concerns in mind? Julie Cartigny - The Beauty Week represents a high point in the agenda of the beauty industry, some initiatives at the heart of the three specialised shows but also in parallel with several high-level Summits/Conferences which are also represent bridges between each exhibition. The European Spa Summit will bring together international experts from the wellness/spa market, the Natural Beauty Summit Europe will take place in a completely revisited 2012 edition, but also an exceptional cycle of conferences called ’Beyond Beauty Trends’ who will give the floor to 23 trend agencies and beauty experts and dozens of other conferences.

MakeUp in Paris to open its doors this week,"With an average 30% of the references of a brand being renewed each year, the make-up market is probably the one requiring the highest innovation rate within the beauty industry.  So, it is rather logical if the organizers of MakeUp in Paris chose to put innovation at the heart of the third edition of the show dedicated to the makeup industry. Thus, more than more than thirty innovations have been submitted to a jury which was in charge of identifying the list of final nominees in each of the four categories - full service, packaging, formula, accessories, samples - that will receive a MakeUp in Paris Innovation Award. All the selected products will be then showcased in « L’Espace des Innovations » (innovation Area) of MakeUp in Paris 2012. Main originality of this last step: it will be the visitors who will chose among the finalists to single out one product per category. The votes will be displayed on the main screen in real time and the awards will be remitted to the winners during the evening. For the third consecutive year MakeUp in Paris will invite exhibitors, make-up schools and make-up artists to express themselves through make-up demonstrations. On the initiative of exhibitors, nearly a dozen demonstrations are planned, with the participation of renowned make-up artists like Michele Burke and Céleste Duquesne. Four make-up schools will collaborate to two make-up poles; Tannaz Studio from Switzerland, the Make Up For Ever Academy, the Atelier International de Maquillage and for the first time since it was created, MakeUp in Paris will invite So Nails Academy, an academy for future nail stylists, who will perform on Friday, June 22 at 02:00 pm some spectacular demonstrations. Partnering, as of its first edition, with the CEW (Cosmetics Executive Women) France and its Beauty Centres, MakeUp in Paris will propose this year to buy pins bearing the colours of the show, to the benefit of ""Les Centres de Beauté de CEW France"". On Friday, the 22th of June, 9:00 am the CEW France will also propose a conference entitled “The power of nails!”  This event, upon reservation with the CEW France (www.cew.asso.fr), will be preceded by a breakfast. MakeUp in Paris will feature a program of 23 conferences with a large part of them focusing on beauty trends. In the end, with a record number of exhibitors and an enhanced program, all indicators are on the rise for the next edition of MakeUp in Paris."
France: Competition between retailers is strengthening in a difficult market environment,"After a rather buoyant 2011 year, 2012 is likely to be more complicated for perfume and cosmetic retailers in France, partly because of economic uncertainties and the predictable Increase in burdens of households. In a recent study on the challenges of the distribution of perfumes and cosmetics in France [1], Xerfi expects a slowdown in global demand in the short term, despite structural growth factors, particularly the increasing population of seniors, large consumers of skincare products, and the growing emphasis on appearance and well-being in society. But for 2012, some moroseness is to be expected. Sales in the first half of 2012 were rather disappointing for selective distribution (-1.1% in value and -4.1% in volume). For the year as a whole, the beauty industry could suffer from changes in consumer behaviour from French people, even if explains Xerfi, perfumes and make-up should be relatively spared. Additional difficulty, the undeniable source of growth represented by natural and organic cosmetics, personal care products for men and so-called ""ethnoscosmetic"" products may not, despite their dynamism, suffice to boost the short-term market. Especially since, according to Xerfi, traditional operators are struggling to optimize their development strategies vis-à-vis these new segments. For Anne Césard, author of the study, brands are having trouble to communicate with new potential targets. "" They have still not developed specific communication strategies for men, and the sales universes are still very much women-oriented, especially in selective distribution,"" she explained. Observations are the same on the side of natural and organic cosmetics. ""If laboratories are increasing the number of launches, distributors for their part are not too offensive and concepts dedicated to organic cosmetics are scarce,"" with few exceptions, like Aphibio, a selective perfumery of organic perfumes and cosmetics present in 5 cities in France. Given this expected slowdown in sales, Xerfi believes that the volume strategies of selective perfumeries, leading retailers of perfumes and cosmetics, have reached their limits and are ""now forced to play the card of differentiation,"" to try and ""retain consumers increasingly seduced by competitors (pharmacies, drugstores and pure players of the web)."" The research institute notes however that ""in this quest for differentiation, truly innovative concepts have trouble to emerge, brands most often preferring the easy way with imitation, "" by extending their private label range - such as Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé - by increasing the number of exclusivity agreements or by expanding their service offerings to beauty salons (Yves Rocher) or through nail, brow and smile bars (Sephora with its Brow Bars Benefit Cosmetics). For their part, pharmacies are relying on their image of experts to increase their venture in the beauty market (about 15% of perfume and cosmetic sales). Hence some economic interest group have launched their private brand (like Welcoop with Marque Verte), seeking to grow particularly in the segment of dermo-cosmetics, with a low price policy, while others, like Top Pharma, are setting foot on the web. As for drugstores, whose market share in this segment is for the time being limited (6% according Xerfi), they are steadily gaining ground on the cosmetic market. They also have their private brands and have managed like Parashop to revamp their image by revisiting their sales concepts and by expanding their offer. Finally, distance selling leaders must also cope with emerging new actors. In a few years,  beauty boxes  or subscription based e-commerce websites have proven their attractiveness. While the market is still in its infancy, half a dozen operators (GlossyBox, JolieBox, My Little Box, etc..) have already invested this market niche. Other innovations in the segment, such as private sales and de stocking (beauteprivee.fr) or low-cost operators (Eyes Lips Face - e.l.f.) are also trying to challenge the leadership of chain stores network (Sephora, Marionnaud and Nocibé) on the web."
MakeUp in New York announces a set of three round tables,"Visitors of the second edition of MakeUp in NewYork, which will take place on 12 and 13 September 2012 at the Studio 450, 450 West 31st street in New York, will have the opportunity to attend three round tables titled: – Do major make-up trends in Europe have an influence on the North American ones and vice versa?
– Why is the Full-Service offer an underlying trend and how far will it go?
– Make-Up Artist and make-up Innovation, a winning complicity. “It will be a premiere for the MakeUp in NewYork show,” say the organizers.  Indeed, following the success of the first edition, the show doubles its surface and allocates a dedicated area to conferences. The first roundtable (September 12th from 10:30am to 12:00pm), titled Make-up: What is the mutual influence between Europe and North America?, will try to build a bridge between both continents. Led by H. Douglas Thornley, co-founder of Impact Colors, it will bring together Dominique Bouvier, Strand Cosmetics Europe; Mario de Luigi, B.Kolormakeup & Skincare; Renato Ancorotti, Ancorotti Cosmetics; Eric Vanin, Qualipac America and Barbara Bauer-Kropf, Schwan Cosmetics. Titled Strengths and limitations of the full service offer, the second roundtable (September 12 from 3pm to 4:30pm) will explore the development full service in the cosmetics industry.  “This is probably what has most changed the economic landscape in the beauty sector in recent years. In a survey conducted in 2006 among a hundred cosmetic brands in Europe, 20% of respondents said they relied almost entirely on outsourcing... Four years later, they were almost 40%,” explain the organisers of MakeUp in New York.  However, what are the limits of outsourcing? Can everything be outsourced? The round table will be moderated by Jamie Matusow from the Beauty Packaging magazine, with the participation of Jill Tomandl, Stila Cosmetics, as a ""witness"", and: Philippe Cohen, Oxygen Development; Marc-André Houx, Shya Hsin Packaging USA; Mauricio Pachon from Weckerle Cosmetics;  Debra Mc Donough, Cosmolab and Nick Gardner, HCT USA. The third round table (September 13th from 10:30am to 12), titled Make-Up Artist and make-up innovation, the winning couple, will focus on the role of make-up artists in the development of new products and their contribution to innovation, from new formulations to new packaging or accessories, through new techniques of application.  The round table will be moderated by Brian J. Fox-Krawczyk, Genealogy, and will gather Sumatra Batra, Ziba Beauty, Virginia Bonofiglio, Fashion Institute of Technology and the Make-up Artists Michele Burke and Eve Pearl."
Cosmetics for dark skins: Towards a quality labelling?,"Premium Beauty News - What was an association dedicated to cosmetics for black and coloured populations created? Isabelle Ossey Mananga - Because there is a real need for information in France: information intended for consumers and public authorities as well as professionals operating in the cosmetic sector who are developing an increasing interest in this market segment, that they do not however always understand very well. Label Beauté Noire works with dermatologists black skin specialists, pharmacists and psychologists. We carry out preventive and information actions throughout France. We also conduct actions to raise the public’s awareness on the dangers of some products. We have also eventually managed to alert public authorities on the need for information campaigns for consumers and for a better control of the market, while for years we were facing a total indifference vis-à-vis these issues. But information is not our only goal. Our association, founded in 2004, is a consumer association but it also takes an interest in products themselves. We want to raise the awareness of all stakeholders in the sector so that they act more responsibly: manufacturers and distributors alike. This is why we are currently working on a quality label, which will enable our committed manufacturers to have additional benefits in terms of ethics and to enhance their efforts. Premium Beauty News - What will be the purpose of such a label when all cosmetic products sold in France and Europe are subject to the same regulation which guarantees their safety?  Isabelle Ossey Mananga - All this is true in theory. But what we observe in the field is quite different from this legal fiction. If all products on the French market were really safe, the government would not have felt the need to warn consumers on the risks associated with voluntary skin depigmentation practices. [1] It must be recalled that for a long time this market segment, considered as a niche, was of no interest for the European cosmetic giants. Products were only available in specific areas such as Barbès or Château d’Eau in Paris. They were often parallel imports of American, or African products, which in some cases were not compliant with EU regulations. In 2009 and 2010, the French authorities, launched a national campaign to control the market. The tests performed on more than 160 products highlighted a high level of products which were not complying with regulations, with the presence of prohibited substances endangering the health of consumers in about 30% of cases in 2009 and 40% of cases in 2010. The DGCCRF undertook legal proceedings for breaches of the rules on the composition and/or labelling of products and proceeded to the withdrawal of products at the distributors. Premium Beauty News - The situation has not changed since? Isabelle Ossey Mananga - This market is rapidly changing with manufacturers showing a growing interest in it. Long considered a niche market, it is now increasingly seen as a growth driver for brands. Today, the product offer is much broader. But parallel circuits have not disappeared, online sales of non-complying products either. Some drugs are still diverted from their original use for cosmetic purposes. Consumers have trouble making a difference between products. Our work to educate and alert consumers consists in directing them to general and specialized recognized cosmetic ranges and in preventing them from using an inappropriate product, and in diverting them from the use of illegal products containing hydroquinone or steroids. The label will be, from this point of view, a simple and immediately understandable indicator. The cosmetic market for black and mestizo skins must be deghettoized. Whether it concerns hair care, skincare, or make-up products. By educating consumers, without stigmatizing them and by promoting quality products. Premium Beauty News - How will this label work? Isabelle Ossey Mananga - Interested brands will have to adhere to a quality charter imposing commitments in terms of quality and traceability of products and forcing them to accept controls. All product categories will be concerned: skin care, hair care, make-up. Premium Beauty News - Yet, health issues are not identical for all product categories. Concerns are mostly related to lightening products? Isabelle Ossey Mananga - Beyond the health aspect there are much more general issues. We can for example question ourselves on the predominating standard of beauty. But all this is changing very quickly. The increasing mixing of races in societies, globalization, the rise in the purchasing power of children and grandchildren of immigrants, are all factors fuelling a fast growing market that brands no longer overlook even if they still find it difficult to meet the specific needs of over-consuming, and demanding customers. Take for example the case of make-up. Studies have shown that there were 12 tons of so called Caucasian skins against 35 of black and mixed skins. This represents a huge issue in terms of product development, particularly in the field of make-up. And few are the brands addressing this need. The more women will easily find a suitable and accessible offer meeting their needs, the less they will be tempted to turn to the parallel market."
Summits highlight growth of US natural cosmetics market,"According to Kline’s ""Global Natural Care Market Report"", the double-digit growth rate of the natural care global market, reached a volume of USD 23.1 billion in 2010 (USD 20.1 billion in 2009).  According to the market research firm, which presented the main quantitative features of the North American market during the Natural Beauty Summit, growth in the U.S. market alone is expected to reach USD 5.8 billion in sales by 2016. Kline’s Consumer Industry Manager Nancy Mills attributes the dynamism of the natural personal care sector to ever growing consumer awareness of health, environmental, and sustainability concerns. “These drivers are near universal, but their influence varies significantly between markets,” she observes. ""In Western Europe, consumers have a higher awareness and interest concerning product ingredients, business ethics, and sustainability practices, and many are astutely avoiding products which are natural only in positioning.” To this regard, third party certifications play a much more important role in Western Europe compared to the U.S. where both consumers and manufacturers appear quite confused by the profusion of integrated private standards. Possible clarification could come from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which is currently working to develop a standard for natural and organic cosmetics.  Farah Ahmed, Vice President - Associate General Counsel at the U.S. Personal Care Products Council, closed the Natural Beauty Summit’s session devoted to regulations and standards, explaining that ISO is mainly working at defining what are natural and organic cosmetics and cosmetic ingredients and providing the corresponding technical criteria.  However, Farah, who was appointed convenor of the ISO Cosmetic Marketing and Packaging Group in 2009, remained very cautious about the exact scope of the future standard. Speaking at the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which was held at the end of the same week, Wendy McLain of PCC Natural Markets said that the lack of U.S. standards for natural and organic cosmetics puts the onus on retailers to educate consumers. Its company uses newsletters, in-store sampling and merchandising techniques to inform consumers about its natural cosmetics range. In comparison to the Natural Beauty Summit, the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit was more focused on industry’s best practices, feedbacks and technical solutions, and devoted less time to the description of the market and consumer behaviour.  The two key messages that emerged from the presentations were the need for better and more accurate measurement techniques for environmental impacts, as well as increase adoption rates of sustainable packaging. Regarding the measurment of their environmental impact, although many companies are undertaking life-cycle analysis, varying methodologies, lack of standardized data and general difficulties in analyzing cosmetic formulations prevent accurate measurement. Regarding packaging issues, which according to Intertek, comprises a third of landfill waste, speakers stressed the importance of eco-design in reducing their impact.  Innovations in recycled packaging and the potential of bio-plastics and novel packaging materials were also highlighted. Following the success of its North American edition, Organic Monitor, the organiser of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit  also announced its intention to host its first-ever Latin American edition on 25-27th September 2012 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. As for the next edition of the Natural Beauty Summit Europe, it will take place on 10 and 11 September 2012 in Paris."
Make-up: Spring/summer 2013 trends according to Eckart,"In a market permanently in search for new products, cosmetic ingredient suppliers are required to develop an increasingly widespread range of services. Their laboratories do no longer limit themselves to illustrate the potential of their products, but offer innovative formulations in line with the needs of different markets and with the latest trends. Thus Eckart offers its interpretation of the trends in colour cosmetics for spring / summer 2013. The specialist of metallic effect and pearlescent pigments has identified three major trends: Colours to die for, Business glam, and Dresscode summer. However, warns Eckart, “as unique as each of us are, the more important our ‘own’ personal style becomes.  Few big trends mix up with each other and are displaced by a variety of uncountable small, but distinctive directions.”  What counts, in the end, is to stand out from the rivals, to entice emotions, to leave a deep impression on others, in particular in a highly competitive environment. The first of the three trends developed by Eckart, is made of metal effects that meet traditional Scottish habits and melt into a moment of sensuality. “They create the feeling that the long-awaited gentleman is only one look away.  When applying the “Colors to Die for” make-up, a woman turns into a femme fatale for one night. She will be the centre of attention, and wraps everybody around her little finger by her charming appearance.” To illustrate this theme, Eckart used a variety of red and lilac shades, provided with the expressive metallic shine of its Visionaire range of pigments.  “They are dark, dramatic, and offer passion to touch,” explains Eckart. The ‘colours to die for’ trend was also illustrated in lip stick colours (Gasping Rose, Racing Heart, Bloodcurdling Ruby), blushes, and nail varnishes (Burning Tears, Heart-Stopping Pink, Pulse Breaking). Business Glam, the second trend, brings a feminine touch into a business world.  “This theme understands itself as an escape from dreary dark-blue and grey interwoven office routine. It is a clear commitment to delicate colour accents, which are effectually spiced up with glamour.” Colours are derived from the nude trend, and they have been successfully combined with the Mirage range, Eckart’s borosilicate pigments. For this thematic, liquid eye shadows in toffee and caramel have been upgraded by a touch of violet.  “They bring unexpected sparkle to the ‘business lid’, and help radiate self-confidence and dynamics. Additionally the eyeliner ensures precise highlights,” explains Eckart. As per glosses, they will bring lips no more than the necessary sparkle.  The same applies for the nail polishes; on the first sight their shades appear innocent and subtle. On looking closely they shine in manifold dimensions. Eventually, Dresscode: Summer, the third and last trend explored by Eckart, targets the young, hip, cool.  “Dresscode: Summer is happiness created with the cleanliness of SynCrystal pigments. Long days, long nights – both are right.” It is a true anthem to summertime, sports, beach, music and meeting new people. In short, an anthem to the lust for life; outdoor activities, and to freedom. The colours in this theme are sending a floral message, with eyes exuding cheerfulness, lips which invite kissing, and nails that are true eye catchers. “Dresscode: Summer represents the perfect contrast and partner to the white of linen,” concludes Eckart.

What is the place of creative perfumery in France?,"The last decade has indeed seen the revival of some old perfume brands and the emergence of a significant number of newcomers, trying to capture an audience, both curious and wanting to escape the uniformizing steamroller of international brands. But strangely , these brands seem to have trouble finding their place in France. [1] According to David Frossard, co founder of Différentes Latitudes, they are ""perfumes whose approach is not dictated by marketing and markets, perfumes which are not intended to the largest number but to a happy few, an intellectual, financial and/or cultural elite."" Which confirms François Hénin, President of Jovoy, for whom this is an ""interesting phenomenon that invites individuals to stand out from this homogeneity with a real differentiation approach."" For his part, Gilles Thévenin, President of Lubin, insists on the research for quality and tradition of the French fine perfumery. Freedom, creativity, independence, and almost home-made high quality manufacturing, are also characteristic features highlighted by Valérie PIanelli-Guichard, CEO of Comptoir Sud Pacifique. All stakeholders agree on the reality of the request for a segment that, according to David Frossard, represents about 4% of the global perfumery market. But the French situation is both specific and difficult for brands, due of the highly concentrated structure of the distribution. ""In France, very few distributors exist for these products,"" explains David Frossard. If we add to this, the fact that small brands cannot really afford to invest in advertising and that there seems to be a lack of interest from beauty journalists for the subject, the main difficulty to overcome by creative perfumery in France seems be its lack of visibility. Brands strive to work on their own identity, not hesitating to adopt differentiating biases. From the wild and natural history of the Atlantic coasts at Lostmarc’h, where each ingredient comes from a local sourcing, to the olfactory world tour proposed by Comptoir Sud Pacific, from juices made by the greatest noses at The Different Company, to the classics revisited by the Lubin house founded in 1798, each player is working with passion on his identity and positioning. The customer will then acquire a perfume that will become her/his perfume. Despite a often higher shelf price than in the traditional selective circuit, a real emotional connection is created between the customer, and her/his creator’s perfume. "" Customer loyalty is very high in this market unlike the selective market which is a market driven by novelties,"" confirms Luc Gabriel, CEO of The Different Company. More than ever, creativity is at the heart of this business, because the number of artistic perfume brands has exploded since the early 2000s. An inspiration that must however come to life in compliance with regulatory constraints. The last part of the conference focused on packaging issues and on the specific needs of creative perfume brands. For most brands, packaging is an integral part of the creator’s universe and a source of differentiation. Working with standards appears therefore difficult despite the numerous decorating and customizing possibilities offered nowadays by suppliers. The difficulty then stands in finding manufacturers that can perform specific moulds and produce series in limited quantities. Significant efforts have been made by packaging suppliers and conditioners to meet this demand. Valerie Jacob, Marketing Director of SGD, Francis Cheru, Sales Manager of Verreries Brosse, Jean-Luc Leblond, Sales Director of Bormioli Rocco & Figlio, Lucy Ray, Industrial Marketing Manager of Pochet and Isabelle Legallicier Pochet, President of CCI Productions, presented the interest of this segment for them and the specific solutions they offer. Eventually, despite a difficult environment creative perfumery is responding to a real market demand.  Thus, leading luxury brands are interested in this segment and many of them have developed a specific offer. Maybe a means to unlock retail networks."
The cabaret trend continues to inspire cosmetics,"Are movie stars on the verge to lose their near-monopoly on glamour? We are still far from such a situation, but the stars of cabaret, whose fame, until the mid-2000s, never exceeded a limited number of connoisseurs, are now beginning to gain access to worldwide fame.  No wonder that cosmetics manufacturers are interested in them.  More generally, the sensual and glamorous image of the cabaret stage fits perfectly with the development of cosmetic lines especially dedicated to life’s moments of seduction. Dita Von Teese, the famous stripper who greatly contributed to the renaissance of burlesque, had already launched an eponymous perfume in October 2011, with German group Luxess.  The creation even received a Duftstar Award, the German equivalent of a FiFi Award. It is again with a German company, Artdeco, a leading brand for colour cosmetics, that Dita Von Teese signed last year in Paris a licence agreement for the launch of a makeup line to her name. A naturel choice for Artdeco’s CEO Helmut Baurecht: “We couldn’t identify any other woman who is so closely linked with the perfect make-up. She is a true icon.” Dita Von Teese, who participated in the presentation of the new line in Munich at the end of April, explained that she wanted to be part of the products’ design and that it was one of the reasons of a choice for Artdeco.  “I had all liberties to drive the creative process, to influence the development of the textures and colours to make them my signature products. For me it’s important to give more than just my name to a product.” For Artdeco, which is still a family-owned business, the size of this challenge is also an opportunity to strengthen its position on a market where its main competitors are global brands. However, it does not seem to intimidate the team, which is sure of the quality of its work.  “We have never worked so long or so hard on a product launch. We compared ourselves to benchmarks and ultimately surpassed them by delivering better solutions,” said Anna Blasco-Salvat, marketing director. For Chrisitian Louboutin, for which it is legendary said that a bottle of bright red nail enamel inspired him to coat the soles of his vertiginous stilettos, the leap into the cosmetics sector may seem less obvious, but it is consistent with the glamorous image of the French shoemaker, known for his fascination for Parisian cabarets, from the Moulin Rouge, where he started his career, to the Crazy Horse, for the dancers’ of which he made booties and stilettos and signed four scenes of the latest show. For its first foray into the beauty industry, Christian Louboutin partnered with U.S company Batallure Beauty, with the aim to develop and globally market luxury products across a number of classifications. “Wearing a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes completely transforms a woman and Christian will bring that same transformative quality to women through his beauty products,” said Robin Burns, Chairman & Co-Founder of Batallure Beauty. “Twenty years ago I started what I thought would be a small adventure, which ended up becoming a company. The beauty adventure is a natural extension for someone like me, who likes to empower women and to be a part of creating beauty seems like the right next step,” added Christian Louboutin. The first Christian Louboutin Beauté products are expected to launch late 2013. Sources : Beautypress, Artdeco, Batallure Beauty"
French creative perfumery: why is it performing better abroad than at home?,"But, good news, things are starting to change! On the side of distribution channels first with more and more shops opening specialized in this unique world. On the side of big perfume brands also who are getting involved in the marketing of perfumes of exceptions, and who with this proactive strategy, contribute to better convey this information on another world of perfumes. Finally on the side of suppliers of glass bottles who reaffirmed, on the occasion of this information day, all the good they thought of this sector by striving to adapt their industrial tools to the needs for small batches of high quality required by the creative perfumery. An opportunity, however, for David Frossard (Different Latitudes) and Francois Henin (Jovoy), to make a comprehensive review of this market in France and of the difficulties related to the lack of visibility of creators vis a vis the consumers. An opportunity also for Valérie Pianelli-Guichard (Comptoir Sud Pacifique), Gilles Thévenin (Lubin), Antoine Vuillermet (Lostmarc’h), and Luc Gabriel, The Different Company, to explain their strategies. The opportunity for Nicolas Olczyk (Rouge Curacao), and Isabelle Ferrand (Cinquième Sens) of letting us enter into this wonderful world of unusual fragrances. The opportunity for Frédéric Lebreux (Ifra), to try and make us see that, this particularly controversial subject, of Regulations must not be seen as an obstacle to olfactory creativity. Finally, an opportunity for packaging professionals, including in particular glass manufacturers to demonstrate their know-how and industrial flexibility enabling them to meet the most audacious technical and artistic demands.

China’s beauty market goes premium and online,"Total sales of prestige beauty [1] in China increased by 21 percent in 2011 compared to the previous year, revealed a recent study conducted by The NPD Group.  The skincare and makeup were the most dynamic categories, growing by 23 and 17 percent, respectively. Anti-aging continued to play as the driving engine of the prestige skincare market, accounting for a half of the market and posting a robust growth of nearly 27 percent in 2011. Hydrating (+19%) and whitening (+15%) skincare also played a big role in the category growth. In prestige makeup, the face segment captured 59 percent of the category’s dollar share and increased by 18 percent in value from 2010. “Products that make the face look lighter and smoother like foundation and makeup base continued to play a key role in China. Foundation and makeup base led the face category, up 24 and 30 percent, respectively,” said The NPD Group. In addition to face products, lip helped drive the growth in makeup, with a rise of 26.5 percent from 2010 to 2011 (+31% for lipstick sales and +22% for lip glosses). On the other hand, sales of eye products were soft (up +6%) due to mascara’s sharp decline of -3% in dollars and the slower paced sales of eye shadow and eye liner. While the rise of prestige beauty was quite predictable in a country where consumers are seeing their living standards rising quickly, the recent explosion of online sales is more surprising. Actually, according to Kline & Company [2], beauty sales through the Internet in China have been growing at a rate of nearly 200% since 2006 and are estimated to be worth nearly US$8 billion at the retail sales level in 2011, making it the largest Internet beauty market in the world. “This news is astounding,” remarks Karen Doskow, Industry Manager at Kline, “and to put this into perspective, Chinese online beauty sales in 2011 are nearly equal in size to the entire beauty market for France, which is the largest market for cosmetics and toiletries in Europe. Furthermore, Chinese Internet beauty sales are nearly nine times larger than the U.S. Internet beauty market.” “The rapid growth of Internet usage over the past five years has given way to a tremendous surge in sales and availability of local and foreign cosmetic and toiletry brands,” explains Li Wang, Vice President of Kline Asia. “The number of online users and buyers in China has skyrocketed. Internet user numbers in China approached 457 million in 2011, up from 137 million in 2006. Online buyers now total some 205 million in 2011.” So-called “e-malls,” such as Tiantian.com and Alibaba’s Tmall, are enabling customers to buy from a wide range of domestic and foreign skin care and makeup brands in a convenient one-stop shop. “We expect the growth of these portals to remain quite robust, driven by continually improving socio-economic dynamic, as well as an increasing appetite for Internet convenience among all consumers,” adds Doskow."
Selective distribution: Nocibé states its ambitions,"Until now a rather discreet challenger, Nocibé, third selective beauty retailer in France, behind Sephora and Marionnaud, is going on the offensive again, through the impetus given by Isabelle Parize, its President. The chain headquartered in Villeneuve d’Ascq, in the Lille metropolitan region (Northern France), in turn is launching its own brand, with as main assets, a bath product range and a full make-up and nail polish range, that aim to be both accessible, trendy, glamorous, innovative and of quality. A launch which, while being part of an underlying trend in the French selective distribution, claims being, according to the brand, ""the answer to a true expectation"" on the theme ""I want to have fun, I want to test, I want to experiment"" In total, it is no less than 360 references, including 200 in make-up, that will be made available as of May in the Nocibé outlets. ""With this approach, we wish to attract all generations, in perfect complementarity and in perfect harmony with luxury brands,"" explained Isabelle Parize. As far as colours are concerned, for its first cosmetic line under his own name, the retailer’s officials believe they have ""thought big, very big even"": 200 products for the eyes, skin and lips, not to mention accessories. But the successful launch of the nail polish line, as a preview, in January, bodes well. It must be said that the company has managed to create the buzz by adding to its 24 traditional nail polish shades, four shades of its Vernis Magnet 3D, containing magnetized nacres to create, with a magnet, small ripples featuring a 3D effect. Nothing revolutionary, maybe, for the aficionados of nail art, but it is a first in this circuit and at this price (6.90 euros)! On the side of bath products, the new Nocibé range is composed of fourteen products (shower gels, body lotions, scrubs, scented candles, massaging oils, eau de toilette, or bath beads), available in six scents decidedly gourmands (Blackberry Blackcurrant, Amber Patchouli, Honey Vanilla, Litchi Redcurrant, Green Tea Citrus, and Jasmine Tiare). The line benefits from bottles designed exclusively for Nocibé to convey the brand values. Among the suppliers mentioned by the retailer at the press conference, companies like HCT, Lumson, Bomal/Pibiplast, and PRP, for the packaging, Intercos, ICC, Hygena-Laboratoires Gilbert, and Alcia Laboratoires, for the formulations. Nocibé also intends to animate its sales operations throughout the year with the launch of ephemeral, one-off product lines. For Mother’s Day, it will be the Jungle operation, with nine make-up palettes, bath products and even an eau de toilette Jungle Addict. In July, to celebrate the Olympic Games in London, the retailer will market its Union Jack line, and another one-off animation is planned during Christmas time. A total of three to four annual animations of this type are planned. Finally, for Nocibé and for its competitors in the selective circuit who opted for the launch of private label ranges, the benefit is twofold: a higher profitability, and the diversification of the offer at the entry level in order to attract in stores a younger population, looking for quality products at affordable prices. By joining Sephora and Marionnaud on these grounds, Nocibé makes no secret of its ambitions and is clearly aiming to become the second-largest player on the French market. After having restructured its network and closed several unprofitable or inappropriate outlets, the brand should start opening new outlets again specifically targeting the Paris region and major provincial cities. According to the newspaper, Le Figaro, a new store concept could even be under development. Nocibé which since 2005 belongs to the British fund Charterhouse, achieved in 2011, with 450 stores, 90 franchises, a turnover of 651 million euros."
Sothys wants to develop sales in spas,"With business in beauty salons and spas perking up again after troubled times, sales in Asia representing a real powerhouse, strong growth in France, its home market, and a highly developed international network, Sothys can face the future with some optimism. On the agenda of the 2012 year: The launch in September of a BB cream, the complete redesigning and relaunch of the men’s range, and some productive investments in the make-up segment. Founded in 1946, the French brand really took off after it was acquired in the late ’60s by the Mas family, who still is its sole shareholder. Today, Sothys represents 80% of the group’s consolidated sales, which neared 60 million euros in 2011. The brand is present in 120 countries through a network of agents and a dozen subsidiaries. This international deployment is also one of its main assets. Not only because it offers the possibility of a better resistance to economic vicissitudes, but also because it conveys the image and values of a brand who prefers to invest in lasting relationships with its customers, and remain adamant about its development strategy in beauty salons and spas. ""There is no country where we consider using retail networks to gain in notoriety and grow faster. Our goal is to invest in the long term, by strengthening our partnerships with salons and spas,"" explains Christian Mas, the CEO of Sothys. ""The brand is strong because it shares values which are consistent with those of its distributors and professionals who trust her,"" he added. But because visibility remains a crucial issue in an extremely competitive market, to further increase its brand awareness, the brand taps in channels more in line with its positioning, such as this partnership for the year 2012, with Singapore Airlines, who offers Sothys creams to its first-class passengers. Strong principles that do not stop the brand from broadening its global network, on the contrary. Among recent openings: Macedonia and the Honduras. But the main development priorities are in Northern Europe, Turkey, Asia as always, and of course Russia, where there is a strong potential. Bearing in mind that a market as huge as Brazil still needs to be addressed. ""We were present in this country until 2006 and we are currently looking for a new partner,"" explains Jérôme Froment-Meurice, Export Manager. In any case, this firmness seems to be paying off. Sothys somewhat better withstood the 2008 crisis than some of its competitors. Maybe also because it was, again, an opportunity to put its values to the test. ""We didn’t change the R&D resources, or our workforce during that period,"" explains Mas. ""We started from a premise that with a development time for new products ranging from 12 to 24 months, such a strategy would allow us to be in battle order for when the market recovered""  And today, the brand can claim being one step ahead of its competitors. In September, the company should be the first to launch a BB cream exclusively intended for beauty salons. ""This is a segment of its own in which we have the opportunity to develop our expertise and provide a true originality."" Also new in 2012, the complete redesigning of the men’s range. Formulas and concepts were revisited and the number of references will increase from four to seven A consistent Investment with the brand’s desire to increase its sales in spas, where men’s products can represent up to 50% of sales, while this turnover remains marginal in salons, where it peaks at 3%. ""The spa is still very consistent with an ongoing dynamics, particularly in the United States and Canada,  details Mas, it is a key axis of our development."""
France: The necessary differentiation of beauty retailers,"If the concentration was already high in selective distribution and mass-market, it is growing increasingly in the hitherto spared circuit of pharmaceutical sales. More than fifteen pharma chains were created in recent years and are uniting a growing number of outlets. Eurostaf also notes that groups of pharmacists are developing ""real branding policies, thus improving their visibility on the beauty market."" [1] In parallel drugstores chains are continuing their deployment driven by supermarkets in particular, (the Leclerc Group as a leader) who are developing their networks at a rapid pace. However, the difficult economic environment and the high cost of market entry, have not deterred newcomers from making their entry. Among them, alternative brands like Mademoiselle Bio for natural cosmetics, specialists of ethnic cosmetics like Mix Beauty and Colorii, but also retailer brands, like Kiko, the Italian brand positioned on low prices, or pure Internet players. These new actors benefit from a unique positioning while on the side of generalists, "" The convergence of offer strategies blur the brands image and strengthens price competition by trivializing the offer."" ""Concerning the offer, the growing number of exclusivity agreements, the positioning in dynamic segments (bio, ethnic cosmetics, doctor brands), the expansion to drugstore products and the development of services are dominant trends."" observes the research firm. Another underlying trend, the growing investment in private labels (PLs), which are mushrooming, with in particular the recent launch in mass market of Carrefour’s Cosmetics Design Paris, and the announced one of the Nocibé brand in selective perfumery, and which are getting more sophisticated, with an increasing segmentation, like at Sephora, where the private label is managed like a national brand. The direct consequence, according to Eurostaf, being that in a context where the available retail shelf space is necessarily limited, ""the product delisting of national brands is increasing in all circuits."" In such a competitive environment, networks try to differentiate themselves through their outlets and through the development of new concepts. With more or less success: ""from 5 to 10% growth in sales for Marionnaud’s renovated outlets, 5% for Parashop and Galeries Lafayette. For others, like Carrefour Planet, results are disappointing."" The aim for brands is to increase the average basket, seen as a strategic priority to increase the brand loyalty indicator [2] and thus brand loyalty. Apart from optimizing merchandising, this also involves some investment in customer relationship management with the improvement of the quality of the database, the sophistication of loyalty programs (customized programs ""premium"" cards, offered services) and the use of new technologies (Internet, social networks, blogs) to continue to enrich the relationship. All this may require some choice making. Thus, emphasises Eurostaf, Passion Beauty has announced the termination of its magazine to focus resources on customer relationship management."
"""Eudora"": a year already!","Premium Beauty News - Eudora is not only an original brand positioning but, truly, a new strategy for Grupo Boticário! Helena Garcia de Gracia - Absolutely! The decision was taken three years ago. You know that the Group’s distribution network is based on a strong network of franchised stores in a Brazilian market historically oriented towards ""door to door"" sales. To grow, there were not that many solutions. We had to create a new brand more in tune with the aspirations of a segment of Brazilian customers that we had not reached yet. And commercialize the brand in both, dedicated stores that are also real platforms to develop our ""door to door"" activity, but also through social networks via the internet. For this, we have studied and questioned nearly 4,000 21st century Brazilian women during several months to understand their aspirations and motivations. This enabled us to determine the category of women who were looking for a certain type of product. Premium Beauty News - Out of the two hundred million inhabitants in Brazil, about half are women. This segment, corresponding to the ones you had selected represented how many consumers for the Eudora products? Helena Garcia de Gracia - Approximately 20%, that is to say 20 million! Eudora understands that the woman has many ways to express herself according to her mood. She may go through different moments without ceasing to be herself. Provocative and surprising, Eudora incorporates a variety of expressions and the sensual moments in beauty and fashion segments. Eudora attends this woman bringing specific products for each of its four moments: Casual, Cool, Powerful and Between 4 walls. Premium Beauty News - Results of a survey that you wanted to take advantage of for each element in the range of your new brand! Helena Garcia de Gracia - It’s true that we were very careful to stay consistent with these four wishes expressed by the sample of women we had interviewed. I can even tell you that our investigation even led us, without any taboo, into these new stores selling erotic products to take into account this phenomenon in the development of some of our products. Premium Beauty News - A year later, how many products and how many dedicated stores does the Eudora range include? Make-up is obviously a strong point. Helena Garcia de Gracia - We have on display three hundred references in fourteen stores. Our aim is to reach seven hundred references fairly quickly. You’re right, make-up is also a strong asset of the range. The Brazilian market has changed considerably over the last few years. A new breed of consumers has emerged with these men and women, with a greater purchasing power who can have access to more sophisticated products. Premium Beauty News - You believe that more sophisticated products, require an access to a larger and more diversified supplier market. Now you are aware that it is not easy for a supplier to enter the Brazilian market.  Helena Garcia de Gracia - That’s true! But that’s what has also participated to Brazil’s economic recovery. The system encourages obviously local production. You must know that we are of course very interested in what is happening in terms of novelties, in all areas of the beauty industry. And any opportunities that can help us gain access to these areas are welcome. I think, in particular, of the recent announcement by the organizers of MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York of the organisation, next year of MakeUp in Sao Paulo. That’s an excellent idea that I fully support."
"""Beauty in Brazil, a rapidly developing sector!"" João Carlos Basilio, ABIHPEC","Premium Beauty News - Most beauty industry professionals agree on the fact that Brazil is only at the very beginning of its growth in this sector. Joao Carlos Basilio - We have been experiencing growth rates between 11% and 12% in this segment for almost a decade. And for good reason... If one considers only the last five years, more than 40 million people (including women!) have advanced from a precarious state to the one of empowered consumers with enough purchasing power to buy ""something else"" than just food. A ""boom"" that the whole perfume and cosmetic industry is fully benefiting from, with, still in full swing, the door to door sales sector but also, and this is new, the distribution sector undergoing profound changes with new brands gaining access to the market through the development of new shopping centres and a very dynamic parapharmaceutical sector. As a result, major European or American brands are no longer hiding their intentions of setting foot here. Not to mention many new Brazilian brands that emerging here and there. Premium Beauty News - Those well-known foreign brands are only entering the market now? Joao Carlos Basilio - Some of them, yes. Because to enter the Brazilian market, brands had to be aware of the necessary adjustments they had to do in their formulas, for their products to be able to cope with the Brazilian climate and the different skin types we have in Brazil. For example, a foundation powder or a cream made in the United States or in Europe are not suitable for Brazil. You must also add the fact that the Brazilian tax package is too complex to be administered, which makes it difficult to access these different markets. Premium Beauty News - It is true that volumes have what it takes to make manufacturers’ mouths water! Among the latest anecdotes to date, the one referring to the sale of some 70 million bottles of nail polish in just one month, just before the last summer holidays...  Joao Carlos Basilio - But this doesn’t stop at nail care The face, eyes lips are also the brands core strategy in our country. It must be said that for the eyes, the market development is impressive. Not to mention perfume! Premium Beauty News - The ABIHPEC of which you are the President is, by far, the sector’s main professional organization! Joao Carlos Basilio - The largest in fact, with 300 member companies representing 94% of the Brazilian market of the health and beauty sector who generate a turnover of more than USD 17 billion. In this figure, hygiene products have a share of 57%, followed by cosmetics (27.5%) and perfumery (15.5%). The growth rate should again be at least of 10% in 2012 compared to last year. Premium Beauty News - You were already talking about it, things are changing in the distribution sector. Joao Carlos Basilio - That’s right! The famous Brazilian exception of ""door to door"" sales is changing. It remains strong and is still developing but new circuits are emerging like the one for example of drugstores and shopping centres where we can see appearing here and there some specialty shops. You also know that Sephora has announced it had made plans to set foot on the Brazilian market. Premium Beauty News - An important development for a market which is opening up to other brands? Joao Carlos Basilio - This indeed can only but encourage the opening of the market to new brands and new products. In fact, some well known Brazilian brands specialized in door to door selling have grasped this opportunity to develop new concepts and new points of sale."
Natural and organic cosmetic brands looking for new growth openings in North America,"While the North American market for natural personal care products has reached 5.4 billion US dollars, Organic Monitor underlines that in most revenue increases are from outside the traditional channel of natural food shops.  In a context of slower growth, most brands are focusing on the expansion of the retail network. “Burt’s Bees and Yes To brands have grown considerably in drugstores, whilst premium brands like Dr. Hauschka have become popular in beauty retailers. JR Watkins is focusing on multi-level marketing, whilst brands like Eminence Organic are targeting hair salons. Natural brands are also making inroads in mass market retailers, encouraging supermarkets to develop private label ranges,” notes the market research firm. Actually, the retail landscape for natural and organic cosmetics is changing at a fast pace.  Limited shelf-space for non-food products is restricting growth in natural food shops. In parallel, retailers are also becoming more selective with their natural personal care ranges. Chained outlets, such as Whole Foods Market and PCC Natural Market, are increasingly scrutinizing product formulations. Apart from new distribution channels, export markets are the other important source of business growth for natural and organic cosmetic brands.  Asia is one of the main destination for North American brands. Although its size is a fraction of the North American market, the Asian market for natural and organic personal care products continues to show double-digit growth. According to Organic Monitor, the burgeoning middle-class in countries, such as China and India, are creating demand for ‘chemically clean’ cosmetics. “The Asian market is attractive because of healthy market growth rates and high consumer preference for western brands. Aubrey Organics is one of the most successful American brands in the Japanese market, whilst Intelligent Nutrients is gaining popularity in Asian countries because of its certified organic range. With a consumer market of 1.2 billion, the Chinese market is deemed the most prospective in Asia. However, few western brands have made advances because of distribution and regulatory issues. A frontrunner is the Australian brand Jasmin Skincare with its range of organic skin care products,” details Organic Monitor. These various issues will be presented and debated at the next New York edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit organised by Organic Monitor at the InterContinental New York Barclay hotel on 17-19th May 2012. CEOs of leading natural and organic personal care brands will discuss the marketing and distribution challenges they face in the North American market. The panel comprises CEOs from Aubrey Organics, Dr. Hauschka, Weleda, JR Watkins, Eminence Organic and Jasmin Skincare. With research showing raw materials and packaging comprise the highest environmental impact of personal care products, the summit will also hone in on these key areas."
Fragrances boosted prestige beauty sales in the UK,"Data collected by The NPD Group confirm strong growth in the UK prestige beauty market in 2011, one of the most robust sales periods ever. Indeed, total sales grew by 9.4% to £1.7 billion compared to 2010.  The market growth was boosted by the two-digit rise of the fragrance sector and by robust sales of prestige make-up and skin care lines, +8.5% and + 8.2% respectively. According to The NPD Group, the exceptional performance of fragrances was fuelled by a series of launches as well as re-launches of existing scents. In particular, the highly successful launch of the new designer fragrance of Jimmy Choo would have boosted the market. “In 2011 some manufacturers tried a new approach - launching fragrances at the start of the year to maximize share of voice and sales opportunities in what is a quieter time for the sector - rather than waiting for the Christmas season when up to 60% of all sales have traditionally been made. Launched in January 2011, the Jimmy Choo fragrance was publicized throughout the year, culminating in a strong push in the run up to the all-important holiday season. High-end fashion brands are increasingly moving into the premium beauty market allowing consumers to indulge in affordable luxury. Whilst not everyone is lucky enough to be able to afford a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes, being able to own the fragrance gives consumers the chance to own a part of the luxury brand,” explains June Jensen, Director for The NPD Group’s UK Beauty team. As far as make-up is concerned, the overall market growth of 8.5% for the year was fuelled by a strong push on lip colour during the start of the year, with launches and promotional activity from Lancôme, Dior, YSL, Chanel and Estee Lauder amongst others. According to The NPD Group, the big story in the second half was the launch of Benefit’s ‘They’re Real’ mascara in August. “What was interesting about this specific launch was that it was communicated exclusively using social media including YouTube. Support activity from personal consultants in-store was a crucial part of the strategy that eschewed advertising in traditional media such as TV and magazines.” Having been the fastest growing sector of the UK market in 2010, skincare growth slowed last year although a rise of 8.2% would still be very pleasing in most industries in Europe. The main reason for the slowdown, according to The NPD Group, is that existing skincare ranges grew more slowly than in make up and fragrance."
PCD and Aerosol & Dispensing Forum held their first joint edition,"For the first time, these two events were held at the same time and under the same roof, the Espace Champerret, Porte de Champerret, Paris.  Apparently, combining the two events was successful, at least if we refer to what exhibitors said to Premium Beauty News.  The two events hosted over 2400 attendees from more than 40 countries, announced the organizers. In total, some one hundred suppliers of packaging, dispensing systems, services and technologies for the packaging of perfumes and cosmetics presented their products. Taking advantage of the emphasis put on electronic cosmetic devices during the Innovation Workshop e@PCD, Jackel-LF Beauty presented its latest developments in this field, including: an ultrasonic spatula for an easier application of face cleansers and skin care, and a massage device for the face. Clearly, despite economic pressures, operators continue to deserve great attention to environmental issues, whether in their operations or in the design of their products, with increasing efforts to combine luxury and sustainable development. A trend epitomized by the presentation of Or Infini, an “exquisite body veil” eco-designed by the eight partners of Mouvement Infini - Mane, M-real, Rexam, SGD, Strand Cosmetics Europe, Sylvie de France Designer, VPI et Wauters. A theme that was also at the heart of the keynote presentation by Michel Fontaine, President of the French National Council of Packaging, at the beginning of the PCD Awards ceremony, which have honoured the best packaging innovations showcased during the exhibition.

Skincare to fuel growth of men’s grooming market,"All studies confirm that men are increasingly paying attention to their personal appearance, with the youngest generations being as vain as their female counterparts.  Six in 10 (65%) European men would consider their appearance important and almost half (48%) admit that what they want most is to look attractive and well groomed. Sales of men’s beauty and personal care products are subsequently progressing at a steady pace.   According to Euromonitor, the global men’s grooming market grew by 7.4% from 2009 to 2010, to reach 29,6 billion US dollars in retail value, while beauty and personal care products in general grew by 5.2%, to reach 382,2 US dollars in 2010.  In Western Europe, sales of men’s cosmetics grew by 3.1% from 2009 to 2010, compared to +2.0% for the overall market. Thus, despite their dynamism, sales are not skyrocketing in developed markets. Mintel estimates that the overall male grooming category in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK was valued at 6.6 billion euros, an increase of just 8% since 2005.  “While the category is set to grow by a further 8% to EUR 7.2 billion (USD 9.5 billion) between 2010 and 2014, the slight dip in 2009, due to the economic crisis, has led to men buying fewer and cheaper grooming products,” explains the market research firm. Actually, as far as sales are concerned, all male grooming categories are not equal.  For instance, the market for shaving products and razors, has remained largely stagnant in the five biggest European countries [1].  According to Mintel, sales in these segments grew from 1.85 billion euros in 2005 to only 2 billion euros in 2010. Over the years, with penetration rates remaining relatively low, skin care products have emerged as the most promising product category in this market. Indeed, according to a new study conducted by The NPD Group, over 9 in 10 men (ages 18+) in the U.S. are using some sort of grooming product today [2]. However, only one quarter of men are currently using facial skincare products [3] such as facial cleansers and moisturizers, lip and eye products, and anti-aging treatments. “There is a huge opportunity with men for facial skincare. The challenge is getting them involved and engaged,” says Karen Grant, vice president and senior global industry analyst, The NPD Group. “Seventy-five percent of men ages 18 and up are not currently using facial skincare products. There is a feeling that facial skincare products are not needed unless you have a specific skin problem such as acne. For men to use a product, he first must be aware that there is an underlying need that requires addressing,” she adds. In Europe, Germany and Spain have registered the greatest growth in male skincare sales over the past five years. Indeed, the German men’s skincare market grew from EUR 65 million (USD 85 million) in 2005 to EUR 130 million (USD 171 million) in 2010, a stunning 100% increase between 2005 and 2010.  Similarly, the Spanish market for male skincare grew from EUR 29 million to EUR 51 million between 2005 and 2010, with a growth of 76% in five years. No other sectors within the grooming market have registered the same outstanding performance. “Men show a huge interest in keeping young looking which has fuelled demand for skincare products that combat signs of fatigue, stress and ageing. An increase in information about male grooming in the media, the availability of a wider range of products, and the wider usage of celebrities to endorse brands has benefited the male grooming category in the past five years,” explains Nica Lewis, Global Skincare Analyst at Mintel. When it comes to new trends, botanical and herbal products dominate with three in ten new launches during the 18 months to June 2011 featuring botanical ingredients, according to Mintel. Dermatologically tested is the second most popular claim in Western European countries. While just under a quarter of new launches claimed to moisturise or hydrate."
"""Facebook is a marketing tool for ultra-precise targeting""","Premium Beauty News - You are one of the few people who have transformed their passion for social networking in a real occupation. Can you tell us what your activity consists in?

Laetitia Luthringer - As a consultant in the Social Media cluster of KRDS, I help brands communicate on Facebook. This includes both operational and strategic missions. It may consist in helping a brand build a page on Facebook, to propose quizzes, to recruit fans for her or to undertake on her behalf a real community management activity. Depending on its identity and its needs, we often undertake an audit to better target its presence on social networks, and advise the brand on all the construction work to achieve in terms of image through these new media. In my case, I am more specifically in charge of luxury brands and of cosmetics. Partly because I was noticed as a beauty blogger and because this passion has led me to always want to get a better mastery of this market’s codes and techniques. Most of my missions is devoted to communication on Facebook, KRDS being an agency specialized in F-marketing . But we can also, for larger budgets and when there’s an elaborate strategy of development on social networks, operate on other media. Premium Beauty News - Precisely what are the goals of a community management on Facebook? Laetitia Luthringer -  I think the greatest achievement of a community manager is when he manages to develop around a brand a large community of fans, with enough motivation and enthusiasm to see the community generate by itself enough buzz and animation. At this stage, his role is simply to guide the community. Among the big successes of this type we can name Starbucks, or in the cosmetic sector, bareMinerals USA (Bare Escentuals Cosmetics). On the Facebook page of these brands, it is mostly the fans who express themselves, and with a high number of online posts (particularly for pictures). At this stage, the role of the community manager is almost only reduced, to controlling the legality of exchanges. Premium Beauty News - However you are often far from such ideal situations! Laetitia Luthringer - Yes. But not all brands have the same goal. For many of them, the display of their products or of their posts is a priority. In this case, the objective is much less to unite a community than to be seen and read by its targeted audience. Premium Beauty News - No salvation outside of Facebook? What, about for example, Google +? Laetitia Luthringer - Being present on several social networks takes time and requires resources. I think that at present, a presence on Google + is justified especially if one is targeting an audience of technophiles and even of techno-addicts. There are many people registered on Google + but the site’s traffic rate seems quite low. However some brand have been very successful on this medium, like Burberry. In general, there are two questions to ask oneself before investing on a network. First question, is my target present on that medium? You must address each social network like you would addresses an agglomeration. And then question yourself on the profitability of your investment: where and by whom will you be seen? Will my advertising pay off? From this point of view, Facebook is an ultra-precise targeting tool. Second question, what will I say to my target? You must be sure of your identity and of your discourse. In all cases, a campaign will always have more impact if it is not confined to the only chosen network, but if it is supported by an action on several other media. Especially in France, and more generally in Europe, consumers have less the Facebook reflex than in the United States. If some brands have a very large number of fans, it’s often because they did not hesitated to recruit them elsewhere than on Facebook, through POS actions for example. Premium Beauty News - And the cosmetic brands in all this? Some say they are lagging behind? Laetitia Luthringer -  This is all very relative! There is nothing surprising if beauty brands took an interest in social media later than high-tech brands. It is a universe that could have seemed very distant to them. But the consequence, when they decided to invest these media, was to step in an increasingly expensive market... Today, for an SME, the entry ticket is far from trivial if one wants to be efficient. Brands that got their tickets first have taken a lead and benefit from a greater loyalty. Premium Beauty News - Is there not also a generational gap with leaders for whom Internet and social networks are still considered as an ""area of inconsistency""? Laetitia Luthringer - Social networking can be scary. This is not specific to cosmetics. To some leaders, entering Facebook is to run the risk of opening Pandora’s box. There are several answers to these concerns. On the one hand, there is a legal restraint, which is permitted by the Facebook rules. On the other hand , brands can suggest rules of conduct (policies) on their page, and must not hesitate to put them forward. But it is true that there are always people who have a negative opinion and for whom Facebook can give them the opportunity to speak publicly on the cheap. Listening to these people is always useful. One can of course delete their comments if they violate the rules of good conduct, one can also answer them constructively. They can even sometimes uncover problems not seen before. This possibility which left for someone to express its negative opinions is what makes the strength of communication on social networks. Positive opinions have even more weight than negative opinions are possible. This may seem like a risky bet, because it is generally accepted that a consumer who has a negative opinion on a brand is more likely to express himself than if he had something positive to say. But inside a community of fans, this proportion is very different and positive opinions are expressed more easily and spontaneously. The role of the community manager is also to encourage and facilitate the expression of positive opinions."
Russia: the distribution issue,"Since the liberalization of the Russian economy in the 1990s, the Russian cosmetics market has undergone profound changes and a constant and dynamic growth, with the exception of the brutal recession that followed the 1997-1998 crisis, and the slow-down that followed the 2008-2009 crisis. Estimated at US$ 3.9 billion in 2001, total sales of perfumes and cosmetics accounted for US$ 11.2 billion in 2010 and were expected to reach 13.2 billion in 2011, an increase of 17.8% over the previous year. ""The market is gradually recovering after the crisis, in particular thanks to the strengthening of the rubble, rising incomes and increasing consumer expectation index,"" said Anna Dycheva-Smirnova, Deputy Managing Director of Reed-SK LLC., the organizer of the Intercharm Moscow. The pace of growth should be sustained and the market is expected to approach US$ 17 billion in 2014. In parallel to the development of the market, the distribution was highly restructured in Russia. Open markets, with their amounts of goods of questionable origin, which had become emblematic of the post-communist era now account for only a fraction of the overall distribution of perfumes and cosmetics (8.3%). However the striking phenomenon of the last two years has been the decline of direct sales. If this circuit still accounts for 25.6% of sales, specialty shops have overcome it. This phenomenon is explained by both more efficient distribution channels, which extend their network to better serve the public, and by a shift in consumer preferences towards more upscale goods. This is accompanied, however, by a significant concentration of distributors, in particular with three major networks that dominate the selective distribution (L’Etoile, Ile de Beauté and Rive Gauche), including Moscow and St. Petersburg, and are extending their network at nationally. ""But there are regional chains that may offer an interesting alternative, with favourable terms,"" says Anna Dycheva-Smirnova. Indeed, there are more than 25 local channels, operating in a number of regions, with nearly 400 doors for Sangi Stil, the biggest of them. These chains are, however, often less upscale and are more likely to operate in a ""drugstore"" format, which has emerged as the most dynamic in the country. Regarding the breakdown by product categories, the Russian market is relatively balanced between four major segments: perfumery, skin care, hair care and decorative cosmetics. Decorative cosmetics have been particularly dynamic in recent years, with an average annual growth of 5%. Eventually, as far as major market trends are concerned, one’s can note a growing but still marginal interest for natural cosmetics. Generally speaking, environmental issues remain of low concern for the Russian consumers."
Stylesight’s views on beauty trends,"With nearly 3,000 subscribing companies and 40,000 individual users in over 60 countries around the world, Stylesight is the industry-leading global content and technology provider for professionals in the style, fashion and design sectors. Stylesight combines trend forecasting and analyses, with an online workspace designed to help analyze and anticipate the ever-changing marketplace.  Isham Sardouk, Senior Vice President Trend Forecasting at Stylesight tells us his vision of beauty trends and gives us an extract of its forecasts for 2013. “The beauty market never seems to be affected by any type of recession. There is always a need for fantasy, which provides a type of escapism into something indulgent. Especially in a time of economic uncertainty, this escape can boost our morale and make us feel better about ourselves. The beauty sector is always dynamic, providing innovative colours and technology,” says Isham Sardouk. Despite the resilience of this market, there is harsh competition and leaders need to innovate permanently in order to keep their position.  “I think that beauty is an eternal evolution – one that mutates from one stage to the next, but is always going forward,” adds Isham Sardouk. Stylesight’s Beauty Forecast for Spring/Summer 2013 comes across four themes: Subnation, Nutopia, Ashen and Clarity. Mood: An anti-conformist approach resonates with a new generation of urban tribes that are chic and shocking. This style merges disparate genres, combining everything from cocktail glamour to a candid punk attitude. Colours: A range of explosive colors pierces and vibrates with added metallic and changeable effects. Pinks, violets, greens and blues harmonize with power and force. Mood:  A positive and radiant ambiance sees oranges and reds flourish in a theme where nature takes back its rightful place in the world. There is a fresh desire for outdoor living and a need to experience cool, dewy mornings. Colours:  A truly sunny palette emphasizes subtle oranges and coral nuances. Red and copper will also feature in darker tones that veer towards crimson. Turquoise and sky blues, along with prairie greens, will illustrate the outdoor aspect and the re-found respect for nature. Mood:  A monastic universe recalls the Victorian era in stark contrasts of dark and light. Materials will express this mood, moving from patina to aged and weathered effects. Dust, cinders and mists will soften this richly dark mood. Colours: A misty theme appears through stormy skies, dusts and cinders, lightened by a touch of sky blue. Powdered pinks temper the grey expanse of the palette. Mood: The extreme orient is set to influence a current with two distinctive streams. One side emphasizes purity while the other plays with tradition to develop a modern and fantastical aesthetic. Colours: The colour range will showcase impertinent acidic hues and soft colors with a fresh twist. The most prominent colors emerge as orchid pinks, bamboo greens or coral while translucent effects and jelly consistencies are set to renew textures. What makes each of Stylesight’s four key themes different for S/S 13 is the difference in color range. Some trends in beauty are focused on the ‘non-color’ trend, whether it’s developed through naturals, skin tones or simply muted neutrals. On the other hand, we have trends that only focus on brights; saturated vivid colors with a lot of different textures. The common thread between these themes is the importance of textures and finishes. A color without texture or finish is meaningless today."
"French enjoy gift sets, but not at any price","At Christmas time, the French acclaim gift-sets, but not at any price and provided they are seduced. These are the results of the qualitative study conducted online by Panel On The Web, a subsidiary of Promise Inc., a consulting and market research firm, specializing in the analysis of consumer behaviour. In the cosmetics business, these gift sets appears to be a Christmas hit, with 2 to 3 million items sold every year. The study was conducted between October 24 and November 1, 2011, on a representative sample of 500 individuals (male and female) 15 years old and more. Six beauty gift boxes, available this year in France, whose prices range between 45 and 115 euros were screened through three questions to assess their attractiveness: ""3 customized fragrances"" (50 euros), Beauté Divine (69 euros), Elaÿs (109 euros), Love the carrots, by Honoré des Prés (76 euros), box Bento Box, by Nars (115 euros) and Contes de fée parfumés, by Cire Trudon (45 euros). Is it because of the economic crisis context or just a choice of reason? The fact is that the cheaper boxes monopolize the top three places. But the distribution is not mechanical as the Beauté Divine gift set, the most expensive among the top three, ranks first: – First: the Beauté Divine gift-set (69 euros)
– 2nd: the ""3 custom fragrances"" gift-set (50 euros)
– 3rd: ""Les contes de fée parfumés, Cire Trudon"" (45 euros) The point to be noted about the Beauté Divine gift-set is that it is the only box offering a so-called ""experiential"" present. Actually, it consists in offering a skin-care session in a beauty salon - a well-being moment - rather than make-up or perfume. The French also need to appreciate what they offer to their relatives. The results of the study show that, whatever the gift-set, percentages are almost identical for the two questions on the concepts of ""act of purchase"" and ""desire to receive."" For example, in the case of the gift box  ""3 custom fragrances"": 30% of respondents would like to receive it as a present, and 29% plan to buy it in order to offer it to a relative. ""The symmetry between the desire to purchase and the desire to receive can be applied to all the gift-sets presented in this study,"" said the authors. However, it must be noted that almost all the gift-sets achieved higher preference rates among women, with the exception of the Elaÿs gift set, the only one that more men (34%) than women (21%) want to offer. Indeed this package features a bottle of champagne with two creams, allowing the present to be shared. This gift thus express its full potential during the holiday season. ""Elaÿs seems to have met the challenge of convincing male customers,"" concluded the authors of the study."
MakeUp in Paris 2012 on the rise,"MakeUp in Paris continues growing, with one figure to remember: +25%.  Indeed, the next edition to be held on 21 and 22 June 2012 at the Carrousel du Louvre, is already recording an increase of 25% in the number of exhibitors, as well as a 25% increase in exhibition space, according to the organisers. Actually, almost all exhibitors in the previous editions have signed up for the next one, and over 15% of them have decided to increase the surface of their stand in 2012. As for the organisers, in order to consolidate the unique positioning of MakeUp in Paris as the a high-end business to business event exclusively dedicated to the make-up industry, the aim remains to reach a good balance between the various product categories, with exhibitors proposing formulation and full development services as well as packaging suppliers, together with a series of make-up animations and professional conferences, during the two days of the event. Among the new exhibitors: Cosmogen, a French company specialising in the design, development, and production of makeup and cosmetic packaging and applicators, to elaborate its new line of brushes, Marbella, a French supplier of luxury body jewels, Kum, a German supplier of cosmetic sharpeners and brushes, Rusi, a German group specializing in the manufacture of manufacture of make-up lines, in particular of mascaras, lip-glosses or eyeliners, and SGD, the world’s leading manufacturer of glass for the beauty industries."
Marionnaud is renovating its outlets to attract new customers,"Step by step, Marionnaud is continuing the renovation of its brand and the unification and harmonization of its network that it had started in 2005 following its acquisition by the AS Watson Group, the world’s leading distributor of beauty products and toiletries. With 572 outlets in France, Marionnaud can rely on the largest network in the country, but this network of outlets is heterogeneous, reflecting a growth that was achieved through successive acquisitions of regional chains and independent stores. In France, the sales areas range from 20 to 900 sqm, the outlets can be located in city centres or in shopping malls in all types of cities and catchment areas. The brand is also present in Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Romania, the Czech Republic and Portugal. After having reorganized its logistics and reshaped its IT system to finally manage to unify it at the group level, Marionnaud has renovated most of its beauty salons (240 out of 254 in 2010) and reviewed its signage in April, before tackling in 2011 the very concept of outlets, with a new version being tested on more than 70 outlets. As the first results posted by these outlets - 5 to 10% increase in sales - met and sometimes exceeded the group’s expectations, the pace of renovations should be increase compared to what had originally been planned. ""Legitimizing our approach, shareholders have given us the means to accelerate the program enabling us to have half of our stores completely revamped as of 2012,"" was delighted to say William Koeberlé, CEO of the Marionnaud Group. The pleasure of discovering and a clear consumer perception of the offer have been placed at the core of the project, so to make shopping even easier through clear signage, family products (women’s perfumes, men’s perfumes, skincare) identified with their own colour codes, readily available products, and beauty consultants always available. ""Without reinventing everything, we worked on a concept store which could be used on all our formats, all our sales areas, and for all customer types"", explained Fabrice Obenans, Marketing Director of the brand. Fragrances are arranged on either side of the outlet, with a taupe colour on the left for men, and a mauve colour on the right for women. Areas dedicated to sales opportunities, new products and seasonal events were created and the opportunities for impulse buying of small complementary products have been increased. The area dedicated to care was designed as a space conductive to a privileged relationship with the beauty consultant. Located in a quiet area, at the back of the outlet, it is the perfect place to start discovering and learning around the ""beauty bar"". The make-up offer, the pleasure category par excellence, for its part has been granted a central place in the outlet, with standardized dedicated furniture and inclined displays designed to increase the visibility and accessibility of products. Make-up through its accessibility, is also, coupled to the brand’s private labels, one of the main component of the strategy devised to reconquer customers. To regain market share, Marionnaud is also relying on the strengthening its image of proximity and accessibility. Hence the development of the make-up offer, perceived as a good way of recruiting young customers, with in particular the Danish brand Gosh, for which the group is the exclusive distributor in France. In general, the most accessible offers, especially the group’s private labels, are more particularly put forward in order to capture new, younger customers. Thus, an ""impulse table"" located at the store entrance, showcases the set boxes, the price opportunities and current commercial news. ""Customers that way, can enjoy from the start products in connection with the brand’s latest commercial updates, thus demonstrating its beauty expertise and its price affordability"", the company said. All or part of a wall panel is dedicated to Marionnaud’s skincare offering. As for Marionnaud accessories, they are displayed in transparent Plexiglas compartments located in different areas depending on the configuration of the outlet: in wall units (near the check-out, or near the make-up to make the connection between the two worlds), in displays at each end of the aisles and at the check-outs. in spite of this emphasis on the Marionnaud offer, William Koeberlé insists that in no case this offer cannibalizes the offer from selective brands, but on the contrary provides a complementary service. ""Our core business is selective distribution. But there is a large part of needs which is not appropriately covered by the offer in selective circuits, especially in the bath and shower segment."" Consistent with this approach, the brand will soon present a range of skincare products for men under its own name, with nine references including shaving, deodorants and anti-aging products."
Cosmoprof Asia carries on its rise,"At time of publication of these lines, we do not have the details about visitor numbers of the last edition of Cosmoprof Asia, which was held from the 9th to the 11th of November 2011 in Hong-Kong, but we know already that the organizers have reached their first goal: to fill all the halls of the Hong-Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Cosmoprof Asia hosted this year 1,780 exhibitors, up 9% compared to the previous years, occupying a total of 68,000 sqm, up 18% on 2010. Among these exhibitors coming from 42 countries, the show welcomed 477 new comers. 23 country and group pavilions took part in the event: Australia, Belgium, Mainland China, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, UK and USA, with Jordan, Pakistan and Turkey as first-timers. With such a record participation, the organizers of Cosmoprof Asia have succeeded in fulfilling the two halls that were still available last year.  They also approach the objective which they have announced for one year: to become the world’s first trade show of the beauty industry, before Cosmoprof Worldwide, which is held in Bologna, Italy.  A concern however, that space becomes scarcely available, and the risk of not being able to answer all the demands during the next years. What are the reasons for this success? Unquestionably, the dynamism of most markets in the Asia Pacific region has played a key role in the impressive development of Cosmoprof Asia. In addition, the organizers have cleverly uses the attractiveness of Hong Kong to open the show to open the all the area, so as not positioning as a Chinese only event. As a result, exhibitors as visitors come from around the world, of course primarily from the neighbouring Asian countries, such as Korea, Indonesia, Japan, or Thailand, but also from the Middle East and Europe. It thus possible to observe on the show floor a surprising number of visitors from Central and Eastern Europe or Russia. As the access to mainland China’s markets still remain highly complex for most exporters, this regional opening is unmistakably an enormous asset. Should we also consider the quality of the organization, it is not surprising that we hardly met any deceived exhibitor, even if some of them recognized that the Asian markets were becoming more and more demanding and that this show, as the others, needed to be carefully prepared.  In particular as competitors from Asia are proposing an increasingly higher level of offer. The next edition of Cosmoprof Asia will be held from 14 to 16 November 2012."
The French cosmetic industry goes looking for growth in emerging countries,"Sales of French cosmetic manufacturers continue to rise, driven by a domestic market that has returned to growth in 2010, in particular because ofselective distribution (2.8 billion euros in 2010, i.e. an increase of 1.9 % over 2009 according to NPD) and mass distribution (5 billion euros in 2010, i.e. an increase of 1.5% over 2009 according to Nielsen) and, despite a slight drop in sales from the pharmacies and drugstores circuit (1.54 billion euros, i.e. a drop of -0.87% compared to 2009 according to Nielsen). But it is mostly thanks to their performance on foreign markets that cosmetic French manufacturers have continued to post remarkable growths in sales, said Gérard Delcour, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the FEBEA, (the French trade association representing manufacturers operating on the Beauty market), at a breakfast organized by the BeautyFULL Club last November 4th, themed on the main growth drivers for the beauty industry. Indeed, figures provided by the French customs reported a 9.2% increase in French exports of perfumes and cosmetics in 2010 compared to the previous year. Overall French exports of perfumes and cosmetics reached 9.538 billion euros (ex-works before tax prices) in 2010.   In this sector, the French trade balance surplus remains high (7.571 billion euros, i.e. an increase of 9.4% over the 2009 surplus. While most of French exports go to countries of the European Union (53%), the markets where the growth is strongest are Latin America (which is currently only 4% of exports but up 24% in 2010), European countries outside the Union, which grew by 19% in 2010 (and account for 11% of exports, thanks to the weight of Russia) and the Far East, up 19% representing a share 12.8% of total French exports. ""If the market still clearly remains an European market, most of the growth come from emerging markets. It is estimated that 60% of the growth in years to come will be fuelled by the BRIC countries"", commented Gérard Delcour. However, behind this BRIC acronym - which means Brazil, Russia, India and China - lie some markets very different from one another. The Russian market is certainly the one who, with its structure, distribution and consumer preferences, is the closest to the French market and more generally the European one. The Brazilian market however, is characterized by a severe lack of distribution networks, that leading brands (Natura, O Boticario, Avon) try to overcome by resorting to direct sales. ""But things are changing, notes Delcour, especially with the arrival of Sephora, who last year took control of Sack’s an online shopping platform and one of the leading distributors of beauty products in Brazil."" India, however, remains primarily a market for toiletries and haircare products (bath and shower, shampoo, etc.) manufactured locally, and where imported high-quality products are only enjoyed by a small elite, particularly because of high custom duties and a very weak distribution network. As for China, it is obviously a very dynamic market, but exporters of perfumes and cosmetic products are still facing great difficulties to access this market which has set up technical barriers effectively blocking the entry of new products."
L’Oréal invests in at-home skin care devices technology,"L’Oréal USA, a subsidiary of the cosmetics giant, recently announced the signature of a merger agreement with Pacific Bioscience Laboratories, Inc. (PBL), the market leader in the rapidly growing areas of electronic skin care devices, with its Clarisonic brand. Established in 2001, PBL has grown rapidly since the Clarisonic launch in 2004 and now employs 300 staff.  The company’s currently sell its products throughout the US as well as in the UK, Australia, Mexico, Canada and the Far East, through a distribution network that covers six diverse channels: dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons, spas, prestige retail, e-tail, television shopping, and clarisonic.com PBL recently relocated to new corporate headquarters and state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Redmond, Washington. “This is a strategic acquisition for L’Oréal,” said Frédéric Rozé, President and CEO of L’Oréal USA.  “Devices are rapidly emerging globally as an important new skin care category. Clarisonic is successful and the fast growing premium brand in this segment. We think that together with PBL, we will create in Redmond an outstanding centre of innovation for L’Oréal.” The transaction, which amount has not been disclosed, is subject to the approval of PBL’s shareholders and other closing conditions, and is expected to close in December, 2011.  L’Oréal USA has received significant shareholder commitments to vote in favour of the acquisition, including Rosewood Capital and, PBL’s co-founder and current CEO, David Giuliani. PBL’s senior management team has committed to remain with L’Oréal USA.  Upon closing of the transaction, the Clarisonic brand will join the portfolio of L’Oréal luxury division (Lancôme, Armani, YSL Beauté ou Kiehl’s) and benefit from the group’s worldwide presence."
Global sales of natural cosmetics to reach USD 9 billion,"In an upcoming report on the Global Market for Natural & Organic Personal Care Products, Organic Monitor predicts sales to reach 9 billion US dollars this year and 14 billion in 2015. Organic Monitor estimates that natural and organic products have 2% share of the global personal care product market.  “Demand for natural and organic products has spread to every region, however sales remain concentrated in Europe and North America,” the company reports.  “In some countries - such as the USA, Germany, Austria - the market share is reaching 10 percent. The large market share is because of high consumer awareness and extensive distribution of natural and organic products.” Availability is a major driver of market growth, explains Organic Monitor. While their distribution was initially limited to specialized organic food retailers, in many countries now natural and organic personal care products have reached all mainstream retail channels, including pharmacies, drugstores, supermarkets and department stores and high-end retailers.  Companies like ADA Cosmetics and Panpuri are developing natural lines for hotels and the spa channel. Furthermore, the production of natural and organic cosmetics is no longer limited to specialized brands.  “Large cosmetic companies are entering the naturals arena. Some like L’Oreal and Colgate-Palmolive have taken the acquisition route, whilst others have developed natural / organic lines. Recent newcomers, such as Garnier, Henkel and Amore Pacific, are launching certified organic products,” adds Organic Monitor.  Eventually, retailer private labels are also becoming prominent for natural personal care products, in particular in Germany and many other European countries. However, the rising number of competitors is now coinciding with slower market growth rates.  In this environment, Organic Monitor finds successful brands are those that focus on marketing and distribution to differentiate their products. “Concept stores have become en vogue, with leading brands like Aveda, Melvita and Korres opening international retail networks.” Latest findings from Organic Monitor’s new report as well as future growth projections will be given in dedicated workshops at the Asia-Pacific (November 7-8th in Hong Kong) and European (November 28-30th, in Paris) editions of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit."
The evolution of the relation to beauty in the U.S.A.,"While the United States are gradually emerging from a crisis that marked their history and shook up their values, the beauty market has recovered strongly, showing a remarkable resilience. New proposals have emerged, riding on emerging lifestyles, leading to a significant evolution in the relation to beauty. It is this evolution that Rémy Oudghiri, Director of the Prospective for market research firm IPSOS, and Leila Rochet-Podvin, Founder of the agency Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation, presented in October as part of Beyond Beauty Paris. Five major themes have been decrypted, Rémy Oudghiri decoding societal trends and Leila Rochet-Podvin unveiling underlying emerging product trends. Compared to their European or Japanese counterparts, American women seem to have a casual relationship to appearance, giving greater value to independence of mind.  However, a thorough analysis of their responses to the surveys conducted by IPSOS, reveal that appearance is in reality a real source of stress in their daily life and that the aging is less well accepted in the U.S. than elsewhere. The neutral styles of crisis times have finally given way to what Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation called ""the great comeback of the hyper-femininity,"" including sophisticated make-up, flawless complexions, and highlighted and more colourful eyes and lips, with a more seductive state of mind. Self-confidence is central to the American vision of beauty (49% of American women say it is one of the reasons that lead them to make-up), which is modelled on an increasingly urban pattern and on the go lifestyles. This results in a quest for hyper-performance: the products must be mobile, easy to use and highly effective at the same time. As a result, multifunctional products flourish on the market. They are stackable (eg Sephora Collection), with multi-brushes (MAC) or proposed as wipes (eg, Dr. Dennis Gross self-tanning and exfoliating). If the desire to appear ""younger than her age"" is not seen as ridiculous in the United States as it is often the case in France, Germany or Italy, the crisis has partly questioned the cult of youth. Indeed IPSOS studies show that the idea that beauty is acquired with maturity, is progressing gradually. The concept of ""aging well"" tends to replace the ""look young"". The search for ethical values survived to the crisis. According to 61% of American women, a luxury beauty brand must be ethical. Similarly, the ecological sensitivity remains strong after the crisis. ""Ethical promises are no longer a specificity of niche brands,"" confirms Leila Rochet-Podvin. ""Right now, a series of pink products are flooding the shelves, and support the action of the Pink Ribbon fight against breast cancer. In Soho, the new boutique Treasure & Bond, an initiative of Nordstrom, pays 100% of its profits to charities. For consumers, ethical values do not replace the search for performance or pleasure but add to them, according to the ’double bottom line’ principle."" The proportion of women members of the so-called ""ethnic minorities"" is increasingly important in the United States. Surveys show that minorities more and more contribute to create new symbols of femininity. Beyond a demographic reality, the ideal of a “mixed race” beauty is merely becoming the new American standard of beauty. According to a study in the March edition of Allure magazine, 64% of respondents say that a woman of mixed complexion is the epitome of the American beauty. Consequence of a reality that is reinforced by magazines, fashion designers and cosmetics brands in America: ethnic minorities are increasingly present in the media."
"Maria Viegas, Albéa, ""Consumers are showing the way to us!""","Premium Beauty News - You have launched in quick succession several innovations in the field of lip applicators. Where do you find your inspiration from? Maria Viegas - Our proactive approach that we had already explained on a previous occasion on your site, has confirmed being the right one and has even strengthened in recent months. Basically it consists in always staying tuned to the market and its trends. We systematically organize brainstorming sessions with consumer panels to feed our creativity. At the same time, we have developed partnerships with a network of designers, make-up artists, experts in various fields, and this, in all parts the world. These numerous sessions and the quality of the resulting feedback, confirm the necessity to meet the specific needs inherent to each country. Gone are the days where there was just one packaging on display, not to mention the universal applicator. Consumer expectations, for example, in South America are very different from those in China or in the Middle East. Premium Beauty News - A true revolution! Because it is one thing to notice it, but it’s a completely different story when it comes to implementing it on a industrial scale! Maria Viegas - Yes, but it’s our job! And we are already in battle order to take up these challenges with a very operational but also very flexible industrial tool, to support our customers in their growth projects. We are also aware that innovation does not focus only on products but it does also in processes. At Albéa, we also pay a lot of attention to all the developments on materials, surface treatments, new technologies sometimes coming from other areas and that may lead to new avenues in our domain. Premium Beauty News - Any examples of this ""flexibility"" in terms of innovation and on the efficiency of the feedback from the field? Maria Viegas - Yes, for instance the three rotating lipgloss applicators that we have just released! They enable a perfectly uniform application of the formula on the lips and maximum brightness in a single stroke. This applicator is actually part of the SpinArt™ family. The first one, called ""Volume +"" is a flocked applicator with a simple shape but which, thanks to its different options in terms of wipers and sizes of the stem, enables according to the needs to better control the amount of formula applied on the lips compared to a standard applicator. The second one, ""Silhouette"", with its design recalls unquestionably feminine curves. With its ergonomics it fits perfectly to the shape of lips. The ""formula traps"" located at the upper part and bottom part of the flocked tip make it possible to apply just the right amount of product as of the first application. Finally the third applicator, ""Mars"", features a non-flocked tip with an extremely original shape. It clearly offers more definition and more hygiene thanks to its angled tip. Composed of ""micro formula traps"" it is ideal for pearly lipgloss formulas. Premium Beauty News - Another feedback from your ’field’ sessions, the come back on the lips of the red colour and a demand for precision! Maria Viegas - Absolutely! intense colours are back and ask for more technical applicators. And Néopro, the new range of lipgloss spatulas, epitomizes this trend perfectly. This new series of six innovative lip applicators (""Tulip"", ""Up&Down,"" ""Fiber Sensation"", ""Feather,"" ""Rose"" and ""Luxe Color"") combines an eye-catching design, vibrant colours and a professional make-up result. They also come in a flocked or partly flocked version according to requirements. Premium Beauty News - This indeed is all about ""ultra"" precision! Maria Viegas - This is the result of our studies! We offer a complementary range: the ""Tulip"" Model with its flower-shaped spatula stands out thanks to its incredible fineness and extreme comfort, perfect for liquid gloss and lipstick formulas with strong and opaque colours. ""Up&Down"" has two different sides to make up the lower and upper lip. A single stroke is enough to achieve a very technical result, a real tool worthy of a professional make-up artist. ""Fiber Sensation"" mimics the gestures of the make-up artist with a brush for ultra shiny formulas and a wet effect. The feather tipped shape and its firmness allows for a precise lip contour. ""Rose"" has a thick base with large formulas traps to capture a large amount of gloss. ""Lux Color"" features on one side some grooves to load the applicator with formula and a flat side that enables to smoothly apply the gloss on the lips."
Perfumes and cosmetics facing the challenges of ethical sourcing,"Fair trade and ethical channels that are beginning to take shape in perfumery and cosmetics are seen as an extension to the bio trend. This is quite a challenge in fact: to offer products elaborated through responsible supply chains, lending as much attention to environment than it does to human beings. The goal being not to lose sight of the concern for fairness and social partnership that first guided pioneers in organic products. At a time when, with a flurry of standards, of labels, and with the entry on the market of multinationals and private labels, bio products tend to become a purely technical matter, ethical channels seek to reconnect to the social pillar of sustainable development. ""This came as a logical continuation of our commitment six years ago in the manufacture of natural scented composition"", explained François-Patrick Sabater, CEO of Technico Flor, a creator and manufacturer of aromatic compositions for the perfume industry. As for the supply chain in shea butter implemented by L’Occitane, which includes five cooperatives and employs nearly 12,000 women in Burkina Faso, it results, explains Maud Reboul, Sustainable ingredients & Supply chain Project Manager for L’Occitane, from the commitment, more than thirty years ago, of Olivier Baussan, the founder of the brand, in favour of what was not yet called sustainable development. Ecocert, with the launch of its repository ""ESR - Equitable, Solidaire, Responsable"" (Fair Trade, Supportive, Responsible) and Cosmébio who has modified its charter to take into consideration ethical and fair trade concerns, are following the same logic. The main objectives of the Round Table ""Fair Trade Perfumes and Cosmetics"" were to better understand the concept of fair trade and to put into contact the actors involved. Julie Stoll (Plateforme Française du Commerce Equitable - PFCE), Maud Reboul (L’Occitane en Provence), Patrick Collin (Golgemma), François-Patrick Sabater (Technico Flor) and Jérôme Vaquier (Ecocert) presented their activities in this area and exchanged views with brands and stakeholders gathered for the occasion. Among the priorities put forward by different stakeholders, the need to develop the offer emerged first. The perfume and cosmetic market originating from fair trade is still very marginal in France and the offer is confidential, unlike the English market which is driven by dynamic major brands and a keen consumer interest. The various participants, admitted however that there were still too few of these fair trade channels. The greatest difficulty not pertaining so much to additional costs but more to the time needed to really structure the supply chains and get the desired qualities. ""But with this progressive multi- stage approach, we don’t need to start everything at once, we can engage ourselves in a process of progress scheduled on a 2 or 3 year period"", tempered Claudie Ravel, General Managing Director and Marketing Manager of Guayapi, one of the pioneering companies in this field in France. Hence the importance of uniting all stakeholders to create partnerships for the development of these fair trade programs. ""By sharing our experiences, we hope to spark the interest of other operators who in turn will also work with the producers that we support, making them less dependent on L’Occitane"", explained Reboul. Once the channels are in place, the creation of value will surely be the one expected. In particular because of an improvement in the quality of materials produced thanks to a tightening of links and a closer cooperation with suppliers. ""Our - human and financial - return on investment, is truly beneficial for both producers in Madagascar and Golgemma. It is truly a virtuous social, commercial and environmental circle"", commented Patrick Collin, Director General of Golgemma, a company specialized in the production and trading of essential oils, hydrosols and maceration oils. François-Patrick Sabater also believed that ""Fair Trade creates a true dynamic within Technico Flor, but also with customers and suppliers. This approach leads us to more transparency and enhances our creativity. In addition, our commitment towards sustainable development has taken another dimension. The fact that all our fragrances can now take advantage from excellent fair trade essential oil stands as a proof."" An approach that should quickly sparkle increasing interest among both industrialists and consumers, even if, as all stakeholders underlined, it could not be considered as a panacea. Indeed, by definition, fair trade channels only concern some producers, leaving all the others in the traditional trade circuits."
Michele Burke: Passion and love for make up!,"Premium Beauty News - Where did you get that passion for make-up? Michele Burke - I was probably predestined to it! I was born in Ireland and I emigrated to Canada late 1973. I moved to Montreal and found a job in fashion. I noticed the work of make-up professionals and then it was just like love at first sight for what will become my profession! Anyway, I always felt from the start irresistibly attracted by artistic ""matters"". However, I had no idea at the time that I could make a living out of it. But I really wanted to! And where there is a will... Premium Beauty News - Precisely, from this will is going to emerge all the talent that you had in you? Michele Burke - Absolutely! But it was necessary to spark and channel this talent. So of course I took some courses. Then I began to get clients. One of the first was with Revlon, doing live demonstrations. Then, in the early 80’s, I met two Makeup Artists, Electa and Corrado, who owned a make-up outlet with their own brand of makeup and with whom I worked with for two years doing makeovers, print and runway shows. They were truly... precursors, because today’s specialty brands that have their own makeup lines have certainly drawn their inspiration from them. All these early years are very important to me and my evolution as a makeup artist. At this point I was firmly decided and committed, ""I want to become a true professional makeup artist!"" Premium Beauty News - The die is cast but not just in any direction. Michele Burke - That’s true! I quickly chose make-up in the film industry. Rightly or wrongly, I believed the makeup for film is one of the royal roads to do this job I love so much. And the facts will prove me right. I started by working on three films for no pay, just experience. I was a sort of multipurpose make-up artist! At this point I felt that the way ahead is almost mapped out. And actually, my career began to take off  quickly. It must be said that at the time the city of Montreal attracted a lot of film producers, especially for horror movies. You can imagine in such conditions all the creative opportunities that were offered to me. Nothing like a horror film to develop one’s talent in make-up! Premium Beauty News - And then there’s the movie, Quest for Fire. A milestone! Michele Burke - Yes absolutely! This film will represent a major step. It will be my first Oscar. For the record, no make-up artist agreed to leave for seven months of shooting in the wild. But I was made for this kind of challenge. After, of course, events happened even faster I participate to several wonderful films in a row, in Canada such as Ice Man, Clan of the Cave Bear, and many horror films too numerous to mention. Premium Beauty News - An acceleration that can only lead you to the West Coast of the United States. Michele Burke - Yes and obviously Hollywood was a necessary stop on my royal road. So in 1985 I moved to Hollywood where I had to start again almost from scratch. People weren’t waiting for me! You have to prove yourself! This will be the case with a film, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, for which I get my second Oscar. [1] Premium Beauty News - The other films come in quick succession and you have excelled in recent years in several major Hollywood productions such as Rock of Ages, Mission Impossible IV and III, Tropic Thunder, The Cell, Elizabethtown, Spanglish, Minority Report, As Good As It Gets, Austin Powers 2, 3, Interview with the Vampire, etc. But cinema is not all? Michele Burke - That’s right! During that period, I also worked for some big brands like Max Factor, Procter & Gamble, etc. Then in 2006, I have the opportunity to meet the GEKA team. The company had a desire call to utilize the experience of a make-up artist like me to develop new applicators and make the existing ones more efficient. I found the challenge interesting. This is the starting point of an exciting collaboration, which has led us to develop novel products, like for example, GEKA’s latest gloss applicator ""LipDefiner Max"". The applicator is inspired by my pinky finger, and is a real power loader thanks to its ergonomic shape. In addition I have also designed a series of unique multi-functional lip and eye applicators. There’s really nothing like them in the market… Yet ! Premium Beauty News - What is your philosophy of make-up? Michele Burke - In general make-up must first of all allow a person to feel better about themselves. Make one feel beautiful! But we have all our own personal beauty needs. We have to look at our faces and discover ourselves. Find one signature note or feature like eyes or lips and focus on that! Beauty and makeup is all about self-discovery and the image we want others to see. We have to sift through all the information about cosmetic products and beauty tips and find out what suits us and what we need. So, my philosophy is to focus on our best features, correcting what we can and ignoring what we can’t change without doing any harm or damage. Always be ready for evolution. Don’t get stuck in applying the same colours and looks all the time. Only follow trends if they look good on you. Carefully consider the colour and style of your hair. Good grooming can make you look like a million. There is nothing more golden than a smile. Premium Beauty News - This profession that you have taken up  is really a matter of passion! Michele Burke - As I have already had the occasion to say. I think you need a love and a passion for it. It is not for everybody, with all the hours you put in and the personal sacrifices. Those who have that passion and love, whether male or female, will make it. See on line : www.micheleburke.com"
TFWA World Exhibition in the dynamics of travel retail,"The annual travel retail event hosted a total of 5868 visitors from 2737 companies, increasing respectively by 9% and 6% compared to the  previous year. According to the organizers, of that total 15% were key duty free operators and retailers. Among the 457 exhibitors, 128 belonged to the perfumes and cosmetics sector, including Ahava, Beauté Prestige International (BPI), which showcased Kokorico, the new Jean Paul Gaultier fragrance, the Jacques Bogart group, or Gosh Cosmetics, a Danish makeup specialist. The French company Terre d’Oc, which is not yet distributed in the travel retail channel, also took the opportunity of this event to meet some of its distributors. According to the Tax Free World Association, global duty free and travel retail sales rose by 13% in US dollars between 2009 and 2010 (+11% in local currencies) to 39 billion dollars. With 13.8 billion dollars and a market share of 35.4%, Europe remains the largest duty free and travel retail market, followed by Asia-Oceania (USD 12.7 billion and 32.7% market share), and the Americas (USD 8.9 billion and 23% market share). But in this market as in others, the Asia and Ocenia zone proved to be the most dynamic and grew by 23.7% from one year to another. In comparison, the growth of the European market appears as rather more sluggish (+3.6%). Perfumes and cosmetics account for 30.8% of the total market, and increased by 13% between 2009 and 2010, identical to the total market, second only to luxury goods (+16.5%). The next edition of the TFWA World Exhibition will take place from 21st to 26th October 2012 in Cannes."
Personal care products: Emerging markets are driving the global growth,"First conclusion drawn from the study [1], total global sales of personal care products have reached a record of USD 380 billion in 2010, or the equivalent of USD 56 per capita, an increase of 7% on the previous year. Sales, which according to the authors of the study, should continue to grow by 3% per year to 2014. Hair care would represent the first in all product categories, with some 49 billion units sold, followed by bath and shower products, and facial skincare products coming third. The Asia-Pacific region represents the largest share in the global market of personal care products with 56% in volume, Europe accounts for 19%, Latin America for 14%, North America for 8% and Middle East for 2%. It is Asia too that should achieve the highest growth rates.  The hair care category, in particular, should record its highest rise over the next coming years with an increase of around 9% per year, and hair colouring products leading the way. The dynamic is the same in Asia for facial skin care products where the growth should be of 7% per year. Another interesting figure revealed by the study, Latin America accounted for 26% of global sales of perfume in 2010.  In this region, the overall market of personal care products is expected to grow by 4% annually to 2014. The best performance being achieved by facial make up, perfume and eye make-up. According to Rexam, ""Latin America is expected to be the main growth friver of the global beauty industry, with the region set to add over USD 18 billion to its value size by 2015"". Let’s mention also the good performance of colour cosmetics in the Middle East and Africa, with an expected growth that should be well above the average. Facial make-up should increase by 11% annually while eye make-up is expected to grow by 7% per year. Perfumes should also do well. However, sales of fragrance in the region are heavily weighted in a small minority of wealthier countries - Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Israel, United Arab Emirates and Iran. More generally, the authors of the study subsequently forecast a strong growth in packaging needs for the personal care sector and expect a rise around 5% a year to 2014. Source: Rexam"
Strong growth for TV and internet cosmetic sales in the U.S.,"Sales of cosmetics and toiletries through alternate channels have skyrocketed, growing by nearly US$ 1 billion since 2005, reveals a recent report by consulting and research firm Kline & Company. [1] Internet sales (e-commerce) are leading the way with a 25.4% growth from 2005 to 2010, followed by home shopping networks like QVC and HSN posting an annual growth (CAGR [2]) of nearly 20%. As “consumers are increasingly drawn to the convenience of at-home shopping to meet their beauty needs,” Kline forecasts that double-digit growth should continue. “Consumers are spending more time at home, either by virtue of unemployment, telecommuting, or merely a desire to save money by not going out so much,” observed Karen Doskow, Consumer Products Industry Manager at Kline. “Instead of running out to the store to buy their beauty products, they’re watching home shopping channels and infomercials to get the latest on new products.” Kline also says that consumers increasingly tend to use online services to get more information on products.  “The Internet and mobile technologies are empowering consumers to be even more aggressive in their product and price comparisons and driving marketers to deliver value-based products to meet these demands,” adds Doskow. Both brand marketers and retailers are adapting their strategies to the growing importance of these channels. Kline’s study reveals that as brands increasingly look to leverage mobile and e-commerce to create seamless and ubiquitous purchase options for their customers, single-channel marketing is being rendered less and less viable.  In order to build online buzz, brands are also using daily deal sites, such as Groupon, LivingSocial, and so-called “flash sale” sites such as HauteLook, Rue La La and Gilt Group, which are fueling e-commerce sales by creating awareness and enticing interest about new products or services by offering one-time discounts in order to create trial. The bricks-and-mortar front is far from lagging. Doskow notes that “beauty has become the new revenue sweetheart in the traditionally slow-growing drug store channel as pharmacies reinvigorate their beauty offerings to lure customers with a more upscale, specialty-store look. For example, Walgreens’ acquisition of Duane Reed and its high-end Look boutiques is expected to promote growth for both the chain and the channel. Meanwhile, CVS, Rite Aid, and others have begun offering new and improved customer loyalty programs and expanding shelf space for their beauty merchandise.”"
"Beyond Beauty Paris, a transition year?","The 2011 edition of Beyond Beauty Paris, which was held from September 12 to 14, brought together 450 exhibitors.  The organisers announced an increase of 14% of visitors to 22,230 over 3 days, including 37% international from 90 countries, mainly Germany, Italy, United Kingdom but also Iran, Liban, Russia, and a great noticable Asian presence from China, Japan and South Corea. Beyond Beauty Paris features three components: Cosmeeting, the event focusing on cosmetic brands, Creative, which gathers suppliers, and European Spa, renamed Spameeting, for the spa and salons sectors. This year again, the Zoom area and its 40 exhibiting young brands was an important focal point, despite a lower rate of innovation compared to previous years. The Beauty Challengers Awards have highlighted several of them: – “Coup de coeur de la presse”, for Too Fruit, a brand aimed at the 6-12 years of age,
– “Beauty blog favourite”, for Less is More, a range of organic hair,
– “Innovation Awards” granted by the Beauty Alliance, the first German selective distribution network, for three brands: Patyka, Sampar and Laboratoires Filorga,
– “Beauty Organic Award,” for  Alorée and its Chlorocosmétic® concept,
– “Beauty Pharma Award” for the Fleurs de Bach, the brand well known for its elixirs,
– “Coup de coeur du jury”, again to the Fleurs de Bach,
– “Prix de la marque de niche”, for the brand of high en hygiene products, Le Bain Collection,
– “Prix de la marque émergente”, for Solyvia, an emerging brand of roll-ons against small daily troubles and based on the Corsican pharmacopoeia. Beyond Beauty Paris featured also two trend laboratories, several conference cycles and master classes, with more than 50 speakers. In particular, twelve conferences dedicated to the latest trends identified by the main style offices (Peclers, Carlin International, Nelly Rodi, Inspiration & Design,...) were fully booked. Within the Creative section, the BBLab, the area dedicated to analysing trends focused on Sustainable Development, Ethics and what’s “Behind the Green”. This year, Solabia highlighted its expertise in biotechnology, Greentech its natural and organic cosmetic oils, Natur’alps its comprehensive work on organic and coloured formulations of the future, Stearinerie Dubois the possibility to «go green» without plants. Minasolve and the Institute of Monoi were also present. However, several suppliers in the Creative area questioned the broad-scope positioning of the show, combining packaging manufacturers, ingredient suppliers, brands and suppliers of beauty salons or spas. What was once seen as an asset of the Paris event, which was aiming at gathering much of the beauty industry, now seems to undermine its coherence and ultimately limit the presentation of new products, reserved for more focused events. Some issues that the Informa group, the new owner of the event, will have to tackle."
MakeUp in New York: A grand cru ... as of its first edition!,"“All the necessary ingredients were there!” say the organizers. “A magical place with a breathtaking view on the Hudson River, perfect weather, the finest in America’s and Europe’s make-up industry from formulation, packaging to full-service specialists, a large number of participants with a high quality level, all of them coming and it was a surprise, from both New York and the West Coast of the United States.” ""An excellent show..."", ""the best we have attended in a long time..."", "" high quality decision makers..."", ""the very best in the make-up industry decided to meet here..."" comments were already flying as of the end of the first day of the event. With a total of 650 participants as of its first edition, Make Up in New York already appears to be the future meeting spot for American make-up professionals. During two days, dozens of managers of American brands coming from managing, marketing or purchasing teams have followed one another in the aisles of Studio 450. ""A true festival of highly competent professionals, with many of them coming from the West Coast and even several from South America"", agreed many exhibitors who had seldom seen during a professional event so many people of such high level. An event punctuated by a number of make-up animations particularly appreciated by visitors and which were set up by the teams of Eve Pearl, who is a 5-time Emmy Award winning celebrity Makeup Professional with over 18 years’ experience in television, film, theatre and print. Make Up Designory who teaches the art of make-up and hairstyling for a career in the beauty, media, Entertainment and retail industries, was also working on the show, as the team of Make Up For Ever launched in the U.S. in 1995 with the opening of a NYC Studio and which has grown tremendously over the past 16 years. ""We also wish to thank the Studio Make Up team who have also helped us organizing the events"", added the organizers ""We also wish to thank the ‘Look Good…Feel Better’ program present at the cocktail with Louane Roark and who has for more than 20 years, changed the lives of people with cancer by reminding them that they are beautiful, Inside and out… ‘Look Good… Feel Better’ is the only fee, global public service that is changing the way people with cancer approach their disease, by teaching them that they can have some normalcy in a life that is by no means normal…"" To note also the presence of the association of the Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW) Inc.. which is a non-profit professional organization that advances the professional growth and leadership potential of its members in the cosmetic industry ""This first edition was rich in lessons explained, Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, members of the organising team, and we are already working on the second one. Especially since all exhibitors that we warmly thank again for their first participation, told us they were eager to attend next year’s edition. A second edition, which will of course be full of novelties and surprises. More details to come in a few days.”"
"Samples, the first purchase triggers for make-up products","The sample is just before the promotional box with free products, the most efficient element of the promotional mix, the one that encourages the most to buy a make-up product, according to a survey conducted by Invescomm, a market research and consulting firm, in partnership with the online site FemmesPlus. Beyond questions in connection with the purchase trigger and the conditions of choice of a new make-up product, the survey also addresses preferences and expectations in terms of sampling and, more generally, make-up habits. The survey was conducted on a panel of 1,071 women who answered an online questionnaire from the website FemmesPlus. The panel was adjusted using the socio-demographics of the French population as published by the Insee. It was complemented with a B to B supplement consisting of interviews of professionals operating in the marketing of colour cosmetics. When asked about the choice conditions of a new make-up product, consumers say they need to try it and use it for at least a day (54.4%) or quickly (29.5%), but they do not believe that simply enquiring on the product is enough (9.4%) just as seeing it on someone else (0.9%). No wonder then that samples are acclaimed before promotional boxes and even before testers in the ranking of purchase incentives for make-up products. Samples are particularly appreciated by women aged 25-44 and those whose annual income is over EUR 100 000.  The survey also reveals that the older consumers are, the more they need to try a make-up product on themselves for a long period. This is also what claim 90% of consumers with very large incomes, who want to test them for at least a day. Concerning the dispatch mode of samples, Invescomm’s survey focuses in particular on the internet channel. It appears, and this is no great surprise, that the younger the consumers, the more they are familiar with ordering samples via the Internet.   But the survey also reveals that high-income consumers are more likely to order samples online. The survey also noted strong differences in terms of awareness, depending on whether consumers are interviewed about the websites where they had the opportunity to order make-up samples or on brands from which they have already received samples. Except that in both cases, Yves Rocher is ranked far ahead of its competitors. ""The results of this survey show that consumers want to test thoroughly a make-up product before buying it. This makes the sample an unavoidable tool since it has the most competitive unit cost of all testing tools available in the promotional mix of make-up brands"", explains Stanislas Feminier, Associate Director of Invescomm."
United States: the new horizons of the cosmetic market,"The Big Apple continues to play its role as a fashion and beauty trendsetter in North America. Despite the creativity of California, where many of the most innovative cosmetic brands have emerged in recent years, sustainable success and recognition can only be achieved with the recognition of the East coast. On this subject, Leila Rochet-Podvin, founder of the marketing intelligence firm, Cosmetics Inspiration&Creation, has no doubts.   For her, ""the East Coast, and New York in particular, remains the sounding box and the amplifier of all the trends that have an influence on the American society"". Hence, twice a year, she undertakes a study tour in the shops of the metropolis, from Brooklyn to New Jersey, to unearth the most significant products, the most surprising brands, with the aim to understand what trends are at stake in the market, to explore behavioural changes and decrypt innovations.  Last September 2, she offered a small overview on the results of her latest survey. After the shock of the 2008-2009 crisis, which stroke the U.S. much harder than it did Europe, the market recovered sharply in 2010 and growth remained strong all along the first half of 2011, with in particular a great comeback of colour, especially in nail polishes and lipsticks, and a stronger rise of the selective circuit compared to that of the mass. Nevertheless, crisis has left its marks, challenging points of reference and habits.   ""During the crisis, the consumer became frugal, driven by a kind of de-consumption and prioritizing its purchases of products with higher perceived value, whether emotional or rational. At the same time, the emergence of web tools facilitated consumer access to information,"" explains Rochet-Podvin. Return to growth was therefore performed in a market environment very different from the one preceding the crisis. On the one hand, consumers have changed and, on the other hand, brands and distributors have reorganized themselves. On the side of distribution, the most noticeable fact is certainly the increasingly obvious blurring of the line between distribution channels. A chain like Ulta, which offers both prestige and mass market brands in an open serve concept, has emerged stronger from the crisis. Ulta currently has 400 outlets and is aiming the 1,000 mark in the short term. As for drugstores, if upselling was slowed down by crisis, the logical process of opening shops or specialized beauty spaces (Beauty 360 for CVS, or Look Beauty for Duane Reade) continues. Even Walmart, the world leader in mass distribution, is doing his best to attract beauty buyers by renovating its outlets (200 to 800 per year) and by proposing innovative exclusivities such as Hard Candy and GeoGirl. Department stores are not to be outdone. Macy’s like Bloomingdales created new places dedicated to beauty by providing more open spaces for self service, and by inviting on an exclusive basis a number of niche brands.   In its new developed site of 2,360 sqm dedicated to the beauty of its flagship store on 59th Street Bloomingdales offers some fifty niche brands, in partnership with the British chain Space NK. Concept stores that open in the trendy districts (City Chemist, Shen Beauty and skinnyskinny in Brooklyn) and, more generally, local neighbourhood boutiques that select specific products for their customers, also contribute to the rise of niche brands. The same for beauty corners that invite themselves increasingly in deco outlets, like ABC Carpet & Home. This rise of niche brands is probably under-evaluated by existing statistical tools, in particular because they do not take account of sales carried out in stores that do not belong to large chains.   But it has not escaped professionals, a proof of that is, the very recent establishment, by the American Fragrance Foundation, of an Indie Committee, a committee dedicated to independent perfume brands. According to Rochet-Podvin two major underlying trends of the American society are transforming the beauty market.   On the one hand the rise of multi-ethnicity and on the other hand, the evolution of the self-image among younger generations. ""Since women who are currently considered as belonging to ethnic minorities will constitute in the next thirty years the majority of the population, there is nothing surprising in the fact that this is already reflected by a change in the model of the American beauty type,"" she explains. In a nutshell, the ideal of the blue-eyed American blonde is out of fashion.  Recently, a survey published in the magazine Allure revealed that for 64% of Americans, women of mixed race are the new beauty ideal.  According to this same study, Angelina Joly stands out from actresses as the one who is acclaimed for her beauty. Ethnic diversity is increasingly valued and this is more and more observed in the ads. Today, a brand like Estée Lauder claims for its new Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator, a ""proven efficacy on all ethnicities"". ""As for the young generations, notes Rochet-Podvin, the evolution of their practices is so spectacular, that people say that they tend to get older younger."" This hyper-connected generation has become ultra sensitive to the importance of valuing one’s self-image and more and more brands have a growing interested in them. In its latest report Inspiration from New York, Cosmetics Inspiration&Creation offers, based on its observations, a detailed analysis of seven themes in connection with the new world of femininity, of colours, of textures and ingredients, which were identified during the last twelve months. ""The main theme of this report is a new ‘ELEVATION’ in beauty and femininity, consumers demands and brands offer have increased, and combine with a ’RE-reinvention’ of a consumer’s aspirations who is looking for more innovation, provided it serve performance. This is what we synthesized in the word ’ReaLevation’, i.e., demand for more ambition, more innovation and dreams, but also for more real and humane stuff. Colour, light, femininity, experience, blend of cultures and vitality are the keywords in this report,” concluded Leila Rochet-Podvin."
"So different, so similar: colour cosmetics in Japan and China","No doubt, the world of beauty and cosmetics has today, its eyes focused on Asia.   Despite the early hour, it was before a packed audience, on the occasion of the latest edition of MakeUp in Paris, that Florence Bernardin, Director of Information et Inspiration, a marketing intelligence firm specialized in the cosmetic sector and Asian markets, presented the latest trends in the Japanese and Chinese make-up markets. By way of introduction, Florence Bernardin provided a brief description of these two markets, which have some similarities (demanding consumers, an abundant supply of good and even very good quality) but also many differences. Among these, there is first a different historic relationship regarding make-up. Of course, in both countries, there is a heavy and long tradition. But, while in Japan the transition from ancient culture to modern use was made in continuity, the history of China is marked by the break due to the revolutionary period, with an interruption of intergenerational transmission. Make-up is truly part of the daily routine of Japanese women, it plays an important social role and it is even seen as an obligation. ""In Japan, women never go out without wearing make-up,"" explains Bernardin. While in China, women have rediscovered make-up only quite recently, as a result there is more distrust and fears concerning, firstly, the possible toxicity of products and on the other hand, concerning the image a woman would give of herself.   Whether in terms of formulation or of result, the word ""natural"" appears to be  an essential criterion in China. These differences are reflected in figures.   In Japan, make-up represents 24% of the overall cosmetic market, against 10% in China. Another consequence is that the Japanese woman is particularly well informed and has a thorough knowledge of products. ""She is an expert at using cheap products with luxury products at the same time,"" emphasised Bernardin. The Japanese ideal of beauty is quite different from the Chinese ideal.   The ideal shape of the face, of the eyes (almond-shaped in Japan, large and wide in China), of the nose and lips differ greatly from one country to the other. From all this, results of course, some very different preferences vis-à-vis the products.   For Japanese women, complexion is a central concern and foundations are leaders in the make-up market (58%). In China, on the contrary, make-up products for lips are the top sellers (40%). In addition, it should be noted that 75% of young Japanese (15-30 years) use false eyelashes, to which they find a number of advantages (an ease of use, an immediate and stronger impact than that of a mascara, no risk for the product to run). This tidal wave is actually washing away the mascara market in Japan, a phenomenon not yet observed in China. After presenting the characteristics of the different segments for both countries, Florence Bernardin highlighted the case of BB Creams, the latest phenomenon in the Asian cosmetic market. What is it about?   The BB Cream term is a contraction of Blemish Balm, Blemish Base or Beblesh Balm. In the beginning, this product was first used, after laser surgery, to cover, soothe and soften the skin. It is therefore a perfect example of multi-functional product. There too, Florence Bernardin noted some significant differences between the two markets.   For Chinese women , it is a make-up product, used to cover skin imperfections, correct the skin tone, and provide a ""natural"" result. For Japanese women on the contrary, it is a multi-functional skincare product that enables to save time because it protects the skin against UVs and can be used either as a light foundation or as a make-up base. 
According to Kanebo Cosmetics, BB Creams ideally address the needs of thirty- and forty-something busy modern women.  Under the Freshel brand, Kanebo offers a BB Cream line with five distinct roles: beauty lotion, emulsion, cream, sunscreen, and thin cosmetic base. Since the launch of the first item of the line in September 2009, the various versions of Freshel’s BB Cream (Freshel Moist Lift W Cream, Freshel White C W Cream UV, Freshel Moist Lift BB Cream, Freshel White C Mineral BB Cream UV) have sold a total of 5,001,996 units. [1]"
MakeUp in New York: D day -16!,"“The scene is set and all the ingredients are there so that professionalism and friendliness are up to expectations,” the organizers highlighted. As for exhibitors, Studio 450 is fully booked. ""And we were unfortunately not able to meet all requests."" As for exhibitors, precisely, there will be a well balanced number of companies specialised in formulation and in packaging. Exhibitors, where there will also be an even number of European and American companies. On the side of make-up animations there too, they will be full of pep with the presence of Eve Pearl, and the teams of Make Up for Ever and those of Make-Up Designory who will be working alternately during the two-day of this make-up celebration, not to forget also the support of Studio Make Up, the one of the members of the association Look Good, Feel Better and of those of the CEW. Finally, concerning the visitors, there too, the number of pre-registration has been increasing in recent weeks. ""We have, as of today, registered more than 650 visitors"", organizers explained, ""which heralds an excellent score for a first edition."" It must be said that all the players of MakeUp in NewYork were instrumental in this success. Starting with the exhibitors themselves, who have not ceased to show their enthusiasm for this first American edition. To the example of Brian J. Fox from Genealogy who recently stated that ""MakeUp in New York can provide this inspiration to U.S. companies and brands."" An opinion also shared by Nicole Masson at MAC: ""It is time for a fresher approach in beauty shows""."
Interest grows for the booming at-home skin care devices market,"Japanese women call them “Moba Beau”, a contraction for “mobile beauty devices” a category that includes both electric-powered devices, such as mist-sprayers, and non-electric instruments such as roller type tools used to stimulate blood circulation.  The category recently attracted a great deal of attention in Japan with major cosmetics and home appliances makers tapping into a fast growing market. Recently, Japanese cosmetics giant Shiseido collaborated with Panasonic for developing a special size of its Aqualabel Moisture Lotion to fit with the Ultrasonic Beauty Device Handy Mist produced by the electronic appliances maker. Earlier this year, Hong Kong-based company Jackel, specializing in promotional goods, packaging and full-service, created a new division entirely devoted to instrumental beauty, with the aim to supply the global beauty industry with electrical and mechanical appliances designed for the face, the eyes, the body, nails and hair. In a recently published report, Kline estimates the US market for at-home skin care devices at approximately USD 1 billion at the retail level for 2011 and expects exceptional growth for the next five years. [1] According to the market research firm, these products are finding a very receptive and growing audience of consumers wanting to save time and money by avoiding regular visits to salons or to the doctor’s office.  “We knew this market was really taking off, but even we were shocked by its sheer size,” said Karen Doskow, Industry Manager for Consumer Products at Kline. The direct sales channel, which includes home shopping networks, infomercials, and e-commerce, is the primary means of distribution in the U.S., with about 60% of the total market share, added Doskow. While sonic cleansing products are currently leading the way, with market leader Clarisonic, Kline’s research points out a huge potential for anti-aging devices, that are expected to grow by a very healthy 50% this year alone.  The research also mentions strong opportunities for manufacturers to develop mass-market options."
"MakeUp in Paris, A strong increase in visitorship","According to the organisers, the 2011 edition of MakeUp in Paris can be seen as the conversion of the promising try performed by its first edition in June 2010. With nearly 1,900 visitors, the increase from one year to the other exceeds 35%. As in previous year, brands (with over 61% of entries) were once again the most attracted by MakeUp in Paris, followed by retailers. ""The key principles driving the creation of this unique event in the B to B universe of the beauty sector have only increased, namely a strong presence of Marketing teams dispatched by the main decision makers, who accounted for one third of visitors, Marketing teams which were closely followed by Research and Development teams and then by those concerned by Processes and Production"", detailed Sandra Maguarian the Show Manager of MakeUp in Paris. The strong attendance of marketing teams (nearly 32% of visitors) seems really to be what makes MakeUp in Paris stand out. There are several explanations the organisers say: the location of the event at the heart of Paris, the quality of animations staging the products and the conviviality of the welcoming. Research and Development managers represent the second category of visitors, with almost 19% of the total. As for Purchasing departments, they account for about 8% of the total. Although MakeUp in Paris first gathered French visitors, the number of foreign visitors has also nonetheless increased, with +5% on 2010, representing 12.5% of the total. Germans and Italians rank first, followed immediately by UK and Americans visitors. Then comes Switzerland, followed by the Netherlands, Spain, Japan, South Korea, Lebanon and Poland. Organizers also noted the visit of Russians, Brazilians, Swedes, Moroccans, Tunisians, Romanians, Mexicans, Iranians, Indonesians, Hungarians, and even people from Saudi Arabia and Benin. The next edition of MakeUp in Paris will be held on June 21 and 22, 2012 at the Carrousel du Louvre."
Honesty in questions on the occasion of Benefit’s latest mascara launch,"On the occasion of the launch of the new “They’re real” mascara - a product that Benefit claims to have “the ability to make lashes look so long as to not be one’s own” - the brand founded in California in 1976 by Jean and Jane Ford, commissioned a survey of U.S. and French women on the subject of lying and make-up habits. Benefit Cosmetics, which has made a name for itself by creating quality products with a sense of humour, wanted to obtain some basic information about the extent of lying among both U.S. and French women, subjects lied about, reasons it might be acceptable to lie, etc.  The survey was also conceived as an excellent buzz maker, in line with Benefit’s image as the “friskiest luxury brand.”   It was also an opportunity to learn more about make-up habits in the U.S.A. and France. From June 15 to June 19, 2011, consumers and markets research agency ICR conducted online interviews on nationally representative samples of 300 women in the US and 300 women in France, between 18 and 54 years of age. According to the survey, 62% of women in United States and 59% in France, lie at least once a week, and this is higher for 18-24 women: 74% in US, 70% in France.  Younger women are also more likely to lie than older ones about makeup, spending and time getting ready, and French women are more likely than US women to lie about makeup and beauty issues. Is it a surprise?  French women appear more tolerant than U.S. ones about the acceptability of lying. The survey also provides interesting information about the difference in mascara and make-up use on both sides of the Atlantic.  Over half of both groups own two or more mascaras, but French women appear to own more items than their U.S. counterparts.  Actually, 13% of French women do not know how many they own, maybe because they own too many of them to count! Eventually, when asked to mention “the one essential makeup which a woman will not leave the house without applying”, French and U.S. women have quite divergent opinions on the matter. In the US, concealer/foundation and lipstick are top essentials while, in France, mascara wins, especially among the 18-24 years old.  Almost 3 times as many young French women as young US women won’t leave the house without it. Unless it is just another lie!"
Make-up: The dynamics of full service,"Full service is here to stay. Whatever may be the market’s cyclical or structural difficulties, main key players participating in MakeUp in Paris agree that it is the symbol of a particularly heavy evolution of the trade, both for brands and subcontractors and that it is finding with make-up, a technical product par excellence, a favoured field of expression. Very complex to produce, many make-up products require, both for their formulation, and their packaging, a thorough industrial expertise that many companies, SMEs in particular, cannot afford or will not wish to acquire internally (when skincare and perfume are the core part of their business) and will therefore seek to supply from a third party. So far nothing surprising. However, full service, ""that offers everything"", is also attracting big decision-makers, and even very large ones... But, why do groups enjoying a global dimension, that have at hand most of the required expertise and also have considerable resources, appeal to this type of service? They do so sometimes to address specific needs, for instance in the case of a non-strategic one-shot launch, when they wishes to limit their own investment. They also rely on full service because it is fast, and therefore allows greater responsiveness for trendy products, and because it is also a very comfortable solution: ""we manage the planning and logistics and we smooth out programs over time,"" explained Marie-Christine Clerc, Sales and Marketing director of BCM Cosmétique. But there is no denying that there is a tendency toward the transfer of brand’s activities to subcontractors. With, as a corollary, a transfer of risk when brands delegate to subcontractors uncertainties linked to packaging development. Which can have its pitfalls for players otherwise subject to strong price pressure, even if they must invest heavily to remain competitive in the race for innovation. So does it mean sub-contractors can be considered like service providers likely to be ruthlessly exploited? Not at all. Because it is a great opportunity for them. First of all, because by working with these major groups, full service players discover that overseas operations are a very valuable springboard for growth when the European market is still dull. But there is more to it. ""It’s interesting, explains Nathalie Dessirier, Export and Marketing manager at Alkos Cosmétiques, because it gives us a broader view, allowing us to acquire increased experience."" And in this highly competitive market where innovation is permanent, ""the more we will increase our expertise, the more we will become unavoidable, claims Anne Challe, CEO of Fareva Color, because full service covers a wide range of interpretations."" ""At LF Beauty, we distinguish full service - which is more limited - from a turnkey service, which implies full support from the draft to the placing of products on the shelves thus bringing real value,"" revealed Francis Camilli, Senior VP. However, if full service represents a strategic development for many companies, it is not the only one. Because as mentioned above, it often involves seasonal collections, licensed products with a short life span, and thus very clearly raises the issue of the sustainability of the activity. Thus remains, as always, the critical importance of the relationship built with clients. ""We select our suppliers on their capacity for innovation, on their understanding of the brand as well as on the quality of our business relationship and, more and more, on their knowledge of regulatory issues, emphasised Stéphanie de Chaxel, Marketing director of Sothys. In the case of full service, they must almost act like if they were a real department of the company that would be outsourced and with the same quality level"". Good news: the regulatory challenge to which will be confronted companies is another opportunity offered for a win-win partnership."
"""The market is in need of services and skills,"" Alban Muller","Premium Beauty News - What are your expectations concerning the U.S. market? Alban Muller - The approach of this market is difficult, but we believe we can successfully introduce a new concept of eco-friendly cosmetics corresponding to societal expectations of consumers. Currently the U.S. market represents 15% of our turnover, but this proportion will grow as we expanded our offering of services. From a simple ingredient supplier, we have become partners for research projects and creators of natural formulas.  Indeed, the ingredients offering has diversified, formulas are increasingly sophisticated and consumers are increasingly demanding and informed. The U.S. demand has changed significantly too.  It became a market to buy skills. The reason is quite simple: the regulatory constraint is much stronger than before. U.S. cosmetics brands will have to comply with EU rules that are more stringent than theirs. Today, a U.S. exporter wishing to enter the European market must comply with a heavy and demanding body of regulations requiring. When the turnover expected in Europe is too small compared to the cost of acquisition of these skills, it makes sense to use a local supplier. Actually, we bet that many American brands will relocate part of their production to Europe. Premium Beauty News - How would you characterize the U.S. market? Alban Muller - The market is hungry for news and trends, always dynamic, with a high standard. Premium Beauty News - It is often said that North American customers are much less sensitive than Europeans regarding environmental issues? Alban Muller - I do not think that is true. American companies have often been accused of green-washing practices. However, we observe that the chemical industry has made considerable efforts and the cosmetics industry is progressing in this field. Furthermore, consumers get information more easily now. While in France, labelling is starting to display carbon footprint and environmental commitments, in the U.S., smartphone applications proposing to decipher product labels are increasingly popular. QR-type tags are increasingly used, allowing an easy and quick reading of products’ main features. It is very convenient for consumers, but a bit less comfortable for manufacturers, as we know that 60% of consumers change their product when they read and understand the label. That’s a major shift in the market that must be taken into account. Premium Beauty News - Broadly speaking, how do you see the major market trends in the cosmetic world? Alban Muller - I think the main change is concerning the growing search for external highly qualified expertise. Large companies are now fully aware of the advantages of outsourcing, when it is based on small and virtuous businesses. Network models such as the Cosmetic Valley can interface more easily public and private research. The explanation for this trend reflects both the crisis and the growing complexity of the technical and regulatory environment. Outsourcing also allows to tap into creativity and innovation and to reduce development time. The second major trend is the increased integration of environmental aspects into product design, particularly in terms of packaging. The industry is investing heavily to improve the life cycle of its products. Among the consequences of the tsunami that occurred last March in Japan is the acceleration of environmental awareness, especially among manufacturers. The mountain of waste that the waves washed away in the ocean is now concentrated in the Pacific. Each fish that dies by swallowing a plastic bag is a fish that man will not eat. We all understood the need to work on the biodegradability of our products and therefore of our waste. For 15 days, the Earth has 7 billion people, and it is a figure that is still expected to grow: the challenge of our species survival is clearly stated. Premium Beauty News - It is in these directions that you focus the development of Alban Muller International. Alban Muller - Yes of course: we are not only developing technical skills but also social skills. Our concern is to provide businesses with expertise in social responsibility, in full loyalty with the values of Alban Muller International, and by involving our clients. We want to ensure that we offer them concrete and tailored solutions, sustainable in the long term, to meet the many challenges they face. In this context of environmental issues, we provide relevant solutions in a timely manner, where all steps have been controlled. This calls for partnerships in the medium and long term, as well as contracts for specific developments, which are also a way for us to have secure resources to improve the quality of our services. It’s a win-win situation because it helps us to optimize the cost of our research by focusing on the real needs of our partnering clients instead of working on risky and possibly inadequate ""marketing hypotheses"" that are cause time and energy wastes for all."
Men and fragrance: Top 10 of French consumers’ favourite brands,"The survey, which was conducted online from 28 to 29 April 2011, on a representative sample of 1,000 male Internet users aged 18 or over (average age 39) relying on selective networks for their fragrance purchases, seeks to highlight consumer trends on a highly competitive market and the perception that consumers have of men’s fragrances. While this study by Promise Inc. seeks primarily to decrypt consumer’s perception of fragrance brands for men, it also highlights masculine consumption patterns. Thus, male buyers in selective distribution networks (e.g., Sephora, Marionnaud, Nocibé ...) purchase 64% of perfumes they use. These however do not forget woman. Since, 41% of fragrances bought in selective network are offered to women. Finally, if male buyers buy on average one fragrance every 9 months, they are offered on average a bottle every 16 months. According to the authors of the survey, the results, in particular the highest scores of image allocation per brand, help highlight three types of perfumers: luxury, virile and intermediate. “It is also interesting to note that most of the ten fragrances for men the most kept in mind by consumer have been deep-rooted in this market for many years,” they add. Apparently, a product must reach some maturity before it can emerge in the collective unconscious. Indeed, 80% of perfumes named by respondents in the rankings, were launched at least 15 years ago. “Only Dior Homme and Allure by Chanel were created respectively 12 and 6 and years ago and benefited from the halo effect of these traditional luxury brands,” says the survey. The image of the ten brands with the highest equity to the eyes and noses of respondents stretches between ""modern virility"" and ""expert luxury"" and, between these two poles, an intermediate positioning occupied by Jean-Paul Gaultier. – Luxury and prestige, the safe values of traditional perfume brands This first group gathers the fragrances  created by High Fashion brands that expanded their luxury image to these products. “Houses like Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel, traditional French luxury brands originally specialized in women’s fashion, actually very quickly diversified themselves by launching collections intended for men and by also setting foot in the perfume and cosmetic sector.” Clearly perceived by respondents as ""major luxury brands"" (Chanel, respectively: 74%; Dior: 67%; YSL: 53%), they are also synonymous, in the subconscious of consumers, with very high quality and with a solid reputation in fragrances (Chanel: 69%; Dior: 63%; YSL: 40%). – Virility, a reflection of masculine identity for men’s fragrance houses In this second group are the fragrances perceived as “seduction weapons”, which are also the first beauty reflex that comes to men’s minds. “Some fragrances, more than others, characterized by manly notes, convey a virile and modern image and become attitude-fragrances,” say the authors of the report. Thus, houses like Hugo Boss, Azzaro, and Diesel, who all started in men’s ready-to-wear, are clearly identified by the French people interviewed, as so called ""virile"" brands (Hugo Boss, respectively: 52% ; Diesel: 51%; Azzaro: 38%). To respondents, they are also part of today’s trends, they are modern and innovative. – Design and creativity, the intermediary positioning of Jean-Paul Gaultier Finally, considered totally new, in the context of this study, the respondents representation of the Jean-Paul Gaultier brand which stands out as a category of its own: that of an intermediate positioning. According to 64% of the French respondents of this study, the Jean-Paul Gaultier house offers bottles created by designers. 58% of them point out that Jean-Paul Gaultier has a keen sense of aesthetics and of design and 48% have characterized the fragrance brand of the ambassador of the white and navy blue jersey, for its creativity."
"Glass and make-up, in the field of intimacy!","The Espace Matières (Materials and textures area) at MakeUp in Paris, reminiscent of an art gallery, was a tribute to cosmetic material: stunning visuals of make up faces by Damien Dufresne, the Artistic Director, ""... like words on skin"" mingling harmoniously with amazing sculptures, ""... like countless moments of intimacy when the body meets with matter""... enhanced with glass bottles, in turn transparent, iridescent, delicately tinted or fully opaque. An area which was made possible thanks to the commitment of three companies G. Pivaudran, Solev and, ... SGD Parfumerie/Cosmétiques. An opportunity for Valérie Jacob, SGD’s Marketing Director to recall for Premium Beauty News the importance that the skincare segment and more specifically, the make-up segment mean for her Group. Premium Beauty News - Surprisingly the glass industry seems to express itself much more in the fragrance segment than in the one of cosmetics and much less in the make-up segment. But figures show that cosmetic products account for more than 30% of sales in this packaging segment and that make-up, mainly through foundation products, is one of its dynamic vector. Valérie Jacob - Yes, you are right! The world of perfume is undoubtedly the one where our know-how in terms of glass making expresses itself the most flamboyantly. The world of cosmetics is more in connection with jars and bottles, which were often, up to now originating from our collection of standard items. But nowadays, codes for high-end skincare and make-up products are changing. There is currently a new trend highlighting the development, and a return in some cases to more sophisticated and creative glass containers. Premium Beauty News - What are the advantages of glass for skincare and make-up products? Valérie Jacob - There are numerous! First of all, glass is a neutral material, which therefore has no compatibility problem with formulas, and which in addition has a barrier effect protecting even the most sensitive of them. The weight, the brightness of glass, its multiple decorative options make it inevitably a ""premium"" image vector for skincare and make-up products. And of course, let’s not forget a major ecological advantage: glass is 100% recyclable! Significant strong points to which SGD is giving value to. Taking advantage of our expertise in the pharmaceutical industry, we are reflecting on innovations for ""intelligent packagings"" in order to bring real functional benefits, to the foundation segment, for example. Remember that 60% of references are packed in glass. Moreover, the ""Fusion Beauty"" trend which gave rise to make-up products enriched with active ingredients or to formulas that change colour or texture when applied on the skin, enhances the use of glass containers. It seems worthwhile to reflect on the development of appropriate bottles! Premium Beauty News -  A market watch and innovation approach that is always at the heart of SGD’s strategy? Valérie Jacob - Absolutely! This is an integral part of the strategic marketing unit whose daily work is to deepen its knowledge of markets, to provide insight and enable the Group to project itself into the future. All this, of course, within the overall framework which characterizes SGD as we operate commercially and industrially in all parts of the world, Asia, North America and South America, and, of course, Europe. We are strongly market- and consumer-oriented, to provide optimal solutions to our clients. Premium Beauty News - Finally, does your desire to take part to the MakeUp In Paris show, an unusual move for a glassmaker, come from your observation that the assets of glass are still too little known in the world of make-up? Valérie Jacob - Yes for sure! Especially since the advantages of glass are not limited the material itself, but also extend to the decoration techniques that make it possible to obtain very peculiar touches, and unique colours and finishes. With our expertise and the beauty of the material itself, we offer brands opportunities to unleash their imagination to create bottles and jars representing a true visual and sensory experience for consumers, while highlighting colours, light, textures. At SGD, we give clients the freedom to enjoy a new vision of glass, to animate the worlds of make-up and skincare."
"HBA, trying to find its way in a recovering market","According to the testimonials of those who have been attending the show for many years, the HBA is presently unrecognisable compared to what it was ten years or even five years ago. All sectors were impacted by the loss of key exhibitors. This was particularly striking on the side of ingredient suppliers, who were still numerous a few years ago. ""A large number of exhibitors now focus on the Suppliers’ Day organized by the NYSCC [1], which takes place in New Jersey"", pointed out Nicolas Meyrial, National Account Executive Personal Care, at Naturex specialised in plant-derived substances. Nonetheless, the participation, among others, of Catalent, Clariant, and Rossow USA was noticeable. The conclusion is the same for packaging, with a massive presence of Asian suppliers, but with yet, a smaller number of big players such as Arrowpak, Alpha Packaging, Coswel Korea, Elcos, Fusion Packaging, Lablabo, Mega Pumps, Topline Products or Yonwoo. As for formulators and full service players, the presence of important European companies was noticeable, especially in the make-up segment, such as b-kolor makeup & skincare and Technocosmesi, along with such American companies as Columbia Cosmetics, Lady Burd, and Wormser Corporation, or the Korean Hwa Sung. As for the organizers, while visitors figures are not yet available, they insist on the efforts that were made this year to concentrate invitations on the most qualified buyers. “We did hear from several exhibitors that they met with high quality attendees from  Avon, Coty, Revlon, Estee Lauder, L’Oreal, Lancome, Maybelline, MAC, Unilever, Tarte, Sephora, and more top brands that were in attendance along with several top independent brands,” said Jill Birkett, Brand Director for HBA Global. “Through comments on-site and through tweets and other real-time applications we did hear that attendees were pleased with the increase in European exhibitors, that there were exciting innovations on the exhibit floor,” she added One thing that does not change on the HBA is its rich program of conferences, who for most of them required an entrance fee. These training are undoubtedly extremely popular, to such a point that some visitors only allow themselves a short detour to the exhibition area. Among the speakers, many of them are also former exhibitors who now limit their participation to one or two presentations before an audience they generally judge very interesting. “Trying to accommodate the needs of the brand and product managers seeking education with a balance of time on the exhibit hall is always a challenge.  This year, we added more education to Thursday so that we could have a longer break mid-day Tuesday and Wednesday to allow conference attendees the chance to spend more time on the exhibit floor,” explained Jill Birkett. With a dozen rooms dedicated for this purpose and more than 70 conferences giving voice to a panel of three or four experts, i.e. over 200 stakeholders, the program addresses many topical issues in the areas of marketing, international trade and sustainable development. To note this year, a morning dedicated to French cosmetics which was orchestrated by the Cosmetic Valley and its president, Alban Muller, during which were exposed the operating mode and the activities of this cluster so unique in the world that groups together nearly 500 companies, universities and labs. The aim being to show how the ""Made in France"" integrated environmental concerns and the use of natural substances. If economic recovery is obvious after the downturn, many companies and consultants believe on the other hand that the U.S. market is still very much focused in trying to find the best price. Even in the high-end sector, customers are on the lookout for promotional operations and for the gifts that come along with them. While it was felt that, the ecological trend was on the rise on the U.S. market, sustainable offer was however not as prominent on the stands of exhibitors, as what could be observed in European or even Asian trade shows. Does this mean that American consumers and companies show a lack of interest for these issues?  The opinions we collected differ widely.  The ones note that the issue on parabens, for example, is here much less sensitive than in Europe. Others highlight that some companies such as Proter & Gamble have a real advantage regarding the use of plant based plastic packaging. Anyway, the market is structuring and developing itself.  For some years now, for example, Whole Foods Market, the specialist in organic food, offers large areas dedicated to personal care products, under the brand name ""Whole Body"". Sephora in turn created a label called ""Naturally Sephora"" to identify the products that were meeting its corporate specifications. But mostly, certification is starting to grow withthe development of official U.S. standards under the guidance of the ANSI. [2] ""We have certified a hundred of products since February"", explained Jacklyn Bowen, General Manager of Quality Assurance International (QAI). Market figures are also not bad at all. Lagging behind for some time because of the recession and after stagnating in 2009, the U.S. market for natural cosmetics has strongly taken off in 2010 and has just passed the USD 5 billion mark, according to Organic Monitor, in particular through the impetus given by private labels which were launched by mass market operators."
MakeUp in Paris: the dynamics of success,"All the necessary ingredients were present! Exhibitors were satisfied, visitors, were enthusiastic, a place who lived up to the event and... to the visitors, quite an affluence indeed! Quite surprising too, to see so many visitors until the last remaining hours of the show on Friday afternoon. Words like ""they were really two very professional days but in a festive atmosphere,"" could be heard here and there. The make-up animations of course had something to do with this success. The presence of renowned make-up schools,  and the one of a number of make up artists among the most brilliant of their generation, and especially their almost uninterrupted performance during two days challenged the imagination and whetted the appetite of everyone. As a proof of this, the numerous marketing teams from the biggest cosmetic brands that were walking up and down the aisles of the show ended up by gathering around the make-up animation clusters judiciously placed in the show area. As for the very professional atmosphere, it could be noticed immediately upon entering the show. “This was largely due to the set-up of the booths themselves, which were almost all alike (all the product and nothing but the product!),” the organisers of MakeUp in Paris insisted. With some of them looking like real small private-looking showrooms dressed in white and the other ones looking more like open spaces, where visitors in search of ideas could appreciate at a glance the offer of each exhibitor. Keeping the ""showroom"" appearance was an essential aspect in the strategy of companies specialized in formulations whose ultra confidential presentations mostly concerned the future. Another strong point this year was the quality of conferences and round tables.  An occasion to further broaden one’s knowledge around the theme of colours and trends, but also bove all to have available the main actors of this sector. Of course, an essential and final ingredient was present like the previous year: ""conviviality"". Obviously members of the big make-up ""family"" who, in other places and circumstances, would remain fierce competitors were happy in such a special occasion to meet one another. As for the Carrousel du Louvre, it can only be summed up in a single word: magnificent! what more could be dreamt of? At the very heart of Paris, this mythical place represents in itself what is actually the best the world around, in terms of Prestige, of Culture and of History and where MakeUp in Paris could only but write its own. An amazing place in which one willingly delves into (and it is rare enough!) with joy and where MakeUp in Paris will have sparkled with a thousand colourful points for two days in a row. MakeUp in Paris is only in its second edition, yet perceptions of sustainability and maturity, are undoubtedly already noticeable.   Its younger counterpart, will see the light September next in New York. The organisers announced that most of the ingredients mentioned above will also be present across the Atlantic. Good luck!"
bareMinerals: success through recommendation,"Early in 2010, when Shiseido announced its intention to acquire Bare Escentuals, the 1.7 billion dollars offered by the Japanese giant, provided a picture of the exceptional success encountered by this company founded some thirty years ago in San Francisco. The valorisation of Bare Escentuals, which markets mainly the make-up brand bareMinerals, is indeed just as important as that of YSL Beauty when it was acquired by L’Oréal for 1.15 billion euros in 2008. The aim for Shiseido being to reinforce its positions in North America and Europe, on a young and dynamic market segment. In addition to North America, bareMinerals products are marketed in Europe (UK, Northern Europe, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland), and Japan. ""A jar of bareMinerals foundation is sold every 4 seconds in the world"", the company states. Initially best known for its foundation products, bareMinerals has now established itself as a global make-up brand: eye shadows, blushers, lipsticks, eyeliners and mascaras. Interestingly, it is the only brand of mineral make-up coming from across the Atlantic to have successfully managed a breakthrough in Europe, beyond the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. The reasons for this success? ""Quality products and our strategy to educate consumers"", explained Sophie Ifrah, Marketing Manager forBare Escentuals in France. Sold in France exclusively in Sephora outlets since 2006, it’s mostly because it took the time to explain how to use the products that the brand managed to convince French customers who were at first reluctant to try the foundations. ""We never hesitate to go over the basics of make-up. And it’s very well perceived. Women are always very much seeking for tips and advice. French women had a preconceived idea of foundation. For example, many women buy products which are way too dark for their complexion, hoping to achieve a healthy look. Actually, the foundation must be applied first, before the ’healthy glow’ product"".  For this purpose, the brand has a team of trainers as well as a team of make-up artists at the Sephora outlet on the Champs Elysées. For 35 years, the Californian company has refused to hire a spokesmodel or to select predefined beauty standards. Bare Escentuals puts simplicity at the heart of its bareMinerals brand: advice suiting each woman and her skin type. The goal is both simple and ambitious: develop close ties and complicity with consumers. ""Our customers must become the brand’s ambassadors because our products convinced and satisfied them. Recommendation is the driving force of our success"", insists Ifrah. No wonder then the brand is so active on social networks, where it is considered a pioneer.   New media are perfectly in tune with the ""marketing recommendation"" implemented by the brand. ""Facebook is the recommendation vector par excellence, it’s a great sounding board, a completely new relay to the shopping experience"", emphasises Helene Couderc, Community Manager at Bare Escentuals France. ""But this is obviously a tool you need to know how to use which is not always that easy to achieve, so sometimes appropriate external expertise is required."" But regarding make-up, the media, whose influence is growing fastest is of course YouTube. Videos where young women give their peers, short make-up courses, testing at the same time their latest purchase can reach very significant levels of audience. ""YouTube is definitely an increasingly important prescription channel for make-up"", explains Couderc. ""The proximity effect comes fully into play."" Social networks are part of the brand’s priority investments. ""This is not without risk but is consistent with our brand’s marketing logic. On Facebook, the cost per click remains particularly attractive. Especially the very specific criteria selection possibilities in terms of hobbies, tastes, enable to select targets very accurately."" Another advantage of new media is an interesting rejuvenating effect, at a time when ’digital mums’ replace ’housewives under 50’ at the heart of advertisers’ concerns.  ""On our Facebook fan page, the most common age ranges from 25 to 34,"" notes Ifrah. An average age somewhat lower than that of customers in outlets. Beauty bloggers can obviously not be sidelined from this local strategy. ""We are in regular contact with several bloggers, and with most of those in the top 20-top 40 of Wikio"", Couderc indicates. And the brand is quite complimentary to them. ""They are young, responsive and very reactive, but also professional, they respect the embargoes and, in addition, some are followed by the beauty press."" Besides the prescriptive influence of these bloggers, seems confirmed by the few available studies.  According to Hélène Couderc, ""we must act with tact, know how to be close while remaining professional and respectful.""  Generally speaking, brands must be careful not to be too intrusive.  The readers’ confidence toward bloggers relies heavily on a close relationship, a common language and universe.  Sponsored posts can be misunderstood, even if offerings to test some products are generally better welcomed. At bareMinerals in any case, bloggers, like fans of the Facebook page, and loyal customers and newcomers of Sephora stores are all pampered by a brand that regularly offers the opportunity for customized make-up sessions in Paris and in the provinces, simply through Facebook. During these sessions, they are first asked to familiarize themselves with the foundations and their method of application. They will then be in a position to advise their friends! That is the way the virtuous circle of marketing recommendation works, according to Bare Escentuals."
MakeUp in Paris: Focus on colour,"Premium Beauty News - Your participation to the first MakeUp in Paris in June 2010 made of you a precursor. The magnificent pictures of your work are still in everyone’s minds. What will be the highlights of your presence, this year at the Carrousel du Louvre? Damien Dufresne - I indeed participated to the very first MakeUp in Paris and I am very grateful for the renewed confidence you are placing in me this year.  I doubt the images of my ""exhibition"" are still engraved in everyone’s mind, but in any case they are still in mine. It was a new experience for me, to make up and then take pictures of my own make-ups. Premium Beauty News - A 2011 event that will be punctuated by the “Espace Matières”, tell us more about it? Damien Dufresne -  Sandra Maguarian this year, entrusted me with the artistic direction of the ""Espace Matières"" within MakeUp in Paris. So I chose the subjects of pictures, the models, the main theme, prior to the shooting. Unlike last year, I didn’t take the pictures, I decided to only take care of the creation of make-ups and of the art direction of pictures.  I asked Alexander Pattein, a young photographer, to join me on this great adventure. We were also joined by the Imaginers Agency represented by Galaxie Vujanic, Niko Neki and Greg Jouslin to do the scenography of the exhibition. Together we tried to establish the connection between raw materials and images. I must take this opportunity to thank SGD, Pivaudran and Solev for their help in providing us with the raw materials. Premium Beauty News - Make-up has become a key strategic element for the development of a beauty brand. Probably more important than some years ago. What were the reasons, do you believe, for this trend to grow? Damien Dufresne - Because it is difficult to create an identity for skincare lines, while make-up lines allow brands to stand out.
This identity, comprises the choice of textures, of colours, of packaging but also and especially the image conveyed by the media. To achieve a beauty image is not something obvious, the light must be ideal, the connection with the model ""intimate"" and the photo ""accident"" factor is much less obvious than with fashion shoots. The choice of the model is also very important, her complicity with the photographer, the glances, what the eyes have to say, what they don’t say, what they are hiding. Emotion, is what makes the difference between two pictures.
Major brands have understood this perfectly, they use images of high profile personalities to challenge the reader. Most of the time they are actresses, because they are the representation of roles they have played. It bothers me of course, because it’s like moving make-up to the background. Premium Beauty News - Given your experience in this field, what do you believe was the main progress achieved in formulation and packaging in recent years? And how much still remains to be accomplished? Damien Dufresne -  I have no experience whatsoever in terms of formulation, formulation is the matter of chemists, of laboratories. But my experience allows me, of course, to distinguish a good texture from a poor texture, but it enables me mostly to know how to combine textures and colours. Because a texture does not allow all colours. Of course, I regret the lack of collaboration between make-up artists and laboratories.  I am convinced that labs as much as brands would benefit from having their range of shades developed by make-up artists. When visiting trade-shows, I often test samples and notice how much an inappropriate colour can reduce the attractiveness of a texture itself. Make-up artists are not chemists but chemists have never make-up anyone. As for packaging I’m not an expert either, but I regret of course standardization. Brands do know that packaging is the first asset to help them stand out. And that some customers are just as sensitive to the content as they are to the container. Without necessarily focusing on packaging as a ""luxury item"" no to say a ""collector’s item"", why not try and elaborate better quality refillable packagings, instead of putting on the market quality textures in ordinary packagings? I believe the success of a brand in the long term, always implies a quality texture, a packaging worthy of the name and most of all a respect of the client. And I am convinced a satisfied customer returns by herself in an outlet and that for that, she doesn’t need to rely on ads. And long-term is necessarily synonymous with loyalty."
"Brigitte Reiss-Andersen, New York: ""To make-up yourself, is to tell a story""","Working as a ""booker"" for a modelling agency in Stockholm, learning the basics of make-up very early, Brigitte Reiss-Andersen draws the attention of several fashion photographers. We are in 1980. Two years later, by chance, she meets José Luis, the legendary make-up artist and creator of Yves Saint Laurent’s range of make-up. It’s all about making up his twenty models who are on a fashion parade on the same day in Stockholm, and he needs an assistant.  She answers his call. And they get on well! So well that he very quickly gives her the choice: to accompany him in Paris, or not. And before he knew it, the answer was yes and it was a deal! A luggage each, their plane tickets in the other hand, and they’re on their way! This will last for two years. ""A very fulfilling and rich period,"" she admits, ""where I’ll be collaborating with José Luis for prestigious fashion magazines as well as on big fashion shows (Montana, Alaia, YSL)"". Eventually, at the beginning of 1985 when Brigitte Reiss-Andersen decides to fend for herself and she hires her first agent. The saga continues and she is contacted by ELLE, Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and creates the looks for the ads of Yves St Laurent, Biotherm, L’Oréal. In 1987, the question arises. Why not go to New York? ""It’s quite funny, when you think about it, since it’s my hairstylist, Frédéric Fekkai who gave me the idea when he told me he was going to establish himself on the other side of the Atlantic. It puzzled me at first, but very quickly, desire took over. Why not?""  There too, Brigitte Reiss-Andersen takes the decision in no time. ""When I arrived in New York, she says, the atmosphere was quite different from that of Paris. Here it is not only a poorly paid vocation, it is a profession of its own just needing to be developed.” Brigitte Reiss-Andersen reinforces her professionalism and... gets married! Her talent is not left unnoticed. She works with great photographers (Demarchelier, Penn, Leibovitz, Elgort), fashion designers (Kamali, de la Renta, Ralph Lauren) and spends her time between studios in Paris and New York. Then her long time friend, Frédéric Fekkai who is launching, with the Chanel Group, a range of products bearing his name, asks her to create a line of make-up. She quickly grows a true passion for this other world in the universe of colour cosmetics: branding, marketing, launches and public relations.   She then works with Procter & Gamble, Walgreens and Sephora. Today she has the rare privilege of keeping her position at a top fashion make-up Artist (she can boast for more than two hundred cover magazines) and to be requested to work for the biggest names in showbiz.   Among the twenty Oscars-winning movie stars she was requested to work for, there are Halle Berry, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Juliette Binoche as well as Catherine Deneuve, Mariah Carey and Michelle Pfeiffer. ""To me, she says, make-up has always been, at the start, something very spontaneous. When you make up someone for a magazine, it’s instantaneous work. Therefore, my vision is quite natural and logical: make-up is a tool that allows a women to show the different facets of her beauty. She can change it. She can modify it depending of her desires, goals, and the identity she wants to take. At the same time, life changes every day. Obviously, to some extent, the use of the tools we have at our disposal every day has become ""simpler"". The make-up application must also be simple and quickly reach the desired objective. It must remain practical!” “What has also changed in the picture is that the great Beauty Houses are no longer the only ones to pave the way. Many others stakeholders have emerged to successfully influence the public: Celebrities ""parading"" on red carpets, fashion shows and blogs, for example. They are quick and efficient and are well suited to demand. This too has changed! I would say finally that a woman should not make up only according to the physical features of her face, but she should mostly make up for the story she wants to tell in her make-up and, somehow, for the message she wants to convey."" Does she see herself classic and discreet for her business lunch, or more casual during her vacations or with the looks of a femme fatale for her evening date?    Her make-up will match her very desires and the ""role"" she has chosen."
"MAC, surprise them, keep on surprising them!","A marketing strategy that roots the brand deeply in the unconscious of consumers and which obviously can only but boost the suppliers sector whether derived from packaging or formulation. All the more because the U.S. firm does not hesitate to fully exploit the trump card of innovation. Explanations by Nicole Masson, Vice President Global Product Development. Premium Beauty News - With more than 1700 outlets spread in every corner of the world, MAC is indeed a big machine. Which does not keep you, on the contrary, from having a performing presence on the field. Nicole Masson - You are right! Our dynamism expresses, itself of course, through our will to constantly adapt to the market, to the consumers needs, be they visible or implied. It’s also our job to identify them, to understand them and to provide the best possible response to women’s needs. Our approach is global and not just hinged to a specific country, although it’s clear that our interests in terms of brand development evolve according to global trends. Currently, our strategic priorities are called Brazil, Japan, Korea and, of course, China! Anyway, development in its broadest sense, is a constant concern at MAC. Most formulas are developed by our own laboratories.  Of course, we have suppliers that work with us. As for packaging, we rely on the main players in the marketplace with a strong focus, from our part, on innovation. Premium Beauty News - The face, the eyes, the lips, the skin. You scope of activity is quite comprehensive! Nicole Masson - We are indeed present in all the segment of colour cosmetics, which does not necessarily mean that our development strategy is uniform. It is clear, for example, that depending of times, consumers will prefer to highlight their eyes rather than their lips and conversely. Today, lipstick has gained considerable importance. As you know, it’s our flagship product and we have observed, for example, the enormous impact created by the launch of the Lady Gaga lipstick whose ""sharp"" pink shade almost started a new global trend. But we also focus a lot on the face, especially recently, with the help of Mickey Contractor, a renowned make-up Artist who has become very popular thanks to his talents and the textures he uses to impart the face of Bollywood actresses with that so distinctive matte and soft touch. In fact, there too, we created a whole collection of products associated to his talents. Premium Beauty News -  This kind of ""marketing coup"" has truly become one of MAC’s hallmarks! Nicole Masson - Yes, indeed! But it’s in the logic of things. Women are fond of new colours, new textures, new effects, new gestures. Moreover, we nearly have a hundred make-up artists working with us to that effect in the world. At the same time and somehow paradoxically, they want products that last longer. Premium Beauty News - This trend for long-wear products, seems to have become a sustainable trend! Nicole Masson - Yes undoubtedly! And this explains the work we have begun, with this in mind, on our foundations, our lipsticks and our concealers. And it’s not always easy to combine long-wear and quality textures.  In this context, the role of packaging is obviously fundamental. We will also be launching by the end of the year a whole series of innovations in this field."
Towards fairer cosmetics,"It is not enough to be organic or natural. One’s should be perfect! Or, at least, try to be. For example, by eliminating from formulas any suspect (according to the media) ingredient, ensuring that absolutely no animal has been used in the different development stages of the product and, increasingly, in building ethical supply-chains. Opening of the Fair Trade Fortnight in France [1], insiders of the perfumes and cosmetics industry operating in the fair trade business met in Marseille on the 13th of May 2011 to share their experiences. The event was supported by Technico Flor, a fragrance supplier well known for its natural ranges and eco-labels, and, more recently, for its Natfair line, which features natural fragrances and fair trade sourced ingredients. Hosted by the UNIDO (the United Nations for Industrial Development) and Chakib Jenane, the organisation’s Director of Agro-Industries, around Valérie Roubaud (Terre d’Oc), Patrick Collin (Golgemma), François-Patrick Sabater (Technico Flor) and Jerome Vaquier (Ecocert), participants have expressed their interest but also their need for explanations. Actually, what exactly is a trade fair cosmetic?  It is primarily a product with an ethical approach of trade, including the establishment of a partnership between the mark and some of its suppliers, usually small producers within developing countries. Fair trade is very consistent with the formulation of natural or organic cosmetics, because it fits perfectly in with sustainable development goals. Today certification is growing fast in this area as well. Max Havelaar, has started to certify cosmetic products, the association Bio Partner certifies - with the labels Bio Équitable and Bio Solidaire - various raw materials such as argan or vanilla, and in 2008 Ecocert created the ESR (équitable, solidaire, responsable) organic and fair trade label. This meeting was an opportunity to share everybody’s field experiences. Valérie Roubaud, CEO of Terre d’Oc, described its involvement in Vietnam with concrete and strong social actions, such as health care coverage for all workers. Patrick Collin, Director General of Golgemma, a producer and marketer of essential oils, has presented its personal experience in the economic assistance of small Malagasy producers, thus also allowing them to develop quality products. In the opinion of all participants, fair trade carries strong values that company employees naturally seize. Speakers also noted that this a long-term investment that often requires a mobilization that is more human than financial."
"""The situation in China is still a source of concern"", Alain Grangé Cabane, FÉBÉA ","Premium Beauty News - How important is the cosmetic industry in the French economy? Alain Grangé Cabane - In 2010, the cosmetics and perfume industry remains, with its trade surplus, France’s third exporting sector in net balance [1] ( military weapons excluded) behind aircraft and spacecraft manufacturing and beverages. These excellent results are, among others, due to the attractiveness of French products, recognized for their safety and quality, and for their innovative nature. Premium Beauty News - Did the block put on the registration of files in China have major economic consequences for French companies? Alain Grangé Cabane - Undoubtedly, consequences for companies exporting to China are important. The blockage, which began on 1 April 2010, will weigh on sales in 2011 and even in 2012, since exports to China have not yet fully recovered. Premium Beauty News - While the situation seems to be slowly improving, are there still some regulatory grey areas remaining for companies exporting to China? Alain Grangé Cabane - Indeed, the situation is still a source of concern. Renewals of authorization for already marketed products, with a nearing expiring time limit (four year validity), are resuming at a regular pace. It is the same for so-called ""non specific"" products (shower gel, shampoo...) as opposed to products with a ""specific"" purpose (sun care, deodorant, slimming...) according to Chinese regulations. For new products and for some of the so-called ""specific"" products (e.g. products for babies or pregnant women), the situation remains critical, since the notion of ""new ingredient"" is not clarified to date, with the result that product registration applications are always refused. Premium Beauty News - What are the most promising export markets for French products? What are the French companies most favoured areas? Alain Grangé Cabane - Europe remains the main export zone since in 2010 it accounted for 64% of French sales: 53% of our exports go to EU member countries (with a growth of +3.8%), and 11% in Europe to non EU member countries. The best performance for 2010 concerned the Latin American region, since an increase of 24.5% in exports was recorded. The strong growth of Brazil (+40%) was a pleasant surprise too, as well as the one of other Latin American countries overall (Uruguay, Mexico, Argentina). Regarding the top 10 ""customer"" countries of ""Made in France"" cosmetics and perfumes, they are by order: Germany (a customary leader), the UK, Spain, USA, Italy, Russia, Belgium, Singapore, Switzerland and the UAE. To note however that in the case of Singapore, products are mainly transiting before they reach their final country of destination in Asia. In conclusion, an overall recovery is clearly noticeable compared to 2009. Premium Beauty News - What markets are the most difficult to access? Alain Grangé Cabane - We’ve already mentioned the case of China, of course... Otherwise, we can name Japan, for quasi-drugs, the USA and Canada for OTC/therapeutic products. Finally, we are closely following the case of Israel, as the authorities have embarked on the drafting of a new regulation, which turns out being for the time being, a clumsy interpretation of the European Regulation. The project, originally scheduled for June 2011, could not be applied by companies, as it stands. The FÉBÉA and the CTPA (Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association which was approved by the FÉBÉA) immediately alerted Israeli authorities. The implementation has therefore been postponed to a later date and discussions with European authorities are underway to shed light on the differences between the European Regulation and the Israeli project. Premium Beauty News - It’s been nearly a year since you were granted the ISO 9001 certification for the management of the issuing of CFS (Certificates of Free Sale). Have you already reaped some benefits from these lengthy procedures? Alain Grangé Cabane - Absolutely. After a year of work, we obtained this certification allowing us to guarantee the issuance quality of FÉBÉA-CFS to exporters, bearing in mind that CFS are mandatory to export to 59 countries. But most interesting was the reaction of authorities of countries requesting the CFS. They greatly appreciated this initiative and congratulated the FÉBÉA for the pledge of seriousness it represented."
"“Towards a busy second semester,” Daniel Saclier, Guerlain","Premium Beauty News - After last year’s euphoria, it seems that there are signs of a slump in demand. What is your insight on this? Daniel Saclier - First, we must clarify what you mean by a ""slump"" in demand...  I would like to emphasise on the fact that the trend in the perfume / cosmetic business in France remains dynamic versus 2010: growth figures have always been between 2 and 4%. During the first half of 2011 the stock replenishment operations were terminated for our basic packaging products. We achieved a good level of sales during this period. Our turnover is also on a good trend, with new launches (Shalimar Initial, Rouge Automatique) and the support of key franchises such as Terracotta, Idylle ... The second semester will also be active, but essentially focused on the launch of new products, thus contributing to supporting our growth. Premium Beauty News - What were the highlights in recent months in terms of product launches? Daniel Saclier - The first half of 2011 generated quite a lot of activity for Guerlain teams and this whatever the marketing axis concerned. Regarding skin care products, let’s mention: the launch of new day creams in the new Abeille Royale line, in the wake of the successful launch of the serum, the launch of eye care creams for our Orchidée Impériale premium line, and eventually the new generation of products in the 2011 Whitening Collection for the Asian markets. Regarding perfumes: a major initiative in our historic franchise, with the launch of Shalimar Initial. Our in-house perfume creator, Thierry Wasser has revisited this iconic perfume to target a younger population. Eventually, as far as make-up is concerned: the re-launch of Terracotta, Lingerie De Peau (our expertise in foundation), and currently, a major new initiative, the launch of Guerlain’s new lipstick, Le Rouge Automatique. Premium Beauty News - How are you dealing with sustainable development issues? Daniel Saclier - At Guerlain, we are fully aware of our responsibilities in order to address these environmental challenges.  This is the reason why a real sustainable development strategy has been implemented and integrated into the brand’s global vision since several years now. In this context, one of our goals is to constantly anticipate regulations to adapt our tools and processes. Thus, the environmental impact of our packaging is an issue we are working on, eco-design being a key point of our approach. Our Marketing, Purchasing and Development teams have been fully trained on this issue and we systematically measure the environmental impact of our new products. Finally, we have set up guidelines on a number of parameters (equipments, separability, volumes) and we will continue to actively work on these items in the future. We do not wish to communicate widely on these topics because we believe that the implementation of such an approach is part of our duty as a responsible company. However, we will inform our customers about our operations in the course our product launches. Premium Beauty News - The make-up segment and its products clearly appears to be driving the cosmetic market. For Guerlain, how much do they account for and how is the future of these products perceived? Daniel Saclier - Yes, undoubtedly the make-up sector and its products is a major axis for Guerlain as part of its policy to attract new customers. Such flagship products as Terracotta, Météorites, Rouge G, Lingerie De Peau, the collections of eye shadows 4&6, enable us to anchor in the long term our brand image whatever the geographical area concerned."
Japan: what is the impact of disasters on the cosmetics industry?,"Solidarity with the people affected by the disaster was the first response from the cosmetics industry after the giant earthquake and tsunami that struck the northern part of Honshu island on March 11. Of course, Japanese groups strongly responded. Kao opted for product donations and announced it will dispatch to affected areas thousands of soaps, detergents, toothpaste and toothbrushes, as well as sanitary napkins, and diapers, etc.   For its part, Shiseido, the leading Japanese cosmetics company, has announced a donation of 100 million yen (about 830,000 euros) and the shipment of shampoos dry, soaps and hand sanitizers. The L’Oréal group also announced a donation of 100 million yens to the Japanese Red Cross. Canadian retailer Shoppers Drug Mart / Pharmaprix has pledged a US$ 150,000 donation and has launched a special operation for members of its loyalty program. Procter & Gamble, Amway, Temptu, Lush Shu Uemura, Hanae Morris also joined the charity movement. Another emergency for the industry is to respond to the immediate consequences the disaster had on the market. The earthquake and tsunami destroyed or damaged a part of production facilities and infrastructures.  Beyond the area directly affected in the Sendai area, which accounted for 7-8% of the Japanese GDP, the energy crisis consecutive to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant is disrupting the production in much of the country. A month after the earthquake, there were still daily power outages and the problem is still far from being entirely solved. Logistical problems consecutive to the destruction of traffic infrastructures, amplified by the just-in-time organization of the economy, and of course the persistence of the nuclear risk, add up to the difficulties. Economical analyses agree on a drop of the country’s GDP during the April-June quarter.  The most optimistic forecast considers a 0.6% fall, while the worst scenario anticipates a 10% decrease. Most economists predict a return to growth for the July-September quarter, a real reconstruction-driven recovery being expected for the fourth quarter. The disaster immediately impacted Japanese companies. Shiseido just announced a 62% drop in profits during its latter fiscal quarter (3.8 billion yens compared to 10 billion during the same quarter last year), a fall that is mainly due to the additional costs resulting from the March 11 earthquake. However, global consequences should be limited. Of course, Japan remains the second largest market for cosmetics, but the penetration rate of foreign firms is relatively low and mostly confined to the high-end segments. Major world exporters should therefore absorb the shock, even if the travel retail business and sales of luxury goods will be affected initially. The global cosmetics industry could instead experienced sourcing difficulties with ingredients and intermediate products manufactured in Japan. Indeed, a consequence of the technological advance in surface treatment acquired by the Japanese industry during the 1990s, 30 to 40% of treated pigments and of certain powders (including titanium oxides) currently used by the global makeup industry is supplied from Japanese companies such as Nippon Shikizai, Miyoshi Kasei (see update below) and Nikko Rica. Although the production facilities of these suppliers were not affected directly by the earthquake and the tsunami, they are impacted by the organizational disorganisation throughout Japan. Even when the Japanese industry will have solved these problems, companies will have to reassure their customers about the safety of their products. From this point of view, the lack of responsibility of Japanese authorities is quite puzzling since, according to the Union European, they do not assess the level of radioactivity contamination on exported products. Recognizing that the risk of contamination is not limited to food, DKSH, a leading distributor of Asian specialty chemicals, has announced the setting up of an internal task force responsible for collecting all data on possibly concerned products and to anticipate potential regulatory changes. However, so far, no contamination of non-food goods from Japan was detected by importing countries. In a statement dated March 30, 2011, the Japan Cosmetic Industry Association (JCIA), the organization representing Japanese cosmetics makers, said that air quality in production facilities is usually controlled. The association, however, admits that ""slightly contaminated drinking water"" can be used in the industrial process, but that the doses involved do not present any danger to health. But in a market consisting of highly substitutable products, more guarantees may be necessary in order to convince consumers!   Shiseido thus announced in a statement dated April 22 and published on its website that, following tests conducted in collaboration with a third party, there was no radiation detected on their products made in Japan. On the demand side, it is obvious that the short-term priorities of Japanese consumers will be redirected. What is absolutely unknown is the long-term impact of these disasters, especially of the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi that directly unsettle the Japanese production and consumption model. The need to share electric power resources, as well as TV reports on supply shortages affecting certain products and consumers testimonials saying that, after all, one’s can easily live with less superfluous stuff, might transform Japanese consumers. It remains certain that Japan, which has already overcome other rough crises, still has the capacity to surprise us."
"Joël Palix, Clarins, ""Make-up is the fastest growing segment""","Premium Beauty News - After last year’s euphoria, demand appears to be weakening. What is your view on this? Joël Palix - We aren’t noticing any weakening in perfumes, consumption is on the rise for all mature, emerging and travel retail markets. Perfume remains a pleasure and gift product. Premium Beauty News - The industry recently became aware of the over abundance of perfume launches, what is the situation? Joël Palix - Distributors are being more selective in the choice of novelties and manufacturers have begun to better plan the number of market launches. On this first half of 2011 there are fewer major launches but brands continue to bring their classics to life with line extensions, flankers or new presentations. Premium Beauty News - What were the highlights in recent months for Clarins in terms of product launches? Joël Palix - Clarins launched a major innovation, Vital Light Day. For Clarins Fragrance Group (CFG), we launched Womanity last fall, and the new Swarovski brand with a fragrance and a line of make-up jewels called Aura. The first results concerning these launches are positive. Premium Beauty News -  How are you dealing with the green wave which has a tendency to submerge the whole beauty ? Joël Palix - The Clarins Group is particularly sensitive to this issue because of our historical connection to plant-derived treatments. Christian Courtin, our CEO and son of the founder of the Group is a strong supporter of sustainable development and keeps us very much mobilized. Clarins sponsors the Solar Impulse aircraft and conducts many sustainable development initiatives with its ranges. Kibio, a new brand of the Group is involved in high quality cosmetics. Clarins Fragrance Group has innovated for its last two launches (Aura and Womanity) by choosing to create a fully rechargeable range and by setting up a eco-design process that makes the sorting and recycling of components easier. Our historic commitment to environment based on the Mugler Source, thus finds its natural extension. Premium Beauty News - The make-up sector actually appears to be the one driving the cosmetic market. What does it represent for your group and how do you see the future of these products? Joël Palix - So far, make-up is actually the segment that is growing the most rapidly in the selective market. It is the one being the closest to fashion, trends, immediate pleasure. Clarins has a highly developed range in this segment. For Clarins Fragrance Group, we are experimenting with Mugler and Swarovski shorter ranges. Barriers to entry are considerable and we are very careful with our development but opportunities do exist particularly in Asia and in the Middle East."
"Max, the magic of make-up!","Two months from now, this unusual make-up creator will be stealing the show again at the next MakeUp in Paris event. The two main highlights being, first his participation to the round table focusing on the creative process, trends and the future of make-up, and then an exceptional animation, Friday morning on the theme of foundation. Premium Beauty news - Since our last interview, many new events have arisen! Herlant Max - Yes, several new collaborations: one already concluded with the Rexam Group, where we are focusing on finding new gestures, and others to come with a manufacturer specialised in formulations and a brand. Premium Beauty News - Make-up gestures! Always your magician side? Max Herlant - That’s true! We have already talked about this. Magic has been and remains one of the engines that drive me. But, again, make-up has nothing to do with magic even if it is true that people ask us to create illusion. It also requires a precise gesture. Premium Beauty News - You had expressed the wish last year to take part again in a television show has this project seen the light? Max Herlant - It’s still a bit too early to go into details but I did take part in the first sequences of a show dedicated to well-being and for which I will be the host. Premium Beauty News - You seems to be quite critical about current make-up trends. Max Herlant - That’s true! I find that globally, brands have cold feet in terms of innovation and that this trend towards product mass consumption is no help to boost the sector. Make-up, should be fun. A few professionals, of course, are standing out such as MakeUp For Ever who is really playing the card of innovation, Nicolas Degennes who is launching superb collections and Fred Farrugia who still astonishes us with his visionary side. Premium Beauty News - You are still involved in making-up a lot of showbusiness people and you’ll be in front of the cameras soon. Max Herlant - Make-up is actually part of the show! But constraints imposed by today’s cameras obviously have nothing to do with those of a few years ago. Hence the importance of mastering new HD textures. Techniques that can also easily be applied to everyday make-up. I am actually working a lot on this concept. Premium Beauty News - There is no need to dollop loads of foundation to hide skin imperfections anymore? Max Herlant - This will be the focus of one of my speeches at the next MakeUp in Paris. It is clear that women need to reconcile with foundations. Many of them use it incorrectly. I will try and demonstrate that it is a fantastic product to work with provided that one knows how to use it. It obviously plays an important part in rejuvenation and some foundations have almost the same effects as skincare creams."
"Nail Polish: between ""fastdry"" and ""longlasting""!","Premium Beauty News - The nail polish is in full boom. How do you position yourself in terms of marketing proposals? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Nail polish is, to colour cosmetics what handbags are for trendy looks: the accessory that will make all the difference. So that women can take pleasure when choosing and using their polish we need to work on both formulations and shades. It is all about finding a optimal definition of colors, of always gaining in comfort of application, staying power, gloss and drying time. Anticipating what will be the ""it-polish"" in two years... in order to be able to always offer the most appropriate qualities for each market. This is the mission of IL Cosmetics Marketing Team. Premium Beauty News - What are the main demands of your customers in terms of colours and effects. Can we identify main trends? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Innovations coming from our R&D Department allow us to offer qualities suitable for the various markets in which we operate. Overall, however, we notice that our clients chose formulas that offer a good compromise between ""fastdry"" and ""longlasting"". Öko-Test formulas are increasingly required, as is the case in the German market. Nail polish allows women greater eccentricity and originality than an eye shadow or lip gloss. It is a good way of playing with colours. This explains why pallets are nowadays extremely vast: from yellow to green, everything is permitted! Concerning effects, there is a strong demand for pearlescent, even if creams are timeless. Premium Beauty News - Where does your inspiration come from? What will the future trends and innovations be like? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Our inspiration stems from an alchemy between couture trends, forecasts from style agencies, innovations tapped from other sectors and the strong presence of our sales representatives on the global marketplace. Thus, our customers were able to discover our latest collections at the Cosmoprof Bologna 2011. For summer 2012 the tone is set with a palette ranging from cold-warmed tones with fresh and vivid touches to more-sophisticated shades pushed to the limits."
Professional skin care market rebounds in Europe and the US,"While Japan remained flat with 0.1% growth, a rise in visits to professional outlets for skin care treatments gave way to sales growth for the professional skin care products market in the US and Europe.  According Kline & Company’s recently released study [1], Europe posted a 3.0% increase in 2010, following a 3.3% decline in 2009, and sales in the United States increased by 2.7% in 2010. Growth in the US was stimulated by brands of medical care providers, such as SkinMedica and SkinCeuticals, which posted double-digit gains.  Market leader Obagi, entrenched in the medical care providers segment, maintained its leading position in the U.S. market, experiencing a 13% sales gain for the year.  In Europe and Japan, Guinot was the leading brand in 2010. Spas and salons remains the largest purchase channel in the United States, but Kline says their market share is declining due to stiff competition from other channels and a market increasingly focusing on facial treatments. Beauty institutes are the leaders in both Europe with 59% and Japan with nearly 68% of market share. “While some brands are well established in a single professional channel, such as Sothys and SkinMedica, an increasing number of professional skin care brands adopt multi-channel strategies,” the consulting and research firm comments. Marketers also want to appeal to a wider group of consumers, such as teenagers, mature clients, pregnant women, and men, by expanding their portfolio with specifically targeted product lines. Introducing smaller sizes of products for retail to appeal to a more frugal consumer would be another strategy to consider, suggests Karen Doskow, Industry Manager at Kline’s Consumer Products Practice. Over the next five years the market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 4.2% in Europe, 6.7% in the United States, and 2.6% in Japan."

Over 44,000 visitors attended both events, a slight rise compared to the 43.669 visitors recorded in 2010.  Besides Germany (25,000 visitors), attendants mainly came from Austria, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The international visitorship rose to 42 %. While Vivaness remains a small event, compared to Biofach (200 exhibitors from a total of 2,544), the exhibition is the leading event in Europe as far as natural and organic cosmetic products are concerned.  This year, the 200 exhibitors (183 in 2010) came from 22 countries (21 in 2010) including Germany (83), France (38), Italy (31), Austria (8) and The Netherlands (5). Every year, those interested in organic farming, and natural clothes and personal care products, including a number of politicians from Germany and abroad, meet in Nuremberg on the occasion of Biofach and Vivaness.  The two German trade fairs have grown as Europe trendsetting event in the organic sector.  No surprise that key players on this market have chosen Vivaness for launching their innovations or announcing their strategic moves. This year, the organisers have put the light on innovative and creative products in all segments of the market. A Novelty Stand gathered 67 innovations from skin care, body and hair care, perfumes and wellness to decorative cosmetics.  Baby care and kids products were especially prominent.  With its Babycare line, for instance, Töpfer GmbH showcased the first baby’s oil bath with 95 % organic olive oil. Other illustrations are the allergens-free Argital baby care line of NCM GmbH or Logona’s children’s face paints. As far as ingredients are concerned, several innovations also struck the visitor’s eye: native oceanic collagen and plain seawater (oceanBASIS GmbH), sage, grape, lavender, juniper berry, cypress, rose, sallow thorn, ginger and lime (Primavera Life GmbH), argan oil, baobab oil and sea buckthorn (Provida Organics Kosmetik & Umwelt GmbH), mango butter, acai berry, cranberry and pomegranate (Droste-Laux Naturkosmetik GmbH & Co. KG), oat and evening primrose (Eubiona) and lemongrass (Ortscheid GmbH). In the BREEZE section, Vivaness also showcased innovative products and concepts, trendy niche brands and young labels, selected by experts from the natural cosmetics sector.  The section included products such as: – Intelligent Nutrients a comprehensive line of hair, skin and body care products based on a seed oils of black cumin, pumpkin, raspberry, red grape and cranberry, designed by Aveda’s founder, Horst Rechelbacher,
– Swedish brand Estelle & Thild, proposing cleansing, day care, night care and eye care products,
– Câlinesse (Newcos SA, Switzerland & France), a certified beauty care range for women and babies with donkey’s milk,
– Nvey Eco, an Australian range of organic and natural decorative cosmetics and compostable make-up accessories. The harmonization of the different standards for natural and organic personal care products was a hot topic at Vivaness this year. BDIH, Cosmebio, Ecocert, ICEA and the Soil Association - the five founding organisations - have officially announced the launch of the COSMOS-standard certification. In parallel, NATRUE announced its partnership with NSF International to develop the first U.S. official national standard for natural cosmetics.  NATRUE also staged a demonstration of its QR tag, an electronic system allowing fast display of information on products on mobile phones. As far as growth is concerned, there are good perspectives for natural and organic cosmetics.  Experienced players are publishing good forecasts and new-entrants continue to blossom on the market. According to a recent study by Kline & Company [1], the natural cosmetics market will continue to grow steadily in Asia, Europe and the USA until 2014. The Asian markets will achieve two-figure growth rates and will reach a volume of 14.8 billion US dollars. Sales of over 6.3 billion US dollars are forecasted for Europe in the next five years and 5.8 billion US dollars for the USA. Regarding Germany in 2010, more customers switched to natural cosmetics and sales grew by 11 % to 795 million euros. According to Naturkosmetik Konzepte the market share of natural cosmetics reached 6.2 % in 2010. Within this positive context, today’s main challenge for certified brands is to be able to communicate on their added value and their benefits compared to conventional cosmetics. The next Vivaness (and BioFach) will be hold on 15-18 February 2012 at Nuremberg fairground."

Marionnaud is gearing up for revival in France,"In a selective French market on the rise for the first time since two years (+2.6% in value and +1.6% in volume), Marionnaud’s results also rose in 2010. The increased in attendance (+ 120,000 customers) has taken sales volume to a higher level, with a 2.4% rise. In value, however, the first network of perfume and beauty parlours in France (567 outlets and 704 cabins) suffered from its low cost policy with a limited growth of 0.8%. With a leap forward of 7.8% in volume in the make-up segment, the brand exceeds the performances of the French market (+5.4%), even if again, the low cost policy reduces the performance in value: 5,3% compared to the 5.3% of the market. Moreover, with a market share of 26.7%, Marionnaud remains the market leader for skincare products. ""We’ve increased the number of transactions performed on competitive segments of the market. These good results were achieved with no growth of the park but with more involved teams"", explained Miek Vercouteren, CEO of Marionnaud France. Marionnaud considers that its good results in make-up and skincare, ""segments where beauty advice and more globally customer relations are a determining factor"", highlight the strength of its teams of beauty consultants. For the brand, this is due to both the very low turnover of employees (-10%) and to the training program implemented within the Marionnaud Academy, who welcomed more than 2,000 consultants and beauticians in 2010. This sense of service was specially acclaimed by consumers who elected Marionnaud ""Retail outlet of the Year2010"" in the Perfume category as part of the annual survey conducted by the Dutch company Q&A Research&Consultancy. They evaluated the ""Expertise of the staff"" and ""Friendliness of staff"" as being the two main assets of Marionnaud’s outlets, with a score of respectively, 7.15 and 7.36/10. In 2010 Marionnaud’s priority was clearly to win new customers by engaging a fight on prices. The company sees no problem in the fact that the increase in attendance was accompanied by a drop in the average basket in value. ""Beyond the advice and service we provide our customers with, we commit ourselves in practicing all year long the best price in outlets, so that all women have a chance of feeling beautiful every day, whatever their budget,"" explained Sacha Tikhomiroff, Trade Director for Marionnaud. Depending of the outlet in 2010, the number of customers considering Marionnaud as offering the best value for money has increased by 6% over the previous year (The 2009-2010 Picture Price barometer of the OC&C firm on the price positioning of different outlets, published late December 2010). On the network side, the priority for 2010 was the renovation and standardization of the parlours. Nearly one Marionnaud outlet out of two has a parlour, which makes of the brand, with its 704 cabins, the first beauty parlour network of in France. The concept was globally rethought to make it more flexible and more modern. This renovation plan is continuing in 2011 with the launch of a harmonization program for the outlets network on the entire territory ""focusing on a new identity, suitable to all surfaces, and a revamped, more pleasant and efficient customer path."" Marionnaud will also resume its expansion policy by announcing the opening of more than twenty new stores in 2011, with to top it all off, the recruitment of hundreds of sales consultants."
"William Koeberlé, FFPS: ""The selective channel has returned to growth""","Premium Beauty News - As soon as you took office at the head of the FFPS you had to handle the issue on the renewal of the exemption regulation for the selective distribution. What is it about exactly? William Koeberlé - It was my very first priority. When Thibault Ponroy left the presidency of the FFPS, we were negotiating with the European authorities the renewal of the exemption for selective perfumery. Maintaining a coherent framework on in this matter was crucial for us. Selective distribution is first a means for market regulation. It enables high-end perfume and cosmetics brands to select their distribution network on the basis of quality criteria such as for example the shopping environment, and customer service at the time of sale. But in the end, the consumer must have the feeling he gets his money’s worth, specially through a range of services and advice which are offered to him in point of sales. Among issues to address, there was the question of Internet sales. It was not, of course, the question of prohibiting online sales of perfumes and luxury cosmetics, but to make sure that they did actually meet quality criteria that compared to those found in stores. The market needs rules that make it as efficient as possible. Premium Beauty News - And how is this selective market performing today? William Koeberlé - We returned to growth in 2010, both in value (+2.6%) and volume (+1.6%) according to figures provided by the NPD. This is true for all market segments, except for perfume whose sales volumes are still on a declining trend (-0.6%) in spite of an increase of 2.1% in value. It is colour cosmetics that is the fastest growing segment with +5.4% in value and also in number of units sold. Skincare is also very dynamic: + 2.1% in value and 3% in volume. I’m pretty optimistic about the future and confident on the constant innovation spirit of brands which helps them to offer products that meet the needs of increasingly demanding customers. Premium Beauty News - There is a significant development of private brands. How do you explain this phenomenon which hitherto originated rather more from mass distribution? William Koeberlé - Private labels complement traditional skin care and make-up brands. They have their place on the shelves next to must-have best-sellers or original brands, with a true story, that help create differentiation. Private brands are actually meeting a growing need emerging from the market: Affordable quality. As such they are particularly attractive to young consumers, but not only. These ranges are an important element to help maintain the attractiveness of selective distribution. Premium Beauty News - What are your priorities at the head of the FFPS? William Koeberlé - My very first priority, as you understood concerned negotiations on the exemption regulation for selective distribution. Then I wish we could move forward, with our suppliers on the challenges pertaining to logistics, and on closely related issues such as sustainability. We have thought up specifications on this subject and we have proposed to the FEBEA (French trade association representing manufacturers specialised in beauty products) who represents our contacts within the brands, to start discussing this issue with us. We have everything to gain, suppliers and distributors, by working together on common specifications for logistics. Indeed, shortcomings and a lack of efficiency in the supply chain, don’t bring value added to anyone. In practice we must take up a common language for flows, we must agree on common methods for calculating greenhouse gases emissions, for harmonized traceability methods, anti-theft procedures, electronic data interchange (EDI) and the creation of electronic catalogues with standardized products sheets. Eventually the third priority is our collective agreement and, through it, the key issue of trades in the perfume industry. Here again we touch issues related to the training of our employees and counselling, but also products, and the question of quality service provided to our customers."
"“The future of make-up is in new materials,” Nicolas Degennes, Givenchy","After more than ten years as Givenchy’s Colours and Make-up Creative Director, Nicolas Degennes, still hopes ""to surprise and be surprised"". He strongly believes that ""the future for make-up is still looking bright. In a world of exposure, it has become unavoidable. We are going to add to colour cosmetics skincare notions for an improved comfort and surface correction. The future of make-up lies in science which is evolving faster and faster!"" In 1999 Nicolas Degennes arrives at Parfums Givenchy. ""These ten years have been a collective adventure, he explains. We all ’professionally’ grew up together.  I also discovered a world I did not know.  New concepts for me: business, profitability that becomes challenging. I was compelled to understand the expectations, differences and evolutions. I learn a lot.” And he learns fast.  So, for Givenchy too, this adventure is bearing fruit. Representing a modest activity at the time, make-up now contributes to more than 20% of the brand’s turnover. For Nicolas Degennes, to work for a brand such as Givenchy means: ""Being aware of what is a luxury brand. Respecting its codes and identity while insuring its evolution.” ""When I took over from Olivier Echaudemaison, stresses Degennes, I didn’t specifically know Givenchy’s make-up. The 4 Gs had disappeared. I wanted to rediscover the codes of the House to make sure it was still moving ahead."" But there was a life before Givenchy.  And Nicolas Degennes’s success is rooted in these years before. He enters the world of make-up in 1981 during a stay in the U.S.  At the age of 18, Nicolas becomes the official make-up Artist of the American make-up brand On Stage. In 1985 he decides to join the Parisian school of Christian Chauveau, headed by Dany Sanz, the founder of Make-Up For Ever. He will then grow a passion for stage or film make-up, special effects, body art, transformations and the discovery of new materials... End of 1985, he joins the TV channel Canal +, which was just founded in France. An opportunity to meet artists, agents, and directors in an atmosphere of freedom and creation... He suggests pop singer Mylène Farmer to test another look and successfully dares the pallor and the strangeness of a white make-up. As the Canal+ Chief makeup artist, Nicolas Degennes takes in charge events such as Les Césars (French movie awards),and The Cannes Film Festival.  “I have a compulsive greed for images, he explains. And the channel decided to entrust me with the responsibility of its image. Against all odds, I decided to dress up the whole channel in black & white.” And it worked! When he arrives at Givenchy, Nicolas Degennes strives to rediscover the legacy of Monsieur Hubert de Givenchy through cosmetics.  With Le Make Up, he revives the brand’s initials and assumes this couture legacy of which he tries to transcribe the contents and philosophy. During ten years one collection follows another: Délice de Chocolat, Artycolor, without forgetting Diamantassiez the concept of jewel make-up, The Poetics, etc. There were also non-standard creations like Baby Lips, ""a material-free colour developer just a natural reaction, a rush of blood to the lips.""  We can also name Lash Pearls: ""This was my first go at polymers. I love transformation. Makeup is not meant to be serious."" And of course, Phenomen’Eyes ""a revolution, a technical performance,"" Nicolas Degennes insists, ""with the famous patented spherical brush, that loads the eyelashes, even the shortest ones, even the ones in the inner corner of the eye, for a broad panoramic and very graphic effect."" The future of make-up, according to Nicolas Degennes ""will obviously come from new materials. A make-up to better suit people all day long. We’ll have to invent new words for new products. Conceive make-up differently."" Nicolas Degennes will participate in the round table on the theme of art direction on June 23, 2011 during MakeUp in Paris in co-operation with MUP magazine."
"Marionnaud, Douglas, Limoni voted Europe’s best perfume retailers of the year","The survey ""Retailer of the Year"" was created in 2003 by Q&A Research & Consultancy, a research and consultancy agency headquartered in the Netherlands and specializing in qualitative and quantitative surveys on consumer habits. The survey is conducted every year using a similar methodology in 10 European countries: The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and Portugal. The surveys are conducted on different sectors of distribution, and are base on panels of consumers who are asked to evaluate chain stores. The evaluation is based on average score obtained upon nine criteria: assortment, price level, customer friendliness, service, atmosphere, innovation, expertise of staff, promotions and price/quality ratio. Overall and for all retailers, the “customer friendliness” criterion is the second most important for customers with 14.4%, behind the ""value for money"" criterion (32.2%). As far as France is concerned, the survey was conducted between June and December 2010 on the basis of 46,520 consumer evaluations concerning 66 different chain retailers. In the “Perfumery” category, 3,142 consumers have rated the 3 main actors of the market. First on 8 of 9 criteria, Marionnaud was awarded the title “Retailer of the year” followed by Nocibé and  Sephora. The retailers obtained the highest scores on the criteria ""Customer friendliness”, with a score of 7.36/10, ""Service"" (7.22) and ""Expertise of staff"" (7.15). Marionnaud and Sephora get the same score with respect to their ""innovation"" ability. Among the 66 chain retailers evaluated in France, in all business sectors, Marionnaud is positioned in the top 15 on the criteria ""Assortment"", ""Customer friendliness"", ""Expertise of Staff"", ""Innovation"", ""Price/Quality ratio "", ""Promotions,"" ""Service"" and ""Atmosphere of the store."" In the “Health & Beauty” category, however, it is Yves Rocher that ranks first with an excellent overall performance since the retailers reaches the third position of the general ranking, just behind fashion retailer M&S Mode (1st) and Ikea (2nd). In the rest of Europe, Douglas, was awarded the title in the ""Perfumery"" category in Germany, while DM-Drogeriemarkt ranked firts in the ""Drogerie"" (Drugstore) category. In Italy, Limoni took the first place in the ""Profumeria"" (Perfumery) category and Bottega Verde got the highest score in the ""Erboristeria"" (Heath and beauty botanicals) category. In Belgium, Ici Paris XL ranked first in the “Perfumery” category, together with Kruidvat in the “Beauty and Health” category.  The Belgian chain retailers also took the first place in The Netherlands, while it is Dirx Drogist that got the highest scores in the ""Drogisterij"" (Drugstore) category. Marionnaud was selected again in Switzerland in the ""Perfumery"" category. There was no “Perfumery” category in the survey conducted in Spain."
MakeUp in Paris hoists the colours,"The first conference will focus on the influence of 3D technologies in make-up and, more globally on our approach to colour, on products, textures, but also to everything concerning distribution and communication, from packaging to advertising.  The second will focus on a historical approach of colour in make-up and will address colours’ interaction in fashion, body and make-up. Olivier Guillemin, who was born in Paris in 1961, is also a fashion designer, Secretary General of Intercolor, an international Association of creative research on colour trends in fashion and environment, and Creative Director and co-founder, along with Olivier Védrine, of the design, architecture and scenography agency [o,o]. For more than 10 years, he has been involved in Japan as a colour, design and fashion artistic consultant, for Shiseido, and more specifically today for the Maquillage brand. Olivier Guillemin has chaired the French Committee of Colour since 1993.  Stylists, designers, art directors, visual artists, researchers, journalists and even writers gathered in this original club form a prospective breeding ground, to serve design and colour. Together, they give thought to the evolution and expression of colours linked to lifestyles. Twice a year, the French Committee of Colour imagines a chromatic evolution of the environment with the publishing of a colour range that enjoys a wide audience among trade shows and member companies. According to Olivier Guillemin, coulour acts as a sense enhancer.  Colour is there to serve both, aesthetics and function, it attracts the look, but carries within itself very strong sensory connotations hinged on touch, hearing, smell, taste. “To awaken one’s sense, is indeed to be sure of offering that little extra bit of soul to colours that speaks to our conscience and unconscious mind. To observe to better create, but it’s also to feel in order to better imagine.” The second edition of MakeUp in Paris will be held at the Carrousel du Louvre on June 23 and 24, 2011."
Blogs more efficient than magazines to drive beauty purchases,"According to a research jointly led by PR agency DeVries and online participatory information network BlogHer on the influence of media on women’s shopping behaviors when it comes to beauty and personal care products, blogs are two times more likely (63%) than magazines (26%) to have inspired a beauty product purchase over the last six months. The survey was conducted through the BlogHer online network on October 2010 on a sample of 1,074 women across the United States, who had to answer 25 questions aiming at measuring the relative influence traditional media and blogs have on the products women purchase and brand preference. Women in the sample were significantly younger than the average U.S. population: a majority (48%) were 18-34, 31% were 35-44 and 13% were 45-54.  However, it “mirrors the general online population when it comes to attitudes about beauty products,” say the authors. ""We’ve long believed at DeVries that trusted blogs have as much influence on purchase decisions as traditional media outlets, both inside the beauty category and out. We just didn’t have data to confirm what we felt intuitively to be true,” said Stephanie Smirnov, President ofDeVries Public Relations. “Our research partnership with BlogHer was forged to validate our hypothesis about blogger influence on beauty purchase decisions, and it’s been extremely illuminating."" Actually, women appear just as likely to trust the beauty product advice from a parenting (43%), health (42%) or lifestyle (37%) blog, as from a beauty and fashion blog (43%). Furthermore, when seeking recommendations about beauty product, women turn to and trust “familiar” bloggers more than store websites, social networks or message boards. However, while women tend to research online they continue to buy offline.  According to the survey, U.S. women prefer buying beauty products offline. “The brick and mortar store (offline) beats online shopping for beauty products by a margin of four to one.  And this ratio extends across all beauty verticals; cosmetics, skin care or hair care. Women want a 3-D experience when it comes to beauty products; they have to see it, feel it and touch it,” comment the authors. Cost and efficiency were cited as the top reasons for preferring online shopping, although most women (39%) still said they would prefer to purchase their cosmetics in a real store. “Doing a deeper dive into the beauty product segment, specifically, revealed that even when purchasing ultimately takes place offline, online word-of-mouth maintains its powerful influence,” added Elisa Camahort Page, co-founder of BlogHer, Inc. The full results of the survey can be found at: www.blogher.com/beauty-eye-blog-holder-0"
Make-up to drive Indian cosmetics maket,"Amid changing lifestyle and increasing consumer awareness, India cosmetics market now provides lucrative opportunities for existing market players as well as new comers. In a new research report titled “Indian Cosmetic Sector Analysis (2009-2012)”, RNCOS explains that the cosmetic industry is among the most dynamic sectors in India and that colour cosmetics is the segment that should experiment the fastest growth, with a compound annual growth rate of around 12% during 2010-2013. “Main reasons for the growth of the colour cosmetics segment are increased access to branded products through specialist retailers, supermarkets, and increasing population of working ladies in the country,” explains RNCOS. According to UbiFrance, the French trade commission, lipsticks and nail polishes account for 60% of make-up sales in India. Hindustan Lever Limited brand, Lakmé, which was created at the end of the 1950s, remains India’s leading beauty brand.  M.A.C. (Estée Lauder) et Lancôme (L’Oréal) are among the leading foreign brands in the luxury make-up market segment. Along with colour cosmetics, the entire beauty and personal care market in India should sustain its upward growth trend in the coming years. The potential for growth is huge as most product categories only have low penetration rates within the Indian population.  If 90% of Indian households use soaps, only 50% use toothpastes or shampoos and 23% only use skincare products. According to RNCOS, even Indian males are showing a growing interest to cosmetics and the fast emerging men’s grooming products market is boosting the cosmetic sector.  The mindset of male consumers is changing due to the increasing influence of media and western exposure."
Kanebo brings Tokyo women to light,"While many national economies in Asia are growing at a fast pace, Japan, the most developed country in the region, has been trapped in a protracted recession for years.  Despite this general context, the beauty and fashion sectors remained dynamic. In order to better understand what fuels Japanese women’s interest in this areas, Kanebo has carried out a lifestyle survey on women in Tokyo and in four other major cities in East Asia: Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei, and Seoul. According to the Japanese cosmetics maker, women in Tokyo place greater importance on their “hobbies” than women in the four other Asian cities covered by the survey. On the work front, they tend to emphasize “personal relationships” and “work-life balance”, while women in the other four cities, emphasize “high income” and “personal development.” On the one hand, Tokyo women stress personal relationships and are somewhat less concerned with their femininity than women in the other four big Asian cities.  When asked what sort of person they wished to be, Tokyo women most frequently responded, “someone considerate to others.” In contrast, women in the other four cities tended to reply “cheerful” and “feminine.” On the other hand, Tokyo women like to be praised for their appearance, particularly for being “stylish” and having “good taste.” In contrast, women in Beijing, Taipei, and Seoul like most to be praised for their “work ability.”  Significantly, only Tokyo women react very positively to being described as “kawaii” (cute). Respondents in all five cities named their “eyes” as their main “attractive features,” followed by skin. The frequency of makeup use differs considerably from one city to another. In stark contrast to other cities, 80 percent of Tokyo women and 60 percent of Seoul women use makeup either everyday or five days a week. Tokyo women also use the most makeup items, while Seoul women are the most ardent users of makeup bases. Tokyo women tend to consider makeup as a part of their personal etiquette, a contribution to the quality of their social image, whereas the Seoul women think of it as a means for “concealing defects.”  Taipei is close to Tokyo in this regard, while women in Shanghai and Beijing seem to use makeup for more various reasons.  “As Japanese women grow older, they may miss out on the pleasure of making up and begin to think of makeup as a social duty,” commented Kanebo’s research team. A comparison of “preferred makeup styles” revealed a preference in Tokyo for “intricate makeup” with an emphasis on lines that look natural and sophisticated at the same time. Women in Seoul, in contrast, embrace different makeup styles ranging from natural to intricate on different occasions, while Taipei women are inclined to the look of “wearing no makeup” at all. When asked to name their favourite colours, all women expressed a preference for pinkish tones. However, for eye shadows, Tokyo women preferred beige and brown shades.  As a whole, foundation is the most important makeup item for the survey respondents. Kanebo plans to continue the survey through the comparison of lifestyles of women in Europe and in North America."
The beauty industry will be green in 2011,"In 2011, cosmetic products will be greener than in 2010. Actually, experts at Mintel Beauty Innovation state the so-called ‘Down to Earth’ trend will increasingly shape the beauty industry. Closely linked to sustainability this key trend addresses the practicalities of making and marketing green beauty, and is a continuation of the trend to greener product formulas that was important in 2010. According to the market research firm, 13% of skincare, hair care and cosmetic products launched in 2010 made the paraben-free claim (up 5% from 2008), while almost 9% of made organic claim (twice as many as in 2007).  The all-natural claim was found in fewer than 3% of launches in 2010. “Paraben-free claims actually outpaced organic and all-natural claims in new skincare, hair care and cosmetics launches in 2010 [1], backing up Mintel’s Nu Natural trend that predicted that brands would emphasize results and free-from claims over certification,” explains Nica Lewis, Head Consultant at Mintel Beauty Innovation. In 2011, “free-from” formulas (“free from parabens”, “free from preservatives”, etc.) should continue to evolve in an effort to avoid petrochemically-derived ingredients. In order to be successful, cosmetics makers wanting to ride the trend will have to learn how to source natural and organic raw materials and how to manage the price pressure due to the varying supply and demand.  They will also have to master the challenges of green chemistry: such as the use of sustainable surfactants, ‘green’ solvents and alternatives to parabens and other preservatives. New skincare products with environmentally-friendly packaging were also up 5% on the previous year - a trend Mintel expects to have real impact in 2011. “2011 will see beauty companies placing increased importance on the environment, focusing on sustainable sourcing with attention to maintaining biodiversity. A renewed emphasis on repackaging to minimize waste will also be a factor,” concludes Lewis."
MakeUp in New York : first edition set for September 2011,"In the wake of the success of MakeUp in Paris, its organizers have announced their intention to duplicate the concept in the USA. The first edition of MakeUp in New York will open its doors on September 14th and 15th, 2011 at Studio 450, ambitioning to be the first trade event in New York exclusively dedicated to the make-up industry suppliers. “Because of its size, the US market is highly attractive. Compared to the parcelling of the European market, it can be considered as the biggest unified market in the world. Due to the high concentration of beauty companies in the area, New York is the best place for suppliers to display and promote their products,” explains Sandra Maguarian, the show manager. “Our aims is to create an event exclusively dedicated to the make-up industry suppliers, which gathers the most innovative and creative products of the make-up universe, and to bring together suppliers, brands and distribution in the very heart of New York,” she adds.

A beautiful Christmas for the beauty industry in Europe?,"Now retailers are fully in the Christmas sales season, leading market research company The NPD Group reports that consumers are spending more on prestige beauty in 2010 in the United Kingdom and in France while Spain and Italy are lagging behind. The UK prestige beauty market (+8,8% in value) [1] is performing better in January-September 2010 than France, which has the next highest growth rate at 3.6%, and Spain [2], which is still facing decline, and Italy. All categories are growing but the British prestige market continues to be boosted by skincare (+12.4%), which accounts for 32% of the market. Fragrance remains the largest sector of the UK market with a 37% share. In France, all categories are growing but the prestige beauty market continues to be boosted by fragrances (+3,1%), accounting for more than 60% of the market in value. Make-up (+7,3%) showed the strongest growth at the end of September, whereas skincare (+2,2%) is growing albeit slowly as it struggles to recover from a particularly tough year in 2009. December is once again eagerly anticipated as it represents 20% of the prestige beauty market revenue in France and 28% in the United Kingdom. This figure is even higher for fragrances: more than 25% of 2009 revenue was achieved in December.  Christmas is also the most important time of the year for sales of fragrance gift sets that accounted for 23% of the fragrances’ revenue in December last year in France and for 32% in the United Kingdom. There is a particular emphasis on sales of gift sets this Christmas in France as sales were disappointing not only this time last year, but also during traditionally strong sales periods of Mothers’ Day and Fathers’ Day this year. During the first six months of the year the top sellers for women in France were the trusted classic fragrances ranges including Chanel No.5, Dior and Kenzo, whilst the top selling men’s lines included more recent products from Paco Rabanne and Hermès. In the UK, the first semester top sellers for women were a mix of classis and new fragrances, whilst the top selling men’s lines included leaned more heavily towards recently launched products."
L’Oreal to strengthen research capabilities in emerging markets,"The global cosmetics market undergoes significant changes - with emerging markets (with China, Brazil and India leading the way) already accounting for 53% of the world’s consumption and 87% of its growth.  The globalisation of beauty, is the first main trend identified by L’Oréal Research. Considering such a situation, the French group committed itself to understand and adapt to all women and men in the world in order to offer them the best of cosmetics in terms of quality, efficacy and safety.  “The ability to innovate for new markets must therefore rely on in-depth knowledge of the culture, needs and preferences of Chinese, Indian and Brazilian consumers,” the company summarizes in a release. In order to place consumers at the very heart of Research & Innovation, L’Oréal has decided to create the “Consumer Insights” International division as well as regional R&I hubs, on the model of the one existing in Asia.  The aim is to strengthen research in emerging countries that currently host only 10% of the group’s 3,300 researchers. In the context where huge non-European markets are skyrocketing, L’Oréal is convinced that innovation must take place where consumers are based.  “The concept of design to value looks at consumer habits in a given location to develop an innovation.” According to L’Oréal, innovation stems from an association of market intelligence (observing beauty rituals, emblematic products, cultural habits) and in-depth knowledge of skin and hair’s biology and physiology.  The French cosmetics giant points out the example of kohl, an emblematic product in India, which is now being used as a source of inspiration for the development of new products. Second key factor of success, underlines to Laurent Attal, “to invest in technologies that will generate even greater innovation.” L’Oréal is subsequently highly interested in genomic, and in the progress in stem cells, biphonotics and reconstructed skin … Anti-perspirants and oily skin products are strategic for emerging markets. “In most of these countries, sweat and oily skin are seen as one and the same, and are intimately linked to climate, diet and physiology.” Third main trend regarding innovation: the efficacy perceived by the consumer and demonstrated by scientific and clinical proof. “The notion and perception of performance is in continuous progression. For example, the quality of a shampoo or shower gel’s lather is not appreciated in the same way by all cultures,” explains L’Oréal. To address these diverse expectations, L’Oréal wants to combine instrumental evaluation methods that assess clinical efficacy and objective evaluations of the product’s emotional and sensorial performance (brain imaging, “eye tracking” or sensorial mapping…)."
Perfumery and cosmetics: French online shops still to be improved!,"Yuseo, a consulting firm specializing in the ergonomics of interactive systems, asked 480 female Internet users to test 3 of the leading French online retailers of beauty products - Marionnaud, Nocibé and Sephora. The study was conducted from October 15 to 20, 2010. All participants were regular female Internet users, who already browsed online cosmetics shops. They were asked 60 contextual questions and had to perform 6 tasks each of them previously standardized to be similar for all sites. [1] Among the main drivers of Internet users to browse online cosmetics retailers are the opportunity to benefit from web-specific promotional offers and the possibility to buy without being ""pressured"" by shop-assistants. These motivations may be connected to a priori expectations vis-à-vis online cosmetics and fragrances purchases: time saving (not to queue) for 74%, attractive prices for 60%, and home delivery for 57%. On the other hand, the main expressed barriers vis-à-vis online sales are the impossibility to touch and test products (91%), excessive delivery charges (77%), and the difficulty to visualize the product (77%). According to Yuseo, the scores at the end of the test reveal several disappointments that can be related to e-shops weaknesses. The 450 women web users who participated in the study have retained a half-hearted impression of their experience. While information on products obtain a good rate, the access to the assortment is not always as simple as expected, and some processes sometimes appear unnecessarily complicated. Overall, the attractivity of online retailers , though initially very strong, is impaired. The product information (colour, composition, product benefits, usage tips, product quantity, ...) and the product offering provided by online retailers seem in line with the expectations and the needs of users. Product information is an important issue as for 91% of Internet users, the main inconvenience of searching and / or buy cosmetic products online is not being able to touch and test the products. Customers participating in the study also give good rates to the product offering, and have especially appreciated the wide range of brands available for each product category. Women users generally appreciate the simplicity and intuitiveness of the ordering process.  “This simplicity is particularly important as for 74% of them, the main advantage of searching and / or buying a cosmetic products online is the saving of time (not to queue). Therefore, it would have been shame to lose this benefit the purchasing the tunnel,” explains the consulting firm. However, users interviewed by Yuseo generally felt they were required to do a lot of unnecessary actions. “Consequently, the retailers’ image was impacted negatively by the browsing experience. This degradation of the brand’s image can affect the conversion rate of these sites.” Clearly, this means fewer purchases. ""Indeed, a significant proportion of the participants, who were initially positively oriented or undecided about visiting / using these sites, turned to negative opinions in terms of envy for future use after only a dozen minutes browsing the sites (i.e. the time needed to achieve the 6 required tasks).” Actually, the proportion of interested Internet users dropped from 74% before the test to 47% after, and the proportion of hesitant users surged from 5% before to 24% after. Among the three online retailers included in the study, Sephora’s online shop stands apart from its two competitors and gets better rates for both the browsing experience and the overall satisfaction of users. However, the study did not examine the performance of other important stakeholders, including online beauty relailers specialized in direct sales. In particular, one’s can note the absence from the field of the study of Yves Rocher’s online shop that, for the 4th year in a row was recently elected # 1 e-commerce beauty site by Internet users surveyed by the FEVAD (Federation of e-commerce and distance selling)."
Consumer packaged goods trends for 2011,"Mintel has identified several trends that may impact the development of consumer packaged goods in 2011. According to the market research company, marketers should get ready for a “natural shakedown”.  While all types of natural claims have grown in importance in all regions, and across all product categories, the term ‘natural’ remains vague and “ill-defined”.  As a consequence, misleading natural products are likely to come under fire and governmental authorities may opt for stringer regulations. Mintel also expects to see a new focus on accentuating the positives of what is in a product, rather than emphasising what is not in it (e.g. “no parabens”, “free from synthesized chemicals”, etc.). As far as sustainability is concerned, Mintel considers that rather than new developments, 2011 will be in the continuation of what we have seen.  “There will be a greater focus on reduced packaging that promotes environmental responsibility.” The development of hybrid products will of the responses of manufacturers to consumer needs.  “Consumers don’t necessarily view products as being in one category or another, rather they look for solutions that meet their needs, and that may be something that straddles multiple categories.” Beyond hybrid forms, Mintel also sees a blurring of how consumers use products – for instance with personal care and home care products that do more than one thing. The border between professional and consumer products is blurring too.  Mintel says that on the model of “salon-style” hair treatments for home use, mainstream brands are getting into a more serious “professional” arena, by offering consumers what used by specialists. Over the last year, more big brands have been revitalising old products and old ad campaigns, tapping into the escalating trend of nostalgia. Mintel anticipates more of these in 2011. The market research company says that many brands will use old formulations, old package designs, re-runs of advertising campaigns or new ads with a retro feel. “These annual predictions represent continuations of current big-picture trends, rather than major changes in the marketplace and what companies are doing,” notes Lynn Dornblaser, Director of innovation and insight at Mintel. “Understanding the major trend areas and how they change from year to year is essential for companies to be successful when developing and launching new products.”"
"Asia, much more than a (huge) market","Cosmoprof Asia, the largest tradeshow in the Beauty sector in the Asia Pacific region, which was held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 10 to 12 November 2010, has once again confirmed its dynamism. The event, celebrating its 15th year, posted impressive statistics: 57,400 sqm of exhibition area (+10% compared to the 2009 edition) that hosted 1,633 exhibitors (16% up on 2009). Furthermore, according to the organizers, more than 45,100 visitors attended the event over the three show days (a 10% increase compared to 2009), including more than 26,100 international visitors (11% up on 2009) coming from Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Turkey, Brazil and the USA. 18,900 attendees from Hong Kong (8% up on the previous year). “Cosmoprof Asia has again confirmed its place as the definitive show in the region for the international cosmetic and beauty business. It’s the reference point for new trends so that visitors come away with exciting new ideas and new business contacts,” said Michael Duck, Director of Cosmoprof Asia Ltd. For cosmetics makers and their suppliers, China and Asia are the world’s key growth markets. Japanese cosmetics giants, Kanebo and Shiseido, thus eye at the Chinese market as their number one strategic priority to fuel their international development.  AmorePacific Corp., South Korea’s leading cosmetics manufacturer, wants to become China’s fourth cosmetics supplier.  Procter & Gamble and Estee Lauder are increasing the number of brands and products they offer in the country, in order to make the most of the growth potential they hold.  L’Oreal, the world’s leading cosmetics maker, intends to quadruple its production capacity in Asia. Once again, China’s huge but tricky market was the main focus of many exhibitors and visitors at Cosmoprof Asia. The two conferences on the development of beauty brands and on cosmetics regulations in China were fully booked. According to market research firm RNCOS, China’s cosmetics and toiletries market shows no signs of slowdown. Especially, skin care segment has been a key growth contributor and steered overall industry to sustain its growth momentum. RNCOS forecast the segment to grow at a CAGR [1] of 12.7% over the next three years (2010-2013). “The growing number of discerning Chinese consumers is leading into more diversified demand for skin care products. To meet the demand arising from different consumer segments, skin care players are introducing new products with added functionalities. Besides moisturizers, other products like, whitening, toners, and anti-ageing skin care have received positive response from the consumers and shown impressive growth,” explains RNCOS. The latest edition of Cosmoprof Asia also highlighted the high technology level and innovation of the industry’s leading packaging and full service suppliers such as Alcan Packaging Beauty (now Albéa), Du Pont, Iléos, Fiabila, FS Korea, Gerresheimer, HCP Packaging, Jia Hsing Enterprise, Kolmar, Libo Cosmetics, and many more. Each year, Asian suppliers from Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and, increasingly, from mainland China showcase increasingly interesting products, complying with the highest quality standards. “Actually, there’s no reason for Asian suppliers to remain specialised in low-cost and poor quality products.  The natural trend is that leading companies provide increasingly sophisticate products,” a European exhibitor told Premium Beauty News. The show was swarming with manufacturers presenting a countless number of vibrating, rotating, or heated mascaras, but also with companies showcasing innovative packaging designs. Libo Cosmetics, for instance, a supplier of make-up packaging headquartered in Taiwan, with manufacturing facilities in mainland China, showcased flower-shaped, fabric-covered or maple-covered compact series, besides extensive ranges of standard products, lipstick cases, mascara and lip gloss containers and supplies many of the most renown international brands. FS Korea is another illustration.  The Korean supplier showcased its ranges of packaging made from eco-resin as well as innovative designs for compacts and make-up brushes."
Natural cosmetics: becoming commonplace?,"Premium Beauty News - The market of natural and organic products is rapidly differentiating itself and getting more complex? Yet does it still remain a niche market? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - No: it is becoming a mainstream market. The market is featuring annual growth rates of about 6-8% - which is twice as much and even more compared to the rates for ""classic"" cosmetics. Consumers are becoming increasingly more demanding and require from brands that they demonstrate not only the efficacy but also the safety of their products: they claim it’s for the sake of their health that they use more and more bio and natural beauty products. Premium Beauty News - The Natural Beauty Summit is going to emphasize on the role played by distribution channels? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - We are going to focus on three ""non standard"" distribution channels: drugstores / organic food stores / internet. We will in particular address the necessary complementarity between online stores and the ""brick and mortar"" ones. This will give us a chance to see that distribution channels of natural and organic beauty products go well beyond traditional selective channels and that brands must have diversified strategies: there is no point in trying to obtain, at all costs, a referencing in specialized distribution channels... who not always know how to sell properly these products. Premium Beauty News - The proliferation of definitions and labels on natural and organic products are often seen as a source of confusion for consumers. What can be expected from the announcement of an ISO standard publication on this subject? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - Harmonization of the five European labels has just given birth to the European specifications Cosmos Standard, which have two levels of certification, natural and organic. Similarly, Natrue, the European specifications -soon to become international, which present a genuine definition of a natural cosmetic which should simplify the understanding of consumers looking for more clarity! ISO international standards which are currently in preparation relying, as a work base, on these two specifications will offer international guidelines within four years; in the end, these standards will bring forward a specific definition but most of all will help maintain the international market open and will encourage our industry to innovate in the field of natural cosmetics! Premium Beauty News - Presently, packaging seems to be the core issue in terms of sustainable development for cosmetics? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - Sustainable development in cosmetics is very often a matter of packaging choices, because in fact, it is easier to choose a more eco-friendly or environmentally friendly packaging than to entirely rework the formula it contains, like for example, incorporating more naturalness. Premium Beauty News - However what is meant exactly by eco-packaging? Michel Gutsatz and Sandie Jaidane - That’s the whole issue actually. Bio-materials, bio-based polymers, regenerated plastics, recycled or recyclable packaging, durable packaging, certifiable packaging, material reduction, control of energy, carbon offsetting, local manufacturing... Eco-packaging cannot come down to only one of these approaches addressed solely but must be thought up in a transverse and global way. In a true environmental approach, brands should consider packaging differently. New consumer expectations, as well as legislation on environmental information, may be an opportunity to reconsider the manufacturing process as a whole, in order to then adapt a specific communication, legible and understandable to brands and end users, in search of environmentally friendly products and of brands commitments in terms of environmental responsibility. Of course, limits and constraints of such an approach need to be discovered (high cost, aesthetics, resistance, contents/container interaction...). Can we reconcile brands and consumers expectations with these new constraints and new environmental functions, he must enriched himself with? Specialists from ILEOS, Alcan and Leoplast companies will be there to expose us their views."
Container/content: a vital partnership!,"Premium Beauty News - Cosmetology and plastics processes... many subjects are common. And you have everything to gain by working together. Dominique Bouvier - Absolutely! I would even go further: We have no other choice! Because to address at the same time, regulations, often groundless concerns on the safety of our products, the organic wave and sustainable development, media campaigns harmful to the industry, changes in attitudes, consumptions habits, the pressure of decision-makers and globalization ... it is an absolute necessity for manufacturers specialised in contents and those specialised in containers, to talk to one another, exchange and share ideas. We must Co-fertilize ideas and test them together. Let’s be frank, we must avoid the situation where ""full service"" would result in ""full"" customers, getting richer by the day, facing ""empty"" exhausted and poorer suppliers! Premium Beauty News - This looks like a real call to resistance! Dominique Bouvier - Yes, almost! Given the complexity of the world surrounding us, plastics specialists and cosmeticians would be well advised to support one another! If only because of changing regulations. But we must also resist to low-cost competition (products and packs), respond through quality and innovation, meet requirements of sustainable development (carbon footprint), respond to the needs of fast growing markets and, most importantly, sustain the high quality level of ""Made in France"" cosmetics, guarantee the origin and quality of products and their packaging in compliance with market regulations. Some regions of the world but also Europe are imposing us new rules which have set the bar very high! It is therefore necessary to pool our resources. Premium Beauty News - Partnership, indeed, but good old ""individualistic"" habits and a lack of enthusiasm to unveil carefully kept trade secrets are difficult to get rid off! Don’t you agree? Dominique Bouvier -  It’s true! We often hear the following sentence: ""My customer is mine"" or ""my teams are the best.""  We must find a way. Decision makers, brands, are common to all, and what they expect from us is a perfect understanding of our industrial domain, practical inventiveness, solutions, innovation... This implies that we share common data to better meet consumer needs. As for the argument ""my team is the best"", no doubt about that! But this should not keep us from uniting, teaming up, while preserving qualities essential for success. That is to say, autonomy and freedom of movement, dynamism and versatility. Creativity is not the prerogative of large structures, but comes from well ""sourced"" human beings functioning with well ""connected"" brains and ideas emerge from exchanges and openness. We must lift barriers to promote horizontal co-operation between the different trades. Conditions for success lie in mutual respect, the sharing of value and information, the equity of contributions and transparency. To work together successfully, you don’t need a legal contract, you just need a charter of common and shared values. Premium Beauty News - Hence, this rapprochement with packaging converters is essential! Dominique Bouvier - Vital! The functionality in primary cosmetics packaging can be found at different levels: what I call ""Cosmetability"" is the intelligent answer of the product/pack duo, depending on the purpose of use. The more the sought benefits are sophisticated, the earlier the collaboration should begin. And ideally, in our businesses, marketers, designers and scientists should be working together... You do understand that this challenge is more than ambitious, and finally small businesses, with their lighter and more mobile structures have quite a few cards to play! In addition, the content/container compatibility calls upon a wide variety of scientific disciplines, so we obviously also need the support of academic laboratories. Among the CED members, there are some highly skilled researchers who can address appropriately, raised issues. Premium Beauty News - But there is also what you call ""the economic interest"" in a good content/container partnership? Dominique Bouvier - This economic interest should not be overlooked. Through a common market approach and therefore a joint offer, there are on top of it, possible economic gains in packaging operations. Premium Beauty News - The concept of sustainable development also generates new constraints? Dominique Bouvier - Yes, absolutely! And the issues concern material recyclability, biodegradability, waste disposal. The nature of materials changes with ""green"" materials ... Carbon labels to be placed on products in a near future (2011) will result in significant changes and these changes will need to be addressed in partnership between the two industries."
Kanebo Cosmetics accelerates its mature generation business,"On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Evita, its skincare brand dedicated to women in their fifties and over, Kanebo Cosmetics is launching the Deep Moisture line to further enhance the appeal of Evita, alongside the already available Moisture line, in a segment where skin hydration is a priority. When Kanebo launched Evita in 2000, post-war baby-boomers were advancing into their fifties.  The new brand was designed for their need and explicitly claimed it, a premiere in Japan. Market’s response was immediately positive.  “When Evita hit the scene, it instantly struck a chord among baby-boomer women,” explains the company.  By 2007, Evita’s annual sales had overcome 10 billion yens (EUR 89 million). The skincare brand has become a best-seller in what Japanese call the self-selection market [1]. As of 2006, there were around 6.8 million former baby-boomers aged from 58 to 60 in Japan. These are the people who spent their teens and twenties in the era of Japan’s rapid economic growth and have always taken the lead in the nation’s consumption. According to Kanebo’s market researchers: “Women of this generation have been especially quick to catch on to trends and have taken on many new things. As consumers, their influence on the generations just below them is powerful. They are still prime movers of consumption in Japan and wield strong influence on the types of products that come to market.” Indeed, surveys of household expenditure in different age groups show that Japanese households headed by persons in their fifties spent more on cosmetics than any other household age segment. The creators of Evita say that key to the brand’s success was a spot-on understanding of the cosmetic needs of fifty-and-over women.  Chizuru Ishikawa, Manager of the Self Selection Brand Products Development Group at Kanebo Cosmetics, has been working with Evita since its release. “When they hit fifty, women reach a turning point in lifestyle. They gain more leeway with time and money, and this brings more opportunities for leisure. They also think more about beauty care and take a renewed interest in sun care, fashion, lipstick, and other makeup items.” Furthermore, women in their fifties have different skin concerns than women in their thirties and forties.  From the late forties through the fifties, troubles related to skin tone become more noticeable. From about fifty onwards, the skin tends to dry more easily. “Dryness can become a big problem. The intensive moisturizing focus in Evita sets the brand apart from cosmetics made for younger skin,” adds Chizuru Ishikawa. Kanebo Cosmetics is also carrying on investments in Chicca, its prestige make-up brand for fashion-conscious women in their late fifties and sixties, which was launched in 2008.  On next February, the brand will release new colours for Spring 2011. Chicca, which proposes anti-ageing solutions through makeup effects, targets sophisticated, mature Japanese women, who want to stay attractive and feminine as they age. Kanebo Cosmetics has coined this generation the “New Sixties.”  Consistently, the brand benefits from the inspiration of a trendy makeup artist, Yasuo Yoshikawa, a Japanese born  who’s now based in New York, working with international fashion magazines, fashion brands and celebrities in the U.S. and Europe. “Ever since its debut, Chicca has been winning over a steadily growing base of devoted users,” says Kanebo Cosmetics."
Market survey - Samples get the unanimous votes from consumers!,"Premium Beauty News - What is interesting about the results of this survey [1] is the importance of samples for consumers that receive them along with a purchase or during a promotional campaign conducted by a brand! Ludovic Anceau - Obviously, it is quite reassuring for Socoplan and for our business. At least the results of this survey help set the record straight and this should encourage us to continue to put forward the fantastic medium represented by samples, which is not always taken into account by our customers’ marketing teams. Thus, to the question “How did you come to know a brand’s product?”, over 51% of respondents answer “Through a sample.”  Over 71% of people state that “it is with the help of a sample that they learned to appreciate for the first time a fragrance.”  They are 68% in this case concerning a skincare or make-up product. Even better, not only have interviewed persons come to know the product through samples, but it is by far the method they prefer to test it (the tester is only appreciated by 26% of respondents and in-store demonstration is only appreciated by 16% of them!). Premium Beauty News - The success is the same for samples found inside magazines? Ludovic Anceau - The success is the same, indeed! 65% of consumers overwhelmingly applaud this promotion method to discover and appreciation a fragrance. The single advertising page only collects 13% of approvals and newspaper articles, 21%. This seems obvious, but a person who receives a sample will use it! 91% of them will use it straight away. And even better, 73% of them state that the sample led them to buy the product afterwards. Premium Beauty News - What types of samples are the most popular? Ludovic Anceau - It’s an interesting point because opinions are very divided among consumers and sales staff, concerning this subject. The first prefer more sophisticated samples, while the latter are in favour of more simple samples like sachets. In both cases, anyway, people are always sorry to not have enough of them because samples not only help discover a product but are also a highly valued gift. By giving a sample, you also give a bonus to customer loyalty."
Nail polish: sticking to the needs of a market that is exploding,"Premium Beauty News - All indicators are ""green"" in your market? Pierre Miasnik - Yes quite true! We are really on an expanding market on which we are witnessing a real acceleration. In fact, it is the conjunction of several phenomena: The first one of them is of course, strong recovery, but it is mostly the second phenomenon which is much more interesting. A number of major brands specialised in cosmetics had neglected nail polish in recent years and had clearly lost market shares. They now realize that it’s in fact a fantastic loss leader and that nail polish has truly become a powerhouse in the world of make-up. Colour has been brought back into fashion. And the price of the product has also remained affordable for the consumer. Premium Beauty News - Especially since, in parallel, you have made considerable progress on a technical level to improve the quality of nail polishes, their shades and their durability! Pierre Miasnik - Absolutely! This reflects Fiabila’s commitment, for over thirty years, to develop the ""best"" products. And this with the entrepreneurial vision which has always been ours, where investments are the result of long term industrial strategies, not depending on financial investors with short term objectives in mind. We are now reaping the fruits of research works and new product developments for which we haven’t stopped investing in recent years. This gave us a chance of filing many patents, especially concerning new materials and new polymers. And as we are big users of raw materials, it allows us to obtain top qualities. Premium Beauty News - In terms of industrial investments, concretely, what are your future plans? Pierre Miasnik - It is clear that our investments are focusing straight away on our French production plant and our U.S. site, without forgetting the completion of works begun in India, where we have been operating for more than 10 years. In France, this concerns both nail polish production and also the packaging facility. Did you know that this year, we have merely doubled our turnover in the United States. But we are also investing a lot in workforce. All our teams have been reinforced."
Luxe Pack Monaco bets on innovation and sustainable development,"Premium Beauty News - Luxe Pack created this year the Innovation Forum. What is it all about? Nathalie Grosdidier - For a long time we have always known that the show was a real springboard for innovative packaging. But we came to that conclusion, backed by figures from the last survey conducted among exhibitors: 62% of them save their new products to only launch them at Luxe Pack. This is a great finding that we had to put forward as much as possible. Hence this new forum which will bring together novel products and the opportunity for exhibitors to perform ""flash"" presentations. Premium Beauty News - Sustainable development was already a strong point this year at Luxe Pack New York. It will also be the case at Luxe Pack Monaco 2010! Nathalie Grosdidier - It is obvious that authorities and consumers are putting more and more pressure and environmental issues have become main subjects of concern for luxury brands. This is why we have put under the spotlight, at this 2010 edition, the responsibility of luxury companies and sustainable development. Luxe Pack Monaco is the ideal platform to debate and inspire a new vision of the luxury sector and of environmental issues. We therefore also decided to put forward this question: ""Luxury brands instigating eco-responsible behaviour?""  Prominent personalities representing luxury brands will give their points of view and share their thoughts and experience. This roundtable will be immediately followed by the presentation of the Luxe Pack in Green Award, in the presence of the members of the jury. Premium Beauty News - You are singling out exhibitors’ eco-responsible solutions ! Nathalie Grosdidier - Yes, we support luxury brands in their quest for solutions integrating sustainable development criteria, by organizing the ""Luxe Pack in Green Awards"". The success of the event ""Luxe Pack in Green"", in 2009, has demonstrated the genuine interest of luxury brand owners looking for ways to reduce the environmental impact of their products. Luxe Pack Monaco is launching a new edition of this show and in parallel, this prize which will be awarded to exhibitors’ best innovation, comprising one or more of sustainable development criteria, according to a charter defining selection criteria. The jury includes specialists in sustainable development among both, institutional players, luxury brands owners and media partners:  Mr Michel Fontaine, President of the French packaging council; - Mr Alexandre Capelli, Sustainable Development Engineer, LVMH;  Mrs Elizabeth Pastore-Reiss, Founding Director of the Ethicity sustainable development consulting firm;  Mrs Catherine O’Meny Chief Editor and Founder of the website www.abc-luxe.com;  Mr Stefano Lavorini Managing Director of the magazine Italia Imballaggio. They will award the Luxe Pack in Green 2010 trophy on Wednesday, Oct. 20, at 17:30. The latter is an original creation of Alnoor Design, a design agency which will be attending the Luxe Pack Monaco show and who designed it specially for the event. Premium Beauty News - Among other high points, we can also mention the work carried out by your ""Observatoire des Tendances (Trends Observer)! Nathalie Grosdidier - As you know, product launches of the year are decoded and analysed by members of the Observer. Signals, trend setting recurring details emerge from a structural movement: this is how major trends see the light. This work also relies on the analysis of social phenomena, the evolution of the individual and the transformation of its expectations. This identification of consumer expectations applied to packaging is a valuable basis to guide brand’s development. Don’t forget that members of the Observer are experts in packaging, design, communication and sociology. It will have this year, among participants such people as Béatrice Mariotti, Vice-President of Carré Noir; Véronique Liabeuf, Managing Director, Enjoy Design; Jean-Paul Cornillou, Head of the Packaging Section Strate, College; Isabelle Musnik, Content and Editorial Manager, Influencia and Guillaume Bregeras, Chief Editor, Formes de Luxe; and Eloïse Cohen, Deputy Chief Editor, Formes de Luxe. All these experts will be present to give us an account of their findings concerning new design trends found during an interactive workshop. Each trend will be presented by one of the experts and illustrated with new products in order to make their presentation even more pragmatic. Three trends were decrypted by our experts this year: Elixir, Malice, Comedia."
Natural cosmetics must do more to convince consumers,"According to Organic Monitor, the European market for natural and organic should expand by 12% in 2010. Although outpacing the total cosmetics market, growth is far below the 20% plus growth rates observed in previous years.  These slowing market growth rates accompanied with an influx of new entrants are raising competitive stakes in Europe, says the market analysis company. So far, the natural beauty segment’s healthy growth rates have attracted both emerging and mainstream international brands.  As a result, competition steps up and retail shelf-space becomes crowded. In this context, competitively priced brands, in particular private labels, appear increasingly attractive.  “In Germany, private labels comprise about a third of all natural cosmetic sales,” says Organic Monitor.  The availability of low priced certified natural and organic cosmetics is changing the market. For instance, Alverde, the private label of DM drugstores, is emerging as the leading brand of natural cosmetics in Germany. Over 300 products are marketed under the Alverde brand, with many priced below 2 Euros.  “Consumers are attracted to the value prepositions offered by such brands - certified natural and organic products at low prices.” Similarly, most growth in the European market is coming from mainstream retailers, such as supermarkets, pharmacies and drugstores. Subsequently, some premium natural are organic brands are losing market share because of sluggish demand from organic food shops and beauty retailers The results of a recent report by Datamonitor [1], another market research firm, were also released this week and may be helpful to understand changing consumer behaviours. According to Datamonitor, more than half of consumers (52%) across the globe consider personal care products formulated with natural products as being better for them.  This simple fact probably explains most of the impressive growth this segment recently experienced. However, the confidence in the safety remains accompanied by concerns over the efficacy of natural ingredients, also reveals the market research firm.  “Despite the growing concern over the ingredients used in personal care products, consumers were also found to be ambivalent over the efficacy of natural ingredients in personal care.” Actually, Datamonitor’s survey suggest that marketers still have some way to go to convince consumers that natural ingredients are just as effective as synthetic ingredient.  Only 37% of global consumers agreed with the statement that health and beauty products formulated with natural ingredients are equally as effective as non-natural products, whilst 44% neither agreed nor disagreed. Matthew Jones, consumer trends analyst at Datamonitor, comments: “Shoppers will not be prepared to sacrifice performance benefits when it comes to personal care, particularly as many are actively seeking to minimise the time spent on personal hygiene/grooming. Price is also a factor, as consumer will find it difficult to justify any price premiums when there is doubt as to whether they will even see good results.”"
European facial skincare market capitalizes on advances in science,"According to Mintel, the value of the facial skincare market in the five key European markets (France, Italy, Germany, UK and Spain) reached 6.1 billion euros in 2009 - up from 6 billion euros in 2008.  France represents more than 36% of this market, with facial skincare sales reaching 2.2 billion euros in 2009. France is closely followed by Germany, where retail sales reaches 1.3 billion euros, and Italy with almost 1.2 billion euros.  The UK ranks fourth with consumer spending amounting to over 1 billion euros (854 million pounds) in 2009.  Eventually, Spain represents the lowest value with total retail sales of 371 million euros. The combined market value in these five countries is expected to grow even further to exceed 6.5 billion euros by 2013. “Overall, the need to respond to a growing number of European women seeking to target signs of ageing has been at the heart of European product innovation and retail figures prove that it has been worth the investment,” commented Nica Lewis, Head Consultant Mintel Beauty Innovation. Nearly two thirds (62%) of French women use anti-wrinkle products, Mintel reveals. “However, wrinkles are not just an issue for French women. Italian women are not far behind, with 60% using anti-wrinkle products, followed by Spanish women (55%), the UK (51%) and Germany (49%),” adds the market research firm. Fine lines and wrinkles are the top ageing concerns for women in all countries surveyed, with French and Spanish women (63%) coming top, compared to UK (62%) and Italy (59%). This compares to under half (47%) of German women who said that they were concerned with these aspects. However, although lines and wrinkles remain the biggest concern when it comes to ageing, many other aspects trouble European women. For instance, almost half of British (49%), Spanish (47%) and French (46%) women are concerned about dark under-eye circles and sunken eyes. Sagging skin worries up to 43% of German women and stretch marks upset 45% of Italian women. France and Italy have been the most active countries in Europe in product launches in the face and neck sub-category, accounting for 81% each, followed by Germany and UK with 78%, and Spain with 68% in 2009.  In contrast, Spain led the way in the lip care sub-category, accounting for 25% of new product developments in the facial skincare sector, compared to Germany and UK with 12%, France with 9% and Italy with 7%. Furthermore, according to Mintel, the consumer’s interest in facial skincare products is leading to new product developments with more and more scientific claims, including stem cell technology, ever-lengthening peptide chains, sirtuins and DNA repair. “As we have previously predicted in our beauty trends, cosmetic science continues to capitalise on advances in biochemistry and medicine. This trend for Turbo Beauty features more quasi-medical results and ‘mix-it-yourself’ solutions, such as at-home kits, cures and gadgets. In anti-ageing launches in 2010 there has been emphasis on gadgets and glycation,” Nica Lewis concludes."
Japanese companies invest in anti-ageing innovations,"The crisis hit Japan hard, with sales of beauty products dropping by -8.1% in 2009 in value, but only -0.5% in volume, revealing consumers’ growing sensitivity to prices.  The trend to favour lower-priced items of the same quality continued during the first half of 2010, with sales increasing by +1.32% in volume but continuing to decline by -1.6% in value. However, a closer look to figures reveals that high-priced luxury items, in particularly anti-ageing creams performed well. Kanebo’s prestige skincare line Impress, for example, saw double-digit growth in 2009. Indeed, it seems that in Japan’s matured market, with a rapidly ageing population, consumers remain focused on high-quality and innovative products but are looking for more value.  Actually, the shift to lower-priced products mainly affects mid-range items, while high-quality products or breaking innovations are less affected. Despite the economy, cosmetics companies have therefore impressively increased the pace of new product launches.  The number of skincare products launched in Japan with an anti-ageing claim increased by a staggering 85% from 2007 to 2009, compared to a 27% increase in the US during the same time period, Mintel Beauty Innovation reveals. “East Asia and Japan, specifically, have always been at the forefront of beauty innovation,” notes Hinako Sugioka, Mintel Beauty Innovation senior consultant. “The steady increase in Japan’s longevity, traditional eating habits and long history of whitening beauty are just a few of the reasons this region continues to excel in the personal care industry.” These launches include traditional skin care products but also anti-ageing food or beverages.  For instance, Kanebo’s Collagen Deep In, a beauty beverage formulated to enhance skin moisture and firmness and targeting women in their thirties, was launched on May 1, 2009 and reached initial annual sales forecasts within six months only. In this context, Kanebo is launching on November 19 in the domestic market and across Asia of Granmula, a premium priced skincare declination of its Impress line, with items that start at 20,000 yens (178.59 euros) and rise very quickly to 120,000 yens (1,071.56 euros). Through this launch, Kanebo aims at reinforcing its global prestige strategy with a strong emphasis in Asia and China."
Cosmetic brushes: the revival!,"This product, which was reserved until now to make-up professionals, is becoming attractive to an increasing number of consumers. Large retail chains of make-up products have contributed to its success by offering with their cosmetics, attractive kits consisting of several brushes. The result is a booming market with double digits annual growth rates. A niche which has attracted the attention of managers of the DuPont [1], group historically specialized in the production of fibres for toothbrushes and leader in the niche of mascara fibres.  A ""niche"" where animal hair, still predominantly used, is probably seeing its days numbered. A ""niche"" for which DuPont has been marketing since a few months a highly technical and specially performing fibre,Natrafi. But actually? Do women use and appreciate the use a cosmetic brush? Every survey answers ""yes""! Even if their perception of the product is often far from reality. For 86% of them, the brush must of course become impregnated with powder to then perfectly restore it during application. For 46% of them bristles should be soft and 37% believe the brush should obviously not lose them. 67% think that brushes are currently made out of synthetic bristles and only 19% think they are made out of animal hair. More interestingly, European consumers say they would not use a brush if it was made out of animal hair! When 95% of powder brushes manufactured in the world are made, precisely of animal hair! “Actually, explains Sarah Perreard, DuPont, this market was demanding a new fibre that, to paraphrase a well known ad would have the feel and performance of animal hair without coming from the animal industry... and who would not smell like it!”  An even more tenacious ""smell"" when brushes are made from goat hair (which is the majority!) or from pony hair. Especially that 87% of consumers believe that this practice is cruel to animals! In 2003, DuPont teams decide to seriously address this issue. The challenge is far from being simple. It consists in developing a fibre featuring all the qualities of goat or pony hair, that is to say which really becomes well impregnated of powder and perfectly restores it. Not easy when you operate a microscopic analysis of goat hair and you understand why powder clings to it so well. Conversely, synthetic fibre is at least very smooth. “That’s why the design of Natrafil is so clever,” explains Sarah Perreard, “because our engineers have recreated some roughness in this polyester fibre with the addition of various additives and a fibre extraction process which structures and softens the tips. A complex and patented process.”  Incidentally, they did not know that by developing Natrafil, they were at the same time going to help future brushes, partly or totally consisting of this fibre, make a giant leap.  “It was a pleasant surprise.  Tests conducted among make-up artists exceeded our expectations. They all admitted that brushes made from 100% Natrafil impregnated themselves and restored powder much better, applying formulas in a more uniform manner with increasing precision compared to traditional brushes made from animal hair. As for brushes containing different percentages of Natrafil fibres, they enabled adjusting the desired make-up performance according to formula or the use of the brush, be it to apply the exact quantity of required powder, to attenuate, to blend in, etc.” Note that Natrafil is also very effective for applying liquid make-up in the case, for example of body painting. “Key assets of our fibre are: consistent quality complying with specifications, stable supplies not being subject to fluctuations from the animal hair market, and finally a better perception from consumers as well as a guaranteed hygiene,” underlines Sarah Perreard. As a result, the DuPont Group, which currently produces the fibre in the United States and ships it to Shenzen in China for its processing, has recently invested in a second production line precisely in China. “It is true that 90% of brushes manufactured in the world are manufactured in this region,” explains Sarah Perreard, “and they are almost entirely handmade!” Another advantage in favour of the use of a synthetic fibre is to automate production more easily... To be continued."
"Alain Chevassus, Cosfibel: “recovery is taking shape”","Specializing in the industrial production of transparent packaging and also of sourcing in Asia and North Africa in the field of accessories and promotional packaging but also make-up packaging, the Cosfibel group this year will reach 60 million Euros turnover for a workforce of 200 people. “Fortunately, we made a number of choices in the past who turned out to be the right ones today,” explains Alain Chevassus.  “On the one hand the development of a genuine expertise in the design of often sophisticated luxury boxes (an area where we’ve quintupled our business in five years).  On the other hand, the diversification of our supply sources to avoid the ‘all Asia’ supply and to anticipate our customers choices (which is why we now have good operating bases in North Africa, especially Tunisia, where we will probably sign a joint venture soon).  Finally, our customers recognition of our creative capacity and our technical and logistic expertise in the field of cosmetic packaging (the latest example to date being the complete line that we designed for Burberry).  Not to mention the relevance of our industrial tool in terms of transparent packaging which allows us to develop our business very efficiently in alcoholic beverages.  I must add that for this beverage sector, we will also offer injected boxes.” An appropriate decision, in any case, considering the fact that the Group has recently decided to set up a team directly in Scotland, the homeland if any, of Whisky. “This new office is in line with our so called ‘customer oriented’ strategy through the development of the Urban Network® where we position ourselves geographically close to our customers which enables us to take the best decision possible by using all the Group’s resources in terms of creation, production and logistics.”"
Makeup in Paris in june 2011 at the Carrousel du Louvre,"Premium Beauty News - So MakeUp in Paris in 2011 will take place at the Carrousel du Louvre. For those who are not familiar with this location where is it exactly? Sandra Maguarian - Indeed, MakeUp in Paris in 2011 will take place at the Carrousel du Louvre from June 23 to June 24 next year. The whole world knows the Louvre; it is one of the most visited museums in the world. In 1990 an extension was built by the architect Leoh Ming Pei hosting an exhibition area, fashion shows and a shopping mall. The Carrousel du Louvre is located near the Place de la Concorde, just after the Tuileries Gardens. Premium Beauty News - Why such a choice? Sandra Maguarian - It is in Paris one of the latest, most modern and most functional exhibition area and personally, I consider it as the most beautiful! It is very well served by public transports, it is located in the golden Triangle of Paris which represents two major advantages for exhibitors and visitors.  It is a place steeped in history where hopefully in turn, make-up will write its own. Moreover, while keeping in mind the desire of make-up professionals to come together in a friendly and human-scale atmosphere, the organization of this second edition of MakeUp in Paris required a larger space, allowing us to host more exhibitors and provide more space for animations and in particular conferences. Finally, the flexibility offered by spaces at the Carrousel du Louvre gives us the opportunity to secure future dates for MakeUp in Paris, since we are already booked on the calendar of events for June 2012. Premium Beauty News - Nearly all exhibitors from the 2010 edition have reregistered, and you’ve already received requests from new companies wanting to participate. What explains this keen interest? Sandra Maguarian - Yes you are right, almost 95% of exhibitors have reregistered. Such an early renewal rate is an increasingly rare phenomenon noticed by trade show organizers. Companies’ reregistrations put aside, it is to be noted that 20% of them do it by doubling their exhibition space. As for new comers, the majority of them were companies who had strategically wanted to visit the first edition of MakeUp in Paris to make up their mind. It seems that they had a fruitful visit! This craze is the result of an event created in a highly professional manner, targeted, qualified. We have done our best to assist exhibitors in the organization of their participation and have worked very hard to attract the visitors they were expecting. The first edition of MakeUp in Paris, we believe was a total success. Premium Beauty News - Can we go back over the statistics of 2010, what are the main lessons? Sandra Maguarian - 1404 visitors attended the show. And more strikingly, 800 visitors coming from brands were present in June. Exhibitors have expressed it during the event and results of the analysis on visitorship have proved it, marketing and R & D managers were the most numerous.  This means that the number of targeted visitors was the one expected. Above all, the surprise came from the fact we didn’t expect as many international visitors coming from no less than 26 countries, from the U.S. to Vietnam including South Africa. Premium Beauty News - Make-up animations were one of the highlights of this first edition. One can imagine it will still be the same next year. Sandra Maguarian -  Yes without a doubt. I can even tell you  that some of them will surprise you! The Carrousel du Louvre offers us the possibility to organize animations in better conditions, sometimes on a larger scale to allow maximum participation and visibility. For the time being, I can’t lift the veil on these animations, but I will keep you informed as soon as possible."
Kanebo Cosmetics to strengthen its presence on overseas markets,"Like other Japan’s leading cosmetics makers, - such as Shiseido or Pola - Kanebo Cosmetics, belonging to the Kao group since 2006, has resolutely entered into a strategy of international development. Currently, Kanebo achieves 90% of its turnover in Japan and only 10% abroad. ""Our first objective is to reach 15% as quickly as possible"", explains Shinji Yamada, Director of the international PR Department of the Group. Confronted to a domestic market, which for the past eight years, has turned out to be totally lifeless, Japanese giants of the cosmetic industry have engaged themselves in massive international investments. And needless to say it was about time. In fact, although they still use a lot of cosmetics, baby boomers which were a true goldmine to the Japanese industry have reached 60 years of age and since 2005, population has started declining. Even worse, consumption of cosmetics, which was known for its stability, has also shown, some signs of slowing down. From this point of view, with a drop in sales of 8.1% 2009 was an unprecedented year. Even if the situation has partially improved in the first half of 2010, with a volume increase of 1.32%, the market has continued to decline in value (-1.6% according to the Ministry of Economy). Nonetheless, competition is not weakening on the Japanese market itself, quite the contrary. On the one hand, for Japanese companies looking for diversification, barriers to entry are low and many big players have recently set foot in the cosmetic market. These last years, the cosmetic offer has come from cosmetic players as unexpected as Fuji Films, with the Astalift brand or Ajinomoto, the food giant, and even Suntory, the famous Japanese beer maker, on the cosmetic food segment. On the other hand, the lack of dynamism of the Japanese market does not deter international brands who, given their low penetration rates, can rely on significant growth margins and are still eager to take their share of what remains the second global market. For Kanebo, the first step consisted in streamlining its brand portfolio to focus its resources on lines with a stronger international potential and explore new expanding growth markets. From about sixty in 2004, Kanebo has reduced its portfolio to currently twenty lines, while new products were launched, especially in cosmetic food, or on the 60-something age segment with Chicca. With the goal of becoming a real global player, Kanebo has segmented its international strategy in three levels: China, Asia and Europe-USA. China is clearly the Group’s first priority which is carrying out in the country a large scale specific strategy based on six brands distributed through two channels: department stores (Lunasol, Impress, Coffret d’Or, and Aqua Sprina) and high-end drugstores and pharmacies (Free Plus and Kate). Regarding the rest of Asia, excluding Japan, of course, Kanebo is focusing on a dozen countries, with a strategy hinged on its premium brands (Lunasol, Blanchir Superior, Impress, Coffret d’Or) and on department stores, and targeting as a priority markets such as Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, where this segment is experiencing the fastest growth (10% on average over the past three years, against 4.4% on average for Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea). For Europe and the United States, the Group’s strategy remains centred on Sensaï, its ""super prestige"" brand, distributed in department stores, selective perfumeries and in spas of some hotels since the opening in December 2009 of the first Sensaï Select Spa at the Victoria-Jungfrau Grand Hotel of Interlaken in Switzerland. Kate, Japan’s leading make-up brand in the self-service beauty segment, debuted this month in Shanghai and Beijing.  The brand is being launched at drugstores, starting with Watsons, Asia’s leading health and beauty retailer.  The number of sales outlets is expected to grow from 20 stores in the first month to 50 stores by the end of 2010, and 100 by the end of 2011. Kate mainly aims at young Chinese women born after 1980, a population that is reputed to highly appreciate Japanese trends in fashion and cosmetics.  However, as self-service still has not taken root for beauty products in China, Kanebo has decided to provide Chinese consumers with the advices of beauty consultants in sales corners installed in the selected drugstores.  Globalisation sometime means adaptation!"
HBA is a unique opportunity for product development in the cosmetics industry,"Premium Beauty News - What are the prospects for this new edition of HBA? Jill Birkett - We are excited about the 2010 HBA event.  We feel that we have captured much of the education and networking needed to help our audience during these still challenging business times.  With the changes in distribution,  in markets,  in retail,  HBA has developed a strong conference program and networking series of events to allow the beauty and personal care industries to mingle, meet, talk and do business together. There are over 150 new exhibiting companies in HBA this year, including new raw materials and packaging suppliers, lab equipment,  private label and natural ingredients companies from across the world and the USA. We are on track to meet or exceed our plans to register 16,000 attendees for HBA this September. Premium Beauty News - What is the proportion of U.S. and overseas exhibitors? Jill Birkett - Exhibitors are attending from many countries outside of the U.S., including  Mexico,  France, Benin,  Poland,   China,  the Dominican Republic,  Brazil, Austria,  Switzerland,  Argentina,  Germany, Singapore,  Canada, Italy, Turkey, the U.A.E., Israel,  Taiwan,  Spain,  Columbia,  the U.K.,  Korea, India  and others. Approximately one third of the HBA exhibitors come from outside the US, and more and more are responding to HBA’s business platform of bringing the entire beauty and personal care product development community together for three days in New York City, the beauty capital of the world. Premium Beauty News - HBA has remained the first American trade show of the beauty sector, nevertheless it has had to put up with fierce competition. In this competitive context what is your vision of the future? Jill Birkett - As you know, beauty and personal care is not only a global business, but a very large business.  This is fortunate for all of us who seek to serve these market segments!  At HBA,  we have focused on providing a quality event with an outstanding education program, as well as additional activities to provide interest,  fun and education to our visitor base. We continue to build HBA as “the place to be to do business”.  The USA has been the largest market in the world for many years.  Even as other global markets grow,  the large base of beauty company headquarters and innovative start-up entrepreneurs means New York particularly is a great place to do business. So many visitors and exhibitors come to the city during and after HBA that many of them stay up to 10 days to have follow-up appointments after the show. Additionally,  we once again co-located with the Spa & Resort Expo,  which is a regional event for Spa Owners and Managers.  Last year,  over 600 HBA visitors thanked us for co-locating the events to provide them a better  “one stop” business opportunity.  We expect to continue to build on that vision. Premium Beauty News - What do you think of the opening, in a few weeks, of the new Intercharm show in Milan? Jill Birkett - Here in the USA, we have not heard too much about it from our customers. We are extremely focused,  as you can imagine,  on preparing for HBA and making it the best product development event for the  beauty and personal care industry. Product Development is our business-orientation and it provides a unique opportunity for HBA.  Many other events are focused on different segments of the market.  The European community will decide if Intercharm is a good business opportunity for them,  I imagine. Premium Beauty News - What is your point of view on the fact that the beauty sector’s centre of gravity is shifting more and more towards Asia. Not only in terms of growth but also industrially speaking? Jill Birkett - This is not surprising given the world’s overall population and shifting demographics.  It’s actually very exciting, and I’d like to say that Latin America is very much a part of that exciting growth.  This actually provides opportunity for innovative manufacturers:  new packaging needs to meet a different demographic, new labelling to meet new markets’ regulations, new products to meet the needs of a different type of consumer. I believe forward-thinking firms will organize their business to participate in growing markets for the long term.  We provide education, such as our Global Perspectives Conference, to help the industry stay ahead of the changes."
Fashion and beauty intertwined at InterCharm Milano,"InterCharm Milano, the new Italian exhibition entirely dedicated to beauty that will open its doors from 18th to 20th September at Fieramilanocity, will also host a fashion show, with the aim to bring together top and emerging talent from the world of make-up, hair styling and fashion, in collaboration with Vogue Italia. Three emerging fashion designers, three make-up artists (Gabriele Grimaldi for Deborah, Rajan Tolomei for Max Factor and Carmelo Grassi for Debby), three hairstylists (Francesca Sesler for Alfaparf, Carlo Bay for Kemon and Tagliati X il Successo for Screen) “will be matched up together to create three exclusive looks, complete from head to toe”. Named “BE fashion BE beauty”, the fashion show will be held on Monday 20th September to end the first edition of InterCharm Milano.  This special event will feature 30 models on the runway."
Luxe Pack Monaco puts the light on innovation,"For its 2010 edition, Luxe Pack Monaco will focus on innovation.  A “forum of innovation” will unveil the latest developments in packaging solutions from the exhibitors of the global event dedicated to luxury packaging, which will take place from 20-22 October at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. “Exhibitors often choose to display their newly released products exclusively at the Luxe Pack Monaco trade fair, aiming to illustrate their creativity and expressing their support for this leading trade fair through their active participation,” say the organisers. The “Luxe Pack Innovation Forum” will allow all participants to get a complete and rapid overview of the latest packaging developments.  The forum will consist in scheduled presentations, not exceeding 15 to 20 minutes each and allowing exhibitors to unveil their new products and innovative solutions, which may at times feature the use of highly specialised technology.  These sessions will take place throughout the 3-day event in a specially allocated space, according to a schedule that shall be published on the Luxe Pack Monaco website starting September. Innovations linked to sustainable development targets will also be displayed in a specific show-room: Luxe Pack in Green. Furthermore, Luxe Pack Monaco will offer targeted training courses for decision-makers as early as Wednesday October, 20th, opening day of the fair [1]. The following topics have been prepared: – “The Digital Luxury Revolution and its Impact on Product Presentation, Merchandizing & Experiences”, session moderated by Uché Okonkwo, CEO founder of Luxe Corp.
– “Trends 2012 - Focus packaging”, session moderated by Catherine Tétu Fashion and Beauty Council Director Nelly Rodi agency."
MakeUp in Paris fulfils its target,"As far as attendance is concerned, MakeUp in Paris scored beyond its organizers’ expectations: 1404 visitors thave walked down the aisles of the first edition of this event entirely dedicated to te make-up industry, which  was held last June 24 and 25, at the Espace Pierre Cardin, in the beating heart of downtown Paris. “It’s a fine score, actually exceeding our expectations. If there was a large number of visitors, there was also and above all, quality. We were certainly expecting a high level of attendance because the number of people who had pre-registered (1200) was a hint of an even higher number of visitors. But reality turned out to be even better with above all, a good quality of visitorship, a fact which was confirmed by exhibitors themselves”, explains Sandra Maguarian, Show Manager to the event organized by Beauteam. Two weeks after the event, the analysis of visitors’ registration data showed that the MakeUp in Paris concept appealed to decision makers. There was a massive number of brands with over 800 visitors, including a significant number of foreign visitors! And that was a bit of a surprise for the MakeUp in Paris team. Indeed, 14% of overseas visitors made the trip to attend the event, which can be considered an excellent performance for a first edition. Among top countries, all categories considered, Italy comes first followed by England, Belgium, and then Germany. But there were also visitors from Canada, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Poland, Romania, Japan, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, United States and even Vietnam ... Overall 26 countries were represented! The goal to attract marketing teams and development managers was also reached. After analysis by categories of visitors, the first position to emerge among decision-makers is: marketing with nearly 500 people. Then follow R & D, Purchasing, Sales, Communication ... The date are apparently confirmed by the first feedbacks from exhibitors.  “The visitors were of high quality and were seeking for solutions and innovations, and they found a human-sized event allowing to point out relevant issues,” said Eric Fresnel, President of Sleever International. From the exhibitors’ side, satisfaction seems general too.  The broad feeling of exhibitors and visitors collected here and there can be summarized as follows: “An event on a human scale ... very friendly ... very professional!”. “It was intimate, fun, and a much needed fresh approach to our industry.  The quality and number of visitors was impressive. I am looking forward to the next edition with even more animation events,” commented Romayne Apcar, CEO of HCT France: Actually, the HCT Group was one of the first companies to officially commit way back in October of last year.  “I was inspired to support this venture from the outset. MakeUp in Paris is worlds apart from other industry events. Its’ specific focus on makeup attracted a select and intimate audience, and exposed us to a completely new group of potential customers,” added James Thorpe, Managing Director of HCT Europe. According to the organizers, all exhibitors already requested to book their stand space for next year’s event, some of them on a larger perimeter, and several other companies already want to register for their first time. Videos of the event are available on YouTube and some photos on Flickr."
The Nordic market of natural cosmetics attracts foreign brands,"According to a new research by Organic Monitor, few Nordic companies would be interested in natural and organic cosmetic products although the regional market is expanding by about 15% a year. “Organic foods are well-established in the Nordic region, with the market share reaching 5% of total food sales in Sweden and Denmark. However, natural and organic cosmetics have much lower adoption rates with below 2% market share,” explains Organic Monitor.  According to the market research company a major factor behind this low interest is the success of the Nordic Swan eco-labelling system. Perceived as the official eco-label of the region, the Nordic Swan is present on a wide range of cosmetics and toiletries. With Nordic companies focusing on the Nordic Swan eco-label, consumers are turning to imported brands from North America, Australasia or other European countries when seeking ‘chemically-clean’ cosmetics.  As a consequence, imported brands comprise up to 95% of natural cosmetic sales in countries such as Finland, claims Organic Monitor. “A growing number of companies are adopting a segmentation approach to market entry, targeting specific channels and / or consumer groups. For instance, the UK firm REN Skincare has made inroads by focusing on beauty retailers and department stores. Aveda, the leading American brand, is concentrating on hair salons and spas,” says Organic Monitor. According to Organic Monitor’s report The Nordic market for natural & organic personal care products, healthy market growth rates are forecast to continue, with growth driven by new product launches and increasing distribution. As has happened in other European countries such as France and Germany, retailer private labels are expected to have a major impact in the development of the market. Marketing and distribution strategies in the natural cosmetics industry will also be discussed at the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit that Organic Monitor is organising in Paris on 18-20 October 2010."
US colour cosmetics market boosted by eye makeup sales,"The dynamism of eye makeup sales in the US sharply contrasts with the dull growth enjoyed by other categories of colour cosmetics. According to market research firm Mintel, since 2004, eye makeup sales have increased 38%, compared to just an 11% increase in the colour cosmetics market overall. Mintel questioned women about their make-up habits and found that mascara was the most dynamic product among colour cosmetics as 65% of respondents report using it. However, eye shadow and eyeliner aren’t far behind: 63% of women surveyed use shadow and 62% use liner.  “Retailers’ offerings seem to be working, as women report using mascara almost five times a week,” says Kat Fay, senior beauty analyst at Mintel. “The focus is now on more dramatic eyes,” he adds. Brow pencils are somewhat less popular, but still enjoy solid market penetration with 38% of women reporting usage. Lipstick and lip gloss remain the most popular colour cosmetic products, achieving the highest penetration rates with 76% of survey respondents. Women report using lipstick and lip gloss six times a week, suggesting that these products are a daily staple. “Incidence of lipstick or lip gloss usage increases with age,” says Kat Fay. “As women get older, lip colour is a relatively easy way to brighten up the face without having to put on a face full of makeup.” Other lip make-up products lag far behind as some 22% of respondents say they use a lip pencil, 9% use a lip stain and just 7% use a compact lip colour. While four out of five women surveyed by Mintel report using makeup, only 31% state that their makeup buying behaviour hasn’t changed as a result of the economy. Other analyses point out the shift towards less expensive segments. Kat Fay suggests retailers highlight innovative ingredients in their products or utilise environment-friendly packaging to attract consumers and jumpstart the stalling beauty market."
Beautystreams puts beauty trends online,"There was hardly any online service to analyse trends in the beauty and cosmetics industry. Beautystreams intends to fills this gap.  For its launch, the agency already offers access to a database of over 100,000 photographs, hundreds royalty free vector prints, and a solid global network of employees, partners and correspondents. The fledgling company based in Paris and New York aims at quickly attracting customers in the beauty industry, mainly the marketers of make-up, skin care and hair products. “What do we offer? High-level analysis and forecasts of trends, by experienced professionals, maximizing the practical benefits of a multimedia online service,” says Lan Vu, founder and CEO of Beautystreams. This former employee of Style Sight wants to bring the analysis of cosmetic trends into the digital age. “Internet allows us to broadcast multimedia data that can be used immediately by our customers. Photos and videos can then be reused easily within client companies, as prints that are sold royalty free."" The core of the service is formed by the trends forecasts that are delivered two times a year, one for each season (autumn-winter spring-summer). Most of the illustrations in the forecasts section are based on photographs from Beautystreams’ team members and correspondents. According to Lan Vu, this strategy avoids any kind of dependency on, sometimes outdated, databases that may provide videos already seen by thousands of people and it also offers subscribers the possibility of using images with HD quality. Just like Lan Vu, who totalizes a 20 year professional background in forecasting trends, or Bengt Jacobsson, a renown forecaster, member of thePremière Vision’s Color Committee and a former employee of Carlin, all forecasters working for Beautystreams have strong professional paths. Beautystreams and its forecasters do not hesitate either to come across information in a variety of sectors, or from the most unexpected experts, that are interviewed every week to share their thoughts on trends in their area of excellence. A chef, a dermatologist, an architect and artists have already delivered their testimony. Once a month, a theme is analyzed through the focus of different industries. On the occasion of Beautystreams’ launch, water was thus the subject of detailed investigations in areas such as architecture, design, decoration, textile, fashion & beauty. Of course, Beautystreams’ offer is not limited to the analysis of these macro-trends or to seasonal forecasts. The company also proposes to enter into concrete stuff by studying how its forecasts can be embodied in different phenotypes (skin or hair colour...). Beautystreams already provides access to a database of more 75,000 photos from fashion shows and cropped on faces and hairstyles. Finally, Beautystreams’ staffs also travel the aisles of beauty tradeshows around the world where they try to hunt out the most innovative developments, or the most representative of the main product trends. The introductory offer for an annual subscription is 10,000 USD for 10 logins."
Professional skin care products: results matter!,"After several years of strong growth, the global market for professional skin care products showed signs of fatigue in 2009.  While Europe and the United States posted substantial declines, the exception to this trend came from the BRIC [1] markets spearheaded by Brazil, which posted growth of 11.1%, according to recently released study Professional Skin Care 2009 Global Series: Market Analysis and Opportunities from consulting and research firm Kline & Company.  The report focuses on product categories and brands sold in professional outlets such as spas and salons, dermatologists’ and plastic surgeons’ offices, and beauty institutes. It also captures sales for professional brands through traditional retail outlets. “The recession’s impact in Europe and the United States resulted in a change in spending patterns, a decline in the frequency of visits to spas and physician’s offices, and a shift to lower-priced brands,” notes Karen Doskow, Industry Manager at Kline. “But even in the face of a gloomy economy, industry leaders fought back with a healthy flow of new product launches, many of which targeted the anti-aging segment.” “Professional skin care marketers acknowledged the need to diversify, segment, and innovate their offerings in order to cater to a change in demand for the products that are preventative or that are proven to help reverse signs of ageing,” Ms Doskow further explains. “Products that were unique, multi-tasking, or offering dual benefits certainly stood out for the recession-stricken consumer.” According to Kline, marketers of professional skin care products must capitalize on the latest scientific findings and innovations in ingredient research that help their products, to some extent, compare to results of cosmetic treatments performed by medical professionals.  “As consumers extend the time between in-office procedures, new products completing or replacing cosmetic procedures will grow in importance.”  Products such as Babor’s Skinovage Nanocell Age Protective Cream Serum, Germaine de Capuccini’s Time Lift Timexpert Rides X or Skinceuticals’ Retexturing Activator are examples of professional skin care products competing with in-office treatments. Anti-ageing products account for 41.1% in the United States and nearly 50% of sales in Europe and Brazil, says the report. Responding to consumer needs, the dynamism of each product category varies on a worldwide basis; skin whitening is a number one concern for marketers in China and Japan, and anti-cellulite treatments are a top priority in Europe or Brazil. Regional diversity also occurs in channel sales. In Brazil, the spas channel posted a whopping 86.2% gain.  In Europe and the United States, the medical care providers channel enjoyed the highest growth. The direct sales channel in the U.S. professional market posted an incredible 10% increase, making it a top trend for the year. In this channel, marketers took charge of building relationships directly with customers through podcasts, and YouTube clips. Incorporating social media outlets into their marketing strategy has become standard practice in recent years. This, in turn, is quickly becoming a dominant way to reinforce brand imaging and promote new products. According to Kline’s FutureView forecasting model, brighter days are ahead for this industry. As an example, the professional skin care market for the United States is predicted to grow by a CAGR [2] of 5.6% through 2014, or if exceptional conditions prevail, the market could grow as high as 11.3% a year."

MakeUp in Paris announces two days of festivities,"“It was necessary to reinforce the link between a profession and its market, giving it an opportunity to show the extent of its talent in serving brands with the help of professionals who stage these wonderful products which are an expression of a beautiful and attractive society,” says Sandra Maguarian, show manager of MakeUp in Paris. It is precisely this alchemy that the Beauteam [1] team wanted to implement. We were not disappointed, far from it. Even a little dazzled sometimes by the enthusiasm of manufacturers, make-up artists, make-up schools and their talented students. MakeUp in Paris in 2010 is also a new form of professional events still more focused, friendlier. All components in the beauty industry will be represented. Be it with formulas, packaging, accessories, design, make-up professionals... “MakeUp in Paris 2010 has already brought together the energies to make of this very first edition, the first one in a very long series!” claim the organiser."
"“Colour cosmetics are a primary need,” Javier González, Cosnova","Premium Beauty News - What is the positioning of Cosnova today? Javier González - With its strongly focused corporate philosophy of offering high quality, innovative, trendy and modern products at exceptionally affordable prices, Cosnova has revolutionized the market for decorative cosmetics with its two brands - Essence and Catrice - in Germany and internationally. Regarding our positioning, Essence is Cosnova’s designated brand for younger consumers, the core target are the 14 to 25 years old, while Catrice is intended for women aged between 25 to 50. Premium Beauty News - How did you address the latest economic crisis? Javier González - Cosnova recorded healthy growth rates and navigated through the crisis very well because of its focus on the low-price segment. In Germany and northern European countries consumers have not been too sensitive to the crisis. Consumption has continued normally or almost normally. In the southern Europe, where the overall consumption was more strongly impacted, Cosnova benefited from the crisis. Actually, women do not see colour cosmetics as a luxury category, but as a primary need, and they will not use less cosmetics because of an economic crisis but clearly they will definitely try to save money and try to find better value. Cosnova is at the crossroads of this process. For us the crisis is more a friend than a foe! Premium Beauty News - What about product innovation? Javier González - Cosnova is characterised by an enormous creativity. One thing that makes us so unique is our huge volume of new products. Every year Cosnova is able to launch 1,000 new products and colours. Among our latest and most remarkable innovations are the “Essence Blackmania” eyeliner, which contains carbon black pigments and which were launched very successfully in 2009 and voted to “Product of the year 2010“, or the “Essence Colour & Shine” eyeshadow, which features an innovative application device and special pigment effects. That is outstanding in the mass market, and Cosnova is one of the first brands to have such a product on shelf. Also mentionable is the “Essence Nail Art” which represents an extensive range of nail styling and nail art products especially for the young consumers. With “Nail Art” it is really easy to make your own nice nail styling at home. Because the “Nail Art” launch was so successful, the range was widened at the beginning of 2010. Another new and innovative product sub-range is the “essence Pocket Beauty”, which features very convenient beauty products to carry in handbags. As far as our Catrice brand is concerned, let’s mention the state of the art nail polish, which combines long lasting effect with extreme shine, and which is available in over 30 shades. Let’s also mention the “Maximum Resist” Mascara that offers full volume and long lasting characteristics. Within 12 months, new colours, new packaging and new formulas will replace half of the standard range. Each year, Cosnova launches 30 theme-orientated, limited editions - 18 for essence and 12 for Catrice. Premium Beauty News - What were Cosnova’s latest investments and developments relating to technology or manufacturing process? Javier González - Despite the crisis we have maintained high investment rates. Considering our high growth rate, we absolutely need to invest continuously. Two years ago, in just six months, Cosnova implemented SAP. Furthermore, considering that consumer prices for Essence products are about 2.00 euros and 3.50 euros for Catrice products, Cosnova has no other choice than to keep all processes extremely focused and efficient. Additionally, Cosnova has invested in new displays - the so-called beauty-shops. 6,000 to 7,000 older displays had been already replaced in shops in Germany and Switzerland at the beginning of 2010. We observed immediately a significant increase in product sales. The last point to mention is our flagship store. Cosnova has established its first retail shop in Offenbach. It is an experiment because we’re not in the retail business, but we’ll definitely learn much about our own retail potential and the shop represents a very good platform to sell other products than cosmetics, for example jewellery, hair accessories, sunglasses, scarves and so on. We want to know if there a potential for a move of Essence outside cosmetics market into a wider world of beauty to offer the consumers the whole beauty package. Premium Beauty News  - Internationally, Cosnova is concentrating its expansion in Middle East, Africa and the USA. Javier González - The positioning of Cosnova in these areas is exactly the same as in Germany. Cosnova has founded and established a company in the US, Cosnova Inc., two years ago. It was definitely the right decision to expand in the middle of the crisis that hit the consumption especially hard. Our corporate philosophy to offer always high quality and up-to-date products at exceptional prices is paying off. The average price of Essence products in the US is about 2 dollars (excluding sales taxes). One year ago Cosnova has successfully started to work with Clicks, a strong retailer in South Africa.  South African consumers consist also in an economically very strong and growing middle class of black people.  In regard to different pigmentation, colours and textures, Cosnova has developed and launched specific products for the South African market. Actually, we did the same for the US market, where there are various ethnic groups with a wide array of different skin types. Premium Beauty News  - What are you expectations for 2011? Javier González - In 2010 Cosnova will cross the 100 million euro line in net sales for the first time and we expect a very strong and healthy double-digit growth rate this year as well as next year."
Global luxury goods market to recover in the short term,"According to a new report [1] by market research firm Global Industry Analysts (GIA), the global luxury goods market should recover poise and gain steady momentum in the short to medium term to reach US$307.3 billion by 2015. The luxury watches market represents the largest segment within the luxury goods market, having contributed a share of about 17% in the total dollar sales, while luxury cosmetics market is projected to be the fastest growing segment over the analysis period 2007-2015. Europe will continue to retain its leadership as a producer and exporter of luxury goods, helped by the advantage of a weaker euro and its influence on luxury goods purchases and increased tourism. “With its high correlation to a country’s GDP, the luxury goods industry is extremely cyclical in nature, with economic ups and downs amplifying the response demand patterns. For instance, in periods of economic boom demand waxes higher than the growth in GDP, while conversely in periods of slowdown, demand recedes rapidly as consumers quickly axe their spending on high-priced luxury goods,” GIA explains. The pal of gloom set over luxury markets in Europe, North America and Japan in 2009, is perfectly illustrative of this trend. These leading luxury markets faced the most severe impact of the global economic recession, with “High Net Worth Individuals” dramatically decreasing their spending. However, a quick bounce back to market fundamentals is expected. “Diversification of the consumer base for luxury goods away from the conventional ultra rich consumers augurs well for the industry in the medium to long-term and as a result of which perception of luxury will emerge well beyond the traditional confines of fashion, and exclusivity to include quality and intrinsic product value,” GIA says. “The changing consumer habits and values are generating enormous opportunities for brands to draw potential customers as well as reinforce their relationships with their more wealthier and absolute luxury shoppers”. Growth in the luxury goods market should also be fuelled by the growing demand in developing Asian countries, such as China and India. Growing awareness over international prestige brands, coupled with rising standards of living, as well as the emergence of new classes of affluent consumers, particularly working women, are the main factors contributing to the penchant for living unique lifestyles in these countries. The Asia-Pacific market is expected to produce the fastest CAGR [2] (15.7%) over the analysis period 2007-2015."
"“I consider myself more as a product maker,” Dany Sanz, Make Up For Ever","“Certainly, Dany Sanz says, trends exist! I remember very clearly the trend of the mid-1980s, when we started Make Up For Ever, with the surge of American culture. It was the times of the Palace one Paris’ most famous and select night club, of glitters, of eccentricity and the beginning of Body Painting.  From the early 1990s, we were back to natural, elegance, chic.  Glitters had become vulgar.  Then arrived the 2000s with a true fascination for the 1960s.  It was the resurgence of Vichy check fabrics, bunches.... Today, we have to admit we are going round in circles! In such circumstances, it’s obvious that one cannot be indifferent to things happening on the outside and many of my colleagues are paying much attention to that. It’s food for my thoughts and ideas, but mostly I am looking for novelty.” As we can see, the creation in 1984 of her own brand, Make Up For Ever, is the logical continuation of a creative process almost permanent. Obviously the debate ""Professional"" vs. "" General Public""  Is not fully solved for this demanding and perfectionist woman. And the transition from a Make Up For Ever almost entirely focused on the development and manufacture of cosmetic products for professionals to today’s Make Up for Ever, a subsidiary of the LVMH Group which has become a reference in the world of cosmetics, operating in more than 45 countries, has not always been and still isn’t that simple. “It’s true, that there might be a bit of an unsolved issue here and I am far from being indifferent to the question,” she admits. “But at the same time, experience has shown that the professional approach was the right one. When I developed five years ago, the HD range (standing for High Definition), with performances that truly suited, the make-up requirements of artists subject to the raw precision of movie or television pictures, people were surprised that my approach was not more focused on general public. But I am attached to that pro image. And this range that I’m still continuing to develop, has had and continues to encounter great success with consumers”. The HD range, by the way, is continuously expanding. ""I was the first to develop an HD talcum-free powder and I’ve currently developed an HD blush"", she adds. Regarding the current trend consisting in sophisticated packaging and accessories that facilitate the make-up gesture Dany Sanz considers “it’s more a gadget than shear innovation”. “There isn’t a thousand ways to put make-up on!  The real innovation must lie in the product itself and not in its applicator or its packaging. Which doesn’t mean, she acknowledges, that there aren’t any real technical advances, such as airless, which help preserve product performances. This does not mean, either, that we are not interested in packaging. We have planned for instance to change all our packs for eye shadows and we have decided to design our own moulds”. Finally, concerning current changes in legislation which consists in banning more and more products, “it is really the toughest and most serious challenge our profession will need to address in the years to come”, she insists. Dany Sanz will tell the story of Make Up For Ever will during the conferences at Make Up in Paris, on June 24 and 25, Espace Pierre Cardin."
Economic downturn hit U.S. spas hard,"The recession hit spas hard Diagonal Reports reveals in a new report [1]. “Spas describe 2009 as a disaster”, says the market research firm. Revenues fell by 15% compared to the previous year. “Such a drop shocked spas which had become accustomed to continuous expansion. A decade of double digit growth had led to oversupply of spas, which has made the problem worse. In addition, costs had spiralled out of control during the boom. Initially, spas delayed their response to falling revenues and did not react – by reducing prices - until late 2009”. Massage and facial treatments account for more than half of revenues in spas. According to Diagonal Reports, changes in people’s lifestyles (such as prolonged computer use) and their desire to improve their wellbeing have driven demand for massages. It augurs well for the future of spas that these massage therapies attract the widest range of consumer segments in terms of age and gender. Facial skincare is also one of the most recession resistant spa treatments. Consumers are willing to continue spending and even to pay premium prices for quality professional services to maintain the face, which is their most visible body part. Diagonal Reports also notes that an unusual situation has emerged as regards brand share in the spa market. “Long established companies in the personal care market failed to develop suitable spa lines, leaving a gap in the market which has been filled by mainly new start-ups. Spas served as the launchpad for the development of an entirely new category of beauty care products.” Organic and science brands have filled in the gap and taken over this market, accounting for nearly all sales and have squeezed out traditional beauty brands in the process. According to Diagonal Reports, no significant upturn is expected in spa spending until 2011 or 2012. The budget-minded consumer is here to stay and the free spending levels of 2007 and before will not return any time soon. Spas must now move into a more mature phase of their market development. Spa usage has been democratised and spas have gone mainstream. The consumer switch from luxury to maintenance treatments benefits a certain type of spa operators. Convenience is the key word. Compact services are now in demand and spas which offer “smaller price and smaller time packages” to their clients are now expanding in the US."
"“We are in an era of greater limpidity of the complexion,” Damien Dufresne","Damien Dufresne, whose outsized talent built him a reputation, will express his vision of makeup through a gallery of photos exposed during the two day event, 24 and 25 June, at the Espace Cardin, Paris. Damien Dufresne is used to work with prestigious companies in the beauty industry, such as Amore Pacific, Intercos or L’Oreal.  In cooperation with MakeUp in Paris [1], he has accepted to share his personal insight on the world of makeup. MakeUp in Paris - At 22 years old, Manager of a hairdressing salon, in Lille -one of the busiest cities in the North of France, employing 15 people, then Manager of a ""make-up bar"" in Paris in 1997, a few steps away from the Place des Victoires, you obviously have a strong entrepreneurial spirit! Damien Dufresne - That’s true! It’s one side of my nature. It probably helps me to better understand the constraints of companies I’m asked to work with. Incidentally, it’s through this ""makeup bar"" and because of my privileged contacts with consumers, that the Amore Pacific Group got interested in me. And, as you know, I have been working for ten years as Artistic Director for the Hera range, but I’m also a makeup man for the trend books of the Intercos Group and make-up man for the L’Oreal events. MakeUp in Paris - But above all, you are a ""make–up man""! Damien Dufresne - Yes, I consider myself a make-up man and I pride myself of saying so. The side I like the least is the ""Make-up Artist"" one, I prefer saying I am a craftsman. A craftsman is someone who works with his hands. Which also involves passion. It takes time to become a make-up man. I first learned the technique and it then took me some time to forget all about it to only let my inspiration express itself. Today what means a lot to me is probably what interested my industry partners in the first place: working on the global design of a make-up range, participate in the lab to the development of new colors materials and textures, draw on my ""studio"" experience to use the creative and ground-breaking side of it and use my knowledge of what the ""woman in the street"" demands to adapt it to the everyday make-up. MakeUp in Paris - What is the purpose of make-up? Damien Dufresne - It is above all an element of fun, a moment of pleasure. It’s only made to make you feel better. We cannot make a woman actually look more beautiful. On the other hand, with make-up, she can have that feeling of looking beautiful and therefore more self-assertive. That’s what counts! The perception of beauty is something very personal too. We’re all beautiful to someone ... Beauty can sometimes also be exotic because of its differences. For my part, I am susceptible to Asian beauty because it has an element of mystery to it. I have done quite a few make-ups on women and I am always amazed to see how one brush stroke can change the look a woman takes at herself. And this last look in her mirror illustrates the moment when she finds herself again, ready to face scrutinizing looks. At the same time, make-up is something ephemeral, it’s a game, the game of seduction, nothing more. MakeUp in Paris - What do you think are currently the major trends? Damien Dufresne - I don’t like speaking of ""trends"" that much, because that would mean that all women should wear make up the same way, I prefer personalized advices because each woman is different, each woman is unique. A make-up changes throughout life. A successful make is also a make-up you only do once for one woman only. But to answer your question, we can say that we are in an era of greater limpidity as far as complexion is concerned, thanks to new technologies, that eyeshadow are brighter and that lipstick is making a great comeback. MakeUp in Paris - Where do you draw your inspiration from? Damien Dufresne - Inspiration comes from the woman who is wearing your make-up, the important thing is the emotion that must arouse from make-up. The same type of emotion, all things considered, I find when visiting an art gallery. The technique is important, but what matters most is imagination! Serge Mansau told me one day: ""Never let go the hand of the child you were once... or you will lose yourself"". I believe he was also thinking of the proportion of poetry we all have within ourselves. MakeUp in Paris - What will be the highlights of your presence at MakeUp in Paris? Damien Dufresne - What changes the most today is that I take pictures myself of the make ups I did with my colleagues. It’s no longer the vision of a photographer on the work of a make-up artist, it’s the same and single vision. But I don’t think of myself as a photographer, it’s a full-time job, just like mine, it was just the desire to get behind the camera."
Foundations: key factors of success,"For women, finding the right foundation is similar to the quest for the Holy Grail. ""It’s like finding the right pair of jeans”, and that’s saying something! Very receptive to advice from ""experts"" - girlfriends, specially bloggers, internet users in general, and even in very special cases, the pharmacy’s sales staff and ultimately, selective- they will use whatever time and money it takes, multiplying tests until they find the right product. The product which, among other qualities ""melts in into the skin leaving no lines, concealing imperfections with no plaster effect, and which holds"" So once they have found it, not surprisingly, they stick to it ... Until a bigger, more beautiful and efficient product appears, until there is a change in their skin, more sensitive, drier, oilier, more mature - until the desire for a change is back! Women want the packaging to be aesthetic and practical. And even if they don’t slip their foundation case in their hand bag, they still want it to be an option, therefore glass, they appreciate otherwise, has no place, they believe, in the universe of complexion. Moreover, there are two opposing camps in the field of packaging: some are in favor of a pump bottle-only system , which they consider hygienic and handy, while the others no longer want to hear about them, complaining about out of reach product drying up at the bottom precisely because of these pump-bottles! Texture should be fluid but not too liquid; in compact version, soft and velvet-like, or in the form of mousse. ""It should glide easily on skin"", ""melt into skin"". Texture is women’s first real contact with the product; texture allows them to apply easily or not foundation ... So, if they dislike a texture, they will have a tendency to reject the foundation in a whole! It never will have a negative influence, it will only add to the positive side of a judgment. Women are no experts in putting make-up on, they say! So they appreciate all the help they can get to easily apply the product, including the texture, whether fluid or velvet-like. What about applicators? Of course, they use sponges, brushes, roll-ons when available, but they often end up using their fingertips. An ideal foundation should cover but not mask, it should melt in but not be inexistent. It should conceal imperfections, without marking fine lines, with no plaster effect, no lines, in a word, it must be natural not to say ""undetectable"". Even if women believe that a 12,16 or 24 hour foundation is more a discourse used by brands than a fact, -still the product must be long lasting and keep the skin from shinning or drying up. They expect so much from the product and its properties that they are eager for promises. But be careful, better offer little than not hold your promises. If the product claims to be Infallible, Tone on Tone, with Lifting Effect, and of 16 or 24 hour duration... then it better be. Otherwise, women will go for it the first time, but won’t be attracted a second time on the contrary they will be extremely critical with products / brands that disappointed them. There are a number of internet users to regret not finding the suitable colour for their skin. And the extremes –very clear skins, mixed-skins- are the ones complaining the most. If sometimes women find prices too high, it is usually indicative of a dissatisfaction with the purchased product. Actually, they are willing to pay the price for the cult product, the one that achieves everything. But be careful again, if they loosen the purse strings, they want their money’s worth: in which case it’s zero tolerance. Another interesting fact is that they also gauge the price by the quantity of product required for a good make-up which explains why some expensive foundations are considered worthwhile because they are used up less quickly than others, ""a small dab is enough""… The ideal foundation looks like a Holy Grail even harder to get hold of for: – Middle-aged women: they are seeking advice. How must they put make-up on, what product should they use, which one will erase their imperfections and have a real tensing effect?  In her case, there’s virtually no prescription from Internet users. – Women with oily skins: which product should they use to avoid a shiny complexion? Prescription from Internet users: a mixture of foundation + powder. – Women with sensitive skins: when soothing creams or anti-redness creams give no results, what is the best way to conceal the small red spots and other symptoms generated by sensitive skin? Prescription from Internet users: 1/ products from the pharmacy and/or pharmacist’s advice. 2/a mixture of products (green-based cream + day cream + foundation). – Women with dry skins: which product should they use to avoid dehydrated skin? Prescription from Internet users: ultra-rich moisturizer + fluid foundation."
Cosmoprof Bologna: taking stock,"Premium Beauty News - What was your feeling regarding this new edition of Cosmoprof, prior to the opening day?

The impact on others was more serious, only 60 meetings out of 120 for the SPA. Hairdressers for the ""On Hair"" shows arriving from London could not make it to Bologna, while those who were coming from Paris were able to participate after travelling by car, thanks to our intervention. Nevertheless, because of the hype we did to have selective perfumery settle again in Bologna as well as significant investments in terms of communication, we can say that this edition of Cosmoprof was a success: the number of visitors increased by 4.88% compared to last year with 6,808 more visitors. The number of foreign visitors was of 33,404 out of 146,331 visitors overall. Premium Beauty News - Competition between the major international shows of the Beauty business is not weakening. What is your insight for the future concerning your event? Aureliana de Sanctis - Cosmoprof does not fear competition. Our show has been the # 1 show in the beauty industry for 43 years. Shows organized by competitors are at the same time niches events and finally very local events. They are very much different from Cosmoprof who is acknowledged as being the largest international show in the world and the only one guaranteeing an international platform with its Las Vegas and Hong Kong editions. If there is a different offer, we are remaining in a situation of free competition. It’s up to the exhibitors to decide where they want to invest depending on their business objectives. Cosmoprof, since its creation in the 60s, followed the development of the beauty sector and has always kept its promises in terms of reliability and quality; all the exhibitors we have met agreed to that. We are grateful to all the exhibitors who in 2010 trusted us and helped us to achieve a prestigious and useful event for the sector. In the future we will continue with the aim that this event remains not only a show but also a place for meeting people, exchanging ideas and sharing experiences. A true multimedia and multisensory platform facilitating the development of the Beauty world. Premium Beauty News - What do you think of the opening in a few months of a new tradeshow, Intercharm, in Milan? Aureliana de Sanctis - Competition is the spice of business. We are in a free market and we are working to improve our show either in terms of content, developing our own features, or in terms of spaces. Intercharm is a project that we are observing with appropriate attention, as a local show intending to be the expression of the Italian market. Premium Beauty News - The centre of gravity of the beauty business is moving more and more towards the Asian area. A situation that can only benefit to Hong Kong tradesow. Aureliana de Sanctis - Cosmoprof Asia is a well known show playing a leading role in the development of the cosmetics business in Asia including Japan, Australia, Taiwan and Korea. This year, it will be the 15th edition of the show and we noticed that the nature of it is changing: at first an event focusing on the support to foreign brands to help them find a retail system in Asia, it has gradually changed to become a business platform facilitating the creation of new strategic partnerships in technology, production and retail. Today, Cosmoprof Asia is acknowledged as being the second benchmark in the world: all the players in the beauty industry meet during the first quarter in Bologna, then they go to Hong Kong, with a wide participation of buyers and exhibitors attending the show, especially from France. Remember that we are present in mainland China with Guangzhou International Beauty Expo, the largest trade show in China, which is getting great results. Given our performances in Asia, we are looking very closely for opportunities in Beijing and Shanghai. Premium Beauty News - What about your new show in Turkey? Aureliana de Sanctis - BeautyEurasia in Istanbul is another very important project in a rapidly developing area in terms of cosmetic products consumption. Cosmoprof and BeautyEurasia will provide a new professional platform to reach professionals and distributors in this area. The area includes countries such as Turkey, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa: a target of 500 million people. Will congregate there people from, the Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan and parts of eastern Russia."
U.S. make-up users want simplicity from their brands,"Market Force Information, a customer intelligence and market survey company, has examined which cosmetic brands are most popular among U.S. consumers and why, as well as their favourite places to shop for cosmetics. The survey was conducted in March 2010 among 5,000 consumers [1]. When the consumers were asked what they loved most about their favourite makeup line, they chose brand trust over all of the other factors - the actual product attributes mattered much less. More than two thirds said they love their makeup because they trust the brand, while only one third cited loving it “because it feels wonderful.” Surprisingly, claims such as “humane testing” or “environmentally safe” were not weighted strongly and emerged toward the bottom of the list. According to the beauty survey conducted by Market Force Information, Cover Girl is consumers’ favourite cosmetics brand. Out of 60 cosmetic brands, Cover Girl was cited by 14 percent as their favourite, placing it on top. Clinique was second on the list with 10 percent of the mentions, and Maybelline (L’Oreal) and Mary Kay tied for third with 8 percent each. Cover Girl led the other brands in most of the attributes consumers care about most, scoring highest in categories such as great value, brand trust, wears well throughout the day and easy, no-mess application. Clinique was named second in brand trust and rated highest of all the brands in the uses humane testing/is environmentally safe category. Although Mary Kay was the fourth favourite cosmetics brand, it still scored well for several attributes, including ranking third for brand trust. “When we drilled down into our data to determine which brands appealed to different types of makeup users, we discovered that the cosmetic enthusiasts—’cosmaholics’ and ’aspiring stylists’—experiment with lots of makeup and no single brand stands out to them,” said Janet Eden-Harris, chief marketing officer for Market Force. “Meanwhile, those characterized in the study as an ’everyday woman’ or ’minimalist’ exuded much more brand loyalty, and Cover Girl was their clear choice.” A common sentiment that emerged in the survey is that makeup wearers want a natural and authentic look, rather than something “ultra-modern” or “sophisticated”. More than 40 percent selected the adjectives “natural” and “no fuss” to describe their favourite makeup line. Conversely, adjectives like “edgy” and “sassy” were at the bottom of the list. When consumers were asked where they go to purchase their cosmetics, their answers showed there is no one clear retailer category of choice. The majority - 29 percent - said they purchase them from mass retailers like Walmart and Target, and another 21 percent buy from drug stores such as CVS or Walgreens. Slightly fewer, about one in five, shop for cosmetics in department stores. Sephora was a crowd favourite in the specialty retailer category. Out of the 12 percent who reported buying cosmetics from specialty retailers, more than one third said they purchase from Sephora. Six percent of respondents had been to a home party in the past six months and two thirds of them saw the Mary Kay makeup line, although only 1 percent said they shop for cosmetics at home parties."
Fiabila: successful strategy in the nail polish segment ,"Premium Beauty News - Apparently, the nail polish segment still has been spared from the crisis. Pierre Miasnik - It is a fact that nail polish is trendy and getting trendier every day. The European market in 2009 shows a double digit growth rate and is not declining, quite the contrary. As far as we are concerned, our consolidated turnover has made a leap of 20% between 2008 and 2009 and the trend should be even higher in 2010. Premium Beauty News - Since your creation in 1977, your strategy development is as regular as clockwork. In 1996, as a forerunner, you implant yourself in Mexico. In 1999, you set foot in India. In 2000 in Japan and the following year ... in the United States. What is your next move? Pierre Miasnik - Like everyone else, we are of course carefully following what’s going on in South America, particularly Brazil. And this year could well be the one to establish ourselves on this continent. But we also have ambitions for our main and historical production units in France, in Maintenon and Plaisir. We have eventually obtained the rights to use a large area adjacent to the former which, in addition, recently received significant investment concerning production safety. As for the conditioning unit, in Plaisir which employs 95 people, eleven of them dedicated to Quality Control, it will receive two new lines next June. Our Indian unit is being expanded with the construction of a new production tool that takes into account climate related issues allowing the plant to be upgraded at the required quality levels to support the inexorable market development. Premium Beauty News - You pride yourself on the fact of only producing nail polish! Why is it so? Pierre Miasnik - For a very simple reason! You can only manufacture properly things upon which you have a knowledge! This trade is already complex and difficult enough to try and satisfy increasingly more demanding customers, why do you want us to develop other businesses thus reducing our investment capacities in our core business? I will even stress on the fact that our ""mono-product"" position can only help reassure and reinforce our current and future customers. Especially since we are asked to comply with Flawless Quality policies which only a company entirely dedicated to its business can claim providing. Moreover, do you know that twenty people on a total of 85 work every day at Fiabila Maintenon, in the R&D department. Not every company can say that. And we are quite proud of having established control standards which have become genuine ""standards"" in the industry. Premium Beauty News - Isn’t it all about everything having to be ""still more this and still more that"" for nail polishes? Pierre Miasnik - If you want to caricature, yes! Actually it is ""still more""! And it starts with ""still more"" regulatory constraints on components, manufacturing standards and level of purity. You cannot imagine the complexity of our business whose fundamentals are constantly questioned at the mercy of a particular administrative decision issued from a country whose intentions are not always focused on protecting users but are really technical trade barriers. As far as we are concerned, we have implemented very stringent procedures at all production levels to ensure full compliance of our products to regulations and standards across the world. Premium Beauty News - The industry is taking more and more interest in water-based nail polish. What is your point of view? Pierre Miasnik - We have applied for two patents on water-based nail polishes and of course, we are still focusing on the subject. But you must bear in mind that the more the proprieties of solvent-based varnishes improve in terms of ease of application, drying, brilliance and hold, the more the gap automatically widens with water-based polishes. Especially when “85% bio sourced"" polishes will be available upon registration of our patents. Concerning our strategic priorities, we can point out our research efforts to improve the performance of nail care and filing a patent on the use of aldehydes, and finally, our research efforts in polymers with the creation six months ago, of a brand new department, at Maintenon."
ADA and Marietta join forces to serve international amenity market,"Two leading hotel cosmetics producers have joined forces in an effort to significantly expand their business in the worldwide amenity market: ADA Cosmetics International, Europe’s leading producer of hotel cosmetics, and Marietta Corporation, one of the largest hotel amenity manufacturers in North America.  The two companies intend to create synergies between their key competencies to better serve the international market. Their cooperative activities will focus on international bids to offer international hotel chains a worldwide, single-source solution to their amenity needs. Marietta and ADA will provide a wide portfolio of quality cosmetics that can be distributed to any hotel location in the world, especially in North America, South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. “Our customers want modern products of consistently high quality that can meet any international requirements including reliable delivery anywhere in the world,” says Donald Sturdivant, chief executive officer of Marietta. Bothe companies intend to consolidate their international market share and their international growth. According to Wilhelm B. Könning, CEO of ADA Group, the partnership with Marietta could be a huge competitive advantage in international bids. Aside from these joint activities, both companies will continue to approach their core markets in North America and Europe independently. The companies own manufacturing facilities across the United States and in Europe. Partner quality-control and sourcing facilities are located around the world. Production facilities are ISO 9001 and REACH compliant in Europe, FDA-registered in the United States, ISO 9000 and 1400 compliant in Asia, and strictly follow current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) worldwide."
Biodiversity: lack of trust in the cosmetics industry,"In 2009, the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) launched a worldwide biodiversity barometer, to measure levels of awareness of the French, British, Americans and Germans. In 2010, it was extended to test Brazilians. The results of the 2010 barometer were revealed at UEBT’s annual conference “The Beauty of Sourcing with Respect” on April 16, in Paris. According to the survey, common knowledge about biodiversity has progressed in one year: from 56% to 60%. A significant point: Brazilians show the highest awareness of biodiversity, 94% of people have already heard of it, out of which 47% could give a correct definition. “In general, nature is ever more present in the minds of the consumers. If Fair Trade remains today the most well known notion, deforestation and the conservation of biodiversity are equally important. Here too, Brazilians are in the lead, with biodiversity a key theme, much more important than Fair Trade,” says UEBT in a release. According to the UEBT, respondents do not have much trust in companies from the food and cosmetics sector, and particularly of their ethical sourcing practices related to biodiversity. “Nevertheless, it is urgent to build this relationship of trust, since there is such a high number of people who would be ready to stop buying a product from a specific brand, if they knew ethical and environmental rules had been neglected in its sourcing and production process,” says the UEBT. This applies to the food sector (81%), and even more so to the cosmetics industry (84%) according to the survey. Similarly to the compliance with natural and organic criteria, an independent third-party organisation appears as a guarantee of objectivity. Actually, an official report of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) already noted in 2008 that few of the companies involved in sourcing the ingredients incorporate some or any of the requirements of the convention into their practices. According to the UEBT research, only 21 of the top 100 companies in the cosmetics industry mention biodiversity, out of which a small minority claims to take it into account in its sourcing practices. This being said, it is possible to note an increase of mentions of biodiversity in the press: 2009 witnessed an increase in the number of articles on this matter in France, Germany, the UK and the USA by 32%. This just goes to show that the conservation of biodiversity, an emerging issue in 2009, has now become a topic of debate in environmental matters."
Marionnaud relies on private labels and exclusivities to boost sales,"Building on the successes of its first incursion in the market, using its own brand name with its Bio par Marionnaud range (organic range), launched in 2008, and of its bath products range marketed in autumn 2009, Marionnaud announced the launch of a new range of face and body care products: les soins essentiels de beauté Marionnaud (essential beauty care products by Marionnaud). Reflecting the will of the brand to invest significantly in this direction, the new Marionnaud line, will be backed this time by a real global launch strategy, with a total of 11 countries targeted. After investing heavy in a network of 1,200 outlets, the company wants to intensify the development of the Marionnaud brand by placing its private labels at the heart of its offer. In doing so, Marionnaud follows the lead of Sephora, the other giant in selective distribution, whose strategy for a masstige offer using its own name turned out to be a real success. With 35 products and 29 high quality care formulas, Marionnaud intends to provide a complete offer with “a quality leveling the one of major brands” with “extremely competitive prices” (average selling price 10 euros), while allowing consumers to enjoy beauty tips offered by selective perfumery. The new range, available in shops as of May 25, 2010, features face care products such as make-up removers, cleansers, moisturizers, a range of toners, a body scrub and first wrinkle care tonics, and beauty care products for the body, feet and hands. “The development of private labels allows us to respond to needs that traditional brands cannot deal with. This also allows us to take an interest in market segments, the expectations of which we are aware of, by offering quality products, often cheaper, while increasing our customers loyalty by showing them we are paying attention to their needs”, commented Miek Vercouteren, General manager of Marionnaud France. Another objective of the group: to reinforce its identity by symbolizing it in products bearing its values. With a market share of 27.8% in value at end of December 2009 and nearly 270 beauty parlors in France, Marionnaud considers itself as a care expert. Hence, the company has imposed on its suppliers very demanding development criteria, with stringent specifications regarding formulation in order to ensure that formulas are allergen-free, paraben-free and with no synthetic mineral oil, and with original or just comfortable galenic forms. In the end, Marionnaud selected two European manufacturers (Intercosmétiques in France and Intercos in Italy), usual partners for the most prestigious cosmetic brands. Regarding the quality of advice provided, Marionnaud also seems determined to keep promises which were often not up to the situation in the past, with selective channels. Perfectly in line, in fact, with what stated Miek Vercouteren during the last debate organized by the CEW France. A training program dedicated to the new skincare range, has been set up. ""We want to share with sales consultants and customers tips concerning the appropriate gestures to apply products and turn them into beauty rituals. In France, the program is implemented both in the Marionnaud Academy, and from the e-learning portal where product data sheet and selling tips are offered to consultants"", the company said in a statement. Marionnaud has also recently signed its most recent exclusivity with the Danish make-up brand, Gosh, which will be distributed as of the month of May as an exclusivity in 100 outlets. Earlier this month, the Prize for the 2010 Best men’s fragrance, granted by the Fragrance Foundation France and Marie Claire magazine, was awarded to Jamais Le Dimanche by Egofacto, a brand retailed exclusively by Marionnaud since January 2009."
Perfume industry professionals want to react against the crisis,"Rather grim were the first observations made by the dozen participants to the roundtable organized last week, in Paris, by the association, Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW) France. France is seeing perfume, lose each year more market shares.  66% of shoppers entering a perfumery store leave the outlet without having bought something! Whose fault is it? How can the issue be solved? A very rich debate of nearly three hours restoring in the end, some hope. Clear-cut observations. ""Too many perfumes kill perfumes! ...,a perfume can’t be compared to a brand of washing powder! .... Prohibitive prices compared to the quality of the offer ...! There is no more desire! ... A lack of listening from the industry on what consumers ’really’ want!.... A sales and marketing strategy based on short term profits ... An overall decline in quality ... Poorly trained mass retail outlets who do not properly convey the right messages on perfume brands and their fragrances..."" Meanwhile, the crisis has not helped. A crisis ""which, unlike political correctness, is far from over yet"", insisted Mercedes Erra, Executive President of Euro RSCG. A crisis that has further enlarged the gap between an industry standing its ground and consumers whose values have obviously been deeply impacted by the recent months of economic events. ""We would have every reason to be, recalled one participant in the audience, as we belong to the million of French people who only have, altogether, 150 euros to barely manage to make ends meet at the end of each month!”  It seems only normal, in such conditions, that the first purchase criterion has become ""Is it useful or not?"". The second one ""Am I right to buy this?"", the third one, ""Does it please me?"", the fourth one, ""Can I make it myself?"", the fifth one, ""Can I wait for the sales?"". 91% of French people wish to improve their consumption habits! They are only 60% in England to highlight the same need and 64% in the United States. What matters the most is ""quality""! Other interesting changes in consumers scale of values, according to Mercedes Erra, ""It’s the end with dialogue for the sake of dialogue and innovation for the sake of innovation! People want the basics, want to see the evidence of a real know-how"". A series of changes that are not going to be to everyone’s taste in the perfume industry. ""To some people only"", stressed José Manuel Albesa, Chief Brand Officer, Puig. ""Because for our part, we tackled this issue head-on relying on the fundamentals of our business. In other words, by giving time to time, by paying more attention to criticism than to praise, by being able to stop everything and start over again regardless of the industrial and commercial commitment, and above all by doing everything in our power to insure that the product actually expresses a story! And take risks!"". What has changed in recent months? Quite honestly, a lot of things even if, in the opinion of speakers, there is a long way to go from honest intentions to acts. ""In any case, the work can only be achieved together"", noted Joel Palix, President of Clarins Fragrance Group. ""We must return to real creation. More money needs to be invested in the product and less elsewhere. Don’t forget that a so called ’popular’ perfume only represents at best 3% of consumers! Retail channels need to be more selective about the products they accept in outlets and our contacts with customers must be the result of a true relationship"". Message received loud and clear by Miek Vercouteren, CEO of Marionnaud France, whose commitments hold in six points: – more brand segmentation and brand selection,
– limit the offer,
– increase value added,
– pay closer attention to what consumers have to say,
– know  more about the elements of ""value"" of the brand,
– improve the training of sales consultants. ""There has been and still are too many launches and, especially, too many unnecessary launches "" adds Céline Sanzey, In charge of the perfume pole at Sephora. ""We must abandon the struggle for the gain of market shares to contribute instead altogether to market growth! I am also expecting from brands what I call ‘categorical logic’ according to existing outlets. The same brand will not express itself the same way from one outlet to the other and from one shopping environment to the other! And above all, I expect creativity!"" Now, specifically, for Chloé Jay, Director General of Keihl France’s, L’Oreal Luxury Products Division, “We must admit that creativity was not at hand. We must stop doing marketing just for the sake of marketing and try designing a ‘a great classic’. Finally, many in the industry will have done the same thing! For instance, we must review the olfactory composition, review the tests in order to take into consideration different criteria in relation with emotion, sensitivity...” ""Olfactory... , let’s talk about it"" insisted Armand de Villoutreys, President of Firmenich’s Fine Fragrance World Division. ""With over 900 launches per year worldwide, the industry has mechanized creation. But creation must be protected, the level of requirement must be upgraded. We need clearer briefs. It is clear that the value of the perfume element has declined over recent years and this cannot last! As for testing, one must stop ‘averaging’ the brand!"" ""A long way to go,"" emphasized Marc Smia, founding partner of Kea & Partners. ""It is clear that the gain in market shares might kill the market. We must elaborate and set up a strategy of allies. Without a strong and powerful purpose, there is a high risk of trivialization of the market"". Yet, a major absentee at this roundtable, the whole industry of packaging and full service. ""That’s right"", stated José Manuel Albesa from Puig. ""It’s an essential and very experienced link that we are also much more involving at the beginning of our briefs"". Three hours of debate and freely exchanged talks, between, for once, all the industry players, who demonstrated undoubtedly that the sector had perfectly-integrated all the issues and challenges. ""Brands have understood the need to clarify their offer,"" concluded Barbara Le Portz. ""In a word ...., fewer but better !... And it’s probably necessary to stop trying to please everyone by placing the consumer at the center of the game. It would be better to try and increase the market than to try and increase ones market shares. As for retail channels they have also understood the essential part they had to play in this new process that’s taking place. By upgrading the training of sales consultants. We must enchant customers again!""."
IL Cosmetics : “The offer must suit the real needs of the market!”,"Premium Beauty News - What will be the strong points of your presence in Bologna? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Our three entities, International Lacquers, Luxcos and Interpack, specialized in the manufacture and conditioning of nail polish and make-up products, will take this opportunity to unveil their new collections of nail polishes, lip gloss, mascaras and eyeliners. Actually, we are the only nail polish manufacturer with significant market shares to have extended our activity to the production of make-up. We relied on our mastery of technologies required for developing complex products such as nail polishes to work on other products. In addition, nail polish is a niche market, our strong growth, also needs to rely on make-up products considering their potential of expansion. The market of exclusive subcontractors for nail polish, our core business, includes 4 main players. This figure could also drop in the future. Regarding our scope of activities, it is international, with customers in over 40 countries. We take advantage of our position to conduct detailed analysis in order to present the appropriate trends for each market. So, we collect information on the different markets on which our clients, with whom we have a privileged relationship, are present. These detailed information concern formulas but also trends. We can also rely on an international network of consultants and we work with different trends offices too. Data collected by these various means help us to keep track of markets evolutions in terms of trends, distribution channels, but also in terms of prices or even sales trends. We then proceed to an analysis of needs and positioning for each of or our clients to offer them customized solutions at all levels. Packaging for example, plays an important part. For nail polish, the brushes need to be adapted to the formulas they come along with. Thus, a wide and flat brush will be appropriate for instance to apply in one stroke a coat of nail polish. To provide our customers with quality solutions, we mainly work with European suppliers. Finally, in order to assess the performance of products we propose, a team of experts will test them. In addition, a consumer panel meets weekly. Premium Beauty News - What current trends were you able to identify with the help of these studies and how do they directly impact the ranges you offer? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Several can be identified on the color cosmetics market. Firstly, consumers want to feel totally confident with their make-up: they want to be sure it will hold all day through, regardless of their program, without blurring nor running. For nails, long wear is a key criterion in the same way quick drying is. These two main directions in  formulas have long been antagonistic. We can now offer formulas combining the two performances. Concerning eyes, consumers today, want products which will stay true all day long, such as new generation smudges or water proofs. The ease of use and comfort during application are also important criteria. For nail polish, for example, formulas must be non streaking and must apply easily and evenly on nails. Our sensory analysis tests for all products, take into consideration, different applications criteria such as the glide of applicators, comfort or coverage ... Premium Beauty News - But it is not just a question of ease of use. The consumers clearly expect other things? Aurélie Ignaccolo - Products must be enriched with active ingredients so to bring benefits. It is the emergence of ""care benefit"" products. Thus, for nail polish many formulas are now enriched with active ingredients which help strengthening nails, nourishing them or promoting their growth. Consumers expect from enamels and makeup products to do more than just provide color. Glosses may also have a plumping, smoothing / softening or moisturizing effect. We will have the pleasure of presenting at Cosmoprof, each of our formulas meeting different markets needs."
Paradoxes of the market of niche fragrances,"It was a brilliant idea! This is of course what say today organizers of Esxence, which just held its second edition in Milan. For attending exhibitors, there is really no comparison with the dedicated hall at Cosmoprof Bologna, the so called ""Masterpieces"" section. ""We were dealing with real professionals during these four days, and all this at the same time in a very friendly atmosphere much better adapted to our market."" A market, very difficult to identify. The organizers of Esxence would rather refer to it as an ""art perfumery,"" a concept which combines products quality and originality with a special attention given to distribution. A perfumery of character that contrasts with mass production, deeply impacted by crisis and which professionals attending the event believed is even hit harder by ""a real identity crisis."" ""Launching a new perfume like you launch a brand of detergent cannot help improve the situation,"" they explained. So do niche perfumery brands manage to succeed where others are struggling? ""Small successful brand, there are a lot more than you think,"" says Sylvie Dumontier from Parfums L.T Piver. ""To start with ours!"". L.T Piver is now worth 7 million euros in turnover, with 40 people, a factory in Chartres, a presence in 150 outlets in Italy, 45 perfume shops in France and 150 beauty parlors. ""And we have just started tackling the U.S. market,"" adds Sylvie Dumontier. Bashar Nasri, President of France Excellence and owner of the brand Maison Dorin shares the same enthusiasm. An amazing and stunning performance that begins in 1998 with the acquisition of this brand. ""Maison Dorin was born in the latest period of history of the Ancien Régime where art and beauty had all the highest honors"", explains Bashar Nasri. Maison Dorin is one of the oldest heir to the tradition of French perfumery recognized by the choice of the aristocracy. As of 1780, it becomes supplier to the Court. Thereafter, its story is modeled in large part on the international influence of France. The Paris expositions in 1839, 1855, 1867 and 1889 opened the eyes of foreign merchants to French luxury products, and won an unequivocal place among exporters of England, Russia, Spain and the Americas and worldwide. Because it is also a paradox for this Milanese show entirely dedicated to the art of fragrance and with no counterpart in France, that more than half of all stands were rented by French brands. Nothing surprising considering the French tradition of excellence in that matter. However, these niche brands, or of art perfumery, find it difficult to become popular on the French market! The first explanation seems to lie in the distribution system. While in France independent perfumeries were massively absorbed by specialized chain stores - such as Sephora, Marionnaud or other Beauty Success - they resisted much better in Italy. And Italy has almost twice as many specialized outlets than France. And in order to not share the same destiny as their transalpine colleagues, Italian independent retailers invested heavily in quality and differentiation. And France still represents 41% of total perfumes and cosmetics imports in Italy. Not surprising then, that some of the most successful French companies congregated at a show almost tailor-made for them and their suppliers. Like Marie Huet, a passionate who in March 2007 took in charge the destiny of the Parfums d’Orsay, a very old perfume house to which she decided to restore its former glory. ""Le Chevalier d’Orsay, she explains was born in 1801 to a Bonapartist general and a mother Baroness. In 1908, la Compagnie Française des Parfums d’Orsay is created. Over 5 million perfume bottles are sold in 1931"". Like Parfums Nicolaï, whose story is more recent. Patricia de Nicolaï and her husband Jean-Louis Michau launched together in 1989, this perfume brand, by using a simple and strong concept, coming from a long family history: ""a perfumer free to decide upon his choices, to create top-notch fragrances, with no marketing constraints"". A dual purpose: Patricia de Nicolai was experienced in working with one of the best creative teams in perfumery, and wanted to continue her work more independently and freely. Jean-Louis Michau, organizational consultant and researcher in economics, also wanted to set a new challenge for himself.
The brand currently has a conditioning workshop located at La Ferté Saint Aubin, near Orleans, in the French Cosmetic Valley. On a covered area of 2.000m2, the production capacity can meet quickly any requests. Nicolaï has one of the richest collections of all in contemporary perfumery: 12 fragrances for women, 6 men’s fragrances, 5 eaux de cologne, 4 eaux fraîches. from all these creations, a personal style emerges, with a predilection for white flowers and amber notes. The house has also strongly developed the creation of fragrances, currently declined in candles, sprays, and fragrances for lamps. Since 2006, all fragrance lamps have been grouped under the brand La Maison du Parfumeur. With four owned-stores in France (the latter being situated in the area of the Palais Royal in Paris) and more than 700 outlets worldwide, the brand now has the necessary basis for considering development on a larger scale, while maintaining high selectivity."
The US natural personal care market needs more authenticity,"On the occasion of the New York edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit [1], leaders and trendsetters of the natural personal care industry in the USA shared their views and opinions on the different pathways to sustainability. With the North American natural personal care industry dogged by green-washing accusations, they called for companies to authenticate their natural and organic products by adopting sustainability initiatives and consider third party certification. Horst Rechelbacher, founder of Aveda and Intelligent Nutrients, opened the 2-day conference by encouraging cosmetic companies to remove synthetics from their product formulations.  However, Dr. Liliana George from Estée Lauder Companies recalled that “using natural and organic ingredients does not make a product green”. She highlighted the need for a life cycle assessment, stating that consumers look at recyclability, pollution and packaging when considering sustainability.  She looked at the use of green chemistry to reduce the environmental impact of beauty products. One key aspect of sustainability is ethical sourcing of raw materials. The Brazilian company Beraca shared its experiences in setting up sustainability projects at the edge of the Amazon basin.  The subject was further explored by the presidents of Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps and Canaan Fair Trade. The two companies have partnered to ethically source organic and fair trade olive oil from Palestine. The Personal Care Products Council outlined the legal framework and loopholes in labelling and marketing organic and natural cosmetic products in the USA. Once the legal context clarified, an update on the tricky issue of eco-labels and regulations was given by the leading certification agencies. Joe Smillie from QAI International gave details of the newly introduced NSF ANSI 305 ‘contains organic’ standard, which could become regulated similar to the USDA NOP standard for organic foods. Details were also given of the NPA and OASIS standards, followed by Cosmos and NaTrue, the leading certifications in Europe. Although there are differences between the various standards, all certification agencies agreed on the need for authenticity to validate legitimate brands. This sentiment was echoed by Jeff Binder from the North American retailer Saffron Rouge. A survey of 1,252 of its customers revealed that 77% have trust and confidence in third party certification, whereas 72% did not trust natural and organic claims made by brand owners. His company found that natural and organic brands that formulate and process their own ingredients have greater authenticity over others. His paper delivered a key message to brand owners, “natural claims have an expiry date that is past, whereas third party certification was the way forward.” Tim Brasher, CEO of Jurlique, an Australian brand that has gained an international following partly because of its green and clean image, confirmed that authenticity was a critical success factor, provided that it can be proved and combined with performance, safety and value. He explained that Jurlique grows its own organic ingredients on its Australian farms.

MakeUp in Paris wants to stage colour-cosmetics,"MakeUp in Paris will bring together for the first time in the same venue the making-off of the make-up: developers and formulators, packaging manufacturers, converters, full-service businesses, designers, make-up schools and make-up artists. While there no more exhibition space available, the organisers say that: “nearly 400 people have so far pre-registered online. For a very large part, they work in marketing, development and purchasing teams and not only from the big names in the Beauty industry but also from a number of small to medium sizes companies”. A wide variety of geographical areas are represented: Western Europe, of course, North and South America, Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia. “Each of the 32 partners received his roadmap to organize in the best way his presentation space and actively participate to the make-up animations which will enliven these two days dedicated in staging their products,” says Sandra Maguarian, MakeUp inParis’ Show Manager. Make-up schools and renowned make-up Artists such as Damien Dufresne, Max Herlant, or Takuya Motohashi will co-operate to this animations. Each of the industrial partners is going to stage his products at a given time and during a determined period of time. Thirty make-up animations will be set-up in the aisles of MakeUp in Paris, truly comparable to plays showing visitors major make-up trends in the world. “Suprise and amazement will be at the turn of every aisle, every showroom or showbox to welcome visitors.” Make Up For Ever, the renown French brand of professional make-up, spontaneously adopted the concept of MakeUp in Paris by providing their assistance in the setting-up of the “make-up spaces”. The brand will also detail its success story during a conference where Dany Sanz and Jacques Waneph will explain how a make-up virtuoso launched successfully a training school and then a make-up line for professionals, which ended up being one of LVMH group’s biggest commercial success. Furthermore, the CEW France, an association gathering about 270 women who all have responsibilities in the Beauty business, will organize a meeting on the occasion of MakeUp in Paris."
Global colour cosmetics market projected to reach US$41.4 billion by 2015,"“Characteristic growth drivers, such as, higher disposable incomes, propensity to spend, deeper product penetration among youth, and preference towards expensive formulations, which currently lie dormant as a result of the weak economic climate, are all forecast to spring back into action in the post recession period,” reveals markets research firm Global Industry Analysts in a new report titled Color Cosmetics: A Global Strategic Business Report. Europe and Asia-Pacific have the strongest consummation rates and dominate the global colour cosmetics market. Colour cosmetic is a dynamic segment driven by innovation. Formulators are creating sophisticated products to offer multiple benefits such as moisturisation, UV protection, aging treatment, long-lasting effects, ease of use, and convenience.  As a consequence, the delineation between skin care and colour cosmetics continues to fade, as consumers look beyond dynamic colour, and luminescence effects of colour cosmetics.  Also, cosmetic products that include natural, and organic ingredients such as plant extracts, and vitamin E are rising in popularity, and make-up products are also affected by the trend. Foundations have shied away from the use of heavy opaque pigments, to incorporate light-capturing crystals, such as mother-of-pearl, topaz, and rose quartz, in order to produce a perfect skin illusion, without the feel and look of makeup. Foundations have also become more closely allied with skin care product formulations. Intense lip colour, non-smudge wet look formulas, and colours enriched with vitamins A, C and E have proved to be popular. Manufacturers eyeing a gold mine of opportunity to pump their sales would need to combine shimmering, shiny textures, long-lasting formula, and caring properties, in a convenient stick form for easy application. Eye make-up is one of the fastest growing categories with lot of new battery operated mascaras providing volumizing and wet look features."
Formulations and packaging trends : transversal thinking is a key to success,"In the not-too-distant future, the ability of personal care brands and their suppliers to create value will rest upon their ability to generate a transversal thinking, according to Gerald Martines, Director, New Product Development - Make-Up, Rexam Personal Care Division. The industry veteran gave his vision at the recent PCD Congress in Paris, a worldwide “crossroads” show dedicated to packaging innovations for the perfume and cosmetic sectors. “In the current, global economic context, it is critical to raise the bar on innovation in order to provide brand owners with novel solutions that address the challenges of our times, prepare us for the future and differentiate themselves from the competition,” Martines explained during his PCD Congress seminar. “That is why we use the term transversal thinking,” Martines said.  “Savvy marketers and suppliers will work together to knock down product category silos and develop new-breed offerings that create marketplace excitement through real end-user benefits”. According to Gerald Martines, formulations are impacted by mega-trends such the pursuit of ageless beauty, health, safety and comfort.  Packaging is impacted by other mega-trends, such as concerns over sustainability, convenience, the never-ending quest for differentiation and the global move towards affordable premiumization. “Industry leaders are at the crossroads of cultural anthropology, chemistry, engineering and commerce – an exciting place to be”. According to Gerald Martines, key areas to watch include: – Convergence. Martines anticipates more “hybrid” products, such as crossover cosmetic and skin-care offerings.  The recently launched L’Oreal Collagen Care lipsticks are one example; – Complex Formulations. More multi-purpose, fragile, preservative-free formulas are on the way, in virtually all market segments, from colour cosmetics to anti-aging serums. – Diversification of Formula Chemical Composition. Lipsticks are an example, Martines states, with the growth of non-conventional formulas with softer textures, higher concentration of active ingredients, volatile chemical bases, etc. vs. the traditional “wax-and-pigment” products; – Blurring of Boundaries Between Packaging Categories. It is predictable that airless packaging will see its applications grow outside of its traditional chasse gardée of skincare and into colour cosmetics, for example, according to Martines. – Integrated Packaging Solutions. Such as compacts that conveniently and cleanly dispense loose powder or liquid formulations, instead of the traditional pressed powder. – New Regulations. With more stringent regulations applicable to cosmetics on the way by 2011, we may expect development of more hybrid products. “Thus, we will see more active ingredients, less structural additives and preservatives and more multi-benefit formulas – resulting in packaging that offers neutrality, airtight design, high barrier properties, UV protection, precision dosage, and new dispensing systems for non-conventional formulas,” Martines said.  “We are in a fast-changing, challenging environment – it is an incredibly exciting time to be in our industry.”"
Esxence enhances artistic perfumery,"After its first edition just one year ago, Esxence, the event dedicated to artistic perfumery, is making a reappearance in Milan (Italy) from 25 to 28 March 2010, at the Palazzo della Permanente (via Turati 34) which, since 1884, has been one of the most prestigious locations for art exhibitions in the Lombardy’s capital. After its unexpected and extremely positive debut last year, Esxence takes on an international flavour, welcoming 133 brands (compared to 86 in 2009). The application of each participant has been closely examined by a panel of European distributors and retailers, with the aim to admit only the brands that are consistent with the event’s focus on artistic perfumery. The selection process included a “qualitative-artistic analysis” based on the image and the philosophy of the brand, and its “aesthetic-stylistic coherence”, as well as an analysis of the brands’ distribution profile with criteria such as “quality and selectivity” and a “market share that must not exceed 0.2%"". According to the organisers, artistic perfumery could be defined as a business which mixes “artistic and craftsman like contents” with “the highest levels of professionalism, quality and personality”. Actually, this conception is a kind of return to the basics of luxury, in the same way as the slow-food concept is not only a reaction to the fast-junk-food business but also a consistent and holistic theory of what makes life good.  “Artistic perfumery is a way of thinking, creating and bringing to life products with a slow philosophy that penetrates the final consumer, who is led to absorb not the product tout-court but, first of all, a concept, a creative desire made to last and not subject to trends and hit and runs,” the organisers confirm. Esxence aims to become a unique opportunity for insiders of the artistic perfumery sector, including brand owners [1], designers, distributors and retailers, to meet each-others.  The event aims at creating opportunities for reflection and the creation of new ideas. Experts, such as Michael Edwards, author of Perfume Legends: French Feminine Fragrances, a cult book that narrates the story of the greatest fragrances, and Maurice Maurin, perfumer, creator of great masterworks and author of La Sagesse du Créateur de Parfum, will also contribute to the event’s programme. Among the innovations in this 2010 edition will also be the presence of the persons behind websites and blogs, all accredited and recognised in the world of artistic perfumery - such as the American contributor, Sniffapalooza, or the Anglo-German, Basenotes, the Italian blog Bergamotto&Benzoino and the web-site, Extrait.it - who also contributed the organisation of the event. Esxence will see the participation of the Osmothèque, the World Conservatory of historical fragrances located in Versailles, France. “Well aware that the final consumers play a fundamental role in the development and awareness of niche perfumery”, the organizers of Esxence will also welcome certain connoisseurs by invitation on Saturday 27 and Sunday 28 March, 2010.  The public will be able to further its knowledge of the brands on display or make new olfactory acquaintances through the presence of the Osmothèque and workshops to discover essences from different continents, organised by Mouillettes & Co., experts in the sector."
What kind of growth for global cosmetic markets in 2010?,"The year 2010 looks better, and several operators, in particular from the supply side, have already noticed a marked upturn.  According to Eurostaf, “from 2011, the market should resume with growth rates close to those experienced between 2004 and 2007. However, this general picture hides contrasted situations”. In geographical terms, perspectives for growth appear very different from one region to another. Western Europe, the world’s biggest cosmetics market, North America and Japan, still represent the bulk of sales.  But these markets are mature, with important penetration rates for all product categories. Growth in these countries should remain moderate, with the possible exception of the men’s market. In contrast, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia (excluding Japan) are developing very rapidly. Among the emerging markets, three of them already rank among the 10 largest consumers of cosmetic products: Brazil, China and Russia.  Brazil even stands first for hair care products, and perhaps also for perfumery. Hence, no wonder if cosmetics giants focus their efforts in these new markets. For L’Oreal, these markets should represent 50% of the group’s sales in less than 10 years.  Furthermore, while the group already operates 60% of its activity outside Europe, this proportion should increase to 90%.  Actually, L’Oréal intends to attract and retain nearly one billion new customers. A strategy of growth that is shared by many others: such as Yves Rocher, who intends to develop outsourcing and to open offshore production facilities to better serve Indian, Chinese or Korean woman, or by Shiseido, who wants to increase the share of overseas markets in its turnover from 35% today to 50% by 2017. Although they remain marginal in terms of market share, organic and natural cosmetics continue to surge and appear crisis-proof. According to a recent study by Kline, the natural and organic cosmetic market posted another double-digit growth in 2009, and its compound annual growth rate since 2004 exceeds 15%. Nothing indicates that this growth should be interrupted, especially as natural products are also very popular in emerging countries. Brazil is already the world’s second largest consumer of natural cosmetic products and Indian and Chinese traditions promise a good potential to naturals. As far as the different market segments are concerned, skincare products appear as the strongest propeller of growth while makeup, hair care products and hygiene products should experience a more moderate progress, finds Eurostaf. However, the potential of makeup is very strong in Asia, including Japan. From this point of view, with the purchase of Bare Escentuals, Shiseido appears to win on all fronts, acquiring a specialist of natural makeup, which holds strong positions in North America and a good growth potential ins Asia. The crisis has also increased the disparities between levels of ranges: prestige and high-end ranges suffered while mass-market ranges were more resistant."
Brazil: double-digit growth forecasted for the next five years,"Sueli Ortega - Which categories showed the best results in 2009? João Carlos Basílio - In the Personal Care segment, toothpaste is one of the categories that can be highlighted, because it is a category with a very high penetration rate, an acquired societal habit. The category’s growth rate was about 8,4% in volume in 2009.  The expectation of the industry was that this sector product category would generate a growth rate similar to the growth of the Brazilian population - 1,8%, or at maximum 2%. However, in 2009, this category grew 8.4% in volume (17,5% in value), that is to say, far beyond the general economy or population growth, in a category that encompasses all the social classes, it is a sign of a bigger potential for it and for other related categories. Other top sellers were the soaps, with a growth in volume between 15 and 18%, and with revenues growing by 27%. We have observed that liquid soaps have conquered the bathroom area little by little and it is being incorporated now into the shower box, where the greatest preference in the country is still the bar soap. And vegetal soaps are also penetrating the market. Actually, everything has its roots in economics. Over the last years, the animal tallow has been used as ingredient for diesel fuel, and as a consequence the price of animal tallow triplicated. So the price difference between animal tallow and vegetal mass, which was 10 times, was reduce to 2 or 3 times. Thus, the price of prestige soap decreased by 3 to 4 times, which allows a soap production of very good quality, with a differentiated mass and at an accessible price. Society is more and more considering its cost benefit. Sueli Ortega - Does the fall of exportations led to actions and new programs for the export sector? João Carlos Basílio - What happened is that Brazilian exports of Personal Care, Perfumery and Cosmetics sector fell by 15.5% in volume in 2009 and 9.3% in value, dropping to US$ 364 millions. Exports were impacted by the evolution of currency rates - in particular the valuation of the real against the dollar. However, our analysis is that the performance of our sector can be considered as very good. If you do not consider commodities but only manufactured products, the fall of Brazilian exportations exceeds 25%. In some cases it reaches 40%.  Our sector fell by 9.3% in a very difficult context for the export of manufactured goods. It is something like - it is bad, but it is good. It wasn’t a positive result, however in face of the negative picture that crisis was reflected through the exportations of all countries; to us the picture was very good. Now, the positive side of this issue is that we have today 42 companies involved in an exportation project and are in a covenant with Apex [1], these companies grew by15%. Exports grew by 15%. In other words, companies that are under the Apex umbrella and receive ABIHPEC´s consulting had an excellent performance, they grew by 15%, with a US$ 92 million result. Sueli Ortega - Were Brazilian exportations for the sector stronger in South America? João Carlos Basílio - Yes, but the weight of South America is more important for overall Brazilian exports. As far as our sector is concerned the dilution is greater. We sell in 128 countries. In this region the main buyers are: Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. Sueli Ortega - How did the perfumery market perform? Brazil was already the second world’s perfumery market in 2008. João Carlos Basílio - We have ranked as the second market for perfumery products since 2007. We have consolidated these numbers in 2008 and we are getting closer to the first place. In 2008 Brazil had already a 10.7% market share worldwide. The United States had 16.1%. In 2009 the weight of the US market has probably decreased while Brazil’s contribution should have progressed to 12% or 13%.  We anticipate because, as I told you, these data are not consolidated yet, but I can dare to say that we are nowadays the largest fragrance market in the world. We had a growth of 15.72%  (a 16% high in value and 3.5% in volume in 2009). If you consider the inflation in the period, around 4.5%, this means that we have achieved 11 to 12% real growth, which is good, exceptional! Sueli Ortega - Brazil stands out for its performance in the hair market. What is the market share for this category in 2009? João Carlos Basílio - If we take the conditioner category, Brazil is already the biggest worldwide market since 2005. This means that 1 out every 5 conditioners sold in the world is sold in Brazil. We are the world’s main consumer of hair conditioners. If we take the category of permanent wave and relaxers, we are also the greatest market worldwide since 2005. If we take the category of permanent and relaxing we are also the largest market since 2005. If we take hair dye, we are already the largest market of the world since 2007, we had  14% market share in 2008. We had in 2009 a 25.345 thousand tons volume in sales. Certainly in 2009 we will surpass the 15% market share in the world. Sueli Ortega - And regarding the makeup market? Is Brazil walking at large steps? João Carlos Basílio - It is a very good market, impressive. Here in Brazil the products for nails and lips always predominated. Yet today, face and eyes products are growing too and products for nails have become the smallest market in the makeup category. In the eyes segment, our market grew by 30.74% in volume, and in the face segment it grew by 30.84% in volume. Currently lips are still the largest market in the country, but eyes makeup is already very close, it is growing by 26% in value. Sueli Ortega - What are the forecasts for growth in 2010? João Carlos Basílio - Just consider that toothpaste had a growth around 8.4% with the highest rate of penetration, and that all other categories were growing. So I can say that ABIHPEC´s forecast is that in the next 5 years we should continue to have a double-digit growth. Real growth, deflated. The ABIHPEC is celebrating 15 years this year and we are also completing 15th years of growth in the double digits."
Vivaness 2010: natural cosmetics enter new era,"Vivaness (World Trade Fair for Natural Personal Care and Wellness) was held from February 17 to 20, 2010 at the Nuremberg fairground, together with BioFach (World Organic Trade Fair).  About 43,500 trade visitors, of which 38 % foreign visitors, attended both events: a 7% drop compared to the 46,771 visitors recorded in 2009.  The number of exhibitors was also declining: 2,557 this year, compared to 2733 in 2009.  “The organic-market has stood up to the crisis. The passed 4 days of the fair demonstrated this sector has kept the pot boiling. The organic-trend and the trend to an ecologically sustainable consumption continue,” commented Claus Rättich, Member of the Management Board, NürnbergMesse. However, Vivaness alone is a much smaller event: 183 exhibitors (205 in 2009) from 21 countries (24 in 2009) including Germany (88), France (29), Italy (16), Great Britain (12) and Austria (8). The show comprehensively reflected the market and trade buyers looking for an overview of trends, new products, new brand positioning and international developments for natural cosmetics were on the right track there.  The benefits of the visit was enhanced by the Vivaness Forum, the congress programme accompanying the exhibition, which provided production, marketing and trade professionals with the latest figures and assessments from international experts - a worthwhile look into the future of the market for natural beauty care! Despite of this dull economic context, the natural cosmetics market is still growing. Lows and highs of the economy have astonishingly little effect on a market that has been recording stable growth from more than a decade. According to the British market research institute Organic Monitor, worldwide sales are growing by 1 billion US dollars a year and are currently estimated at approximately 7 billion US dollars.  As in the case of organic food, the demand is concentrated on Europe and North America. The American market accounts for 4.5 billion. In 2008 the entire German market for certified natural cosmetics had grown by almost 10 % to 672 million EUR and reached a market share of 5.3 % of total sales of cosmetics.  Estimations indicate that European sales figures rose by 13 % in 2009. The market volume in Europe could reach 2 billion EUR in 2010. France and Germany show the fastest growth. At international level, the United States and Asia, primarily Japan and Korea, are the leading buyer markets. Consumers’ priorities are clearly changing from a meant-is-cool mentality to more awareness of value for money, and a stronger focus on product quality. Besides the powers of persuasion of the products and the general trend to naturalness, the growing popularity of natural cosmetics is also due to their growing availability in all sales channels, including mass market, an increased media presence and a variety of innovations. German and international companies are positioning themselves with innovative products. There is now much more investment in researching and securing highly effective, selected natural raw materials and in effectiveness tests than in earlier years. Makers of natural and organic cosmetics are adopting a new corporate culture: the development of new processes, and the investment in very modern production facilities are now as important as the attention to sustainability, environmental protection and biodiversity or fair trade. “Sales Hit of the Year” awards were presented once again in 2010. A total of 298 new products had registered for the organic event of the year. The Vivaness exhibitors showed 63 innovative individual products and product lines and BioFach exhibitors 235. The decisive factor for winning the award was the number of times the new products were scanned at the POS in organic food shops and organic supermarkets. The Jury Awards for BioFach and Vivaness also took other factors into account, such as company’s innovativeness or the overall market presence.  This year’s winners at Vivaness were the Dr. Hauschka’s Skin Soothing Mask and Weleda’s Pomegranate Beauty Shower. The Vivaness Jury Award went to the neobio brand of Logocos AG for a wise and bold brand policy. Last year’s relaunch helped the brand to achieve a modern and innovative presence. Neobio managed to attract a young target group and several products made it to the Top 50 new product sales. Many new green cosmetic brands are currently capturing the international market. The spectrum ranges from inexpensive trade brands to luxurious green glamour products. This broad spectrum of products is reflected in diversified and innovative marketing concepts. The increasing availability of certified natural cosmetics in all trading formats means there are good candidates to a rapid expansion. However, the recent emergence of new labels and test symbols, and certification procedures have not helped to made orientation easier for trade and consumers. The harmonization of standards has to be pushed further. The next Vivaness (and BioFach) will be hold on 16-19 February 2011 at the Nuremberg fairground."
The future of aerosols,"Premium Beauty News - Aerosol, a product which celebrated its fiftieth anniversary last year and for which controversy has not failed! A product yet more alive than ever! Michel Fontaine - You have summarized the subject quite well! This product has been and remains, dare we say, fantastic! And its designers were far from imagining the huge advance that their invention was going to generate over the years. Figures are stubborn! The consumption is annually of 11 billion units worldwide, including 4 billion in the United States, 600 million in France. China, who ten years ago, was a only dwarf in this area will this year, use 1 billion units! Not bad for a product promised to oblivion by the end of the 1980s! Premium Beauty News - Truly, this industry has also learned a lot! Michel Fontaine - Quite true! The use of freon as a propellant gas is ancient history. We are in the era of hydrocarbons and tomorrow we will be able to use compressed air. Which proves by the way, the huge adaptability of this industry to new constraints whether environmental, technical or consumerist. Premium Beauty News - Yet, you are organizing during Aerosol Forum [1], a workshop with a slightly provocative topic: ""A world without aerosols?"" Michel Fontaine - But this is precisely where we are going to understand the vital nature of this conditioning. After fifty years of high technology developments, aerosols can be seen in the daily life of everyone, in the bathroom, kitchen, workshop or garage. They also take a part in the packaging of some drugs. And in the industry, they are also used for highly developed technical products. But throughout the two days other topics will also be tackled with subjects related to Design and Sustainable Development, and to latest technical innovations. Premium Beauty News - Another novelty, the formula ""Paris Aerosol restaurant! Michel Fontaine - Indeed, the meal will give the participants an opportunity to switch from theory to practice. The meal will be embellished with aerosol conditioned products and products elaborated by Pierre Dominique Cécillon (Academie Cinq sens, Paris) and his team. The purpose of which will be to convince dinners of the the potentiality of aerosol technology for every day meals and catering."
Natural personal care industry to attract investments in 2010,"Improving economic conditions and easing of capital restrictions will make investors target the high-growth natural personal care sector in 2010, analyses Organic Monitor in its new Strategic Insights report [1]. After a lull period of 18 months that followed the financial crisis of 2008-2009, major deals have restarted in the natural personal care industry. Bare Escentuals was acquired by Shiseido last month in a US$ 1.7 billion deal, whilst Clarins completed its purchase of Kibio a few weeks ago. European companies are expected to be involved in major deals in 2010 because of the lack of ‘investable’ companies in North America. Indeed, “many leading American companies have already been acquired, leaving relatively few suitable privately-owned companies.” Companies in North America - such as Bare Escentuals and Burt’s Bees - have been purchased at over 3-5 times their sales revenues. High prices are being paid by investors looking to emulate Estee Lauder’s success with Aveda. Since its purchase in 1997, Aveda has grown manifold to become a global brand of natural personal care products. The report finds the most successful natural personal care companies are those that receive investment and continue to operate as separate entities. Aveda and Burt’s Bees are cited as such companies that have continued to show positive growth. In comparison, those that have been acquired and integrated into larger corporations (such as Sanoflore, bought by L’Oreal in 2006) have not realised their growth potential. “A major reason is that natural personal care companies are typically small enterprises with strong ethical values which do not always fit well into larger profit-driven organisations,” Organic Monitor comments. Organic Monitor’s upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, taking place at Grand Hyatt Hotel, New York, 24-26th March 2010, will highlight the report’s key findings, with details of the major deals and future growth projections."
"Dieter Bakic: “2010, still a challenging year !”","Premium Beauty News - How was your activity like in 2009? Dieter Bakic  - For stock packaging, we encountered decreased re-buy quantities and product launch activities in all countries. The only difference was the point in time, when the activities slowed down. USA was the first one, shortly followed by Russia and then by Europe. For design services, we had a high level of activity in 2009. Some customers wanted to be ready with new shapes when the market turns and others sought for competitive differentiation via colours and graphics. Premium Beauty News - Is the recovery really back and what are your predictions for 2010? Dieter Bakic  - We feel a higher level of activity compared to the same time in 2009. Although customers are still cautious and are ordering smaller volumes at shorter lead times, the outlook is more positive than one year ago. This does not mean that recovery is fully back and we believe that 2010 will still be a challenging year. Premium Beauty News - Environmental labelling, legislative pressures of all kinds ...., how do you cope with regulatory developments in your area. Are they constraints or opportunities? Dieter Bakic  - Opportunities because these developments make you consider new aspects and ideas. Moreover, only by overcoming constraints you add value to your product and service portfolio and that is what customer’s value and why they finally purchase from you. Premium Beauty News - Relocation, partial of full subcontracting in Asia or elsewhere... what is the ideal balance? Dieter Bakic  - The decision to produce in a low cost country depends for us on the type of customer you serve, the products involved and the speed of reactivity you need. We decide on a case by case basis and consider aspects like what regional market we want to supply, the necessary level of automation, size of investments, environmental and transportation costs and the complexity of the supply chain. The balance can be different depending on the project and the customer."
Japan: long live the elderly!,"""People live to be old in Japan, nowadays"" explains Florence Bernardin, director of Information & Inspiration, who developed a passion for this country she visits several times a year. Japanese people, and specially Japanese women, actually set new records in terms of longevity. The number of centenarians in the country exceeds 40 000 (including 37 000 women). Japan is in fact facing an unprecedented demographic crisis. With a birth rate not exceeding 1.37 children per woman in 2008, some demographers have announced that the population could fall from 127 million today to 100 million in 2050. One thing is sure: the country is confronted with a rapidly aging population. Yet, people over sixty years of age brought up with consumer society have very different behaviors from generations that preceded them. They do not want to give up their status as consumers, even though their needs change. According to Florence Bernardin, ""Purchase of cosmetic products by the 60 years of age generation, represents 19% of the total cosmetics market. With an annual increase of +4%"". There is a lot at stake for cosmetic manufacturers, knowing that according to a survey ordered by Shiseido in 2007, 50% of women of this class of age believe there is not a single brand meeting their needs. Different type of answers are found in surveys concerning the Japanese market: – Firstly an hyper range segmentation per age group. The cosmetic market in 2008 witnessed the launch of lines entirely dedicated to women over 40 years of age, who account for more than 60% of the cosmetic market in Japan. Kanebo debuted on the 60-something age segment with the launch of Chicca, followed by Shiseido with Elexir Prior.  Both products lines were highlighted with their reference icons for a greater proximity with targeted women. – Then a discourse where nostalgia is put forward, and which is complemented with a rise in the price range. High-end creams was the most developed category in 2008. The number of creams exceeding 20,000 Yens (retail price = 150 Euros) has increased by 24% compared to 2004. – Finally, older men are not forgotten and in turn become the target of brand marketing. But the Nippon archipelago is also struck by an unprecedented economic slump which goes back to the early 1990s after the burst of the financial and real estate bubble in the late 1980s. Successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to revive the economy through costly programs of public works which as a result, exploded the national debt. The Koizumi government (2001-2006) tried to remedy this situation through a policy of structural reform. Without much success, since a new recovery plan was required to overcome the last financial crisis (2008-2009). Under such circumstances, according to the OECD, Japan’s public debt could reach 200% of GDP at the end of 2010. This situation has severe consequences on the lifestyle and consumption habits of many Japanese and has forced firms to adapt their strategy. Thus, Shiseido, like other major Japanese companies, has chosen to direct its development overseas, particularly aiming at Asian emerging markets. In the home market, responses to crisis have been multiple, from plain and sharp price decline, to more sophisticated consumer appeal attempts, particularly in seeking greater proximity (development of the retail offer in places such as stations, by developing pocket stores, ephemeral stores, vending machines) and facilities (payment with the travel card, mobile phones, etc..). Brands and retailers have also provided consumers with new shopping experiences during which luxury is synonymous with exclusivity, where consumer places become places of emotional discovery, etc.. The Internet is obviously playing a major part, if only to be a source of information for consumers (according to 70% of Japanese women over 20 years of age) but also as real growth engine through e-commerce. The conclusion of Florence Bernardin? ""In a difficult market, only innovation and responsiveness may help provide good products and good ideas at the right time. This requires constant  attention, close follow-up of emerging trends, and the ability to identify good ideas as they arise""."
Potential of social media is underexploited by cosmetic brands,"John Marshall Roberts, communications strategist and CEO of Worldview Learning, will explore the gamut of social media outlets available to beauty companies, highlighting their applications in marketing, sales, public relations and customer service. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other social media channels have particular significance to natural and organic personal care companies since these companies sometimes struggle to communicate their brand / product values to consumers. Research by Organic Monitor finds that consumers cannot always distinguish pure natural and organic products from competing ones. Indeed, many often confuse conventional beauty products with legitimate natural / organic ones because of the lack of regulations for product labelling & marketing. Thus, word-of-mouth is the most important communication channel for natural & organic brands. According to Organic Monitor, most buyers get product information from friends & family. Furthermore, most users of natural & organic beauty products are well-educated and IT savvy, making them ideally placed for social media marketing campaigns. “Social media can dramatically increase return on investment for marketing dollars if done correctly, as they allow brands to generate a global following of loyal customers with relatively low investment,” John Marshall Roberts states.  He highlights Burt’s Bees and Sephora as two companies that are using social media effectively, however Roberts states the use of social media in the natural & organic beauty industry remains largely underexploited, and that there is tremendous room for growth. On the occasion of the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which will be held at Grand Hyatt Hotel, New York on March 24-26th, Roberts will give case studies of companies who have successfully integrated social media channels into their marketing strategy."
Bioplastics market to rise together with sustainability trend,"New bio-based polymers have been available in the market for approximately one decade. Recently, standard polymers like polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC or PET, but also high-performance polymers like polyamide or polyester have been totally or partially substituted by their renewable raw materials equivalents. The starting raw materials are usually sugars or starches, partially also recycled materials from food or wood processing. The production capacity of agro-based plastics is projected to increase from 360,000 tons in 2007 to about 2.3 million tons by 2013. This corresponds to an annual growth of 37 percent. In a study commissioned byEuropean Bioplastics, the European association representing the interests of the industry along the complete bioplastics’ value chain, and theEuropean Polysaccharide Network of Excellence (EPNOE), researchers from Utrecht University found a substitution potential of up to 90 percent of the total consumption of plastics by bio-based polymers to be technically possible. As a consequence, producers of bioplastics are investing heavily in production capabilities. “European Bioplastics’ members are investing in new plants, in further innovation and cooperations. For example, Nature Works just doubled its production capacity of PLA and Braskem made big investments for this year’s start-up of bio-based PE. BASF introduced new biodegradable plastics for coating paper and shrink-film, while Purac, Sulzer and Synbra kicked off a cooperation in the field of foamed PLA products,” said the association. “Of course we still have a long way to go, before we can actually talk about real market penetration. On the other hand, Rome wasn’t build in a day, either,” says Andy Sweetman, Chairman of the European Bioplastics’ Board. However, assessing the environmental impacts and benefits is not always easy, especially when it comes to the development of new materials, there are potential pitfalls, which both consumers and environmentalists will be all too quick to point out.  While bioplastics are supposed to be fully biodegradable and made from entirely renewable resources, questions have been raised about the sustainability of certain farming methods used to grow the raw materials. “There are a number of alternatives on the market but most of them cannot guarantee that they did not use genetically modified plants to produce the starch which is the raw material for the bioplastic. We chose to take the safest possible route and to refuse all products that cannot guarantee they are free from GMO material,” says Jonas Adler, who is commercial manager of Iggesund’s value-added products.  Iggesund recently launched Invercote Bio, a biodegradable version of its high-end Invercote board, which is coated with bioplastic. Despite the fact that virtually no schemes to recycle the material currently exist, Adler considers that “paperboard coated with bioplastic has a fantastic future, because it fits into all the future waste scenarios prescribed in the EU’s packaging directive, be they recycling, energy recovery, composting or anaerobic treatment. No other material is suitable for all these different scenarios – and sharp-witted customers have already realised this.”"
Maesa: optimism for 2010,"Maesa, which is positioned as a designer and manufacturer of beauty products, scented products, as well as tailor-made packaging products, is considering the year 2010 with confidence. According to Julien Saada, the group’s President, “2010 can only, it is obvious, be better than the year we just passed”. Explanations… In January 2009, Maesa moved to new headquarters, in a 1700 square metres building that gathers under a single roof all the group’s operations located in France.  The new premises also feature a laboratory for the formulation of cosmetic products, and two design workshops. In parallel, the group strengthened its sales team for the English market as well as its export team.  The divisions “promotions” and “packaging” are merged under the supervision of Nathalie Bringant, while Zorbit LCC (turnover; 45 million dollars), Maesa’s US subsidiary, a specialist of luxury packaging for luxury and beauty brands, that the group acquired on December 2008, changed its name to Maesa LLC. Maesa’s managers prefer describing their activity with the words Engineering Beauty that match with a mission that covers all the operations “from design to the finished product”.  Other people would describe such activity a full service. “There are four miin axes within our business model, tells Julien Saada, bringing added value to brands and retailers, manufacturing on demand, outsourcing the development and the production, and being a source of cost reduction for brands and retailers”. From a commercial perspective, the main highlights for Maesa consisted in the creation of cosmetic ranges for famous international brands, such as, for instance, the creation of two full make-up lines for Oviesse, the Italian leading retailer of mid-market clothes, a subsidiary of the Coin group.  The group also created the entire cosmetic range of Old Navy, a subsidiary of the Gap group, and, four collections of scented products for Alinéa and the development of a range of scented products for Target. Another highlight, which perfectly suited with the motto “from branding to finished product” that is claimed by Maesa, the launch of the first eau de parfum for the brand of high-end ready-to-wear clothes, Zadig & Voltaire. Or also, the creation of a perfume, 50 Cent, which is named after the famous US rap singer, and which was launched at Macy’s. Maesa, also created a perfume and its derived products for Kim Kardashian, as well as make-up palette for Lauren Luke, a make-up artist who is using the internet for selling its products along with makeup advices. For the first time in Europe, Maesa’s team also created a whole range of specific primary packaging for Marionnaud’s Asiatic bath line, as well as Sephora’s coffrets and gift packs for Christmas 2009. As far as the group activity for exclusive brands, let’s mention a perfume line for Kat Von D, in exclusivity at Sepfora in the US, and a makeup line for Bare Escentuals. Eventually, regarding outsourcing, Maesa’s team have created the coffrets for Interpafums’ Quicksilver and ST Dupont brands, as well as a coffret for promotional scents for Estée Lauder. “Regarding the outlook for 2010 for the beauty sector, explains Julien Saada, it is good. In particular thanks to the new contracts we signed with speciality retailers, the confirmation of our rise on the packaging market in Europe in partnership with prestigeous brands, and the rationalisation of our customers portfolio. Our historic and strong positioning among retailer’s private labels remains an asset when consumption is boosted by governmental measures in a dull economic context. Furthermore, we are feeling the emergence of a new dimension regarding the contracts we are signing for developing the cosmetics range of international brands. There is clearly a growth in the choice for outsourcing among prestige beauty brands”."
MakeUp in Paris takes advantage of a dynamic make-up market,"In every country, every retail channel, the segment is growing at least in value where sales volumes are already high. Of course, the famous ""lipstick effect"" according to which women would have a tendency to buy as much or even more lipstick in times of crisis has had a contrasting influence according to countries and segments. Variations are mainly due to maturity reasons and lack of genuine novelties on some marketplaces. Make-up for the eyes, which is the largest segment of the market and the one that has offered the most innovations, has performed very well, thanks in particular to its champion, mascara. With its brand new brushes (with spikes, motorized, adjustable or retractable…) and new formulae (super lengthening, curving, protective or volume…), the 2009 vintage was simply outstanding. So mascara has been widely acclaimed by women who welcome those launches that brands described as major, or even revolutionary. Women also acclaimed the second segment in make-up, foundation creams, attracted by the latest formulae and the latest packaging advances in mineral powders on the one hand, and assertions for care, ranging from moisturizing to the sacrosanct anti-aging offered by foundation creams, on the other hand. Because if consumers believe the product is worth it, if they perceive the value added, they will still and always go wild over it. The dynamism of make-up sales probably explains why the arrival of new players is announced in a market that still has a reputation for being complicated due to the high number of references it requires. Dolce & Gabbana with Procter & Gamble, Michael Kors with Estée Lauder (Very Hollywood), Ungaro with Avon (U by Ungaro) and even Burberry are moving to the starting line to offer women a key giving them access to their universe. These new comers will thus increase pressure on a market that is bcoming increasingly complex.  Besides the French company, Couleur Caramel and the Australian company, Nvey Eco, among others, operators in conventional beauty have also set off for the big adventure of the so called ""ethnic"" skins or the one of natural makeup: L’Oréal and its Bare Naturale line, Yves Rocher with Couleurs Nature, Revlon with Almay Pure Blends, and Bourjois with its new brand, Une, displaying natural shades and packaging inspired from new technologies… A number of initiatives that should allow the market to continue to attract even more women –in France, they are only 2 out of 3 to use make-up - and thus guarantee its prosperity for tomorrow. MakeUp in Paris, the new appointment of the make-up industry, will take place on June 24th and 25th, 2010 at l’Espace Pierre Cardin."
"""Recovery is still fragile,"" Joël Palix, Clarins","Premium Beauty News - How did the market react during the end of the year festivities? Joël Palix - For fragrances, 2009 has probably been the worst year our profession experienced for a very long time. France, Britain and Germany resisted rather well. Italy and the Middle East are on the decline. Spain, travel retail and the United States have fallen sharply. Asia is slightly progressing. I am generally speaking of the profession here and not of our brands which performed well in particular Mugler. Premium Beauty News - Is recovery really back? Joël Palix - There are some encouraging signs, the last quarter was good, Christmas sales in stores too. Premium Beauty News - Environmental labelling, legislative pressures of all sorts, how do you cope with regulatory developments in your sector? Joël Palix - All this must be perceived as an opportunity like sustainable development, but the big issue remains in the fact that restrictions on ingredients have reduced the palette the nose of the perfume designer was working with. Premium Beauty News - Relocation, partial or full subcontracting in Asia or elsewhere... What sort of balance do you think, needs to be found? Joël Palix - Precisely, the proper balance must be found between cost, flexibility and also creativity. Playing with manufacturing options accordingly."
Bright prospects for MakeUp in Paris,"The organizers of MakeUp in Paris - who also own Premium Beauty News - are delighted with the enthusiastic welcome the beauty sector offered to their project. Only two months after its launch, “80% of the available space has been rented to suppliers in the make-up industry most of them being heavy weights of the sector,"" comments Sandra Maguarian, Show Manager.  Among them are: Ancorotti Cosmetics, Faber-Castell Cosmetics, Fiabila, HCP, Jackel and Strand Cosmetics Europe. “We are receiving enthusiastic reviews and a lot of support from all sides. People we meet have understood that this is not a simple show in the classic sense, but much more an event meant to enhance efforts for innovation, research and development which are so important in the universe of make-up”, adds Sandra Maguarian. For instance, Pilar Gonzalez, communication manager at Geka Brush explains their choice to participate in MakeUp Paris because they “feel it will be an extraordinary and unique event focused on make-up. This is a event we are looking forward to.”  For Katherin Hecht, Faber-Castell Cosmetics, “it’s just the right time, the right place and the right team of connoisseurs to organize such an event”. As far as brands are concerned, Daniel Saclier, Guerlain, considers that “MakeUp in Paris is an excellent initiative that I am sponsoring on behalf of the Guerlain brand at a time when, precisely, make-up has become a key axis of development for the growth of Guerlain, combining dynamism in formulation research and packaging design with always more complex technology.” Among the particularities of MakeUp in Paris, an original program of events, that goes far beyond traditional expert conferences. In collaboration with Anne Camilli, consultant specialized in the universe of makeup, the organizers of MakeUp in Paris developed a dozen poles, whose purposes are to illustrate all the possibilities of use offered by make-up. On each of the poles, exhibitors will be able to enhance their products. “The make-up schools and the make-up artists that were approached also responded enthusiastically,” explains Sandra Maguarian. MakeUp in Paris, the new appointment of the make-up industry, will take place on June 24th and 25th, 2010 at l’Espace Pierre Cardin."
Cosmetics marketers must adapt local strategies,"According to data from the latest study conducted by research firmKline & Company, global beauty brands cannot adopt a single strategy to address the needs and particularities of consumers worldwide.  “The takeaway message is that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for success,” says Carrie Mellage, Director of Consumer Products Research for Kline. “The unique features of each country require marketers to think globally, but act locally,” she adds. As an example, Carrie Mellage highlights the particularities of Brazil’s rural population, which is a huge potential market but depends heavily on direct person-to-person sales. On the contrary, “the more sophisticated and fickle shoppers in the mature beauty markets must be lured with exclusive offers, steep discounts, cool iPhone apps, and social media connections.” Growth rates differ widely from one country to another with a huge gap between mature markets and emerging economies.  Similarly, the dynamism of the various retail channels is unequally affected.  Kline’s research points out that “in the United States, the weak economy has forced department store share of the total market down another two points versus 2003 levels”. At the global level, the dynamic growth in emerging economies, combined with their relatively important rural population is boosting direct sales operators.  Actually, Kline says that direct sales have emerged as the fastest growing retail channel for beauty products, posting a robust 8.6% increase in sales - nearly double that of the overall market. Kline also highlights the successful shift operated by chain drug stores in many countries. They have “dramatically increased floor and shelf space for beauty products and introduced a more posh shopping environment that mimics the feel and service levels of specialty or department stores”. Kline estimates drugstores grew by 5.4%, ahead of the market’s overall 4.7% growth. However, the structure and dynamism of retail channels are linked to historical factors and vary dramatically from one country to the other. In China, for instance, growth is led by expansion in the number of doors across all channels, including department stores, mass merchandisers, and specialty stores.  Meanwhile in India, unlike any other outlet in the world, independent, owner-operated shops (kirinas) remain the mainstay of the personal care market with 78% market share and 9% growth in the past five years. In such a context, it appears that winning companies are those opting for different retail strategies from one country to another. “Savvy brands are employing a mix of complementary channels,” explains Karen Doskow, industry manager for consumer products research at Kline."
Exports of French cosmetics rely on emerging markets,"French exports of cosmetic products declined sharply at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2008 in a context of global crisis, but this situation did not last long, as recovery began in the second quarter of 2009 with a confirmation in the third quarter, notice the French Customs. In 2008, French exports of cosmetics (perfumes, beauty products, hair preparations, other cosmetics) amounted to 9.6 billion Euros. They have grown steadily since 1998, with an annual average of 6.2%, against 4% for all French exports. The dynamism of this sector results from its innovation capabilities, its high-end positioning, aging of population and rising living standards. In the context of recent crisis, the resilience of the French industry is also explained by ""a successful positioning in emerging markets."". According to Customs, ""strong sales in cosmetics is explained in part by favorable positioning in fast growing emerging markets, while the EU plays a less important role in French exports (50% against 64%). Between 1998 and 2008, sales growth in emerging countries is two times faster than it is for all exports of cosmetics"". The share of emerging countries in total sales of cosmetics rose from 14.9% in 1998 to 24.6% in 2008, with particularly strong sales in China and Russia A trend confirmed by Jean-Paul Agon, the Managing Director of the L’Oreal Group, in an interview to the French newspaper Le Monde, dated November 6: ""In the ten coming years, our customers will mostly be Chinese, Indian, Brazilian or Indonesian."" While the group L’Oreal already achieves 60% of its business outside Europe, this proportion is expected to rapidly rise to 90%, according to Jean-Paul Agon ""Sooner or later sales catch up on demography"", he claims. The Department of Customs also notes that the number of exporting companies in the cosmetics industry evolves against the national trend: while the overall number of French exporters tends to decrease, the situation is quite different in the cosmetics industry where the number of companies venturing into international markets continues to grow. The companies concerned are mostly SME. ""Companies exporting cosmetics are less concentrated than the national average. There are relatively more companies with 20 to 250 employees or with more than 250 employees in cosmetics than there is for the whole economy (41% of operators against 26%), with in both cases, about 80% of sales exported"", notes the Department of Customs. French exports, however, remain in the hands of large groups. ""For perfumes, the top ten exporters account for almost 60% of sales, two large groups being behind a quarter of all sales. For beauty products, the top ten exporters draw half of all sales, including one fifth initiated by just one big group"" say the Customs. In the end, France retains its leading position in the global cosmetics industry, with nearly 25% market share worldwide, followed by Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom."
French women have a confused perception of organic cosmetics,"Today, nearly one French women out of three (28%) uses at least one organic cosmetic product. Yet, according to a survey from Cegma Topo, conducted on a cross section of 563 women aged from 18 to 64, few of them have a clear vision of what that concept covers. "" Behind this very fashionable term, perceptions are still vague, "" notes the company specialized in analyzing consumer perceptions. After collecting information from French female consumers on their beliefs and practices regarding organic cosmetics, Cegma Topo notices that confidence in these products is stronger every day, resulting particularly in an increase in the number of facials in terms of consumption. According to Cegma Topo, for consumers, the ""chemical free"" argument is considered to be the first appeal for these products. But the reality behind these products is unknown. ""3/4th of French women have in mind that an organic beauty product is composed by 95% of ingredients derived from organic farming"". Even though the Cosmébio-Ecocert label, which is currently the most commonly used in France, simply ensures that 95% of ingredients are of natural origin and that at least 10% of the total amount of ingredients (and 95% of botanical ingredients) come from organic farming. ""There is quite a confusion between natural products (essential oils, Argan oil, ...) and organic products! ""adds Cegma Topo. The survey reveals that the only element guaranteeing the organic nature of a product, in this case, the labelling, is recognized as such by 52.9% of users. But for non-users of organic cosmetics it is mostly the general appearance of the packaging that is used as a reference. Cegma Topo also notes some confusion between the label and the brand marketed. Two issues seem to represent the biggest restraint for purchase: price and product efficiency. ""One French women out of three may give up in the purchase of organic cosmetics because of the price. French women are not ready to invest more than a few extra Euros to buy an organic product versus its non-organic equivalent. However, they don’t expect to pay less either. Otherwise, the product’s credibility would be compromised"", explain the authors of the study. ""Some vagueness still remains regarding products, their efficiency, labels ... One French women out of four would not buy some organic cosmetics if she was suspicious of the product’s efficiency. A doubt to be dispelled by the players of the organic industry"". concludes Claire Certenais, Customers Director at Cegma Topo."
Colour cosmetics to drive cosmetics sales in Russia,"A recent research study by industry research firm RNCOS has found that by 2012, nearly 16% of the cosmetic industry’s revenue generated in Russia will come from colour cosmetic segment.  “This segment has emerged as the one of the most dynamically growing segments of the industry, influenced by fashion trends and innovations,” comment the authors of the survey. According to RNCOS, the sales of colour cosmetic products have grown by almost 11% in recent years, generating total business of more than US$ 1.5 billion (around EUR 1 billion) in 2008. The consumption of make-up and other coloured cosmetics among Russian women is the highest in the European region, with an estimated 80% of Russian women using colour cosmetics. The report titled Russian Cosmetics Market Forecast (2008-2012) also found that the impact of financial crisis on colour cosmetics has been minimal as compared to other segments due to favourable shift in consumer behaviour among mass and luxury product categories. “The forecast given in the report is based upon the correlation between past market trends, statistical analysis and industry drivers,” RNCOS claims."
A new breed of consumers! ,"Premium Beauty News - Why are consummers between16 and 31 years of age are different from others? Yannick Brunat - Of course , this doesn’t mean that other consumers do not interest us. But one must admit that those born between 1978 and 1993 greatly impact our consumer society and therefore those who, like us, will seek to manufacture products that will attract them. They have significantly changed the codes. It’s the “digital” generation, the one that blurs the boundaries between work and private life. They don’t react like “classic” consumers. In short, they are fascinating and invite us to question ourselves. Who are they? They are usually very motivated and optimistic, they change jobs very quickly because they are free, they want to earn a lot of money, they are flexible in finding a balance between work and leisure, they like travelling and multiplying experiences, they invest on personal connections if only through their many business trips and urban experiences. Premium Beauty News -  It’s all work, hobbies and leisure! Yannick Brunat - In a way, yes! Work is an important component of success. This generation wants to win! This obviously affects its way of life, and vice versa! This age group lives in a very ""electric"" environment and spends a lot of money for that. It’s of course essential for this generation to stay connected anywhere at any time. The mobile phone has obviously become a must. Premium Beauty News -  Internet has a huge influence on this generation? Yannick Brunat - Yes absolutely !  If you compare with other generations, it’s the generation that’s the most online as it represents 30% of all Internet users. It’s also the same generation that uses two to three times more modern techniques of communication than the baby boomers (born between 1967 and 1977). Premium Beauty News - What about their consumption of cosmetic products? Yannick Brunat - This generation spends a lot of money to be fit and to be ""in""! They really want to take care of their skin and are ready to spend money for quality products. Premium Beauty News - Packaging is also important? Yannick Brunat - Absolutely. This age group relies on individualism and the desire to be different. They respect brands and seek authenticity. They break stereotype. They are seduced by technology, by new gesture, by nomadic solutions. At the same time, they like simplicity. Premium Beauty News - And with brands ? Yannick Brunat - Here, clearly, this generation wants to know how a brand can be part of its environment and contribute to its personal lifestyle. If we give a ranking to the motivations, we find that price is not the most important concern for this generation (unlike others), but that the brand’s perception is, on the contrary very important. And the environment comes after as does the place where products were manufactured. The Baby Boomers generation is the one that feels the most concerned about price. The brand matters much less. The environment, on the contrary, is very important. And to complete this survey, the brands most commonly named in the United States by the generation of 16/31 years of age, are: H & M, Adidas, Apple, Levi’s, Volkswagen, Converse. If we look at perfume brands, we find for women: Jean-Paul Gaultier, Dior, and for men: Hugo Boss, Diesel, CK One…And for cosmetic products: Clinique, Mac… And make-up: Chanel, Shiseido. Premium Beauty News - Lots of information for you and you own product development? Yannick Brunat - It’s true that it has helped us in our recent developments. The ModulArt range for instance."
Natural and organic cosmetic standards are proliferating,"Organic Monitor’s new Technical Insights report critically assesses the leading international natural and organic cosmetic standards. Although standards are gaining in popularity, their adoption is mostly on a national basis. Very few standards have built a regional - let alone international - presence. Furthermore, the differences between the most popular standards in each region remain wide. Standards are the most widely adopted in Europe where almost two-thirds of all natural and organic cosmetic products are certified. Ecocert and BDIH are the leading standards, partly because of the high adoption rates in France and Germany, respectively. Ecocert’s popularity is partially because it has a natural and organic standard, whereas most certification agencies only propose one option. Although various standards have been introduced in North America over the last 18 months, very few products have become certified.}} Organic Monitor estimates less than 5 percent of natural and organic cosmetics are certified in the region. Backed by leading natural cosmetic companies, the Natural Products Association (NPA) standard is the frontrunner. The NSF ANSI 305 ‘made with organic’ standard is expected to gain popularity once certification begins.  The absence of an organic cosmetic standard however, is leading to a number of American companies to adopt the USDA NOP standard. Although designed for organic food products, it is popular with cosmetic companies that use food-grade ingredients. Natural and organic cosmetic standards are also being introduced in other regions such as the Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The adoption rates however are exceptionally low. Many natural cosmetic companies in these regions focus on exports, making them favour European standards. The Ecocert standard has become the most popular in countries such as Japan, Malaysia and Brazil. Organic Monitor also undertakes a critical review of new regional and international initiatives such as Cosmos and NaTrue. The Cosmos standard, scheduled to be implemented in January 2010, has been developed over seven years of negotiations between leading certification agencies in Europe; its launch is expected to mark a milestone for the European natural cosmetics industry. However, its goal of becoming an eventual European standard is facing competition from NaTrue. More than 150 products have become certified by NaTrue since the standard was launched a year ago."
"Natural  cosmetics: ""Consumers are expecting new answers""","Premium Beauty News - The market of natural and organic cosmetics now seems to have reached a turning point? Sandie Jaidane - The market share of natural and organic cosmetics in Europe hasn’t stopped growing for ten years, but consumers and their expectations have changed considerably. Our aim, during the Natural Beauty Summit is to have a better understanding of these changes. To help us, we will present many exclusive market researches, on consumers and semiology and perception of the press, conducted in France and in other countries. RISC International will present in particular, the results of a survey started in 1992 in ten countries and will analyze consumers’ high expectations for  natural ingredients and science. Furthermore, IPSOS will present a  survey carried out on 4000 consumers in four different countries (France, United Kingdom, United States and Italy). Premium Beauty News - Retail for instance has changed a lot? Sandie Jaidane - Today, the whole of retail is significantly positioned around natural products. Specialized networks are developing everywhere across Europe. Online sales amount for nearly 30% of turnover. Retailers are launching their own natural brands. For many brands the first question is: where to sell? How to conciliate demand with current referencing? Premium Beauty News - And what about the organic cosmetic product? Sandie Jaidane - Today, the big question for the female consumer is: are natural and organic products efficient? Because actually marketing of fear, based on concerns related to some ingredients, has left marks. The consequences are, that for not having advertized on the ingredients present in cosmetics instead of those that were removed, natural products are too often perceived as neutral, with little or no efficiency at all. On this topic, the Ephyla company will be presenting the results of its survey on luxury cosmetics. and will also explain the significant progress of third generation natural formulae. Premium Beauty News - This raises the question on the efficiency of new ""green ingredients""? Sandie Jaidane - There is a large number of issues on the subject: are green ingredients true palliatives to synthetic or petro-chemical ingredients? Can we really substitute everything? What are the limits to ""everything natural""? Premium Beauty News - You also address the issue regarding controversial ingredients. It is a sensitive subject. Sandie Jaidane - It is the first time a conference deals with such a tricky topic. The aim is to take stock of scientific knowledge on some cosmetic ingredients that led to media controversy involving their safety. It is a well known expert in the world of cosmetics, Pierre Perrier of Essential Consulting, who will try to put the various surveys in perspective for us. We will also talk about the palliatives used as substitutes for these ingredients: are they as efficient and in what quantity? What hindsight do we have? Are their manufacturing process more environmentally friendly? Premium Beauty News - You will obviously raise the subject regarding labels and certifications. What is the situation today? Sandie Jaidane - In recent years there has been a increase in the number labels and logos delivered by certifying bodies, stamped onto the packaging of cosmetic products. For France only, we will name Cosmébio, Coméco, Nature & Progrès, Ecocert and Qualité France. BDiH and Demeter for Germany. The Soil Association in UK, AIAB, ICEA for Italy, Ecogarantie for Belgium, BIOSCI for Switzerland… More recently appeared, Natrue and soon there will be Cosmos Standard, two new European labels. Of course  consumers do not perceive the exact meaning of these labels or their differences. The result is that everyone is lost, even the brands who would like to choose a unique label for their country but also in order to penetrate international markets. The Natural Beauty Summit Europe will be held on November 23rd and 24th 2009 in Paris. For further information please refer to: www.naturalbeautysummit.com"
Luxe Pack Monaco: the saga goes on,"Prior to the show, crisis related issues, of course, were on all lips. Booth cancellations from some of the big market players were no help in order to restore confidence among the other members of the sector. On top of it, other factors intervened: on the opening day, not only the weather was dreadful, but in addition, half of the flights coming from Paris were canceled due to a strike by ground staff at Paris’ Orly airport. But no matter what, the 2009 edition of Luxe Pack Monaco was eventually, in the opinion of a majority of exhibitors we met, a good year ..., a very good year even. ""All the key players in the market showed up"". Or... ""We were surprised by the quality of visitors and by the high level of demand"". Hence, newly available stands, quickly found takers from companies on the organizers’ waiting list. When a good idea turns into a saga In over twenty years, this show has definitely anchored itself in the global landscape of luxury products suppliers. And the two other Luxe Pack taking place in New York and Shanghai, only confirm the relevancy of this concept. And yet it was nowhere near winning in 1988, reads the book published to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the show in 1998 (a collector’s item in the hands of a privileged few!). One understands that at the time, many heavyweights in the industry were turning their nose up to join this new concept. But one also learns that the first forty few exhibitors from the outset (many companies from Oyonnax, but also international firms) believed strongly in Luxe Pack Monaco and as they literally appropriated the concept, thus contributed greatly to the success of the event. By the end of the first edition (which recorded 400 visitors!), Everyone had the feeling that the idea would make some progress. And indeed it did, much faster than what the creators had imagined. The following year, the number of exhibitors rose to sixty and the number of visitors doubled. In 1990, it was a sure thing. And all this happening...under a tent! Believe it or not, for over ten years Luxe Pack was held underneath a tent set up near the Heliport, the very same one used to host the annual International Circus Festival! Pioneers recall heat, water ingress during storms, early chilly winters. “But what an atmosphere!” recall with nostalgia exhibitors and visitors from the outset. A true family..., happy to gather again, every year, in a particularly friendly and warm atmosphere. Today Luxe Pack Monaco has obviously improved itself. But one feels that this event was tailor-made to fit in naturally into this puzzling yet, beautiful building of the Grimaldi Forum. The 2009 edition which recently closed its doors was a true surprise for many people. Activity was intense in the aisles and on the stands ... And among exhibitors, a true commitment for innovation seemed to be the appropriate answer to crisis. Strange atmosphere, where some branches of the sector still have their activity in hot water (sometimes very hot), showing falls in activity from 30% to 50%, while others nevertheless, flirt, with +15%. Strange atmosphere where those who had decided not to exhibit were quickly replaced by those who where dreaming of nothing else. Strange atmosphere where, despite inquiries on a high (not orders), almost all professionals where being pessimistic for the coming months. A show being at the crossroads? Surely. Where “nothing will ever be the same again” was on everyone’s lips. But where the question “how will it then be?” encounter quite different answers, if any! In any case, you can be sure of one thing: targeted events have good days ahead."
MakeUp in Paris is underway,"Premium Beauty News - This event is clearly happening at the right moment. Thierry de Bachmakoff - Makeup is a world apart in the universe of beauty because it creates a visual link with the other magical worlds of fashion, photography and cinema.  This is what gives this event such richness because it crosses, mixes up, and combines very varied creativities and truly deserved a special place in the world of events. Anne Camilli - I agree with Thierry  de Baschmakoff,  the universe of makeup has a place quite unique within the beauty business, essentially because of its infinite capacity for renewal. Its great richness comes from various sources of inspiration. It is made of Art and Science. 
 There is therefore every reason to promote makeup through a different event. Premium Beauty News - Anne Camilli, within the organizers’ staff you will be in charge of the cultural and organizational aspects of the event. Thierry de Bachmakoff, you will assist the team with the stage setting. Why and how do you think this event will be a success? Thierry de Bachmakoff - A combination between festive, irrational and superfluous, one of the bases of luxury, combined with the most audacious techniques to express this visual extravaganza can lead us to think without too much exaggeration, that this event will be a sheer delight....for the eyes and incidentally for business. Anne Camilli - Makeup is alive, animated. It is colour, but colours are ""unpredictable"". They cannot easily be classified into categories as describes Dominique Simonet in Couleurs, le Grand  Livre. I find it essential to enhance makeup through special events, exchanges, exhibitions etc. ... and to highlight the more or less visible links it shares with other artistic universes. To my eyes, the concept of exchange is important because it is a source for improvement. Premium Beauty News - Makeup is undoubtedly one of the most innovative sector in today’s world of beauty. Creativity is everywhere. Makeup Artists, Makeup Schools, manufacturers, all of them will contribute to make this two day event a ""great makeup celebration"".
So why not join the party? Thierry de Bachmakoff - Glamour, light, codes, emotions, colors, glances, clichés ..... everything is makeup as soon as the curtain rises, then yes you can refer to it as a makeup celebration, our scenography will make it a conceptual.... and surprising point of honour.
Anne Camilli - Make-up is a stage setting the beauty of which is the theater. It is a matter of getting across to the audience and for all the actors in this industry to play to a full house on the 24th and 25th of June next, with a mission to highlight, the imagination, the creativity, the inventiveness of their universe! MakeUp in Paris

"“We expect a good turnout for Cosmoprof Asia,” Aureliana De Sanctis, SoGeCos","Premium Beauty News - What are the perspectives for the next edition of Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong? Aureliana De Sanctis - Cosmoprof Asia being the Asia Pacific leading beauty exhibition in the region the show represent the most important business meeting point in the year and also the most effective way to make multiple contacts with existing and potential customers in Asia. International group pavilions have confirmed participation such as France, one of the most important contingent of companies at the show, Germany, Italy, Spain, Israel, the UK, the USA, and new this year South Africa and Poland. Upon completion of the expansion project, after two years of renovation, the Hong Kong Convention Centre will become more visitor-friendly and easy to navigate. All the categories represented will benefit from a customised visitors flow along the redesigned hall sectorization. Premium Beauty News - The impact of the economic crisis seems to be lower in Asia than in other areas. Aureliana De Sanctis - It is true. Despite the economic challenges affecting the global economies, the cosmetics market in Asia holds on and sales figures remain impressive. For this very reason we expect a good turnout for Cosmoprof Asia 2009 both in terms of exhibitors and visitors from the region. Premium Beauty News - On the other hand, do you think that the year 2010 will be more difficult for your European business? Aureliana De Sanctis - We think, and signals give us reason, that the year 2009 represented the heights of business’ slowdown in the beauty sector. In reference to signals of optimism, they are supported by a positivity that Cosmoprof North America has tested. In fact, a strong business recovery was perceived during the manifestation.  This is the advantage of being an international platform, allowing us to understand business trends in advance. Cosmoprof Worldwide in Bologna (Italy) sustains this signal with 60% of spaces already confirmed seven months before the beginning of the fair. This fact underlines the importance of performing every years events that support the industry also in hard time. Premium Beauty News - Could you tell us a few words about your new projects worldwide? Aureliana De Sanctis - I can only anticipate we are working on very important partnership transactions and acquisitions of international and national realities that will contribute to the Cosmoprof’s capillarity in the world."
"""Things have changed in retail"", Thibault Ponroy","The theme of the last and traditional early morning rendezvous of the BeautyFull Club, moderated by Thibault Ponroy, was Selective Distribution, What alternative for brands? The president of the French Federation of Selective Retailers reviewed the situation of selective distribution in Europe. According to him, ""sharing information and knowledge on consumer behavior is essential because it allows all the actors of the beauty sector to have a better visibility and a real capacity for anticipation"". An initiative that would imply ""the creation of vertical links and bridges, the decompartmentalization of the different actors involved in our business."" In short, a true call for dialog within the beauty industry, aiming at a better anticipation of sale volumes. Thibault Ponroy was of course questioned on the attitude of retailers in recent months, he stressed on the fact that distribution could not be used as a variable of adjustment by keeping high levels of stock out of proportion with actual needs. “De-stocking is not a goal. The actual phenomenon is mainly an inevitable readjustment in times of crisis of all the financial and economical indicators of companies in the distribution sector… Things have changed in distribution. It has concentrated and professionalized itself, and switched in 15 years from a structure composed mainly of SME (even VSE) to a structure composed of multinational groups, with shareholders often leaders in their field, familiar with best management techniques and quoted at the stock exchange”. The enthusiastic discussions and the number of people attending this new rendezvous truly delighted Charles-Emmanuel Gounod. The President of BeautyFull Club, who believes that ""talks are useful and essential to the Beauty industry,"" has invited all participants to join the Club and take part into its activities."
Asian companies turning to natural and organic cosmetic standards,"New research by Organic Monitor finds a growing number of Asian companies are taking the certification route, with most opting for European standards. The Ecocert standard is the most widely adopted, including companies in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Australia. “Natural and organic standards are increasingly becoming a point-of-difference for these brands,” says Organic Monitor. In Malaysia, the Buds Cherished Organics brand is reporting a sales surge since the Ecocert-certified range was launched earlier this year.  Produced by the Malaysian company I-Green, it is the first Asian brand of certified organic baby care products. The company believes organic certification is responsible for its large take-up rate.  The success of the Buds Cherished Organics brand is leading the Malaysian company to start exporting to neighbouring Asian countries and Europe. It is also looking to start certification of its other brands. Asian consumers are turning to natural and organic cosmetics as they become more aware of the possible risks associated with certain synthetic chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries. Health scares, especially those involving Chinese products, have raised consumer interest in product quality and safety issues. “Certification gives a guarantee that products meet high production standards and are less likely to contain potentially harmful chemicals,” explains the market research firm. In China, the Australian brand Jasmin Skincare is capitalising on consumer demand for ‘chemically-clean’ cosmetics. The company is also reporting a large sales rise since it started marketing its certified products. To gain confidence with such Chinese consumers, Jasmin Skincare executives have even stated their products are safe enough to eat. Certification is key to Jasmin Skincare’s success. It is one of a growing number of Australian cosmetic companies adopting the Organic Food Chain (OFC) cosmetic standard. Its products are made from certified organic ingredients, many of which are USDA certified. Other Australian companies are adopting European cosmetic standards, with Ecocert again the most popular. Nature’s Care has recently launched a range of certified organic personal care products. It has adopted the Ecocert standard because it is more internationally recognised than OFC. To many companies, certification not only provides a guarantee that high production standards are met, it also opens up export markets. “In this respect, American brands risk losing out in the fast growing Asian natural cosmetics market. American brands such as Nature’s Gate and Aveda are very successful in Asia, however these brands have not adopted natural and organic cosmetic standards. With very few American companies adopting standards, European and Australian brands look to capitalise on growing Asian demand for certified natural and organic cosmetics,” Organic Monitor comments. To help Asian companies adopt natural and organic cosmetic standards, Organic Monitor is conducting a dedicated workshop on October 14th in Singapore. Titled De-mystifying natural and organic cosmetic standards, the workshop is led by Judi Beerling, technical research manager at Organic Monitor. Natural & organic cosmetic standards will also be featured in the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, held in Frankfurt, Nov 16-17th."
European natural cosmetics sales approaching EUR 2 billion,"Organic Monitor’s 2009 edition of The European Natural Cosmetics Market report [1] finds that natural and organic cosmetic sales have been affected by the financial crisis. However, healthy growth is continuing because of increasing distribution and high consumer demand for ‘chemically-clean’ and ethical cosmetics. The UK market has been the most adversely affected. The market growth rate has dropped from 16 percent in 2008 to 8 percent in 2009 because sales have been hit in organic food shops and health food retailers. However, natural and organic cosmetic sales continue to expand at double-digit rates in other European countries. The French and German markets are the fastest growing in Europe. High growth rates are occurring as product penetration increases in mainstream retailers. Both countries have observed a large number of retailer private label launches in recent years. Certified natural and organic cosmetics have been introduced under private labels of supermarkets, drugstores, perfumeries, organic food shops and discounters in these countries. Private labels are so successful in Germany that they comprise over 10% of total sales. Natural and organic products now comprise 3% of total cosmetic sales in Europe. The market share is above 4% in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. High growth in the German market is projected to raise the market share of natural & organic cosmetics to 10% in the coming years. Apart from private labels, a major retailing trend is the growing number of concept stores for natural and organic beauty products. Dedicated stores are being opened by leading natural cosmetic brands, large retail groups as well as private investors. Most developments are in Paris where highly established brands such as Dr. Hauschka as well as large retailers like Monoprix are opening concept stores. Actually, rising competition is leading natural and organic cosmetic brands to expand distribution outside traditional sales channels. With competition for retail shelf-space stepping up, Organic Monitor expects market winners to be companies who can successfully differentiate their products. New entrants and existing participants are advised to consider strategies based on product differentiation and market segmentation; companies should target specific consumer groups or sales channels. The latest figures on the European Natural Cosmetics Market, including market growth projections and business opportunities are highlighted in a dedicated workshop in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit. Taking place in Frankfurt (November 16-17th), the summit will also feature presentations from certification agencies and ingredient suppliers."
Make-Up in Paris: the new meeting place of the make-up industry,"Premium Beauty News - A very simple question: why “Make-Up in Paris”? Sandra Maguarian - Jean-Yves Bourgeois, who gave birth to this project, has an experience of over thirty years in the cosmetics business and, thanks to its extensive relationship in this industry, he was able to identify the interest of an event entirely devoted to make-up. Nowadays, make-up is probably the sector generating most innovations and technological developments in the beauty industry.  Whether a box or a makeup pencil, a lip-gloss, a tube of lipstick, a mascara, a nail polisher, or an airless container ..., technology is everywhere.  This is probably the industry that requires the most advanced expertise at all levels: formulation, packaging and marketing. Did you know, for instance, that the gesture for making up is not the same in Japan and in Europe so that formulae and textures adapt accordingly? Regarding formulae, they are evolving constantly. The whole being subject to more and more stringent legal obligations. Once again, it’s time for innovation with products that will contain molecules capable of modifying specifically a defined skin condition or to adapt to specific signatures. Custom-made cosmetic is probably becoming more than just an idea. Who says ""technique"", says ""innovation"" and ""emulation"".  Make-Up in Paris will reflect all these aspects. Premium Beauty News - It is therefore a unique event to share with unique people? Sandra Maguarian - Actually, make-up is a world apart, which comprises its specialized schools, its make-up artists, its own wordings, its own customs, its language, its codes and its magazines. The United States incidentally were the first goers in this field.  In Europe, nothing! Not one dedicated event to gather this industry.
Make-Up in Paris has the ambition of becoming the personalized and unavoidable meeting place of this business where all actors can congregate in a professional but friendly place, and participating in a set of unavoidable events. Premium Beauty News - This confirms the tendency for targeted events? Sandra Maguarian - Current economic trends call for an overhauling of business events as we have known them for thirty years in Europe.  Expert events focusing on high specificity segments have been fully tried and tested. Make-Up in Paris will be very specifically ""this event"".  Because it is truly an event, not a show in a traditional way.  The selected location and its lay-out will enable the world of make-up to fully express itself.  The various adjacent events will suit with visitors’ expectations, may they be brands, suppliers or retailer,s and of course, all the professionals-to-be. Premium Beauty News - Economically, this segment is one of the healthiest of all? Sandra Maguarian - Quite true! In recent years, the make-up business has been among those showing the steadiest progression rates and the strongest growth prospects.  It is the most resilient sector to the crisis.  Maybe because of the famous Lipstick effect! Premium Beauty News - What is the offer and who are the customers? Sandra Maguarian - The beauty business is constantly changing!  And the crisis accelerated a bit more these changes with as a main trend: the need to widen the offer while providing flawless service. First consequence, the emergence of a new kind of suppliers able to supply all or part of the service. Another important outcome, “added value” is, more than ever, a key word in an industrial sector that has seen its margins decreased significantly over the last ten years. How can you create added value, except by offering a broader and optimum service to a demanding customer-market? Container and content are more than ever indivisible for several reasons: – The shift towards more “fragile” and more natural formulae, continues to reinforce the idea of content protection.
– The need for a complete offer compels the relevant industrial sectors to widen their specialization (manufacturers of cosmetic components widen their skills towards packaging and those in packaging do the same towards cosmetic components).
– Creativity requires good symbiosis between container and content. Aiming at not simply proposing a “global service” but also a “global offer”, operators in the makeup segment must follow or even anticipate trends.  The arrival of the first make-up artists in the world of manufacturers (whether in packaging, in formulation or filling) occurred only recently.  As well as the emergence at formulators’ of research departments specialized in packaging! Make-Up in Paris will allow professionals worldwide from marketing, development or purchase departments, to participate in an “outstanding” event.  I insist on our will to create a true moment for exchanges and to recreate during this event at the heart of Paris, the universe of makeup with its profusion of colours, its inventiveness, its youthfulness. Premium Beauty News - So, when and where? Sandra Maguarian - Jean-Yves Bourgeois and myself, with our entire team, will host the make-up business on the 24th and 25th of June 2010 at l’Espace Pierre Cardin, Avenue Gabriel, just a few steps in parallel to the Champs-Elysées. For further information, feel free to visit the event’s website: www.makeup-in-paris.com"
The natural cosmetics market needs better consistency,"Since years natural cosmetics represent a growth segment par excellence and without doubt this trend continues and will exert influence on the whole cosmetics market in general. Considered worldwide, sales are growing by US$ 1 billion per annum and are currently estimated at around US$ 7 billion in total. As in the case of organic food, the great demand for natural cosmetics is concentrated on Europe and North America. Customers in Germany spent about EUR 672 million on natural cosmetics in 2008, a significant increase of 9.7 % compared to the previous year.  The organic natural and „near-natural“ segments would already represent 10 % of the German market. And the market isn’t saturated yet!  The rising environmental consciousness and health awareness among consumers, as well as the desire for sustainability are fuelling the growth. Speakers at the second Natural Cosmetics Conference - which took place from September 22 to 23, on the occasion of the Nuremberg fair - particularly turned their attention to increased market differentiation, and to the specificities of marketing natural cosmetic brands. Elfriede Dambacher, who has been managing Naturkosmetik Konzepte, a consulting firm, since 2003 to advise manufacturers and trading companies in the natural cosmetics markets, primarily specialising in strategic marketing and sales consulting and the development, and publisher of the Natural Cosmetics Report 2008 and Natural Yearbook 2009, said that variety keeps the market on the move, and asked if natural cosmetics could be viewed as the pacemaker for the international beauty sector. Indeed, the natural cosmetics business is one of the few economic sectors that show favourable development rates. Reasons for growth rank from consumer trends (cultural and social changes) to the search for alternative energies and raw materials and the shift from material prosperity to social wealth, or from prestige luxury to ethic luxuriousness!  Increased media presence, and the rising number of distribution channels are also important factors of growth.  According to Elfriede Dambacher the segment is currently evolving from a demand-driven to a supply market, which means new challenges for everyone involved. Irene Domberger and Dr. Stefan Kraus gave some practical examples and addressed key issues such as: Is premium natural cosmetics the growth market of the future? Do natural cosmetics need their own POS concepts? How much green glamour is credible? Since 2006, Irene Domberger has been working with a French producer on the development and introduction of a new shop concept under the name of Autrepart Nature. The aim is to integrate products and manufacturers who offer exclusively natural cosmetics and also specialise in the organic segment. The basic philosophy is “no risk for customer’s health, fair trade and no animal tests”. Dr. Stefan Kraus is the founder of the Dr. Kraus pharmacies. The concept combines well-known international cult brands with natural cosmetics classics.  Dr Kraus also sells online. Irene Domberger and Dr. Stefan Kraus got to the point that much more innovative shop concepts have to be developed in the future.  They also consider that “shop in shop” concepts are of major interest. These concerted actions would provide authenticity and confidence and establish an appropriate basis for and a better perception of the entire natural cosmetics market. Hana Hrstková, manager of the Kline Market Research’s office in Prague, confirmed that consumer’s awareness in is growing and will help pave way for new product receptivity. As far as the US market is concerned, she explained that mainstream marketers of personal care products have a low penetration rate in the natural cosmetics segment and that they would have interest to help natural brands with high growth potential to develop. She said there are many excellent candidates for acquisition. Regarding opportunities in Europe she explained that more retail shelf space is opening up to naturals, that distribution channels will continue to broaden with natural products becoming more readily available, that smaller less developed product categories offer growth opportunities to marketers, that new standards will help to decrease confusion among consumers and that Russia and other Eastern European markets are less mature markets where consumer interest and demand for natural personal care products is on the rise. Eventually, all speakers agreed that the potential of natural cosmetics has hardly been exhausted! However, the development of the segment needs better consistency. The next Natural Cosmetics Conference will be hold on 14-15 September 2010 at the Congress Centre in Nuremberg."
Organic Monitor launches international summits on sustainability in cosmetics,"Organic Monitor - a research and consulting company focusing on organic product industries - is launching a series of international summits on sustainability and green chemistry in cosmetics.  The inaugural summit will be held in Frankfurt (Germany), on the 16th and 17th of November 2009. The major themes of the first edition are market and industry developments, sustainability and CSR best-practices, and developing green formulations.  George Korres, founder and CEO of Korres Natural Products, will kick off the summit with an opening address titled “Building a sustainable future through natural cosmetics”.  Other speakers include representatives from natural cosmetic firms such as Weleda and Laverana. The opening session of the summit will give an update on the global natural cosmetics industry.  Mr. Amarjit Sahota, Director of Organic Monitor, will present the latest figures on the global market for natural and organic cosmetics and highlight the major trends and developments.  An update will then be given on international natural & organic cosmetic standards by leading certification agencies. Emerging standards in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific will also be featured. Food ingredients in cosmetics are the theme of a workshop on the first day of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit. “High consumer demand for natural and organic cosmetics is leading many product developers to turn to the kitchen table for cosmetic ingredients,” Organic Monitor claims. The workshop will look at the opportunities food ingredients provide, highlighting the technical and formulation challenges."
Beyond Beauty Paris: “A good year 2009”,"Premium Beauty News - The 2009 edition of Beyond Beauty Paris was apparently a success, despite the crisis. What do you believe the reasons where for this success? David Bondi - For three main reasons I think: – The need to reassure oneself collectively by meeting other people, especially when the economic environment is difficult.
– The proximity between the exhibition area and the offices of the major French groups, which impacted noticeably the progression of the revisits rate. 45% of visitors revisited Beyond Beauty Paris a second day or more, this is important, and I think this also due the quality of the offer in each of the 3 shows. [1]
– The need for renewal: discovering small nuggets niche products, organic products, thinking about future product developments, etc... Premium Beauty News - The choice of the Porte de Versailles proved to be a good one! What was the eventual number of visitors? David Bondi - We have welcomed this year 19,000 visitors including 28% of foreigners. A better year than expected and a slight decline in international, due to lower investment travels and probably also because of fears of H1N1 flu. When we realized that, for the L’Oreal group alone, nearly 450 people had pre-registered, we understood the importance, both of our relocation at Porte de Versailles and of an international event in Paris. Our tradeshow with 505 exhibitors is the second biggest professional beauty event in the European market. [2] Premium Beauty News - Very good attendance rate also at conferences including on Monday morning in the first hours! Apparently packaging and full service are hot issues. David Bondi - These topics are at the heart of Creative, Beyond Beauty’s section devoted to suppliers.  With 1/3 of the offer in packaging, 1/3 in private label and 1/3 in ingredients and other partners: the whole chain is represented. As far as conferences are concerned, our commitment is also to provide a high quality panel of speakers with free access for all professionals. Premium Beauty News - What conclusions do you draw from this edition David Bondi - Refocusing our offer around the Beyond Beauty Paris event featuring three shows, more clearly staged, was generally appreciated by visitors who had a better comprehension of the event. We will beef up even more the scheduling of conferences, which is one of the strong points since the creation of the event in 2003. We will be persistent to demonstrate to operators who are still reluctant to exhibit that the quality/price ratio is ideal in Paris, at the start of Autumn because manufacturers, for understandable reasons start to rationalize their non-media investments."
Shoppers Drug Mart to open five new Murale stores,"Canadian chain retailer Shoppers Drug Mart Corporation, recently opened a new Murale store in Toronto. The high-end beauty store is the third of its kind to open in Canada, after two previous locations, in Ottawa in November, and in Montreal in December 2008. As the previous stores, the new location at Don Mills at 1090 Don Mills Road features a selection of luxury, dermatological, fragrance and niche brands from around the world.  The assortment of leading global luxury prestige cosmetics brands includes Bobbi Brown, Chanel, Estée Lauder, Lancôme and Nars, among others, each with their own area for interactivity and application. The store’s fragrance section includes over 75 men’s and women’s scents from fragrance houses and designers like Prada, Donna Karan, Chloé, Cartier and État Libre d’Orange. The skin care and dermatological area features brands like Natura Bissé, Vichy, Murad, and Darphin. Shoppers Drug Mart Corporation plans to open up to five additional Murale locations in Canada this year including stores in Calgary and Vancouver."
Beauty and sustainability at Creative 2009,"Every year, companies participating in Creative seem to be taking up a little more of the ecological challenge. From organic ingredients to green plastic packaging a large part of the 230 exhibitors will showcase a greener and more responsible offer. On the occasion of the show, Cosmetochem, a Swiss producer of plant extracts, is launching a range of 100% organic plant extracts, containing no preservatives, made up of 6 plant references from organic channels (raspberry, lavender, linden, elderberry, vanilla, green tea). Similarly, the Solabia group, a designer and manufacturer of molecules and active ingredients for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and neutraceutical industries, is announcing the increase of its raw materials, actives and extracts offer, in compliance with Ecocert and/or other organic standards. Malian women producing Kaloje®, a shea-butter based range, also expect the organic certification they recently obtained will help confirm the success they met last year. Packaging suppliers also are taking up to the ecological design. Specialized since 1986 in developing packaging, paper bags, plastic bags, silk papers, ribbons, boxes and gift boxes, AK Emballages is adapting its offer to environmental protection.  The company now offers a large selection of recycled and/or bio-degradable paper printed bags on a wide variety of supports such as white and brown recycled Kraft papers, white and brown special texture papers, ""Ecokraft"" paper series, to name a few. Other example, the Italian manufacturer Leoplast, was one of the first to launch into the creation of 100% organic plastic packaging materials, in 2004. Five years later, its range VegetalPlastic, a 0% oil-derived plastic packaging, represents a new generation of packaging that is increasingly winning over the cosmetics industry. “The sustainability trend affects all market segments: mass, masstige and prestige brands are all eager to find solutions for this challenge,” explains Muriel Lesbros, marketing consultant for Quadpack, one of Europe’s fastest growing, independent packaging groups supplying prestige packaging solutions to the cosmetics and beauty markets.  In the wake of its noted collaboration on the 100% ecological line Nude Skincare, Quadpack is consolidating its offer of eco-friendly products for luxury cosmetics packaging. Market analyses made by Organic Monitor, reveal that sales of organic and natural cosmetics in Europe have for the first time exceeded 2 billion of dollars in 2008.  The growth continues in 2009 at a sustained pace even if it has slow down compared to 2008."
Sustainable development under the spotlight at Luxe Pack,"Premium Beauty News - The period is critical for trade shows worldwide.  What about the 2009 edition of Luxe Pack in Monaco? Nathalie Grosdidier - This edition is fully booked, with a total number of exhibitors that is slightly increasing to almost 330 companies.  It is the highest figure ever recorded since the creation of the show.  Luxe Pack remains the leading and unrivalled place where buyers and producers of luxury goods packaging can meet. One again this year, visitors will be delighted with an offering covering almost any of materials, and featuring new products, new finishing technologies and many other innovations linked to high-end packaging. Even before landing to Monaco, visitors will also have the opportunity to prepare their visit through the show’s interactive floor plan, which will be available on our new website.  Luxe Pack being a real source of inspiration and creativity, we thought it was important to help visitors to catch 100% of what’s related to their projects. Premium Beauty News - However, the current economic situation has forced several exhibitors to get away from the show this year.  What is the impact of these cancellations on the show? Nathalie Grosdidier - Our main hope is that these customers be able to come back next year. Nevertheless, it is important to note that, despite the current situation of the economy, Luxe Pack enjoys a turnover rate which is very low, compared to the industry’s standards. What’s new in 2009, is the participation of 60 new exhibitors who never participated in the show before.  This was made possible because the average size of stands slightly decreased, and because we were able to reorganize the floor plan.  These new exhibitors will certainly contribute to the large scope of know-how and creativity that singularize the specialized offer that visitors are used to find at Luxe Pack. Premium Beauty News - What are the highlights of Luxe Pack Monaco this year? Nathalie Grosdidier - We chose to focus on two issues, which will be particularly highlighted, including through prospective studies. The first one is sustainable development, with a dedicated showcase area gathering all the eco-designed products proposed by Luxe Pack exhibitors, as well as original proposals from students of the Strate College on the theme “more magic, less materials”. The second issue is packaging trends, with the “Luxe Pack Trends Observer,” which features a specific showcase and a conference and workshop. But Luxe Pack also put the lights on many other issues and professional expertise, helping professional to share their views, in particular through free admission conferences.  Among many others, we are glad to propose a VIP Round Table featuring Vera Strubi, Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance and Gilles Lipovetski. I would also advice to come and discover the special exhibit of a unique selection of lipsticks gathered by Jean-Marie Martin-Hattemberg. The exceptional design and the originality of some pieces dating back to 1900 are surprising. Premium Beauty News - There are now two spin-off events in the USA and in China.  What about the 2010 editions of these other Luxe Pack shows? Nathalie Grosdidier - Luxe Pack New York is now deeply rooted in the USA.  The event is acknowledged as a different and efficient tradeshow corresponding to the sector’s expectations.  Its original formula proved attractive and the show is now a must-go event. Luxe Pack Shanghai was conceived according to the same principles that proved successful in New York and 2010 will be the third edition of the event.  I think this show was launched at the right time. The number of exhibitors doubled from the first to the second edition.  Furthermore, the growth rate of the country is self-explanatory of the interest of the show."
HBA conferences to focus on market trends,"The Trends Conference at the HBA Global Expo will deal with new consumer habits as they are impacted by the recession. Kicking-off the conference, Karen Grant, the Global Beauty Industry Expert at The NPD Group will present a custom HBA Survey identifying key consumer findings on what is happening in the cosmetics, skincare and fragrance marketplace and its affect on product development plans. Ms. Grant will provide an overview on how the economy has affected the beauty sector and consumer buying behaviour, including what beauty channels have been impacted the most, and the difference ethnicity and geography may have on purchasing decisions and patterns. She will then present exclusive HBA research that delves into who is currently using and not using beauty products including make-up, skin care and fragrance.  The data will unveil how these findings differ by age, region, income and ethnic group.  Compelling insight on why consumers have never used or stopped using beauty products in the past two years will also be discussed. Eventually, the HBA research will also analyze the length of time consumers will try a product before deciding if it is effective and their reasons for not purchasing the product again.  The overall shopping experience will also come into play as well as what other products consumers buy when shopping for beauty. Other sessions to be held on the occasion of the Trends Conference at HBA will also deal with new consumer behaviours, trying to identify emerging trends and new habits, including sessions such as :“How to Market the Recessionista” with leading experts from Bliss, Oasis Day Spa, Red Door Spa and CO Bigelow, or “Inspirational Colors for 2010” with trend watchers from Pantone and Ampacet, and “How to Attract and Engage Beauty Customers During the Recession,” presented by Allure Magazine. The Trends Conference will take place on Tuesday, September 15th at the during HBA Global Expo & Conference, at the Javits Center in New York. In addition to the Trends Conference, HBA will also provide educational programming tracks on Green Business, Private Label, and the HBA Marketing and Technical Conference. HBA Global Expo will open with a Keynote Address by organic and naturals pioneer and advocate, Horst Rechelbacher, Founder of Intelligent Nutrients and Aveda followed by a special presentation of the “Positively Beautiful” award by Lisa Price of Carol’s Daughter."
Structural shifts in cosmetics market benefit to affordable products,"Citing recent trading figures from leading global personal care producers, Fitch - an international credit rating agency headquartered in New York and London - notes that consumers’ shopping habits are moving away from premium brands to more affordable mass market products. “Although cyclicality is an obvious reason for the decline in demand for luxury products, as consumers trade down for a short time period before trading up again when economic conditions improve, there are also arguments for a structural shift in consumer behaviour. This is because mass market products are increasingly being perceived as offering similar benefits to luxury care products at much lower price points,” claim the authors of the report. According to Fitch, this lack of differentiation reflects in cosmetics companies’ results and in their organic sales growth in the first half of 2009.  While professional hair-care products and other luxury care products were in decline, mass-market cosmetic products showed relative dynamic growth in contrast, the agency notes. Fitch claims that for the six months to June 2009, L’Oréal, Beiersdorf, Estee Lauder, Shiseido and P&G’s results were affected by sales decline for their prestige beauty and personal care divisions. In contrast, companies such as Henkel, Unilever  and Avon, would benefit from their focus on affordable mass-market products and strong presence in emerging markets and recorded good organic growth in the first half of 2009. Fitch also identifies threats of substitution to high-end anti-aging products in the form of pharmaceutical-based injection fillers and potentially broader use of cosmetic laser applications.  Statistics from The American Society of Plastic Surgeons showed that the number of individuals having minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures increased 5% in 2008 to reach 10.4 million in the US, with the popularity of these procedures growing in Europe as well. Capitalising on this trend, Galderma  - a joint venture between L’Oreal and Nestle - has developed a rival product to Botox, Azzalure, which received approvals from health regulators in several European countries this year. Overall, Fitch expects growth in the global personal care sector to slow in 2009, reflecting weakened demand in developed countries, particularly as consumers may remain value and price aware. “Emerging markets represent continuing growth opportunities for traditional personal care products (about 40% of the global cosmetics market in 2008) and are expected to grow over the long-term, driven by an increase in middle-class consumer purchasing power,” Fitch claims."
Sustainable packaging is an emerging issue,"“Sustainably-oriented packaging is becoming a consumer expectation. It is one of a growing number of issues driven by ethics, economics and environmentalism. Economic imperatives, as well as possible greater regulation, mean that more brands need to consider sustainable packaging in order to adapt their present approach,” commented Matthew Adams, Consumer Analyst at Datamonitor and author of the report: Sustainable Packaging Trends: Consumer Perspectives and Product Opportunities. The results of Datamonitor’s consumer survey in the second half of 2008 showed within selected countries of Europe between 39% and 67% of consumers felt that packaging design has a medium or high level of influence over their choice. The highest rate of influence was found in France with consumers in Sweden also demonstrating high levels of importance. Of the seven countries in Western Europe surveyed by Datamonitor, the UK was the country where the greatest proportion of survey respondents showed high levels of concern about over packaging of products in the household goods market. Consumers in France and Spain also showed high levels of concern. “This is a threat to unresponsive producers in the household goods market if consumers choose to react to continued excessive packaging with their own pro-active, pre-emptive methods,” said Matthew Adamas. In 2008, 51% of French and Spanish respondents agreed they seek alternative products if they deem the one they were considering buying is excessively packaged in any way. This proportion is slightly ahead of the rest of Western Europe and markedly higher proportion than in the US."
Beyond Beauty: winds of change over the Parisian show,"According to David Bondi, Beyond Beauty Paris is a not to miss event in Europe. With nearly 600 exhibitors this year, “it is the only European event of international scope to bring together the entire cosmetics manufacturing sector”. The Creative exhibition, in particular, is the occasion to “maintain your relationships with your usual suppliers and stand out from your competitors with a new offer!” Over 230 international beauty suppliers - packaging, Private Label, packing, promotional articles, machines, suppliers of ingredients and raw materials, design & style - are expected this year. “In the heart of Beyond Beauty Paris, Creative owes its lasting presence to its ability to bring together both international leaders and small companies with targeted know-how. Business complexes and associations such as Cosmetic Valley or Cosmed are present and actively represented. Creative updates and hones its offer every year, attracting a wide international audience of decision makers from every sector of the cosmetics industry since 2004.” This year again, Beyond Beauty Paris talks series offer to visitors an exclusive opportunity to get in on the profession’s questionings on the major issues of the moment. “The rundown, perspectives, analysis of consumer behaviour, and solutions for the future, covering everything from the supplier phase to the launch phase… subjects taking on special resonance in this period of uncertainty that is spurring us to think even further ahead and that, even more, requires expertise,” explains David Bondi. “Because BBP is fully aware of the difficult economic outlook, access to these talks will be free this year on a space-available basis.

China: cosmetic market to keep growing despite crisis,"Chinese cosmetics and toiletries market, which comprises of hair care, fragrances, make-up/colour cosmetics, was worth an estimated US$ 16.9 billion in 2008 and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR [1] of just over 13% through 2012, says a new report Cosmetics and Toiletries Market in China from India-based market research firm, RNCOS. According to the report, the sharp increase of the hair care and skin care segments will boost the overall cosmetic market growth in China and will safe guard the market from the impacts of the ongoing worldwide economic crisis during 2009-2012. As a result, the market is anticipated to cross US$ 28 Billion. In their report, RNCOS show that the China’s economy, which recorded highest GDP growth in the Asia-Pacific region in 2008, attracted significant foreign direct investment in the cosmetics and toiletries industry of the country. China’s GDP growth further transformed into considerable increase in disposable income of especially the middle class population. Increased spending power coupled with improved awareness about cosmetics and personal care offerings has shaped in tremendous boost in cosmetics and toiletries demand in the country. In addition, Chinese male consumers have shown receptive approach towards previously ignored segments of the market. For instance, fragrances and men’s personal care products demand is rapidly surging in the country due to the western culture influence and media promotions. “These new segments will not only enable the existing players to cater the high growth opportunities but will also demand new players to provide answers to overflowed demands,” comment the authors of the report."
CVS/pharmacy expands Beauty 360 concept,"US retailer CVS/pharmacy recently opened of the third Beauty 360 location in Ridgefield, Connecticut.  The prestige beauty store also added ten new brands across cosmetics and skincare and has introduced hair care to its product offering.  The new brand partners are Vincent Longo, Cargo, Jack Black, Anthony Logistics for Men, Mario Badescu, Bioelements, Philip B, LOLA, H20+ and Neil George and will be available at all Beauty 360 locations beginning this month.

The Ahava line is currently available at Beauty 360 stores."
"« Only the price matters », Xavier Adnet, Bormioli Rocco USA","Premium Beauty News - In a very difficult economic context for glassmakers, don’t you feel some kind of tremor? What is the situation exactly? Xavier Adnet - We are far from the resurgence in trade, and we don’t feel any tremor, our customers and the retailers are still looking for ways to reduce their stocks.  The recession is particularly strong in the perfume sector, while the cosmetic sector remains flat. What is really worrying is that we do not see the light at the end of the tunnel.  However, I am sure that our customers are aware that it will be difficult for us to react as quickly when orders start flowing in again. We will have to make choices. Premium Beauty News – What are your company’s main assets? Xavier Adnet - To be acknowledged in terms of service and quality. Of course this has nothing to do with the present situation, it is a long-winded task. Premium Beauty News - In the range of products that you manufacture for the beauty sector, are some products more on the roll than others and why? Xavier Adnet - “On the roll” is probably excessive.  Let’s say that the cosmetics segment is relatively less impacted, and is only decreasing slightly, while the perfumery segment is decreasing strongly, except for the mass market.  We are selling more small containers than we were used.  Retailers are boosting small sizes rather than reducing the price of a big item, there is resurgence of the “good money value” Premium Beauty News - Perfume and cosmetic brands, seem to have fully understood the full service concept. Xavier Adnet - Nowadays, customers think ahead, they are looking for what you could call the turn key. That allows them to make economics of scales and concentrate on the working capital. We are doing our best to meet such requirement. Premium Beauty News - Environmental issues are also a concern. How do you address this issue in terms of products? Xavier Adnet - But in the United States this topic is put aside in favour of price issues. When economy is booming the American customer has no difficulty in spending a bit more to purchase a home-made product and help reduce the carbon footprint. But today the only thing that makes the difference is green, not in the sense of green/environment but in the sense green/Dollar."
Polishing the crisis...,"Premium Beauty News – In a difficult economic context, nail polish seems to be doing very well? Siegfried Prive – In these times of uncertainty, nail polish has a lot to offer in terms of attractiveness. First of all, it is a pleasure-product with a low price positioning, therefore, affordable for everyone. We also notice growing interest for this product, coming from major brands, a movement first started by the greatest designers, opinion leaders. This opens the way to a very dynamic offer on products with concepts very much linked to fashion in order to  answer needs from beauty addicts. A good example of the connection between product and fashion is  the offer on black and green trendy shades. Today, from, the feminine magazine, local or international, to the TV show, movie star, or even football player, no one takes a chance to ignore polish. 
Media visibility on polish has never been stronger. The product, through its target has rejuvenated, because even the younger ones and their tribes have monopolised polish. Obviously it is a promising sociological phenomenon for brands looking for growth engines. Finally this pleasure-purchase gesture requires a diversified product offer and some brands have understood the evolution of a polish that switched from a more static and classic image to an offer always on the move in a universe built on fashion and glamour. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us an idea, in terms of volumes, of the nail polish global market? How is it developing? Siegfried Prive - Some experts evaluate the global market to 3.5 billion bottles and the reduction in sizes seems to have reached a limit. A first evolution comes from the fact polishes are more accessible: while the concept of manicure service to the consumer was very popular in the distribution network of Beauty or Nails Salons in Asia, in the United States, in Russia, we notice that a variant, the Nails bars, is growing and developing in Central and Southern Europe which were traditionally self-service areas for polish. Of course this contributes to increase product accessibility. New packaging vectors - pens, and then patches, which attract another kind of customers; help improve availability and product attractiveness. A second evolution is linked with the stimulus offer. A classic management of a range as wide as 12 to 20 shades using umbrella brands targeted on homogeneous consumers, plus a few healthcare references has changed to more dynamism. Brands tend to be more open to the use of promotional or seasonal products, with a very short shelf life, which regenerates the offer and stimulated the interest of the end-user consumer. Some brands renew their ranges with promotional one shot offers for which shades, formulations, texture are not the only variables of innovation or of differentiation, but for which the packaging and secondary finish may also change very quickly, every 3 weeks for example. Different segment of masstige and private labels have rushed into this trend. This evolution regarding the frequency of launch generates gains in market shares for brands internally or externally organised to reduce delays and marketing costs, which reinforces the notion of partnership with manufacturers like Durlin. Premium Beauty News - Today, what is the nail polish user looking for? Siegfried Prive - Consumers are looking for novelty or product differentiation. Manufacturers like us usually respond with technological innovation and performance. Recently we have introduced in our formulations a patented polymer originally from the eye lenses industry. We have also reformulated our polishes with a less occlusive film, which increases exchanges with oxygen to allow the nail to breathe better, while improving the functional performances of the product. Along with high technological-value-added innovations, our expertise has intensified on synergisms with innovating packaging suppliers. But today, it is also our capacity to listen and anticipate fashion trends, linked with high creativity that helps us meet market expectations. Beyond consumers’ expectations, product is also impacted with new regulations, which widens our field of expertise and quality service customers are looking for. Premium Beauty News - Do these changes impact your production tool? Siegfried Prive - The increasingly short life span of products and the higher number of launches have led to a reduction in the average size of production batches. But above all 
brand’s demand is clearly aiming for a  full service product, with greater expectations in terms of capacity and quick response from R&D. The faster pace in industrialising innovations generates better integration between the teams of our customers, our R&D and production. Each year our investments are planned to answers these new needs as well as the evolution of regulatory framework. This is to ensure the safety of our staff, of our installations and of our supplies to our customers. We notice that these environmental, safety constraints but also the will to reduce expenses, prompts industrial transfers from our customers to their sub-contractors, which exemplifies Durlin’s acknowledged added value. Our industrial investments have developed in all our factories worldwide, thus in 2 years time, we doubled our capacity to offer turnkey products. For example on the Bergerac site (France) we have invested in the automation of our production lines in order to supply very quickly large quantities and offer high quality products, we have also increased our capacity on some sites with semiautomatic processes to meet requirements calling for flexibility and diversity. In parallel, our investments also concern quality control and our labs and R&D teams, always very active due to the frequency of new launches. Our legal department is also strongly structured in order to deal with the evolutions of different markets. The progressive enforcement of REACH and growing environmental expectations have given us a chance to re-examine our approach on raw material and manufacturing process. Durlin already certified ISO 9001 version 2008 has already applied to comply with new standards on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in cosmetics."
"“Let’s share information about consumers,” Thibaut Ponroy (FFPS)","Premium Beauty News - Crisis in the healthcare / beauty sector does not seem to be over yet. The whole of the supplying industry is impacted. On that point, people are blaming the de-stocking strategy of distribution networks. Thibault Ponroy – Once again I have the feeling that we are the perfect scapegoats. The original reason for the present situation the ""supplying"" industry sector is facing is not our 
de-stocking strategy but the consequences of consumers’ disaffection and decline in attendance of outlets. For what good reason should the distribution sector be used as a variable adjustment by keeping high levels of stocks it has no real need for? Keeping stocks has a very high cost ; this cost will even get heavier by the way, due to the passing of the Law of modernisation of the Economy, Law known as LME. De-stocking is not a goal, the actual phenomenon is mainly an inevitable readjustment in times of crisis of all the financial and economical indicators of companies in the distribution sector. Eventually, in our field regarding selective distribution in the perfume industry, things have changed a lot concerning distribution. It has concentrated, professionalised, and switched in 15 years from a structure composed chiefly of SME (even VSE) to a structure composed of multinational groups, with shareholders often leaders in their field, familiar with management and quoted at the stock exchange. Premium Beauty News – The question on everyone’s lips is if this situation is going to last much longer ? Thibault Ponroy – I don’t have a crystal ball but I would like to give you an answer. Some economists speak of an economic revival during the fourth semester in the United States and six month later in Europe. We will see. Having said that, among the different luxury sectors, it seems that cosmetics is confirmed to stand as an exception and that our sector is suffering rather less than others. Premium Beauty News – Many manufacturers of the packaging industry are experiencing unprecedented low production levels. What is your feeling Thibault Ponroy – I can actually imagine that a lot of manufacturers are in a very severe situation, due to the weakness of production levels with all the human, social, financial and, economic consequences we witness. However could it not have been possible to anticipate earlier in order to dampen such effects? I am very surprised by the absolute lack of dialogue between the manufacturers of the packaging and distribution sector, though the only ones to be in direct contact with consumers. We should use this economic downturn to start thinking differently and take it as an opportunity to better understand the global and prospective key factors of the Cosmetic market. Distribution is a reliable and daily thermometer on customers’ behaviours, doubts, concerns but also expectations. This sensibility must be better shared by all the actors of the Cosmetic sector. Premium Beauty News – During the lunch-debate organized by Beautyfull Club on February 11th, in Paris, you have called for all actors of the sector to collaborate. How can all these different professionals manage to communicate ? Thibault Ponroy – Exchanging data on consumer knowledge and consumer behaviour is fundamental. This will offers all the actors in the cosmetic sector a better visibility and a real capacity for anticipation. To achieve this we must organise and structure dialogue, create vertical links and bridges, and give a chance for all the actors in our sector to meet, whatever their business. This kind of dialog will not solve everything of course, but it can at least surely help beauty sector to progress. To organise such a dialogue is maybe also the mission to organise events like the Beautyfull Club does."
Trends in packaging design,"Respondents from across Europe, of which 62% worked in companies with 500 or more employees globally, cooperated to the survey of brand owners conducted by EskoArtwork in partnered with Adobe and the International Packaging Institute (I.P.I.) with the aim to gain a better understanding of emerging market demands. “While most of the respondents represented global companies, half are operating in small marketing workgroups and are senior managers or professionals. We believe their responses provide an accurate portrayal of the current state of mind for most brand owners,” says Dieter Janout, Global Director Brand Owners at EskoArtwork. The survey reaffirmed the growing popularity of and demand for, private labelling, with 54% of respondents reporting that their private label business accounted for up to 25% of revenues. Other key survey findings included the following: – Respondents strongly believed that the packaging’s ability to make a product stand out on the shelf is paramount. Equally strongly held is a belief that packaging will increase in importance in its role in the marketing mix. – 56% expect a significant increase in the use of digital prototyping either ‘definitely’ (12%) or ‘probably’ (44%). – However, only 15% said that providing sustainable packaging solutions was critical to or already addressed in their businesses today. Key drivers for sustainable packaging identified by respondents included consumers (70%), regulations and legislation (64%) and retail requirements (57%). 84% thought that ‘environmental and sociological constraints’ would require ‘significant change’ (63%) or ‘new ways required’ (21%). – 50% thought that packaging design will adapt to the opportunities presented by the Internet as online shopping becomes more prevalent. – Respondents gave a score of 7.8 out of 10 to the assertion that ‘right-sized or optimized packaging sizes’ will increase in importance over the next few years."
Sluggish growth projected in the U.S. cosmetics market,"U.S. sales in the cosmetics and toiletries market grew only by 0.3% in 2008, the lowest since 1991, according to the latest study completed by research and consulting firm Kline & Company. The new data available in Kline’s latest report - Cosmetics & Toiletries USA 2008 - indicates that sales have reached a total of US$35.6 billion at the manufacturers’ level. Kline projects that consumer concerns about the recession may ensure that these levels do not rise higher during 2009-2010. In the recession context, consumers are showing a preference for competitively-priced products from the mass and direct trade channels. Premium products sales are being affected heavily by these negative market conditions. In fact, salon, specialty, and luxury trade classes all demonstrated negative growth in 2008, whereas mass and direct trade classes turned out to be the fastest growing segments. “Many people have traded down on certain products, and as they get accustomed to buying some lower-priced or private-label products, and shop more in the lower-priced channels, they might well continue with those habits after the tough times have subsided. To be successful, companies will likely continue to infuse the mass segment with more sophisticated products to compete with luxury products,” notes Nancy Mills, Industry Manager, Consumer Products practice, at Kline. Skin care, the largest product class, was also the second-fastest growing category during 2008, spurred by the sun care category. Although consumers have curtailed spending, they are not ignoring innovative and sophisticated new products. Marketers propel growth with product development, albeit the rate of new launches slows down in 2008. Some brands that did very well in the previous years such as Bare Escentuals, had slower growth in 2008, whereas, some mass brands like Garnier skin care and Neutrogena sun care showed very strong growth. Some luxury brands did buck the trend with great results — such as La Prairie."
Luxe Pack New York: a successful show in a difficult environment,"Most of the exhibitors said they were satisfied with their participation in the show; Of course, in such a dull environment, every positive signs are welcomed. Actually, in New York too, the crisis was prominent… “US retailers would have already kissed goodbye to the holyday season,” was the kind of rumour heard in the aisles.  While, it was also possible to hear information about the level of new launches being more or less as usual. From the suppiers’ side, it appeared that, once again, prices hold the centre-stage.  “We are back to front again,” commented the representative of a plastic injection firm.  “And our customers do note hesitate to seize this opportunity,” commented another.  Within such a context several of them were openly speaking about the next bankruptcies to come."
Indian cosmetics market to stay away from global crisis,"The Indian cosmetic industry has witnessed rapid growth in the last couple of years, growing at a CAGR of around 7.5% between 2006 and 2008. With improving purchasing power and increasing fashion consciousness, the industry is expected to maintain the growth momentum (with marginal slowdown due to the global economic downturn) during the forecast period (2009-2012). It is projected to grow at a CAGR of around 7% during the forecast period, says a new report published by market research firm RNCOS [1]. The research also found that the Indian consumers are showing a highly receptive approach towards some entirely new segments such as Spa, Salon and Herbal cosmetics, which have emerged as some of the new trends in the Indian cosmetic market. “The growth will primarily be driven by growing desire of looking young and beautiful among Indian consumers. These segments will help the entire cosmetic market to experience an upward growth trend in coming years,” comments RNCOS Both electronic as well as print media are playing an important role in spreading awareness about cosmetic products and developing fashion consciousness among the Indian consumers. With the introduction of satellite television and a number of television channels as well as the Internet, the Indian consumers are constantly being updated about new cosmetic products, translating into the desire to purchase them. Additionally, the flourishing Indian film industry is fuelling growth in the industry by making Indians to realize the importance of having good looks and appearances. Despite the massive surge in the popularity of cosmetic products, the report finds that the average consumer spending on cosmetic products in India is much lesser than any other part of the world. This implies that the Indian cosmetic industry has an even greater potential for growth in future than present. However, manufacturers should not forget that the Indian domestic market is price sensitive and they need to work out innovative strategies to establish a foothold here, the report added. At present, most of cosmetics manufacturers in India cater to the domestic market but they are gradually establishing their footholds in overseas markets. In recent years, the Indian cosmetic manufacturers have received orders from overseas markets; for example - Indian herbal cosmetic products have a tremendous demand in the international market."
Plastic tubes: Revolution on its way,"Of course since the beginning of this year the prospects are not as good but according to the latest estimations, and depending on markets, sales will remain slack in 2009 or in the worse case will drop to - 10 %. Behind these figures half a dozen European companies manage to pull out from the pack with two unchallenged leaders, the Tupack group (1 billion alone!) and the Alcan group with more than a billion! Following, a small pack of companies including the Spanish Tuboplast that also owns CTL and Tapser (300 to 400 million), the French Soupletube (200 million), the German Linhardt (also 200 million), the Swiss Neopac… An industrial universe that has changed quite a lot during the last fifteen years with the arrival of some newcomers from Asia, Eastern countries, and even India. What about the ambitions of a company like Essel Propack that claims holding the third of the world market of the laminate tube, the headquarters of the company, located in India, weigh all sectors of businesses included, a respectable USD 2,4 billion turnover? But it has become a cruel universe where positions are earned at a high price (the cost of a production line is close to EUR 3 to 6 million) and where profitability depends more and more on the industrial strike force put in the balance. When in the end you consider a tub (plastic) is sold in Euros, around 25 cents or even 6 cents (laminate). A sector where the smallest mistake can cost you a lot. The Betts group (3 billion laminate tubes, USD 200 million in turnover) in financial turmoil presently knows something about it. Extruded plastic tube, laminate tube? Clearly the cosmetic industry uses more generally the first one than the second one. “But things are changing”, confess professionals involved. “The volumes are to be considered”. Favourite and historical market of the laminate tube: the toothpaste. As for the plastic tube, in a mono-material or coextruded version, it has always remained very attractive to the cosmetic industry. Especially when designers compete with one another with great cleverness in three fields: tube printing, development of new functionalities with mainly the use of new applicators, and the design of new shapes! Among the champions in these fields, Alcan Packaging Beauty, world leader in the cosmetic packaging industry that owns for the tube activity, not less than 15 manufacturing units (plastic tube and laminate tube) spread out in about ten countries. “Thanks to its quality of print”, explains François Tassart, Alcan Packaging Beauty’s Vice-President Sales & Marketing Director for the Tube Worldwide activity, “packaging conveniences, protective properties and product delivery rate, the tube is extremely popular with the general public and retains a real potential in terms of development.  Every year we reinvest continually in new machines and news production capacities. Emulation within the teams is constant to find the proper tube, the proper applicator, the proper capping system.” In close cooperation with customers, Alcan also strives into developing more and more environment-friendly tubes. “Their work has led our teams to design lightweight caps, do away with tamper-proof films and labels, replace thermal varnishes with UV varnishes, reduce sleeve thickness and use recycled plastics”. According to Michel Cochet, Codipack, representative of the Italian manufacturer Agatech (annual Production of 25 Millions parts, Turnover +/- EUR 3 millions), “Agatech  has a production line, but to meet increasing demand, plans to open a second one before the end of the year”. He believes “the tube holds a paramount position in every segment.  It will suit any kind of finishes and finishing technology, and now offers a wide range of capping that has made it unavoidable, whatever the market.” In times of constant research for minimum costs, the cost of a tube to conditioning remains fairly low compared to other types of packaging. Versatility of this type of packaging is a major element: plurality of use, ranges in capacities, formulas it can contain, brings confirmation that this leading product is also unavoidable. Its smoothness and easiness to use allow optimal product restitution and it is also very handy to carry around, everywhere you go. “Agatech recently widened its product offer, with a new range that was displayed at the last Cosmoprof in Bologna. It concerns tubes metalized using the FLEX technology: a technology and a know-how for a product targeting high-end markets and luxury products.” Enthusiasm is the same at Tuboplast/CTL... “The tube as always been in an evolution process these last ten years,” explains Eric Derouin, Tuboplast CTL Group’s Sales & Marketing Director, “in terms of variety of finishes, production speed and new functionalities. With regard to the Airless tube that we launched end of 2006 and that allows a new gesture to the end user as well as optimal protection of formulas, associated with the simplicity of a low cost easy filling process of the tubes.” “We are clearly the first and only leader on this segment with a wide offer ranging from 5 ml to 250 ml, plastic (coex / mono) and laminate with all types of pumps from the plastic ones for mass market to the more sophisticated metal ones. It’s a fast growing market. The tube is a base completely Airless with the frame of the tube, coex or airtight laminate + the Airless pump, unlike the systems with pistons where the frame of the bottle in PP, presents some porosity.  The Airless system is also the less expensive in terms of product but also in terms of filling, thereby, we support a full democratisation of Airless systems and the possibilities it offers.” Not to mention the general aspect of the tube, it is clearly what is spoken of as ""commodities"" in English language. It is convenient, flexible (in terms of consumer gesture but also in terms of market launch, fast, easy to fill) cost effective (inexpensive and with high filling-up rates). With an ordinary aspect in shape, it allows infinite decorative possibilities, offset, serigraphy, hot printing ...that offers customisation without framing the brand in a shape. Segmentation according to the channel springs from this variety of finishes but the tube himself is a universal packaging, for all type of channels. It is also the perfect partner for promotional, coffrets, in""+product"", in sleeve, pocket size.... Eventually, it is a youthful gesture, clean, fast e and easy to carry if necessary. It is the reflection of our society and of our consumer behaviours. This product, finally, is never outdated, because it does not restrain the brand in a shape code, allowing it to modernise itself, with the evolutions of finishes. It is simple to use and can be sophisticated at leisure through finishing. Consumers do not need to be trained, they are seduced and provoked by appetency not by the use of it. In this era of globalisation of brands it is a unique and universal packaging in terms of positioning with the freedom for each country to customise, finish and language: now, how can you beat that?? According to Cornelia Schmid, Marketing Communication at Neopac, the tube will never go out of fashion because: “It is convenient, easy to use, inexpensive, unbreakable, attractive thanks to its finish, less expensive that the other types of eco friendly packaging”. Capacity for innovation is a standard at Neopac. The firm has developed tubes with Airless pumps for liquids and creams, the ""Dropper-Tubes"" for nutricosmetics (drop by drop system), The Pinpoint Tube with its silicone applicator for smooth and precise applications, single use tubes for dermo-cosmetic applications... “We focus, explains Cornelia Schmid, on four main markets in cosmetics:  Luxury, with our special finishes; Natural, our tubes offer a high barrier for products with no preservatives; Wellbeing, our tubes offer specific and pleasant contact sensation, Cosmeceuticals, our monodose tubes for facials with very high barrier proprieties to protect special products from oxygen contact”. For Hans Eckhardt Cosmetics’ Sales & Marketing Manager, Linhardt, (a production site for plastic tubes and two production sites for aluminium tubes and a joint-venture in Egypt, in Cairo, for the production of aluminium tubes), “when you look at it, on all markets, the tube is self- advantageous: the luxury segment, for instance, can take advantage of a tube with serigraphic direct printing, the addition of a pump bringing even more value to it. Mass market segment will profit from a very competitive price, and great flexibility in sizes. It is obviously a major advantage with our customers asking us to be very responsive in the present economical context. The labelled tube is a good compromise between high quality printing and an excellent quality/price ratio for products sold in different countries and therefore different languages. The coextruded or laminate tube is a perfect barrier for sensitive products”. On this point, the German company offers currently a new tube, the multiflex tube (an improved laminate tube with a juxtaposed welding instead of a overlaid one which allows combination of different complexes and printing at 360°). Speaking again of novelties, the new dispensing tube from Linhardt equipped with a Rexam pump, which offers customers an airless tube with a safe and simple filling process, the filling being identical to the one implemented with tubes using caps. “There is a great expectation coming from the market explains Hans Eckhardt, not only in terms of preservation of the content but also in terms of use and promotion. Along with the diameter 35, we also propose the diameters 40, 30 and 19 and in a few weeks time our range will see the addition of a multiflex tube combined to a pump”. “One must admit, says Hans Eckhardt, that the tube never goes out of fashion precisely because of its versatility of use in all fields linked to cosmetics (skincare, haircare, suncare, men, etc...). And in our time where everyone feels concerned by environmental issues, the lightweight of a tube (approx. 15gr. for 150ml) combined with  an excellent bleeding rate is a genuine environmental ‘plus’”. It is undoubtedly a segment in which some industrial actors have decided to play a part. According to Bruno Douvillier, BDPack, and representative in France of the Swedish producer, Tectubes (EUR 30 million in turnover, 240 millions plastic tubes including 190 injected and the remainder extruded and a 105 millions in aluminium), “if the tube is not out fashioned it is mainly for the following reasons: simple to use for the end user, simple to fill for the manufacturer, good product protection with an excellent Quality/Price ratio”. Latest innovation to have been launch onto the market by Tectubes:  an injected decorated tube using the IML process (In Mould Labelling) “which offers quality and an exceptional rendering of finishes, explains Bruno Duvillier, which allows us to be very competitive when dealing with small series”."
"“Tube got its edge,” Eric Firmin, HCP","Premium Beauty News - What have been the main technical evolutions in the tube business since the last five years? Eric Firmin - To be honest, as far as I know, there has been hardly any important technical evolutions. Alcan-Cebal tried doing embossing directly onto the tubes to make it look like more real. Another interesting technical progress was the high-resolution picture printing on tubes. Actually, it mainly consisted in improving the printing quality on tube, whereas in the past similar results was only possible to achieve through labels or heat-transfer films. Eventually, our “One piece Tube & Cap” in an oval shape, and with its focus on “environmental friendliness”, has been the main breakthrough innovation for a while. Its price is the same and it offers a 15% material reduction compared to a traditional round tube.  As environmental friendliness is key for the retail, that’s a great competitive advantage. Another innovation is the “Dispensing Tube” that we have created for liquid formulations.  The conceptual background is the fact that liquid products are not packed in tubes since the product would drip out once the cap is removed.  In order to improve dispensing properties, we added a silicon valve at the tube orifice to control the flow of the product evacuation.  The silicon valve opens as the consumer starts exerting pressure on the tube and closes immediately once the force is released.  The evacuation of the product from the tube is now regulated, which leaves it cleaner. Even very liquid product (like watery or oily products) can now be packed in a tube!  Furthermore, the silicon valve system helps preventing too much air going back to the tube to deteriorate the product packed inside. Premium Beauty News - Mass-market, “masstige” or prestige and luxury, which segment is the best for tubes? Eric Firmin - Tube applications are traditionally predominant in the mass market and upper mass market segments.  Indeed, as primarily tubes come in stock package, they cost less than other types of packaging, with less time spent in their development and limited tooling expenditure. Another reason is that tubes have a simple design (compared to a bottle requiring a dispensing pump) and they are very practical. However, the wide usage of tubes in the mass has been a limiting factor of their development in the luxury market, as brand owners were eager to prevent customers from depreciating products in packaging associated with the mass segment. Nevertheless, for certain luxury products, where portable and dispensing properties need to be enhanced, tubes remain the preferred options though the outlook will not be the same. For example, tubes exist in oval shape, most of them in screw on cap instead of flip top cap, and with secondary process (e.g. vacuum plating, spray coating) on the screw on cap, to differentiate them from the mass-market designs. Tube is also the most preferred packaging option for promotional size and free samples items in the luxury market. Premium Beauty News - Are tubes influenced by fashion trends? Eric Firmin - Not really, I think.  And there is always a need for tube.  In a context where everybody is talking about “speed to market,” tube got its edge in supporting this strategy. Also, it remains a very economical option for package with dispensing properties.  I anticipate small size tube packaging still got substantial demand potential, in particular with the 100 mL size restriction in the travel industry. Tubes are still the ideal package for this kind of requirement. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps forward? Is innovation still possible in the tube business? Eric Firmin - In my opinion, there are two different innovation streams in the tubes business, namely: construction breakthrough (including material) and decoration breakthrough. Regarding the construction side, I believe that the next development steps will be oriented towards: – the development of environmental friendly materials (bio-renewable, bio-degradable…),
– the reduction of material used in the production - like our One-piece Tube & Cap,
– the increased use of high transparency materials - like our Surlyn material development,
– the development of high barrier properties materials,
– the development of “air-backless” tube construction, which is linked to the reduction in the use of chemical preservative systems, implying more sophisticated packaging and requiring a very good seal to prevent contamination from the outside environment. Regarding the decoration side, the key factor of success is to achieve better quality at flat costs mainly through: – high resolution printing, which is a basic requirement for normal paper printing but remains very difficult to achieve on a tube,
– combination of offset and silk-screening printing, though the technology is not new further development is required for lowering its cost."
UK retail will never be the same again,"Verdict Research is predicting just 8.1% growth in the UK over the five years to 2013, a massive drop from the increase of 14.1% in the same period to 2008 [1].  “The good news though is that survivors will find themselves in a far less competitive environment, with major opportunities for market share gains and winning new customers,” Verdict says. Despite the retail downturn being very much a prolonged affair, 2009 will be the year in which the market is at its weakest, with the first negative growth since Verdict Research’s records began way back in 1984.  Total UK retail will decline by 0.6%, or £1.7bn, whilst non-food spending will decline by 3.0%.  “This will inevitably mean more hard times for retailers and more significant casualties”. The UK’s economy, including the housing market, will remain unstable over the period, undermining both consumer confidence and spending power.  The main driver of the decline though will be rocketing unemployment. “Unemployment will not peak until late in 2010, as cutbacks continue to spread outwards from the financial sector, to affect all areas of the UK workforce,” says Malcolm Pinkerton, Senior Retail Analyst at Verdict Research and author of the report. The economic crisis is more severe than any for decades and will therefore take a much longer time to recover from. “At present it seems we are still facing a considerable wait before the bank’s balance sheets are sufficiently stable for them to resume a high degree of lending again,” adds Pinkerton. Indeed, the return to economic growth will not necessarily herald a retail recovery. Verdict Research is predicting a return to positive GDP growth in 2011, yet non-food growth in 2011 in the UK will be just 1.1%. “The truth is that retail very much has problems of its own,” says Pinkerton. Indeed, the recession is not merely fostering a temporary change in consumer mindsets, agrees Matthew Piner, retail analyst at Verdict Research and the report’s co-author, but providing the catalyst for a long-term transformation. “By the end of this downturn, shopper psychology will be irreversibly changed from that of the heady days seen in the late 90’s and early part of this decade,” he says. “Shoppers from the lower socio-economic groups in particular will have formed a more price conscious outlook and an intolerance of taking on debt to fund retail expenditure.” As such, non-food retail growth in the UK will be just 2.1% and 2.5% in 2012 and 2013, a much more reserved level than the average 6.3% annual growth seen through the nineties. Retailers will have to adapt in varying ways, but innovation, differentiation and exclusive products will need to become an integral part of retailers operations. “Retailers will have to learn to balance the new consumer desire for quality, timeless products, with the need to drive shorter replacement cycles for areas where consumers are instinctively cutting back,” says Piner. “They will have to compete harder on the entry price items upon which consumers are more sensitive, whilst becoming more adept at adding value to higher priced products.” Merchandising will also need to become more efficient, both in a logistical sense and in terms of driving sales."
"“The crisis thrashes out given ideas,” Dominique Bouvier, Strand Cosmetics Europe","Premium Beauty News - The crisis seems to stimulate you, so do new regulations Dominique Bouvier - That’s true. Let’s dare to say it: “Long live the crisis!”  Actually, the shock wave of the sudden financial collapse is still impacting the general economy.  By trashing out all given ideas, the crisis implies that we use some common sense again. That’s an occasion to develop more balanced business relationships and healthy partnerships between customers and suppliers, on a win-win basis and a mutual respect of each-others. Freedom is not just another word for jungle law, freedom implies that operators on the market be aware of the span of their responsibility. That’s precisely the aim of the future European regulation, and of the recent French law for the modernization of the economy, which clearly stress solidarity and economic efficiency. Premium Beauty News - Strand’s new collection reflects this optimism? Dominique Bouvier - Yes. We’re strongly confident in our ability to guide our customers in the beauty world, and we have designed a collection of skin care and make-up products to generate strong emotions. “Ritualis”, for instance, was born from questions regarding the meaning of our cosmetic rituals. Inspired from sacred rituals, pagans heritage or rites of passage, all our cosmetic habits aims at increasing attractiveness. The range features futurist formulations, evolving textures, all what’s needed to charm customers. For the eye’s area, we developed: – “Stay-on Eye Shadow” is a range of smooth eye-shadows, with delicate and bright colours, for mysterious and innocent eyes,
– “Energetic Eye Liner,” a product designed to highlight the eye with a virginal white line (great effect on a tanned skin),
– “Mythic Khôl,” inspired from oriental customs. And also: – “Skin Perfect Prep”, a transparent complexion enhancer that beautifies the skin,
– “Snow Flake Peeling”, white and fresh as the snow… to remove dead cells and impurities,
– “Voile Lacté,” that wraps the body into a moisturising veil that smoothes the skin. And many other novelties combining innovation and pleasure… Premium Beauty News - What about the next few months? Dominique Bouvier - The general mood was really optimistic at the Cosmoprof tradeshow in Bologna last month. The companies we met have a lot of projects.  Maybe there was less visitors, but their quality was better than on the previous years. After some necessary corrections, I think that innovation and quality will allow us to attract consumers again and our industry should be able to get out from the depression faster than others. However, the quality of distribution networks is a key factor of success today.  The new European regulation will lead to the creation of new retail channels, in particular regarding dermo-cosmetic products. We’ll be attentive to these major evolutions. Premium Beauty News - What about your projects for 2009? Dominique Bouvier - We recently achieved a period of strong industrial investments, and we are now working at the validation of additional quality certifications: in particular the ISO 22176, to complement the ISO 9001, and North America good manufacturing guidelines for OTC drugs. Furthermore, Strand Cosmetics Europe has launched its own environment-friendly policy and all our staff has signed-up the company’s sustainable development charter, featuring various measures to reduce our environmental impact, in particular regarding energy and water consumption. We are also about to get the Ecocert certification, which will allow us to widen our range of products and services and to step into the “green cosmetics” market.  However, we are particularly cautious on the quality of all those new green operators that are contacting us.  There is a real demand for transparency and health safety from final consumers, but deceptive claims are the big problem of this dynamic market segment, and companies should be careful about possible backlashes. As far as new technologies are concerned, we have concluded several transversal partnerships this year, with the aim to develop innovative products, in particular in the textile area, and we’re also working on new dispersion technologies."
"“Beauty industry professionals, now more than ever, need to meet,” David Bondi, ITEC France","According to David Bondi, Paris remains a hub for the beauty, cosmetics and spa industries, and Beyond Beauty, which hosts three shows under one single roof [1], offers “the most profitable concept for opening new markets in France and Europe”.  Moreover, “Beauty industry professionals, now more than ever, need to meet and talk,” he adds. For the first time this year, Beyond Beauty is leaving the exhibition district of Paris Nord Villepinte and will be held at the exhibition centre of Porte de Versailles, in the very heart of the city. Another news, the Zoom area, which presents a selection of young emerging brands, is being completed with a new space called Beyond Zoom exclusively for niche brands, which are also highly appreciated by buyers. Also, in addition to the Beauty Challenger Awards, a jury of experts will give out the Beauty Organics Awards for the very first time. These awards will recognize the best organic-labelled launches. Furthermore, Beyond Beauty’s Spa section has been renamed the European Spa Exhibition & Summit, and aims at taking on another dimension. “It’s an all-new version that’s being organized, exclusively created with European spa professionals.  With the help of a steering committee made up of important market players like Clarins, Comfort Zone, Decléor, and Lemi among others, we have worked on a set-up that is really adapted to the typology of the sector.  The trade show now has a strong identity that’s special to the spa world, and everything is done to give priority to business and networking.  The Proguidespa.com Hub, exclusively designed for the European Spa Exhibition & Summit, contributes to identifying those with European-level projects and promotes networking with our exhibitors,” explains Sophie Dudicourt, who’s responsible for the project."
Lostmac’h exports Brittany through cosmetics,"After having exported Provence’s scents, herbs and traditions worldwide, some French cosmetics makers may have find a new source of inspiration and excellence in Brittany. The westernmost part of the French territory was already the source of a large palette of marine ingredients and of skin and body care products derived from the ranges used in the region’s famous thalassotherapy centres.  Brands such as Nominoe or Lostmac’h now illustrate the Breizh touch (“Breton touch”) in the high-end cosmetics segment. While Nominoe is betting on the organic and ethic trend, Lostmac’h is positioned in the “art perfumery” segment, which was recently showcased at the Exsence tradeshow in Milan. Named after a beach on the Crozon peninsula, “the last beach of continental Europe”, Lostmac’h proposes an olfactory trip to Brittany, through product ranges evocative of sea scum, heather, and beaches, and featuring Breton names such as Iroaz, Atao, Lann-Ael, Ael Mat, … With 40 points of sale, Italy is the first market of the young brand from Brittany, then come Benelux, France, and the USA.  Lostmac’h can also boast being available in about 15 outlets in Australia. Why Brittany? “Heather, gorse bush, lily, blue thistle, ochre stone, wild colours, heavily fragranced air, sea ciselled stones, sun and fogs …  The nature is unforgettable there, with many images, scents and feelings that I tried to capture in fragrance and skincare products.  Brittany in this sense is accessible to everybody,” explains Antoine Vuillermet, the brand’s creator. Thus, Antoine Vuillermet gathered Brittany’s different faces in three product lines (fragrances, extreme skin care and perfumed candles) that are offered in luxurious packaging, inspired from Brittany’s traditional imagery. “There was nothing so far for celebrating Brittany’s treasures, sharing its resources, and offering access to its benefits and pleasures.”  Antoine Vuillermet’s brands is currently distributed in its own shop in Rennes (the administrative capital of Brittany), and at the Printemps department store in Paris.  Another store will open in the Paris’ Marais district."
"Luxury goods sales to drop by 10% in 2009, says Bain & Company","Bain & Company has released a semi-annual update to its Luxury Goods Worldwide Market study (7th edition) in response to the sharp deterioration of the global economy since October 2008. “This year’s declines are hitting both the top and bottom lines of luxury goods companies,” said the study’s author Claudia D’Arpizio, a Bain partner and luxury goods expert based in Milan. “Luxury shoppers are spending less, travelling less and feeling less confident. Luxury goods producers are also feeling the additional squeeze of intense pricing pressure and markdowns from retailers and higher-end department stores.” Bain estimates a 15% decline in the Americas and 10% declines in Europe and Japan. These major luxury markets account for over 80% of worldwide sales. Smaller luxury markets show more promise, with projected growth of 7% in China and 2% in the Middle East, but these gains will provide only a small offset against steep declines in major markets. Among the major luxury product categories, apparel will be hit the hardest, declining by 15%. Jewelry and watches will decline by 12%, while leather goods, shoes and accessories will decline by 10%. Luxury cosmetics and fragrances will be the most resilient categories in 2009 with sales of 22.4 billion euro for cosmetics and 18.4 billion euro for fragrances, both comparable to 2008 levels. Though luxury companies will face increased pressures in 2009, Ms. D’Arpizio cautions them to resist overreacting to anticipated declines. Bain’s analysis shows a long-term trend of continued growth in the number of luxury customers with the new segments emerging, including: – newly affluent consumers in emerging markets, especially working women,
– men who are more willing to pamper themselves,
– younger generations with new tastes and styles,
– the increasing number of high net worth individuals (according to Bain’s 2009 China Private Wealth Study, the number of Chinese high net worth individuals - those with more than 10 million RMB, or approximately US$1.5 million - is estimated to grow by 6% in 2009)."
Cosmoprof: a lacklustre edition,"The absence of any form of queue on the opening day at the entrance of the Cosmoprof tradeshow (Bologna, Italy) was the most surprising event at Cosmoprof this year.  A phenomenon the organisers explain by the online sale of 31,000 tickets, a 63% increase compared to the previous year, representing a third of the total number of tickets sold. Nevertheless, the organisers have announced a 7.5% decrease of the number of visitors compared to the previous year.  Eventually, about 140,000 visitors were recorded, including 33,000 non-Italian visitors, the latter falling by a dramatic -14.9% compared to 2008. Regarding the 2,248 exhibitors, including 60% (1,323) non-Italian companies, they enjoyed a huge 91,000 square metres of exhibition surface. From the suppliers’ side, the halls 19 and 20 (Cosmopack) were missing several industry leaders such as  Rexam, Coster, Seidel, Schwan-Stabilo or Cosmolab, among others… Nevertheless, those who chose to participate in the show have been positively surprised by the number of contacts on their stand.  “Many contacts from Italy, but only very few from the USA, not surprising anyway!  Relatively few French, in particular from the most prestigious brands”.  Despite the fact that the organisers had invited a delegation of French buyers to attend the show, including a dinner with a selection of exhibitors. This year again, Cosmopack seemed lacking consistency and having difficulties to offer halls fully dedicated to perfumery and cosmetic packaging.  Hall 19, in particular, proposed a mix of machinery suppliers, packaging manufacturers, and Asian suppliers of low quality items. Such a lack of consistency does not help to highlight the most innovative offer. However, several exhibitors were displaying interesting new products.  MeadWestvaco, for instance, unveiled series of new airless bottles (Aria Airless, Prelude Airless, Pearl Mini Airless) offering various decorative options, which are entirely made in the group’s European plants and are available all over Europe.  Dieter Bakic Enterprises presented Aqua Lux, a new range of acrylic jars, and several novelties in the double-walled Kronos range, and Pan the company’s first airless bottle. As far as perfumes and cosmetics are concerned, the absence of many prestigious and niche brands was notable this year. Niche and art perfumery brands, which are highlighted in the Masterpieces section, where much less numerous this year.  The first edition of the Esxence tradeshow, which was held simultaneously in Milan, certainly contributed to this situation. Adding to this dismal display, the decoration of the Masterpieces section, in the hall 30 was particularly poor. From a general point of view, one may question the choice of halls 29 and 30 to host the selective section of he show.  In the absence of any appropriate decoration, these two old buildings are a poor shell for high-end products.  The organisers have apparently spotted the problem and subsequently announced that the way prestige and high-end cosmetic makers are hosted at Cosmoprof will be entirely reviewed. “A year and a show that were poor in breakthrough innovations,” according to Nathalie Dessirier, a trends and lifestyle consultant, co-founder of Cap Beauty. Eventually, the heart of Cosmoprof was beating in the most recent halls 14, 15, 16 and 18, hosting spa and salon brands and equipments."
"“Creativity is Brazil’s main asset,” Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva","Premium Beauty News - What is the situation of Brazilian cosmetics makers in the current economic context? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - Actually, ABIHPEC’s [1] sixth participation in Cosmoprof has been impacted by the economic crisis.  We account fewer exhibitors than in 2008 since several Brazilian companies chose to focus their investments on the domestic market and the consolidation of their existing international business. Because of its size and dynamism, the Brazilian cosmetic, toiletry and fragrance market, may be regarded as a good shelter during the international crisis. With an 8.6% share of the world market, according to Euromonitor, Brazil holds the third position in the 2008 ranking, losing only to the United States (15.6%) and Japan (10.1%). Premium Beauty News - What are the main trends of the Brazilian market? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - In contrast to Europe, the Brazilian market is characterized by a preference for long hair. Consequently, the hair care market is the biggest segment in Brazil, and the one where Brazilian companies are the most innovative.  According to Euromonitor, Brazil holds on fifth (20.6%) of the world’s conditioners market. Premium Beauty News - What about the natural trend? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - Consumers worldwide are increasingly aware of the advantages of maximizing the amount of natural ingredients in cosmetic products.  Brazilian consumers also are seeking more natural products.  From this point of view, the Brazilian ecosystem and biodiversity is a huge asset for our industry.  Indeed, this biodiversity is a fantastic tank of cosmetic actives. Among the 250,000 native botanical species that are known in Brazil, only 300 have been studied for their potential health and beauty properties. Premium Beauty News - What are your main goals on international markets? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - In 2008, Brazilian exports of cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances grew by 20.5%, up to US$ 647.8 million. Brazilian companies exported to 140 countries in 2008, compared to 90 in 1998. As far as Europe is concerned, Brazilian cosmetics makers have settled their strongest positions in Eastern Europe and in Portugal. Even if Brazil’s market-share is relatively small in Western Europe, there’s no obstacle for growth.  Brazilian cosmetics products have a good image, they are well accepted by consumers and their price is attractive for importers and retailers. In the last 10 years, Brazil has recorded a cumulative growth of 357.6% in exports, while imports have grown by 65.6%. Our trade balance turned positive in 2002.  In 2008, the surplus totalled US$ 182 million, growing by 11% the previous year.  But gaining more ground in the international market continues to be a challenge. Our goal is to become part of the billion dollar exporters club within the next two or three years. Premium Beauty News - Apart from the Amazonian biodiversity, what are the main assets of the Brazilian cosmetics industry? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - Creativity is certainly the most important asset. It helps the Brazilian industry to overcome the technical gap with European and Japanese producers.  Brazilian companies have been able to create cosmetic products with an interesting cost-efficiency ratio."
Marketers need to adapt their offer to seniors,"“The ageing of populations globally is an issue that will increasingly shape both society and its consumer markets,” comments Matthew Adams, Consumer Analyst at Datamonitor and co-author of a new series of reports [1]. Europe is a relatively mature region Consumers aged 50 and above accounts for a large proportion of the population in each European country. This is most apparent in Italy and Germany, where seniors account for more than one third of the overall population (38%) in 2007. In the case of Italy, this proportion should continue to grow as young families break from the historical national norm and have fewer children than previous generations. The Netherlands and the UK were the youngest nations, relatively in Europe in 2007, but the senior population still exceeded one third of the overall population. This should make the Senior consumer particularly worth targeting in terms of potential market size alone. In addition to having the ability to spend, consumers must also show a willingness to spend in order to make them profitable targets. Matthew Taylor, Consumer Market Analyst at Datamonitor, the other author of the reports explains: “Seniors have many attributes in common with other age groups of consumers against universal criteria such as seeking good value for money.” “With substantial assets and significant liquid capital, seniors are likely to ‘upgrade’ and choose premium products, particularly those ‘empty nesters’ who have less obligation to support the family and children,” says Taylor. The recent ‘less is more’ philosophy might reinforce the pursuit of high quality products. The ageing of the Baby Boomers is also a factor in turning toward a less materialistic approach to the luxury lifestyle. With increased consumer awareness of ‘sustainability’, many products made with natural ingredients cultivated organically, or sourced from specific origins, are becoming popular among these sophisticated consumers. Taylor adds: “The appeal is not just related to the high quality image of such products; they also carry the signal that they are ‘danger-free’ and benefit from the natural substances they contain.” However, as far as personal care products are concerned, value-for-money is vital for targeting the seniors, who want a transparent price with clear product benefits. The importance of product efficacy is in doubt though, as only 18.6% of all seniors rated this attribute as a main influence upon product choice.  By way of counter-points, almost one half (48.1%) rate ’ease of usage’ highly, with more than 40% saying that ’preferred brand’ or ’habit’ has a high influence on decision to purchase. This attitude implies that few seniors can be easily switched to another brand, other than their preferred one, unless given at least a shot-term price inducement."
Russian market expected to slow down,"The impressive growth of the perfumes and cosmetics market during the previous years (10-15% on average since the mid-1990s, and about 20-25% during the last decade) should slow down to more common rates.  According to Russian market research company Symbol-Marketing Agency, a subsidiary of Symbol Communication Group, the growth of perfumes and cosmetics sales should not overcome 10% in 2009 and 2010. Russian customs have recorded a strong decrease of the country’s imports of cosmetic products. In January 2009, imports have fallen by 30% compared to the same period last year. The Symbol-Marketing Agency also states that Procter & Gamble’s sales in Russia fell by 15%.  The decrease of consumers’ spending mainly affect premium and luxury segments and are major cities such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg, which are the strongest areas for high-end sales. According to the Symbol-Marketing Agency, these shifts in spending patterns may have a positive impact on the development of local manufacturers such as Kalina and Nevskaya Cosmetics, which may gain market shares"
Emerging economies to drive growth of global cosmetic chemicals market,"Emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil are responding differently to the global economic downturn than developed markets such as Western Europe and the US.  Presence of large domestic markets has cushioned these emerging economies from the deepening economic crisis. According to new report by Global Industry Analysts, Inc.: “the cosmetics and toiletries market in emerging economies is still in its nascent stage, and holds promise for dynamic growth in upcoming years,” Males are another driver for growth of the cosmetics market.  “Consumption of cosmetics and toiletries is not restricted to the female population alone. Male grooming products have also emerged as an attractive segment. Skin and hair care products, face cleansers, and premium shaving products are proving attractive offerings for the male grooming products market,” the study reveals. In parallel, cosmetics containing natural and organic ingredients are becoming a rage in European and North American markets. Rising environmental concerns, growing awareness about sustaining resources, carcinogenic nature of synthetic cosmetic ingredients have propelled growth of natural and organic ingredients in cosmetics. According to Global Industry Analysts, the ageing baby boomer population is the dominant consumer group for natural or organic ingredients-based cosmetics. Eventually, the global market for cosmetic chemicals is projected to reach US$19.2 billion by 2015."
The crisis seen from China,"The second edition of Luxe Pack Shanghai (March 17-18, 2009), hosted significantly more visitors than the first one, which is already a success, considering the economic context.  However, while the number of exhibitors was also on the rise, most of the “majors” of the high-end packaging industry that operate in China were not there. Aptar, Rexam, Alcan, SGD, HCP, Segede, Qualipac, etc. chose not to participate. Eventually, Heinz Glas, through its joint-venture in China, was the only leading manufacturer to exhibit. Premium Beauty News talked to certain of these companies to understand their choice. Indeed, these companies said their market in China is limited to “the main international perfumery and cosmetic brands” and there are only few Chinese brands. Eventually, all these customers are met during Cosmoprof Hong Kong or Luxe Pack Monaco. Furthermore, product sourcing companies such as Cosfibel or C. Group, their goal is to address the needs of European and US customers, not Asian ones. So, who was participating in Luxe Pack Shanghai?  A lot of designers, of sourcing companies, of resellers in the paper and cardboard industry, a few manufacturers of injected packaging from China or Korea. However it is clear that Shanghai is really the best place in Asia where developing a tradeshow on high-end packaging.  Indeed, all the most important customers are located in the area.  Luxe Pack will just need more time to grow. After having opened a bureau in China in 2005, Quadpack has signed exclusive partnership agreements with the Jin Sheng company  at the beginning of 2008 and, just a few weeks ago, with the Rui Chang company.  The main reason behind these agreements is the need, to strengthen the relationship and to carry-on developing new ranges through a limited number of suppliers on the base of Quadpak’s quality system. In 2008, Quadack developed more than 70 moulds for its customers and carried on proposing its “standards” (500 approved references) also available on its web site: www.quadpack.net While the company just started operations at its new injection plant in China last October (about USD 45 million invested), Jeff Chen, HCP’s President and CEO, just announced a new investment program featuring USD 15 million for 2009. The plan includes the opening of a second plant in North America, more precisely in Mexico, next October. There are also several projects in the pipe, in particular a brand new mascara, which is announced as a “revolution”. “We became a global company, underlines Jeff Chen. Our  turnover, which is split between the USA (32%), Europe (25%) and China (24%), perfectly illustrates this."" Today, HCP in the world can propose 234 injection machines! Diam, a group specialising in the manufacture of displays and other merchandising products, is already present in China (Diam Display China Co. LTD) and is strengthening its position in Asia through the opening of a sales office in Tokyo, Japan. Within a few years, the Aptar group became the unrivalled leader on its segment (dispensing systems) in China. Even if the contribution of the local subsidiary to the group’s global turnover remains modest, it enjoys an impressive growth. “We grew by 31% in 2008 compared to 2007 and probably 20% ‘only’ in 2009,” says Thierry Rabu its manager. “And we obviously still have a heavy investment schedule for the next years, with the aim to become more than twice bigger during the next ten years!” he adds. Knoll Packaging, a designer and manufacturer of boxes, headquartered in New York (turnover US$ 32 million in 2008) intends to use its new manufacturing facility in China (250 staff), as a springboard to the European market.  Jeremy D. Cohen, President and CEO, considers that its Chinese implantation gives him the right assets to interest European cosmetics and perfumes makers."
The recession in three questions,"With a business that dropped “by 10 to 40 percent, depending on the segments, on the first semester of 2009,” some operators in the industry may be tempted to go it alone. “In the present situation, each of us legitimately wants to protect its own margins and therefore wants to pay less for purchases - as it is no longer possible to increase sale prices - and to leave to others the burden of financing growing stocks of unsold items,” Alain Chevassus explains According to the president of Cosfibel, the current recession raises three important questions. The first question relates to the continuation of business activity. Actually, the adjustment of products’ costs is always longer than the drop of sale prices, as everyone is afraid by the “sales gap”.  In such conditions would below-cost selling be acceptable to help maintaining certain activities? “No,” answers Alain Chevassus. “It does not comply with business ethics and there is hardly any interest to see market prices collapsing. Indeed, in such a case, reflation will be more difficult as investments will not be funded by the companies’ cash-flow but through their debt.” Precisely, the second question relates to the funding system.  “Bad sales of our customers, as well as ours, are generating new stocks, together with the need to fund them and the need to clear them”.  According to Alain Chevassus, “business ethics would imply that each of us be responsible for funding its own part of the business. Attempts to comply a company to fund another one should be banned, as it would prevent the second company to fund its own investments and would therefore hinder the reflation.” Furthermore, Alain Chevassus also points out the banks’ behaviour. While ECB’s rates have never been so low (1.5%), rates proposed to SMEs have never been so high (9%). Last but not least, comes the question of how taking into account middle and long term goals. “The only way to benefit from this crisis is to adapt our behaviour to short term necessities (price adjustments) but also to long term goals: to maintain a mutual trustful relation between customers and suppliers, to carry on investing at the appropriate level, and once again, to stand out from the mass through innovation”. “We keep on ensuring that the options we choose be consistent with long term goals and contribute to a rapid return to serenity,” concludesAlain Chevassus."
Australian beauty industry’s ambitions,"The Australian cosmetics and toiletries industry has domestic sales of approximately A$ 5 billion (EUR 2.5 billion).  Domestic production is estimated to about EUR 400 million for 2008, with a production tool belonging to global cosmetics manufacturers such as  Unilever Procter & Gamble and Colgate, but also to several small and medium enterprises such as Jurlique, Bloom, Napoleon Perdis, Ultraceuticals, Nutrimetics and ModelCo. While the country is 14 times bigger than France, Australia counts 20 million inhabitants only. The small size of the market encourages cosmetics makers to conquer abroad markets. One of the main assets helping Australian products to achieve global success in Europe, the USA and in Asia, is their reputation for being clean and green. In terms of exports, the Australian cosmetics and toiletries industry had exports of around A$400 million (EUR 200 million) in 2008, an increase of over 8% on 2007. While the figure remains modest, it is important to consider that exports have been skyrocketing since 2004 when they were estimated at EUR 145 million and the industries are expected continuing strong export growth. Simultaneously, about EUR 550 millions cosmetics and toiletries industry were imported in 2008, growing by 20% over the last four years, the USA and France being the countries first suppliers. Drugstores are the main distribution channel for cosmetics and toiletries in Australia (14% of sales), followed by department stores (12,5%), beauty salons and speciality stores (5%) and duty-free stores. “High quality French cosmetics brands have an in with the Australian market”, says Sylvie Patinec, from the French trade commission in Sydney.  “From a general point of view, there’s a permanent interest for French products.  The demand is mostly on innovative products with new ingredients, on natural and organic products, being original and with a good price-quality ratio.  Cosmetic products with therapeutic effects, as well as so-called ‘holistic’ products are trendy too.” According to Patrice Curien [1], General director of Intercos Australia and R.D. Prestige Packaging, “Consumers of cosmetics and toiletries in Australia are highly interested in high-end products, but there is also a strong demand in the mass market.  It is also important to note that all these young Australian brands that were created a few years ago feel they have an in with overseas markets, thanks to the originality of their products and Australia’s ‘exotic’ image. For all these reasons, all forecasts say their market share abroad should be strongly growing”. Maxime Elgue, General Director for the Oceania Area at the DFS group, one of the world’s leading travel retailers , is on the same opinion: “It is true that the Australian market changed a lot during the latest years.  Several Australian brands are successful abroad, such as Jurlique, for instance. In parallel, Australian customers travel a lot. For our group, perfumes and cosmetics offer real opportunity for growth”. The impressive raise of Napoleon Perdis, the make-up “phenomenon” of the latest years, is perfect illustration of the strong dynamism of young Australian bands.  Napoleon Perdis is a self-made man who was born in Sydney.  Three years after the opening of its make-up studio in1992, he was launching its own make-up line in its first concept store on Oxford Street.  Today, Napoleon Perdis is heading a real little empire.  Its brand is distributed through 59 stand-alone concept stores and over 800 point-of-sale locations in Australia and New Zealand. Napoleon Perdis is also stocked at over 300 Ulta stores across the USA. Further, its mass-market line, NP Set, is now available at over 1600 Target stores as well as at 300 Target Australia stores. Another perfect example of Australian fastest growing innovative beauty brand ModelCo. Launched in 2003 by Shelley Barrett, ModelCo immediately got resounding worldwide results with its heated eyelash curler and its tan line products in spray. With a turnover of A$ 15 million last year, a talented staff of 30 people, an astonished distribution network in 1000 stores in 27 countries, the «young» brand using pink colour as a reference and focusing on innovative packaging, has known, thanks to its ambitious manager, how to take benefit of a growing interest for Australian « niche » brands from America (40% of the total sales) and Canada, Asia, Middle East, South Africa and Scandinavia as well. Since, ModelCo has enlarged its cutting-edge creativity to a complete range of makeup products, with eyes and lips key products. « The Australian market itself is essential for us, says Shelley Barrett, as far as we are concerned it has increased by more than 20% between 2007 and 2008 ». Actually, one’s just needs to visit a department store in an Australian city there’s no shortage of high quality Australian cosmetic brands.  Jurlique, Aesop and Napoleon Perdis, of course, but there are also: Natio, Bloom, Inessence, Sugar Baby, Mor, Invisible Zinc, Chi Chi…"
"“A product must speak to the consumer”, Napoleon Perdis","Napoleon launched a small makeup studio in the Sydney suburb of Leichhardt in 1992. In 1993, he opened the Napoleon Perdis Makeup Academy, which currently has eight campuses across Australia and New Zealand and one on Hollywood Boulevard in California.  Two years later he debuted his first concept store on Sydney’s Oxford Street, boasting a full cosmetics collection, including foundations, eye shadows, lipsticks and accessories.  Vivid, vivacious colour soon became a Napoleon Perdis trademark.  Innovative designs, amazing products, freshness and energy, as well as staff training and education also contributed to the success of the brand. “A product must speak to the consumer,” he says. “He must be consistent with its claims”. Today Napoleon Perdis has 59 stand-alone concept stores and over 800 point-of-sale locations in Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, the brand has four Napoleon Perdis concept stores, including the vibrant flagship on Hollywood Boulevard, and is stocked at over 300 Ulta stores across the country, as well as at select independent retailers nationwide. When Target’s executives approached Napoleon to launch a second cosmetics line in the mass-market channel, he did not hesitate a while. The resulting collection, NP Set, was launched in 2008 and is now available at over 1600 Target stores in the US as well as at 300 Target Australia stores. The collection is 98% paraben-free and boasts organic benefits. Napoleon is now looking at several foreign markets where to extend its young and successful empire. South America comes first in the list, Brazil in particular, which is “the fourth world’s largest market for cosmetics and toiletries”, then Mexico and South East Asia. “Europe is not a priority so far, it will come next but there’s no hurry”. According to Napoleon, being an Australian brand is neither a strength nor a weakness.  “I was born in Australia from Greek parents. This mix of European classicism and Australian nature is likely to have helped developping my own creativity. But I am not selling Australia, I’m selling Napoleon Perdris”."
"In 2009, Cosmoprof announces its R-Evolution","Premium Beauty News - 2009 is likely to be a difficult year for the industry. What will be the impact of the crisis on the next edition of Cosmoprof in April? Aureliana de Sanctis - Our analysis is that buyers will have to make choices in order to reduce the number of tradeshows they will visit, and they will favour exhibitions where they can see the most important number of new products.  Exhibitors should also make similar choices. Eventually, the situation may be very profitable for a leading trade show such as Cosmoprof. So far, we can observe that both middle size and big companies have asked for larger stands, probably after a new market analysis.  Companies are reducing their budget but focus their resources on tradeshows that provide the best answers to their development strategy.  And the Cosmoprof Worldwide show [1] in Bologna is one of them. Premium Beauty News - Under your supervision, the next Cosmoprof will carry on its evolution. Apparently, you made the choice of a “retail”, rather than industrial, positioning. Aureliana de Sanctis - Cosmoprof is evolving toward the creation of synergies between the production and the distribution.  This year Cosmoprof will propose “focus on”, BtoB meetings and conferences about the affective value of design, the creation of fragrances, the use of paper and the services for spa venues. More than ever, the final consumer has an increased influence on every sector of the beauty industry. Premium Beauty News - There are now two additional exhibition halls.  How did you re-organised the showfloor? Aureliana de Sanctis - One of the main changes at Cosmoprof this year is the reorganisation of the different industry sectors.  We are aware that these choices are not always understood by exhibitors, but they are required by the evolution of the show.  The aim is to bring a better legibility to professional visitors.  A show is like a “big city to live in” during 4-5 days and our philosophy is to make our best to facilitate and simplify the visit of our exhibitors’ potential customers. Premium Beauty News - Regarding the “packaging” and “full s ervice” sections (Cosmopack), how do you intend to highlight it? Aureliana de Sanctis - The packaging and OEM sections will benefit from their opening one-day before the rest of the show, so that professional visitors can focus on this specific segment.  Exhibitors in the packaging have been appreciating this separate opening for several years. On this occasion, Cosmoprof 2009 will offer dedicated events, featuring an internationl conference on the sector and the visit of a “Packaging Buyers Delegation” which will meet exhibitors of Halls 19 and 20. Furthermore, our specific attention to this sector does not end with the show as we are organising “Business or Dinner” events all along the year in Paris or Hong Kong during which leading packaging companies are meeting decision-making staff from luxury and mass-market brands, with the aim to exchange on issues of specific interest. Premium Beauty News - What is the future of tradeshow? Aureliana de Sanctis - Tradeshows can no longer limit themselves to showcasing products. They must transform in forerunning and visionary events, in true laboratories where future trends are highlighted and where groundbreaking success stories are analysed.  Cosmoff Lab, the brand new event of this edition, was precisely conceived with this aim: a real beauty laboratory where people can seize the opportunity to meet and exchange."
"“Colour cosmetics tend to resist economic downturns,” Thomas Weckerle","Premium Beauty News - The development of the slide-up button tubes for lipsticks is often presented as a technical revolution. Could you explain why Thomas Weckerle - On the one hand, this development was a true challenge to Weckerle Machines, whereby we needed to adapt to new trends on the packaging side to create an industrial process related to the new way the packaging was conceived. By adjusting tools and modifying existing equipment, we quickly addressed this challenge. On the other hand, such an innovative process is part of every project we handle. From our point of view, every single project owns its part of innovation and R&D challenges; there is hardly any project without innovation. That’s the reason why we constantly carry on improving our development processes. This project shows how much Weckerle Machines’ equipment is adapted to innovation. New Weckerle machines are always made considering that enough flexibility is needed to make possible the development of innovative products. Premium Beauty News - After the launch of airtight tubes for lipsticks did you continue to develop this technique? What kind of improvements were required? Thomas Weckerle - Airtight components are more and more important due to the fact that we have been moving away from the regular wax and oil formulations. At Weckerle we are constantly improving our processes in all areas particularly packaging, formulations and production process design. This in order to create innovative concepts which don’t look at a single dimension, namely packaging, but also in all the areas involved to make a cosmetics product. Premium Beauty News - What proportion of your investments does the lipsticks sector represent? Thomas Weckerle - It is extremely difficult allocate a figure to the development of lipsticks. As I mentioned before, every project implies an R&D challenge and therefore it is difficult measure investments into a specific sector. We are constantly investing into innovation. Premium Beauty News - So, what about your turnover? Thomas Weckerle - Lipsticks represent around 40% of our turnover. Premium Beauty News - Do you think the sector will suffer from the economic climate? Thomas Weckerle - We doubt about it. Colour cosmetic products tend to be resistant to economic downturns. Just asking a simple question may help to make the demonstration: “will your wife stop buying a lipstick just because of an economic downturn?” Make-up products have turned to be a commodity for consumers and hopefully the impact on an economic slow down is minimum. In addition, we are very active in the mass-market sector and we believe that this particular sector could even benefit from an economic downturn. Premium Beauty News - And the alleged competition between lipsticks and the glosses? Thomas Weckerle - During a couple of years, at the beginning of the decade, there has been a shift in the business from lipsticks to lip glosses but eventually the market realized that both products complement each other and in certain concepts they even work together. Also there have been new developments in formulation on both sides as well as the development of filling techniques such as the centre core for lipstick, which has brought a different dynamic to both concepts. The bottom line here is that what we can achieve with a lip gloss we can’t achieve it with a lipstick and inversely, this is a challenge for us and we liked to be challenged! Premium Beauty News - Concerning the evolutions of European and foreign markets? Thomas Weckerle - Eastern Europe has become a key market for lipsticks and for the cosmetics industry in general. Actually, it is increasingly necessary to a have good knowledge of local markets in order to have a better understanding of their specific needs and to develop concepts that are relevant to today’s global trends while addressing local demands. Particularly in growing markets such as Latin America, Eastern Europe and China."
Lipsticks: a safe bet,"It’s not so easy to make a symbol evolve!  That’s probably the reason why, as far as lipsticks are concerned, brands remain cautious about innovation.  However, their suppliers seem have several original projects “in the pipe”. As far as the lipstick primary packaging (the tube) is concerned, British packaging group Rexam is the uncontested leader. Its strong position was built and consolidated during the 1990s, in particular with the acquisitions of the French company Reboul, and of the giant Chinese packaging maker, Derkwey. “Today, our strength lies in our industrial presence worldwide (Europe, USA, Asia, South America) that we have consolidated through the creation of a global platform for our mechanisms,” explains Pierre Marand, Make Up Business Unit Director at Rexam. However, Rexam’s current strength also lies in the group’s research and development capabilities.  “There are still huge innovation opportunities in this segment, and that’s exactly what we demonstrated with the surface coating we applied on Dior’s High Shine tubes,” says Pierre Marand. Additional steps forward, in particular in the field of finishing, are likely to come soon.  “Packaging innovation on the segment remains challenging since traditional gestures linked to the product use have become almost natural to most women.  But it’s also a real opportunity for us. We have always been working hard on these issues, and this year will bring the opportunity to communicate about that,” Pierre Marand adds. According to Jacques Cohen, president of Axilone USA: “It is clear that state-of-the-art technologies and processes regarding metal and plastic transformation and finishing focus on lipstick tubes. This aim is to produce a beautiful object, which brings women the functionalities they’re expecting, while protecting formulations. Therefore, it is necessary to perfectly handle a variety of manufacturing processes and technologies. As far as finishing is concerned, it is required to be the best in all technical areas.” From this point of view, the latest lipstick Axilone developed for MAC is an epitome of this ability to handle a multiplicity of state-of-the-art technologies. The product required lacquering, hot stamping and many other technologies, in addition to the manufacture and assembly of plastic and metal components. For packaging producers, the capacity to supply global customers is a key factor of success today.  For Alcan Packaging Beauty, it has been one of the main axes of its strategy since 2006, as it has been for Rexam.  “For each geographical area, Europe, Americas, Asia, we’ll be able to supply this kind of service to our major customers,” explains Stéphane Tondenier, Alcan’s Vice-President Sales & Marketing Fragrance & Cosmetics Worldwide. Alcan aims to become one of the three leading companies on this segment in 2009.  “We have multiplied our efforts in order to reach this goal,” Stéphane Tondenier underlines. “All or factories will be able to offer multiple injection and finishing technologies, using our industrial presence worldwide where the know-how accumulated for several years in the perfumery, skincare and cosmetic segments is one of main assets.” Thanks to this strategy, Alcan is currently involved in eight major global launches. “We expect to double our lipsticks sales in 2009 compared to 2008,” says Stéphane Tondenier. “It is clear that the competition is mainly about decoration and finishing,” he comments. Of course, the capacity to produce globally is not the only factor of success. Besides companies such as Rexam, Risdon, Axilone, HCP, Shia Shin and Alcan, there are other operators are playing their cards right. For instance, the German packaging manufacturer Oekametall holds “four main assets” according to its CEO, Gerald Oehlhorn: “a well tested mechanism, with no lubricant of course;  a fully integrated manufacturing process featuring the injection, the finishing and assembling;  being a family owned company with a rapid decision-making process; and being a German company that was able to adapt itself to international constraints and other cultures.” On the other hand, Stéphane Tondenier is much more cautious about “mechanical” innovations and possible evolutions of traditional gestures linked to the use of lipsticks! “Of course, we have several solutions in stock, but lipsticks remain a very traditional object, and major changes are unlikely to happen, even if new attempts were recently launched on the market,” he says. At Texen’s, innovation is centred on the industrial process. “We have developed a patented mechanism, that allows us to remove one piece from the process compared to our competitors,” says Georges Lachas, sales director.  But this does not prevent the company to explore alternative solutions for its products. “Our main evolutions are oriented towards possibilities of double-headed products,” he adds. For Eric Bigotte, Risdon (40% of the turnover made with lipstick tubes): “As far as we are concerned, innovation consisted in the launch of a ‘one handed’ mechanism, illustrated by Avon’s ‘Pro to Go’.  Risdon is the inventor and holds the patent of the slide-up button tube, and we are developing a gloss and a mascara with the same technology”. However, according to Jacques Cohen, Axilone USA, if the one-handed lipstick tube is really an interesting idea, it is unlikely to develop further. “There are obvious marketing arguments, but our customers usually do not mention this characteristic in their specifications for new developments.” Same analysis by Georges Lachas, Texen: “The one-handed model developed for Chanel seems to be a success, but so far, other illustrations are limited to lip protection and lip care, and apart from Chanel it’s hard to find any make-up product using it.” “Lipstick is a different product within the cosmetics and make-up categories,” explains Jacques Cohen, Axilone USA. For many women, it’s an accessible luxury that will last. “In the USA, lipstick retail prices are usually less than 20 dollars, even for prestigious brands, allowing women to use several shades. And the price is not yet expensive enough for preventing women to indulge themselves with these products”. An opinion that is shared by Florence Robilliart, Intercos: “We think that make-up, as a whole, will be less impacted than other beauty segments. Lipstick in particular remains unavoidable within women’s daily make-up routine”. Eric Bigotte, Risdon, is more cautious: “Lipstick will be impacted by the current economic situation because consumers are increasing lost within a huge offer, as they are with fragrances. However, it’s true that lipstick tubes are increasingly assimilated to jewellery, matching with particular social status and with a high sensitivity to fashion. I would not be surprised if celebrity lipstick and make-up lines would appear on the market.” And what about the impact of gloss products?  According to George Lachas, the question does not really need to be debated. “Gloss products have certainly conquered some market shares to the detriment of lipsticks, but global sales volumes clearly exceed the initial volume of lipsticks alone.  Gloss products gained market shares, in particular with women of less than 30 years, but remain complementary to the use of a lipstick. Gloss users did not give up lipstick, its more a matter of diversification than a substitution”."
France: beauty sales slow down in 2008,"Sales of perfumes and cosmetics in specialised retail chains, independent shops, and supermarkets increased by 2.5% to 6.56 billion euros in 2008; a strong slowdown compared to 2007 (+4%) or 2006 (+5%). Actually, French consumers did not really increase their purchases of cosmetic products in 2008 compared to the previous year.  As far as volumes are concerned, sales grew by less than 1%. Indeed, the market growth is mainly due to price increases in this sector in 2008. According to Precepta, the slowdown should continue in 2009.  Growth in value would be less than 1.5%, while the firm considers that the second semester will be more dynamic."
A salutary crisis?,"So… is it the big one crisis or just a severe slowdown?  “There’s no doubt, the market is really bad,” comments the manager of a big brands marketer. But the development manager of one of its competitors suggests a very different outlook. “So far the market remains stable, and at a quite good level,” he says. “Should we compare this crisis to periods of strong slowdown, such as 2001 or 2002, the impact on the economy should not be exaggerated,” states the manager of a European glassmaker. “However, it’s true that our order backlog is at a low level (two months) and that the rhythm of new orders has been particularly low since the beginning of the year”. “As far as I am concerned, the few contacts I had with big customers, such as Britain-based Body Shop, for instance, do not lead me to pessimism, on the very contrary,” explains the sales director of a manufacturer of airless designs.  “We have a significant number of new developments in our pipes, we do not really perceive any slowdown yet,” confirms the boss of a French plastic injection firm. Cardboards: the great purge The cardboard industry is probably one the more rapidly and harshly impacted. However, “the rot had already set in"" explains an industry insider. “Too many factories, too many big machines, excessive production capabilities, and a short-term vision from most of the big paper and cardboard manufacturers,” comments the same expert. Numerous closures of cardboard factories in Northern Europe are leading to an unprecedented drop of production capacities.  Actually, the demand dramatically decreased in some sectors. However, several cardboard and paper producers told Premium Beauty News that the perfumery and cosmetics businesses remain healthy, while the pharmaceuticals market is even more dynamic. Broadly speaking, cardboard producers share the opinion that it was necessary to reduce production capacities. Eventually, this purge appears as much needed but it has painful and largely unpredictable consequences. Should we believe most of the beauty insiders we interviewed: 2009 will be an extremely harsh year and many producers will meet severe difficulties, and several closures are expected. Hopefully, they say, the price of raw materials dramatically decreased! So, how to cope with the crisis?  Some interviewees recommend to “focus on niches” or to “preserve margins”.  Others are on the opinion that “innovation” is the only way out.  A latter strategy that some brands have been implementing for several years: with some success considering their relatively good results on the fourth quarter of 2008.  Apparently, they do not intend to slowdown the path of their new developments. A very good idea, according to their suppliers!"
Cosmetic food: Danone to end Essensis sales in France,"A Danone France spokeswoman confirmed to Agence France Presse the information published on the website of specialised weekly magazine LSA: sales of the whole Essensis range, the first beautifying yoghurt to be marketed in France, will end on March 1, 2009. Launched in February 2007, Essensis did not meet the success the group expected.  Despite strong initial sales, volumes rapidly dropped.  Danone even had to develop new flavours after market feedbacks pointed out excessive sugar sweetness.  However, price appears as the key factor to explain the failure. Marketed as a premium product, Essensis was more expensive than other yoghurts. Furthermore, daily consumption was recommended for visible effects on the skin. The stoppage of Essensis sales would be consistent with Danone’s intention to concentrate on its key brands.  However, the skincare yoghurt should remain available in other countries, such as Spain and Italy."
Purchasing behaviour in prestige chain stores,"The study was conducted during June 2008 into 40 outlets of the main prestige beauty chain stores in Paris: Marionnaud, Sephora and Nocibé.  A total of 1628 persons participated in the survey and answered questions about their purchasing habits, from the outlet’s choice to the main reasons to buy. According to the NPD’s study, prestige beauty chain stores have loyal customers (90% are women): 2/3 of them only buy their scented, skincare and make-up products in prestige outlets.  When questioned, 60% of participants in the study said they were in the outlet they are used to visit and where they have their habits.  Eventually, 80% of them hold to the chain’s fidelity program, and half of them also adhere to another selective beauty chain’s program, including department stores. The study reveals that service is an important reason to opt for the prestige retail channel. 60% said it was one of the reasons to chose the chain. The other main reason for coming in a prestige beauty outlet (50%) is the large product choice brands and products available. 85% of the respondents said their purchased was decided and balanced long before the come.  A large majority of consumers say they  exactly know what they are looking for: 40% say they intend to buy several products, and 66% state they came into the store with a specified brand in mind. The proportion of impulsive purchases therefore remains minor, but depends on market segments (22% of impulsive purchases for make-up, 14% for skincare and 11% for fragrances).  “Eventually, half of consumers leave the outlet with the product(s) they say to be loyal to or that they already bought or used in the past,” the NPD Group explains in a  release. Concerning their budget, consumers say they expect to spend an average 63 euros and 60% of them say the are leaving the outlet with one product only, as per their purchasing intentions."
Crisis-shaped consumer trends,"The fourth quarter of 2008 confirmed that the U.S.A. and several European economies have entered into recession, but Nathalie Dessirier warns: “as far as cosmetics are concerned, one should be careful not to be misled by the wrong crisis”.  For the cosmetics industry, the credit crunch might not be the main danger. Consumers’ declining of confidence towards products loosing their symbolic value may have deeper consequences. “From this point of view, addressing sustainable development issues should remain a priority”, Nathalie Dessirier explains.  Actually, mainstream cosmetic products are really distrusted by many consumers.  Consequences are well known: growth of the natural and organic beauty markets, needs for enhanced information regarding ingredients and their origin. The divergent evolution of world’s markets is the other key factor that helps understanding the shift in consumer needs and trends. On the one hand a new upper class of affluent consumers is growing in emerging countries, and, on the other hand, the working and middle classes are facing increased precarity, including in developed countries. According to Nathalie Dessirier, the main trends to come can already be identified: “Consumers are turning inwards, in need of reassurance, looking to purchase less but better…  They want to make their own and personal choices, and will have to decide what to buy and what budget to spend. However, consumers will still like to indulge themselves (hopefully), when there are opportunities.” Considering this picture, the cosmetics industry’s interest seems to keep consumers in mind: “to get back to marketing basics, to understand consumers’ needs and to assist them during the purchase”. Which in the current context means “to adopt an ethical and sustainable behaviour, and to be transparent regarding products’ features, as today’s consumers are increasingly suspicious,” explains Cap Beauty co-founder. Of course, it remains necessary to make consumers dreaming and to boost retail sales but it becomes important to avoid the vicious circle of launches… Actually, “get back to pragmatic and time-resistant innovations, inspired from other cultures”. Many current advertising campaigns highlighting eco-responsibility, authenticity, transparency and service offers plainly demonstrate that some operators have already switched to this new model. Coty’s launch of a personalised e-coaching programme for Home Skin Lab, and Olay’s offer of a personalised beauty consultations are illustrative of the increased individualisation of services…  As far as eco-responsibility is concerned, Aveda’s “100% wind power” campaign is the epitome of the sort.  Commitments to information, education and transparency are well illustrated by Burt’s Bees’ informative messages regarding cosmetic ingredients, or Yves Rocher’s new Culture Bio organic range. Eventually, the best achievement of real-life marketing is certainly Dove’s campaign for real beauty. “In the meantime, beauty must remain a dreamful industry and must carry on creating emotional relationships with consumers” Nathalie Dessirier insists.  Consumers do love paradoxes! Especially when they simultaneously are affluent Indians eager to enjoy a luxury Western lifestyle and tight-budget European employees. However, dream enhancement initiatives in other industries may be instructive.  Nespresso, for instance, successfully marketed a mass consumption good as a luxury product. There are similar achievements in the beauty industry. Serge Lutens, for instance, who welcome its customer in a private parlour where the brand’s make up line is presented and explained. “A crisis is a breakthrough period from which new opportunities (such as the e-commerce), new markets (such as organic cosmetics) or technical innovations can emerge.  But in order to be audacious and innovative, listening consumers is important, such as developing a better market knowledge and being curious about everything happens, in particular on side markets,” Nathalie Dessirier concludes."
"“Consumer’s power is going to increase,” Joël Palix, Clarins","Premium Beauty News - What have been the innovation landmarks of 2008 regarding the fragrance business within the Clarins group? Joël Palix - The two main events for Clarins Fragrance Group in 2008 were the launch of Parfums Corps, Angel’s new bath line, and the launch of the Porsche Design fragrance. The Parfums Corps line is a true innovation, regarding both the formula and the packaging, it’s a real breakthrough on the fragrance. You know how difficult it is to address such a challenge on that saturated market. We’re making a bold statement. This story started from the very simple idea of creating a new generation of fragrances that would materialize into various textures.  We invented a line of perfumes for the body that we named Les Parfums Corps, it’s a real breakthrough compared to the perfumed bath lines currently available on the market. As per the formula, the molecular system IDS, for Intense Diffusion System ®, is a brand new technology developed in exclusivity with Givaudan’s perfumers, which can inflect the olfactory behavior of Angel to enhance its power. Regarding The Essence by Porsche Design, the main challenge was to comply with the stringent “German-like” specifications stipulated by the brand owner.  On the one hand, we had to place the entire spray cap (a 7 piece mechanism) into a very small space, and, on the other hand, we had to combine metal and glass,  two prestigious materials but with opposite characteristics. Both the technical and the aesthetics challenges were addressed through the active cooperation between our suppliers I’pack, Pochet, Qualipac and the Clarins Fragrance Group’s Development division. Premium Beauty News - Forecasts for the year 2009 are not very optimistic.  Within such a context, what is your message to the supply side? Joël Palix - My message is to remain confident. The crisis is similar to the speculative bubble, it is bound to come to an end, and our job implies to think and act in the long run.  It’s within a storm that good sailors demonstrate their qualities. We must carry on cooperating together and we must prepare the future with the aim to increase consumers’ satisfaction.  The power of consumers is going to increase further. They will separate the wheat from the chaff. For instance, it is therefore useless to deceive them with a lowered quality. Through its brands, Clarins Fragrance Group, has built strong relationships with suppliers, and we’ll take care to preserve these links despite the dull economic context. Premium Beauty News - And what about the Clarins group itself? Joël Palix - Our group left the stock exchange just before the crisis, thus gaining the possibility to enter into the current economic environment with a broader view, if not full serenity.  Clearly, we are now focusing on profitability rather that on an artificial and non-sustainable conquest of market shares. Such circumstances may lead us to delay certain new launches or investments for the benefit of our core brands that have the chance of being well established worldwide, our women’s lines with Thierry Mugler (Angel, Alien) on equal footing with our men’s lines with Azzaro (Azzaro pour homme, Chrome). Premium Beauty News - Does the current volatility of raw material markets affect your business? Joël Palix - Actually, current times are not easy times for forecasts, mainly because of erratic modifications in consumer trends, and storage surplus policies, and because of the way the different market operators, particularly retailers, are managing their cash flows.  The volatility of raw materials is just another difficulty, but as far as the fragrance business is concerned this factor has a mild impact and I do not think it is a major impediment. However, supply shortages of some raw materials and the subsequent speculation, I am thinking about patchouli for instance, have a strong impact because they prevent us to safely organize our production. In partnership with our concerned suppliers, we are testing the development of some raw materials in new areas, such as Rwanda for patchouli.  Results are encouraging and at the same time they allow us to support the development of sustainable local economies, something that perfectly matches the goals of the Clarins group. Premium Beauty News - Owners of luxury brands are apparently modifying their supply policy with regard to “full service”. Is it the case of your company and what kind of products is concerned? Joël Palix - We keep on relying on a classical scheme and do not outsource a too important part of the product’s development. Indeed we consider this job as an assurance for quality and originality. Similarly, we rely on a large choice of perfume creators, as we do not want our brands to be confined in a small olfactory style.  Once again, I’m convinced that Clarins Fragrance Group must carry on with the original and, sometimes against the flow, choices that made our previous successes."
Interbrand launches top list of leading luxury brands,"In The Leading Luxury Brands 2008, its premiere study of the world’s leading luxury brands, Interbrand, a global branding consultancy agency, examines how brands in the complex luxury sector are building brand value. According to the company, the ability of these brands to be resilient to economic crises could not prove true this time. “Until recently it seemed that luxury brands remained stable through economic downturns. However, it is clear today, as we plunge forward into the challenges of global recession that no industry will remain insulated,” said Jez Frampton, Group Chief Executive of Interbrand. “Luxury’s success at expanding its markets during the recent times of prosperity have left the sector more vulnerable today. And yet, there remains a tier of pure luxury brands that minimize risk and generate long-term value,” Frampton added. Interbrand’s study identifies the top 15 global leading luxury brands by financial brand value, and taps into the management trends that define their achievements in standing the tests of time. The study identifies that while leading luxury brands offer important lessons to others and are likely to fare better than most in the uncertain economic times ahead, the markets are proving to be unpredictable. “The social implications of this economic upheaval may forever alter the luxury market’s affluent consumer. The consistency with which leading luxury brands have managed themselves suggests that a ‘business as usual’ attitude in the uncertain times ahead will not be enough. As the excesses of earlier days disappear, constant determination, conviction and creativity will be a must,” said Jean-Baptiste Danet, Interbrand’s European CEO and a recognized leader in luxury branding."
