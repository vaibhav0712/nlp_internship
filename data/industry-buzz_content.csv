"Enjoying nature could lower inflammation levels, scientists say","Numerous studies have highlighted the beneficial effects of contact with nature and green spaces on physical and mental health and even creativity. New research, conducted by scientists at Cornell University in the United States [1], highlights a new advantage. The study reports that frequent positive contact with nature is associated with lower levels of systemic inflammation. To reach this conclusion, Prof. Anthony D. Ong’s team analyzed data from 1,244 participants. They were asked not only about the frequency of their exposure to nature, but also about the quality of their contact with these green spaces. ""It’s not just about how often people spend time outdoors, but also the quality of their experiences,"" said Professor Ong, quoted in a news release. The results showed that people who reported more frequent pleasant encounters with nature had lower levels of inflammation. Specifically, participants were tested on three biomarkers, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen. Elevated levels of these proteins indicate the presence of systemic inflammation. ""By focusing on these inflammation markers, the study provides a biological explanation for why nature might improve health,"" Ong said, ""particularly showing how it might prevent or manage diseases linked to chronic inflammation, like heart disease and diabetes."" ""Even when controlling for other variables such as demographics, health behaviors, medication and general well-being, Ong said his team found that reduced levels of inflammation were consistently associated with more frequent positive contact with nature,"" the study news release reports. ""And it’s this sort of nexus of exposure and experience: It’s only when you have both, when you are engaging and taking the enjoyment out of it, that you see these benefits,"" adds Professor Ong. ""These findings lay the groundwork for future investigations exploring the complex interplay between emotions, health, and the natural environment. Integrating regular contact with nature into daily experience may provide a potent means of promoting public health and fostering resilience amid the myriad challenges of modern life,"" the scientists conclude in their paper."
PGP Glass reportedly in the running to acquire French glassmaker Verescence,"Apparently, Verescence is highly coveted! Stirling Square Capital, the British private equity fund who has owned the French luxury glassmaker since 2019, has entrusted Rothschild & Co with a sales mandate, as revealed by the Reorg website at the end of 2023, and the investment bank would have received at least four acquisition offers. According to L’Informé, the New York-based private equity fund One Rock Capital Partners, as well as two family offices, Teak Capital and the Safra family investment structure, would also be working on the project. But it was the identity of the fourth protagonist disclosed by the online media which caught all the attention! Inded, L’Informé unveiled that the Indian glassmaker PGP Glass, previously known as Piramal Glass, has also made an offer. Piramal Glass, which was renamed PGP Glass in the wake of its acquisition by Blackstone in late 2020, for a valuation of USD 1 billion, owns two glass making sites in India, and one in Sri Lanka, with an overall capacity of 1,600 tonnes per day. Initially specializing in the manufacture of nail polish bottles, the Indian glassmaker gradually moved upmarket and has never hidden its interest in luxury, the core business of Verescence.

Demand for luxury goods drives perfume sales in Saudi Arabia,"Saudi Arabia’s perfume market is expected to reach USD 3,374.72 million by 2032 (from USD 2,005.99 million in 2023) with a CAGR of 5.95% from 2024 to 2032, according to a recent report by ResearchAndMarkets.com [1]. International visitors and a growing local luxury market are forecast to drive increased sales in the country’s perfume industry. The thriving tourism sector largely contributes to the market’s dynamism. Saudi Arabia hosted over 100 million tourists in 2023. This included 27 million from overseas and over 79 million domestic travelers, as reported by the World Tourism Organization. International tourists are drawn to traditional Arabian fragrances, with their rich scents coming from a deep-rooted historical past. Now celebrated as a critical part of the luxury fragrance, they blend traditional elements like oud, musk, and rose. The global market is increasingly interested in their luxury distinctiveness and social media, high-profile collaborations and endorsements have expanded their appeal. On the other hand, locals embrace global brands. The growing population of Saudi Arabia (37.3 million inhabitants as of March 2024) continually increases the patron base for perfumes. The perfume market experiences persistent growth driven by diverse choices and a growing emphasis on self-care and indulgence. Many individuals are searching for luxury merchandise, and the high disposable earnings of many of them represent one of the essential factors catalyzing the demand for luxurious commodities in Saudi Arabia, including top-rate perfumes. Substantial internet usage has heightened client knowledge of perfumes in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom boasts the highest proportion of active social media users across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. DataReportal states that during January 2023, 29.10 million social media customers were active, representing 79.3% of the population. As of early 2023, there were 42.5 million active mobile cellular connections, 115.9% of the population. Arabian beauty influencers are emerging as modern marketers in the Saudi Arabia perfume market by leveraging their social media presence. Saudi Arabian media figure Sara Murad entered the fray in 2023 by launching her perfume brand, By Sara Murad. As a self-proclaimed perfume enthusiast and MBC1 presenter, her debut fragrance, Black Oud, is a gender-neutral blend she describes as ’bold and intense.’"
Avery Dennison adds repositioning feature to its CleanFlake adhesive technology,"Avery Dennison Corporation has achieved a new milestone with their CleanFlake adhesive technology that has improved PET recycling by allowing labels to be cleanly removed during the process. CleanFlake has gained acknowledgement from the Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR).

Luxury industry: Chanel nears USD 20 billion in sales in 2023,"French luxury brand Chanel said Tuesday that its sales jumped last year to a record just shy of $20 billion, although profits only edged higher. Half of the group’s turnover was achieved in the Asia-Pacific region, which has nevertheless posed many challenges for luxury brands in recent years. Sales climbed by 14.6 percent to $19.7 billion last year, with double-digit growth across its fashion, fragrance and jewellery products. Meanwhile, net profits rose by three percent to $4.7 billion, a slowdown from the 14.3 percent profit growth registered in 2022. Global Chief Executive Officer Leena Nair said Chanel had made significant investments in research and development, expanded its retail distribution network and added staff to enable further growth. The 2023 financial results ""underline sustained investment in building the desirability of our brand, creating the ultimate luxury experience for our clients and supporting our people to grow and develop,"" she said. Since the third quarter of last year the luxury sector has seen growth slow in the key European and US markets, while China has disappointed. Privately-held Chanel doesn’t provide a quarterly breakdown of its results, but chief financial officer Philippe Blondiaux said ""sales increased in each of our markets as retail teams continued to nourish relationships with our local clients, while also embracing the continued return of tourist travel around the world."" Chanel saw its sales in the Asia-Pacific region climb by 17.7 percent to more than $10 billion. The rise was even higher in Europe, at 18.8 percent, to $5.6 billion. But the growth was a slower 2.6 percent to $3.9 billion in Americas. Sales of the perfumes and beauty division were mainly driven by the makeup sector and sales at airports."
TNT Group appoints Patrick Ng to head its expansion in China,"TNT Group, with its historical and structural origins in Europe and Asia, is led by co-founders Thomas Diezinger and Toby Cattermole, overseeing the Paris and Hong Kong offices respectively. In 2017 the company expanded its global presence by establishing an office in the US, headed by Boris Schaefer. Recognizing the incredible potential of the Chinese market and its unique business landscape, the TNT Group took a significant step in 2023 by opening an office in Shanghai, headed by Patrick Ng (吴盛铨). Under his leadership, the group successfully exhibited for the first time at Luxe Pack Shanghai last April, marking a significant milestone for the TNT Group.

Pure Kiss supports different types of formula while offering cosmetics brands a customizable solution that helps them to achieve their sustainability goals."
Young workers make no compromise about environmental responsibility,"Particularly conscious of environmental issue, young workers are far more attentive than their elders to their employer’s environmental impact. This is reflected in the criteria they prioritize when looking for a job. A quarter of the Generation Z and Millennials polled in the latest edition of Deloitte’s ""Gen Z and Millennial Survey"" said they had already researched a company’s environmental impact and policies before applying for a job. More generally, some 70% of young working people say they place importance on environmental credentials and policies when looking for an employer [1]. Furthermore, young workers have a strong desire to be useful to society. For young people, working in a profession that goes against their value system is out of the question. That’s why 20% of Generation Z and 19% of Millennials have already decided to change their job or sector of activity because of environmental concerns. Others plan to do so in the future to avoid a potential conflict of environmental ethics at work. Others prefer to act from within. Nearly half of Generation Z (54%) and Millennials (48%) say that they and their colleagues are pressuring their employer to take action on climate change and its impacts. This trend has been growing steadily since 2022: at the time, 48% of Gen Z and 43% of Millennials said they were doing so. The young professionals surveyed by Deloitte are not short of ideas on how their employers could take concrete action to help fight climate change. They would, for example, like employers to offer workers training to help them adopt more ecological behaviours in their daily lives, or to rethink their offices in line with climate issues. However, the young working people surveyed have the overall impression that their employers are taking the seriousness of the situation into account. In fact, 59% of Generation Z and 58% of Millennials feel that their employers are taking steps to address climate change."

"Slightly in the red in Q1, Shiseido keeps growth targets unchanged","Japanese high-end cosmetics giant Shiseido posted a small loss in the first quarter due to restructuring costs, but maintained its growth forecasts for 2024. The group’s net loss for the January-March period was 3.3 billion yen (-19.6 million euros at the current exchange rate), compared with a profit of 8.7 billion yen a year earlier, according to a press release published on Friday. Shiseido also recorded a small quarterly operating loss of 8.7 billion yen, due to exceptional charges linked to its plan to transform its Japanese operations. The plan, which was announced at the end of February, includes about 1,500 voluntary redundancies, or nearly 4%. of its global workforce. However, the group’s sales increased by 3.9% over the period to 249.5 billion yen (nearly 1.5 billion euros). On a like-for-like basis, quarterly sales rose by almost 20% in Japan, by almost 17% in the EMEA (Europe, Africa and Middle East) zone and by more than 9% in the Americas. However, sales fell again slightly in China (-2.6%), the third consecutive quarter of decline in this key market for the group. Shiseido and other Japanese brands have been targeted by a boycott from Chinese consumers since last summer, following the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power station in north-east Japan into the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese government has been highly critical of the start of this process, even though Tokyo and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) claim that it is harmless to the environment and human health. Beijing has suspended all Chinese imports of Japanese seafood since last August. Despite the context, Shiseido continues to expect a rebound in sales in China this year. ""The consumer pullback on Japanese products is now coming to an end, and the Business is on a steady path towards recovery,"" the group stated. For its part, the travel retail business (sales in airports and other duty-free outlets) remained sluggish in the first quarter. The sector continues to suffer the consequences of tighter regulations in China and South Korea. For 2024, Shiseido is still forecasting a net profit of 22 billion yen (+1.1% year-on-year) and sales of 1,000 billion yen (+2.8%). ""With respect to the outlook for our business environment, we expect positive impacts from several factors in the coming quarters, including a further acceleration of growth in the Japan, Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific Businesses and favorable foreign exchange translation due to the weaker yen. On the contrary, however, there are still uncertainties surrounding the business such as the delayed recovery in demand from and changing purchase behavior of Chinese consumers,"" the group explained. In a separate statement, Shiseido also said its former consumer cosmetics business, which is now called FineToday, plans to list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Japanese group had sold this business in 2021 to the investment fund CVC for the equivalent of around 1.3 billion euros, while retaining a 20% minority stake in the new entity. According to sources close to the matter quoted by Bloomberg, CVC is targeting a market value of between 2 and 3 billion dollars for FineToday. A sale of the business to another investment fund or another cosmetics group is not ruled out either, according to the same sources."
Avon continues to negatively impact Natura &Co’s profitability,"Avon’s poor results continue to drag down the profitability of the Brazilian cosmetics giant. Indeed, the group’s Q1-2024 losses widened due to falling sales at the Avon business. Natura &Co’s consolidated net revenue reached BRL 6.1 billion in Q1-24, up 1.1% vs Q1-23 in constant currency (CC) and down 5.7% year-on-year (YoY) in Brazilian Reais (BRL). Q1-24 reported net loss widened to BRL 935 million, compared to a net loss of BRL 652 million in Q1-23. Strong results in Natura Brazil were offset by Avon Latam, which is still delivering soft top-line, with revenues down 11.3% in Brazil and 11.8% in Hispanic Latam. Furthermore, Avon International had a slow start in Q1 in terms of revenue, down by 4.7% YoY in CC. ""In Brazil, Avon still experienced headwinds impacting the top-line, but with an improving trend month over month, and we expect Avon’s top-line to stabilize in the second half of the year. We also saw significant margin expansion in Peru and Colombia,"" said Fabio Barbosa, Group CEO of Natura &Co. “Avon International had a slow start of the year, following a solid Q4 2023 profitability performance. The new management team took office in January and is working on simplifying the market, focusing on key countries, and enhancing our portfolio with superior promotional execution. We believe these steps are crucial to stabilize revenues and keep us on track to improve profitability,” he added."

Stoelzle creates and decorates Charlotte Tilbury’s perfume bottles (Puig),"Inspired by the six senses, Charlotte Tilbury’s new fragrance collection is infused with emotion-boosting molecules. The line includes six scents – Love Frequency, Magic Energy, Calm Bliss, More Sex, Cosmic Power, and Joyphoria – created with IFF perfumers Anne Flipo, Juliette Karagueuzoglou, and Dominique Ropion. Barcelona’s headquartered Puig Group entrusted Stoelzle for the production and decoration of the 100 ml glass bottles. The design of the bottles was inspired from 18th-century potions. The diamond-shaped cuts on each bottle echo the brand logo, creating a cohesive aesthetic. Each bottle mirrors the hues of gems such as morganite, ruby or aquamarine. The colours were meticulously crafted to evoke specific moods, with Joyphoria standing out in Charlotte Tilbury’s signature rose gold with its metallic finish, managed by Stoelzle’s UV decoration process. Stoelzle achieved the decoration of this unique set of bottles with a double UV hot stamping technique, showcasing the brand and fragrance names in rose gold. Holographic hot stamping added intricate details, with only the metallic version featuring hot stamping for decoration and screen-printing for names. “Stoelzle’s double hot stamping technique overcame the challenge of precise decoration alignment. To meet exacting standards, spray and hot stamping decorations were sealed with a hydro-based transparent spray,” details the glassmaker in a statement. Adding the finishing touch, a medallion placed below the neck collar enhances the bottle design. Collaboration with suppliers led to innovative solutions ensuring precise placement, with specialized tooling developed for the Stoelzle team to install the medallion correctly. Meticulous attention during the initial hot stamping ensured perfect placement, aligning with the crimp for a flawless finish."
"Since Brexit, London has lost some of its shine as a shopping destination","Buoyed by big names in fashion such as Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney, London has nevertheless fallen out of favour with overseas visitors looking to combine a getaway with shopping. The removal of tax-free shopping after Brexit would be responsible. Whether it’s a stroll through the designer boutiques of Regent Street, a trip to Harrods for an iconic shopping experience, or browsing in Covent Garden or Camden Market, London has long been known as a shopping hotspot. But since the Brexit agreement signed with the European Union on December 30, 2020, the British capital appears to be less of a destination for shoppers, at least for those from countries outside the European Union. Indeed, overseas shoppers have become accustomed to getting their designer handbags and garments tax-free. The disappearance of this tax refund possibility since Brexit, except in Northern Ireland, was already denounced last year by many major British luxury brands, who are seeing their foreign customers choosing other countries for their lavish shopping sprees. France, Italy and Spain are three countries that are increasingly being chosen by foreign travellers for their shopping trips. France and Italy are particularly desirable, with Paris and Milan the EU’s undisputed shopping capitals. According to a report by Global Blue, a Swiss company offering tax-free services to international travellers, quoted by the Schengen Visa News website, some 162,000 tourists required compensation for VAT sales tax in the UK in 2019. Now, one-fifth of those tourists are taking advantage of rebates in the EU, where the tax break is still effective. An even greater shortfall for the UK since spending in the EU among the 34,000 visitors who have shifted their duty-free purchases outside the country averaged EUR 3,800 in 2023, a 31% increase compared to EUR 2,900 in 2019. The purchases were primarily made in France and Italy. In 33% of cases, they were made by travelers from the Middle East. Visitors from the US represent the second-largest group of visitors who combine travel with shopping (19%). The cliché of the Chinese traveller raiding French department stores is a thing of the past. Since the pandemic, far fewer Chinese tourists have been coming to Europe."

"The Estée Lauder Companies expects annual sales drop, despite Asia recovery","The US-based beauty giant has published results exceeding analysts’ expectations in the third quarter of its 2024 fiscal year. However, the group maintained annual sales drop expectations despite return to growth in Asia. The Estée Lauder Companies reported net sales of USD 3.94 billion for its third quarter ended March 31, 2024, an increase of 5% from USD 3.75 billion in the prior-year period. On a comparable basis, net earnings per common share increased to USD .97, compared to USD .47 last year. Analysts had anticipated USD .50. “For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered our organic sales outlook, exceeded expectations for profitability and continued to improve working capital. La Mer, Estée Lauder, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, and The Ordinary led organic sales growth, driven by beloved hero products and highly sought innovation,” said Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer in a statement. Organic net sales increased 6% primarily due to double-digit growth (+12%) in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and “stronger sales” in Asia travel retail. In the previous quarter, the group recorded a 10% decline in its turnover, due to a slower than expected recovery in Asia, and especially in China. The fiscal 2024 third quarter impact of business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $.01 dilutive to reported and adjusted net earnings per common share. Despite these better results, the group nevertheless reports “ongoing macroeconomic headwinds”, including “continued softness” in overall prestige beauty in mainland China, and geopolitical volatility in some areas around the world. The group therefore forecasts annual organic sales would fall 1% to 2%, compared with its previous estimate of a 1% decrease to a 1% increase."
Lessonia: A plant-based emulsi-gelling agent for silicone-like feeling,"At in-cosmetics Global 2024, in Paris, the French manufacturer launched a new plant-based natural emulsi-gelling agent that is claimed ideal to formulate gel cream with silicone-like feeling. It offers a natural alternative to acrylate-based emulsifiers. This fully natural plant extract named Alter-Emulgel is ideal to formulate emulsion (oil / water) with the texture and feeling of a gel cream. When used at 1.3%, no co-emulsifier is needed. Depending on the oil percentage used, the emulsion’s texture can be fluid (between 5% and 10%), light (between 10% and 20%) or rich (between 20% and 25%). Alter-Emulgel is therefore a perfect fit in emulsions targeting young demographics, and combination or oily skins. According to Lessonia, the bright white gel cream obtained with Alter-Emulgel offers a typical silicone-like feeling during application. “In a sensorial study on a panel of experts, Alter-Emulgel showed a sensorial feeling similar and even better on certain parameters than emulsi-gelling agent based on acrylates,” said Lessonia in a statement. Its sensory profile offers a very nice glide comfort with a quick penetration into the skin. After application, the study revealed an extreme softness with less sticky and oily effect. Alter-Emulgel also shows strong stability in the 3 to 6 pH variation range. According to Lessonia, it is compatible with the use of electrolytes, preservatives, ethanol. It is easy to use in formulation, solubilizing very easily in aqueous phases without the need for pre-dispersing. Unlike emulsifier-gelling agents on the market, it does not need to be combined with a co-emulsifier.

Eurofragance’s sales increased by more than 20% in 2023,"The Barcelona-headquartered fragrance maker closed 2023 with sales of EUR 146 million, up more than 20% over 2022 on a like-for-like basis. All categories — fine fragrance, personal care, air care and home care — and all regions where the company operates experienced healthy growth. Strong growth was achieved in top countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Europe, which helped Eurofragance successfully reach its 2023 targets.  India and Indonesia also contributed to these positive results. “Each of our four main regions, IMEA, Asia Pacific, Europe and Turkey, along with Latam, played a significant role in attaining exceptional results by the end of 2023.  Notably, increased sales in the strategically crucial Gulf region area had a substantial impact on our results,” said Juan Ramón López Gil, CFO of Eurofragance. At the end of 2022, the fragrance house had announced the acquisition of PT Euronindo Fragrance in Indonesia. After having reassessed its operational presence in key strategic markets, Eurofragance said they aimed to reinforce their presence in the APAC region. In parallel, the company had divested itself from the U.S. market. “The good results of 2023 come from a strategy carried through over several years, which has allowed us to focus both regionally and locally to determine where to bet and compete in new product categories, which represent new opportunities for us.  And today, as we embark on a new strategic plan, we are emboldened to make organizational adjustments and reinvest some of our gains in strategic projects that will ensure the company’s continued growth,” adds Eurofragance’s CEO Laurent Mercier. Eurofragance thus intends to continue its commitment to innovation and to keep on strengthening alliances with strategic AI partners to support processes, systems, fragrance-related technologies and new ways of working. Today, the company has two major initiatives in Artificial Intelligence to innovate in fragrance development, both of which require a significant level of resources. The first one, announced last year, is the collaboration with the French green-bio-deep-tech company Alphanosos with the aim to uncover new exclusive technologies to address unpleasant odors.  And the second major project is to be revealed later in 2024. In addition, the fragrance house has strengthened its organization in terms of cybersecurity to mitigate risks and has developed a cybersecurity culture plan to raise employee awareness on this matter. Eventually, Eurofragance has just been recognized with EcoVadis’ Platinum medal, the highest possible recognition from the provider of business sustainability ratings.  “This recent accomplishment encourages the company to push forwards with its sustainability agenda,” concluded Eurofragance in a statement."
L’Oréal’s David Greenberg elected as new board chair of PCPC,"The Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) has elected David Greenberg, CEO of L’Oréal USA and President of the North America Zone, as its new board chair, effective May 1, 2024. “David is a visionary industry leader whose profound understanding of the beauty landscape and his commitment to innovation has driven substantial growth in every role he has held,” said PCPC President and CEO Tom Myers. “His transformative strategies, coupled with a strong focus on consumer-centricity and people development, have been instrumental in his leadership at L’Oréal USA. We are thrilled that in his new Board role he will help us continue to navigate the evolving market dynamics and advocate for the beauty and personal care sector.” Greenberg has spent more than 30 years at L’Oréal in leadership roles across markets, divisions, brands and functions, including leading the L’Oréal Mexico Consumer Products Division, driving internal transformation as the Senior Vice President for Human Resources for L’Oréal USA, and, prior to becoming CEO of the largest subsidiary of the L’Oréal Groupe, leading and driving a major acceleration and business model transformation of the Professional Products Division in US and Canada. “I am honored to serve as the board chair for the Personal Care Products Council, an organization that plays a vital role in the advocacy and progression of the beauty and personal care industry,” said Greenberg. “I look forward to working alongside other industry leaders to further foster a landscape of innovation, safety and trust that meets the diverse needs of our consumers worldwide.” Greenberg’s appointment marks a significant milestone in PCPC’s history, following his long time Vice Chairmanship role on the Board of Directors that championed the historical passage of the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulatory Act (MoCRA) of 2022, and will now shift to promoting the essential role beauty plays in society as a whole. “Under his leadership, PCPC will increase its advocacy efforts to promote science-based public policies and promote the industry’s commitment to innovative and sustainable cosmetics and personal care products, further enhancing consumer trust in the safety and quality of the products they use and rely on every day,” the trade association stated."
US consumer confidence at lowest level since 2022: survey,"US consumers appear less optimistic about the jobs market and more worried about future financial conditions, bringing a closely watched confidence metric to its lowest level since July 2022, a survey showed Tuesday. The consumer confidence index fell to 97.0 in April, said The Conference Board, significantly below the 104.0 reading that analysts anticipated. This marks the third straight month consumer confidence has worsened, the report said, and comes as President Joe Biden struggles to boost perceptions about the economy as his reelection campaign ramps up. ""Consumers became less positive about the current labor market situation, and more concerned about future business conditions, job availability, and income,"" said Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board. But she added that despite the slip, ""optimism about the present situation continues to more than offset concerns about the future."" The biggest worries surrounded ""elevated price levels, especially for food and gas,"" said Peterson. Meanwhile, politics and global conflicts were ""distant runners-up,"" she added. While consumers rated current business conditions ""positively,"" their views of the labor market weakened with more reporting that jobs are hard to get, said The Conference Board. Consumers also became less upbeat about their families’ financial situations, both currently and in the future. When asked what spending they would cut back on to save money, consumers place discretionary purchases to the top—including food away from home, clothing/fashion items, entertainment away from home, and vacations. Meanwhile, fewer consumers plan to reduce spending on non-discretionary purchases like childcare, education, and health care. ""Perceptions about the labor market deteriorated even as job growth remains robust, and the unemployment rate is historically low,"" noted Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. ""A deteriorating trend in sentiment could persist,"" she cautioned. This risks bogging down spending and growth, given that inflation remains persistent and interest rate cuts are ""not imminent,"" she said."
L’Occitane stocks surge in Hong Kong after privatisation offer,"Shares in French skincare giant L’Occitane jumped almost 13 percent in Hong Kong on Tuesday as they resumed trading after its owner offered to take it private. Austrian billionnaire Reinold Geiger said he would buy back all the shares he does not own for nearly US$1.78 billion, the company said in a statement to the city’s stock exchange on Monday night. The offer, submitted with the support of US private equity giant Blackstone, concerns nearly 28 percent of the shares. It values the company at around more than USD 6 billion. The firm soared as much as 12.9 percent to HK$33.30 in the morning before paring the gains. The offer price of HK$34 per share was a 15.25 percent premium to its closing price of HK$29.50 when the company halted trading three weeks ago ahead of the offer. Privatisation would free the company ""from the pressures of the capital markets’ expectations, regulatory costs and disclosure obligations, share price fluctuations, and sensitivity to short-term market and investor sentiment,"" the company said in the announcement. Geiger believed significant further investment in marketing would be necessary to invigorate the brand’s shares in increasingly competitive markets, citing pressure from weakening consumer sentiment and rising rivalry from local brands in China, the company’s second-largest market. L’Occitane International in September rejected an offer from Geiger’s investment holding company, L’Occitane Group, which at the time owned more than 72 percent of the firm. Founded in France’s southern region of Provence in 1976, the luxury cosmetics retailer listed in Hong Kong in 2010. The group’s portfolio includes the brands L’Occitane en Provence, L’Occitane au Brasil, Melvita, Erborian, Sol de Janeiro, Dr. Vranjes Firenze and Elemis. Its share price peaked in 2022 at HK$32.45 ($4.14), more than double its IPO price."

TNT Group creates an astonishing collection of four caps for Binaurale,"The French supplier of high end packaging components, and leader in zamak transformation for perfumery, has worked closely with Binaurale’s ownership to create the imaginative globe caps of this fresh, new brand. Binaurale was conceptualized in Miami by husband and wife, Arielle and Jack, a duo with backgrounds in fragrance and design. The collection includes four different scents brought to life in collaboration with Jérôme Epinette and Clément Marx, perfumers at Robertet. Each fragrance has a unique cap that tells a story. The two founders provided TNT Group with 3D files detailing the desired characteristics of the cap such as the areas of the continents in relief and the curves of the coastlines. TNT GROUP engineers were then able to convert the 3D designs into technical files for industrialization, including tooling and production. For TNT Group, the three challenges were finding a way to unmold the caps, minimizing the mold seams, and achieving the 3 color decor on an industrial scale. Engineering and innovation contributed to this amazing project."
Carbios celebrates the groundbreaking of its PET biorecycling plant,"The French biotechnology company has officially launched the construction of its PET biorecycling plant. Located in Longlaville, in the East of France, the new plant will offer an industrial-scale solution for the enzymatic depolymerization of PET waste, a world-first. With a processing capacity of 50,000 tonnes of waste per year when operating at full capacity, the plant will play a key role in the fight against plastic pollution. Close to the borders with Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg, the plant’s location is strategic for access to nearby waste supplies. “PET, the second most widely used plastic in the world, is mainly manufactured from oil. Thanks to Carbios’ enzymatic biorecycling technology, PET will no longer be made from oil, but from its own waste,” said Carbios in a statement. The first significant quantities of bio-recycled PET are expected to be delivered to customers in 2026. The official launch of the work was welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron, in a LinkedIn post published on 24 April 2024: “A technological revolution is taking shape tomorrow with the groundbreaking ceremony of Carbios’ plant in Longlaville: the world’s first biorecycling plant.” Founded in 2011, Carbios has developed enzyme-based processes to break down plastics. Its biorecycling demonstration plant has been operational since 2021 and the construction of the first industrial-scale biorecycling plant marks the first step in the rise of the PET biorecycling technology to commercial scale. “We are delighted to be a long-standing partner of Carbios: an adventure that began nearly seven years ago with the co-founding of a consortium to industrialize the biorecycling of plastic, then in 2019 with our participation in the capital increase carried out by Carbios through our private equity fund BOLD, Business Opportunities for L’Oréal Development. The groundbreaking ceremony for Carbios’ PET biorecycling plant is another key milestone. It confirms the scaling up of this pioneering technology, which contributes to the sustainable management of the plastic life cycle. We believe in the power of collaboration to build solutions for the future with our partners and get closer every day to reaching our sustainable development objectives. The partnership between L’Oréal Groupe and Carbios is testament to this,” commented Antoine Vanlaeys, Chief Operating Officer, L’Oréal Groupe. The plant will create 150 direct and indirect jobs in the region. Carbios will receive grants totaling EUR 54 million from French State and Grand-Est Region. Several feedstock supply agreements, notably with CITEO and Landbell Group, will secure the vast majority of the raw materials required."

Dao Ethical Gifts creates promotional items that support women,"Bamboo and Thai paper boxes, candles, Key-rings, pouches, laptop/tablet cases, sport, shopping, shoe, and tote bags, notebooks covers, conference folders and lanyards: Dao Ethical Gifts designs and produces personalized ethical gifts and branding solutions, as part of a social approach for the benefit of women living in marginalized communities. Indeed, since its foundation in 2020, Thailand-based Dao Ethical Gifts entrusts production to women of 40 to 50 years of age, providing them with vocational training and preparing them for the world of work: the aim is to combat systemic poverty and gender norms by building lasting self-confidence and dignity. ""Dao Ethical Gifts is aimed at like-minded brands, indie brands, businesses and organizations that need a meaningful gift or branding solutions, from 50 to 2,000 pieces, to support the promotion of their product or a special occasion. Ideally close to production for sustainable reasons. We are already supported by fantastic partners, including those of cosmetics groups, and would be delighted to serve other cosmetics brands, locally,"" explains Magali du Parc, founder. ""That’s why, even though we’re located in Thailand, we call on companies from all over the world who have subsidiaries in Asia."" The social enterprise is powered by the Baan Dek Foundation. It works closely with social workers to empower the most disadvantaged women and carefully tailor the ethical gift order to their sewing and handicraft skills, as well as their priority income needs. The Dao Ethical Gifts production team in Chiang Mai will support them step by step, guiding them through the ""production"" process (product training, quality control, delivery times, contractual procedures). As a non-profit social enterprise, Dao Ethical Gifts reinvests 100% of its profits in supporting vulnerable children through the Baan Dek Foundation’s programs. ""We are agents of social change, implementing ethical production processes without compromising on product quality, safety, compliance and social impact.

Therefore, we ensure the traceability of our raw materials, which come from ethical sources (Oeko-Tex standards, Gots label), upcycled fabrics (Moreloop) and local communities (handmade indigo),"" adds Magali du Parc."
P&G profits rise despite hit from Middle East tensions and slowdown in China,"Procter & Gamble reported higher profits Friday, citing strong demand in the United States and many European markets that offset weakness elsewhere due to Middle East tensions and a lackluster performance in China. P&G — the consumer products giant that makes Tide detergent, Bounty paper towel and Gillette razors, among many others — had flat volume in the just-completed quarter but a three percent rise in price that helped produce a slight increase in overall sales. “We delivered solid sales and strong earnings growth in the third quarter despite multiple headwinds, enabling us to raise our EPS growth guidance and maintain our top-line outlook for the fiscal year,” said Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. In the beauty segment, organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and personal care organic sales declined low single digits due to lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand, partially offset by volume growth from innovation in personal care. Hair care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing in Latin America, Europe and North America. Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten described consumption as ""very strong"" in the United States and in leading European markets. But he said sales in the Middle East were pressured by conflict in the region, while China sales were down 10 percent, excluding the effect of currency changes and acquisition. Profits in the quarter rose 11 percent to $3.8 billion, while revenues increased one percent to $20.2 billion. The rise is entirely due to price increases, while sales volumes remained stable. Prices were up 3% on average across all divisions, and even increased by 10% in the personal care division. Despite price hikes over the last few years, ""consumers are not trading down within the US,"" he said, arguing that shoppers stick with known products because of reliability. In China, Schulten noted ""weak underlying market conditions"" as well as lagging sales of SK-II premium skin care, which has been affected by anti-Japan sentiment. Schulten said the company has nevertheless seen some improvement in the world’s second biggest economy, but that it will take another quarter or two for sales to return to growth. Volume trends in several markets including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey ""have remained soft since the start of the heightened tensions in the Middle East,"" Schulten said."

How and when to back a viral trend: WGSN launches TikTok Analytics,"Genuine trend or just trending this week? A fad to test or a product to invest in? Navigating all the trends on TikTok can be overwhelming. In order to help brands find their way in today’s fast-paced digital world, where there is an endless stream of aesthetics going viral on the platform, trend forecaster WGSN launches a new trends forecasting service dubbed TikTok Analytics. The new service is based on a new methodology that combines data analytics, expert insight and WGSN’s signature STEPIC model to ensure brands cut out “the noise” and identify the trends that matter. According to WGSN, it allows to go beyond views and virality. The trend forecaster’s approach identifies the TikTok trends that matter by analysing their health, strength, and stability in the context of their macro forecasts. This enables WGSN to predict the lifespan of a trend, anticipate what will come next, and identify any risks to avoid. By doing so, brands can incorporate trends into their long-term product and marketing strategies and avoid the short-term reactive approach. “No more TikTok FOMO. Instead of jumping from trend to trend, decision-makers can confidently stay ahead of whatever the algorithm throws at them, and eliminate the anxiety around keeping up with every trend,” says WGSN. Indeed, trends on TikTok don’t just spring from nowhere, WGSN deems. Moreover, they aren’t as ‘fast’ as people assume. By framing the trends within proprietary macro forecasts, WGSN intends to deliver a contextualised view and to provide prediction on where each trend will go next. “In the hyper competitive beauty market, identifying fad vs trend is essential. With our truly unique, ground-breaking TikTok Analytics forecasts no brand needs to waste time nor investment on here-today-gone-tomorrow product fads, and instead can get ahead of the market with the trends that will really change the bottom line,” highlights Carla Buzasi, CEO of WGSN."

Towards a bank of genetic signatures for bio-resources in cosmetics,"The founding members of the ""DNA & cosmetics"" consortium — Clarins, Croda Beauty Actives, DNA Gensee, Greentech, L’Oréal and Nuxe — have announced progresses in the development of a bank of genetic “ signatures” of vegetal resources (plants and algae) used in cosmetic products and fragrances. The creation of the prototype of this database is now launched. This work is based on collaboration with botanical gardens and/or specialized conservatories, for the search of botanically authenticated plant samples and the determination of their genetic signature. This in-depth work includes the study of closely related species and the creation of appropriate tools for the absolute authentication of plant resources. These technologies are based on genetic tools developed by the DNA Gensee laboratory, to ""read"" DNA barcodes on plants and algae to ensure their authentication with high reliability in order to guarantee the traceability of plant raw materials with a strong desire to increase transparency and security of the supply chain. Simultaneously, the consortium is getting more international through the arrival of major manufacturers of cosmetic ingredients or finished products. “Joining the DNA & Cosmetics consortium reflects the same desire to guarantee the authenticity of their raw materials and their desire for transparency,” said the consortium in a statement. More details and new announcements are expected at the in-cosmetics Global show, which will be held in Paris from April 16 to 18, 2024."
Trends: ’Doll makeup’ combines a light touch on complexion with sweet accents,"After the success of ""berry makeup"" and ""chrome makeup"" looks, ""doll makeup"" is gaining in popularity among beauty enthusiasts. The trend has become increasingly popular on social media ever since singer and actress Sabrina Carpenter adopted it. Her coquettish, girly makeup looks in pink tones have captured the attention of internet users, making it one of the strongest trends on TikTok in recent weeks. ‘Doll makeup’ is all about reproducing the look of a doll’s face with makeup while reducing the use of cosmetic products to adopt a lighter beauty routine. All with a view to achieving the most naturally glowing skin. Fresh, natural and easy to apply, this light approach to makeup is perfect for the return of warm weather in the northern hemisphere. Although blush is the star of this beauty routine, as it gives that doll-like look, highlighter and white pencil, applied under the eyes, are also essential. Unlike other makeup techniques that focus more on contouring, the aim here is not to define the angles of the face, but rather to create the illusion of a rounded face. Meanwhile, when it comes to the complexion, it’s best to opt for a fairly light foundation to create a ""glowy"" look. Lips are the final step in creating a doll-like makeup look. Using a pinkish lip pencil will enable to outline the mouth. Eventually, applying gloss as a finishing touch will your lips a plumping effect. With its simplicity, freshness and playfulness, ‘doll makeup’ is finally moving away from the more bolded trends that marked last summer, such as the “espresso makeup” look or the ""strawberry makeup"" look, the latter being characterized by pronounced blush, glossy lips, sculpted eyebrows and, above all, visible freckles on the nose."
Evonik partners with Jland Biotech in vegan collagen for cosmetic applications,"In a new strategic move to expand their collagen platform, Evonik’s Venture Capital arm has invested in Jland Biotech, a company dedicated to developing and manufacturing non-animal-derived collagen. Through this partnership, Evonik intends to meet the growing demand for vegan collagen for cosmetic and personal care applications. Evonik recently launched its own vegan collagen Vecollage Fortify L for cosmetic and personal care applications. The new collagen products, manufactured in collaboration with Jland, will be launched later this year. “Evonik’s life sciences division is using its biotechnology platform to leverage the expertise of its partners and collaborate on precision biosolutions. We welcome Jland to our partner network,” said Johann-Caspar Gammelin, President of the Nutrition & Care division. “Together with our expertise in active ingredients and delivery systems, we are creating a world-leading portfolio of non-animal derived collagen.” Collagen is a protein found in human and animal structural tissues such as bones, cartilage, skin and nails. Collagen can be used as a bioactive in cosmetic and personal care applications to improve elasticity and hydration in the skin. Vegan collagen is of particular interest for formulators developing cosmeceuticals that are effective in the deep layers of the skin. Produced from bacteria or yeast through a controlled fermentation-based process, non-animal collagen is easier to formulate and better absorbed by the skin than animal-derived collagen. Fermentation-based collagen also has low immunogenicity and batch-to-batch variability and is highly reproducible."
Spanish fashion and beauty house Puig announces IPO,"Spanish fashion group Puig, which owns the Nina Ricci, Paco Rabanne, Charlotte Tilbury or Byredo and has a controlling interest in Jean Paul Gaultier labels, on Monday said it was planning to float its shares on the local stock market. Puig ""announces its intention to proceed with the initial public offering (IPO)"" with a view to being listed on the Madrid stock exchange, said a statement from the Barcelona-based family-owned group that specialises in perfumes and cosmetics. The aim was to raise an initial 1.25 billion euros through newly-issued shares after which it would make a ""larger secondary offering"" of existing shares held by its holding company Exea. This second step could allow Puig to raise an amount ""higher"" than the issue of new shares and would therefore bring the total fundraising worth of 2.5 billion euros. Following the IPO, the Puig family will retain a majority stake in the company and the “vast” majority of voting rights, the group added. According to analysts, this IPO would value the Catalan group at nearly 10 billion euros. ""Today’s announcement is a decisive step in Puig’s 110-year history,"" said chairman and CEO Marc Puig in the statement, emphasising the firm’s ""long term approach"". The IPO ""will allow us to better compete in the international beauty market during the next phase of the company’s development,"" he said. He had already raised the idea of a IPO back in an October interview with the Financial Times, saying it would bring market ""discipline"" without the founding family relinquishing control. Founded in Barcelona in 1914 by businessman Antonio Puig Castello, the company has grown over the years to become a heavyweight in the cosmetics, fragrance and fashion industries which has carried out a string of acquisitions in recent years. Among its brands are Paco Rabanne, Nina Ricci, Charlotte Tilbury, Dries Van Noten and Carolina Herrera and it also holds a majority stake in the luxury Jean Paul Gaultier label. Last year, Puig posted sales of 4.3 billion euros, a 19 percent increase on 2022, logging net profits of 465 million euros, up 16 percent year-on-year."

AI vs humans: influencers face competition from virtual models,"Social media influencers have embraced artificial intelligence to spice up their content but they are also facing growing competition from AI-generated Instagramers, TikTokers and YouTubers. Sporting pink hair and posing in lingerie, swimsuits or gym outfits, Aitana Lopez has more than 300,000 followers on Instagram where she is described as a ""gamer at heart"" and ""fitness lover"" — except she’s not real. Aitana was created by The Clueless, a Barcelona-based company that describes itself as an ""AI modeling agency"" run by ""visionaries on a mission to redefine the world of influencers"". Sofia Novales, project manager at The Clueless, said the ""rising costs associated with human influencers"" was a reason behind the company’s creation. ""Virtual models, being digital, present a more economical alternative,"" Novales said. The influencer market whets appetites. Indeed, it is expected to grow rapidly, from $16.5 billion in 2022 to nearly $200 billion by 2032, according to Allied Market Research. Other “advantages lie in unparalleled creative control, allowing seamless decision-making on image, fashion, and aesthetics without the need for physical photoshoots,"" Novales added. However, the rise of AI has fuelled concerns about the proliferation of deepfake videos that could be used maliciously. Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, said Friday it would start putting ""Made with AI labels"" on AI-generated content in May. Using virtual influencers is not new: Barbie already has millions of followers on Instagram. But they are now being used in advertisements where they can’t be told apart from a real person. Take Lil Miquela, a ""19-year-old Robot living in LA"" created by a California agency in 2016. With 2.6 million followers on Instagram and 3.5 million on TikTok, Lil Maqueta has promoted brands as big as BMW. The idea was to ""create something never seen before,"" the German premium carmaker said in a statement to AFP. ""Attracting a younger, technology-savvy generation is for us the icing on the cake,"" it said. Maud Lejeune, who heads up the Paris-based digital strategy agency AD Crew, said that it isn’t difficult for the public to accept AI influencers. ""It’s like actors on TV: we know it isn’t real yet we follow them and we find it interesting, it’s like watching a mini-series."" Human influencers are also seizing on AI technology to make better videos. France’s Charles Sterlings sees an opportunity to improve translations. He uses different tools on platforms like HeyGen and Rask.ai to automatically translate and lip-sync his video posts into English and Spanish. Sterlings also uses Deepshot, a platform that allows users to create deepfakes by changing the words and mouth movement of people in real videos. But Sterlings sees the technology as a competitor as well as a useful tool. ""Anyone with a phone can be an influencer. But eventually, it will be artificial intelligence, available 24 hours a day, and much cheaper to develop,"" he said. For Maud Lejeune, AI can help influencers produce more content. ""It’s tough to put yourself in front of the camera for a long time and certain creators burn out... Maybe AI will provide a new way to create without exposing oneself,"" she said. The Clueless has no qualms about its AI models taking away business from real influencers. ""We don’t foresee real models becoming obsolete or replaced by AI-generated models like Aitana,"" said Novales. ""In our view, they can coexist as another competition of the industry."""

Shoppers Drug Mart to recycle the packaging of its private label beauty brand,"Canada’s drugstore chain Shoppers Drug Mart (known as Pharmaprix in Quebec) has announced the launch of a recycling program dedicated to its Quo Beauty cosmetics line. Based on a partnership with TerraCycle, the new program offers customers the possibility to recycle empty Quo Beauty cosmetics components and keep plastic packaging from going to landfills and incinerators. This partnership with TerraCycle comes less than a year after the launch of ""More Planet Love"" by Quo Beauty which includes over 500 products with more sustainable packaging, using recycled plastics, mono-materials, and reduced plastic packaging. In addition, for each pound of cosmetics waste shipped in through the recycling program, $1 will be donated to Shoppers Foundation for Women’s Health. ""As we work to ensure all control brand packaging is recyclable or reusable by 2025, we continue to look for new and innovative ways to eliminate the use of single-us plastics for all product packaging,"" says Pat Dean, SVP, Category Management, Shoppers Drug Mart. Plastic and glass tubes, pots, pumps, sprays, and jars, lipstick, lip balm, lip gloss tubes, and wands, mascara tubes and wands, eyeliner pencils and components, eyeshadow and bronzer components, foundation packaging, powder components, concealer tubes and sticks, are all eligible for recycling. However, nail polish bottles, nail polish remover bottles, makeup wipes and sponges, makeup brushes, and pressurized canisters (including aerosol cans) will not be accepted through this program. ""The majority of cosmetic products are not accepted by curbside recycling services due to their complex, multilayer packaging, which often includes small components such as wands, pumps, and caps that slip through the sorting machinery at recycling facilities,"" said Tom Szaky, TerraCycle founder and CEO. ""As the first major retailer in Canada to create a free recycling program for their own private-label beauty brand, Shoppers Drug Mart is setting a great example for the beauty industry."" At the end of January, Shoppers Drug Mart also announced that it would stop using single-use plastic shopping bags in all its stores across Canada."
China’s Temu drops ad campaign in Europe over personal data use fears,"Chinese online marketplace Temu said Saturday it would drop an advertising offer in which clients could gain vouchers in exchange for surrendering their personal data for an indefinite period. The campaign, launched this month in England and later in France, promised vouchers of up to 100 euros if a client downloaded the Temu shopping app and invited another person to sign up. But the terms of the offer state that Temu is granted the right to use for life, and without notice, much of a client’s personal data. British news site The Independent reported this week that the terms specified the use of ""photo, name likeness, voice, opinions, statements, biographical information, and/or hometown and state for promotional or advertising purposes in any media worldwide"". Temu, part of Chinese low-price retailer Pinduoduo, said in a statement to AFP that its offer had been a ""great success in France, with numerous satisfied clients"". Nevertheless it had been halted in both France and Britain because of ""misunderstandings on the extent of client data use"". Temu said it had only involved ""user names and profile pictures"". It did not respond to requests on whether the promotional offer was being used in other countries. ""Temu is committed to client confidentiality,"" it said. ""We do not and will not sell client data."" Earlier this month, Temu’s parent Pinduoduo, a main competitor of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, reported a 90-percent surge in net profit for 2023, to 60 billion yuan (USD 8.3 billion)."
Beautycounter breaks into fragrance with full ingredient disclosure,"California-based clean beauty brand Beautycounter has announced its foray into the fragrance category with the launch of Clean Eau De Parfum, a collection of five new scents: Miles Away, Sun Spill, Hyper Rose, Second Skin, and Pacific Dreams. The collection is available for purchase through Beautycounter.com, in Beautycounter brick and mortar stores, and through their community of independent “Advocates”. With this five-unit line, the brand intends to fill a blank space in the clean beauty market. As with the brand’s other products, the ingredients used in the new formulas have been thoroughly vetted. Beautycounter explains that each ingredient was reviewed across 23 health and environmental endpoints. Created by Robertet Group’s perfumer Clément Marx, all five scents are EWG Verified, Leaping Bunny certified, and tested to be safe for sensitive skin. Furthermore, Beautycounter has chosen to disclose the full list of ingredients substances making up its fragrances. With the launch of the Clean Eau De Parfum collection, Beautycounter is focused on closing what they call the ""fragrance loophole"", a legal provision that allows companies not to disclose the ingredients used to make a scent and instead to label their products with generic terms such as ""fragrance"" or ""parfum."" “The current industry practice prevents consumers from being informed about what they’re putting on their bodies,” said Beautycounter in a statement. A similar move was already made five years ago by Hollywood actress Michelle Pfeiffer with the launch of her Henry Rose fragrance brand. Looking ahead, the brand plans to mobilize its community and travel to Washington D.C. in May of this year, to lobby Congress to close the “fragrance loophole” and support the larger Safer Beauty Bill package introduced by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (IL), a suite of four bills that address issues Beautycounter has been vocal about: the need for more supply chain transparency, banning the most harmful ingredients—like PFAS— and explicit protections for overexposed communities including women of color."
European firms falling behind in climate transition targets: report,"Four out of five European companies are not cutting their carbon emissions at the pace or scale necessary to meet the EU’s climate targets, according to a report released Tuesday. The cost of adaptation is one factor holding back businesses, despite 20 percent expecting to lose customers to more climate-friendly competitors, the report by non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and management consulting firm Oliver Wyman found. While many firms have adopted transitions plans they ""are struggling to change their business models at the pace and scale required,"" James Davis, partner at Oliver Wyman, said in a statement. A key challenge, he added, is ""green business models are typically less attractive and riskier than the existing ones they seek to replace."" But to meet the EU’s targets to cut emissions by 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels ""the need to significantly accelerate efforts could not be clearer"", the report stated. Its findings were based on an analysis of 1,600 European companies, including those in the United Kingdom, representing 89 percent of the continent’s market capitalisation. Insufficient investment, including access to capital, was the main hindrance to a more rapid transition. Less than a quarter of capital expenditure was being dedicated to projects aligned with their transition plan or European criteria for the environmental performance of economic activities within the bloc. At the same time, ""government policy has not yet shifted the economic landscape decisively enough in favour of greener products and services"" and could offer more support to certain sectors, the report said. For European electricity companies already facing a shortfall in funding to replace oil and coal generation with renewables ""this investment gap would widen to 285 billion euros by 2030"". Greater collaboration across the financial sector was needed to spread risk between the many players from banks to philanthropic organisations involved in the green transition, the report said."

Sephora to exit South Korea after more than 4 years in the country,"In a statement posted on Sephora Korea’s social media accounts, the LVMH-owned prestige beauty retailer said it would gradually terminate all its online and offline operations in the country. Sephora launched in Korea in 2019 with a flagship in the Parnas Mall located in upscale Gangnam District in south Seoul. However, the company’s development plans were thwarted by the Covid-19 pandemic and strong local competition. Other international retailers like Watsons and Boots have also struggled in this very specific market dominated by CJ Olive Young, which operates over 1,300 stores in the nation and sells a mix of mass and prestige products. Sephora Korea currently has five physical stores in Korea, in addition to its online operations. The company will start closing its operations on May 6. Sephora said its customer service team in Korea will continue operating until mid-August for returns and refunds."

Prestige retailer Douglas Group shares drop after stock market return,"Europe’s leading prestige beauty retailer, Douglas Group, suffered a disappointing stock market return on Thursday March 21 in Frankfurt. After ten years of absence, the group decided to come back to the stock exchange with the aim to reduce its debt. Douglas priced its initial public offering (IPO) at 26 euros (US$28.3) per share on Tuesday. The stock opened at 25.50 euros on Thursday and cost 23.06 euros at the end of the day, a good eleven percent less than the issue price, which was already at the lower end of the issue range of up to 30 euros. Based on this price of 23.06 euros, the Düsseldorf-headquartered company, would be priced at a valued of around 2.5 billion euros. ""The deleveraging associated with the IPO will increase our financial flexibility and provide additional support for our successful development,"" Douglas Chief Executive Sander van der Laan said earlier this month. Shares of the Douglas group were withdrawn from the Stock Exchange in 2013 by its co-owners at the time, the Advent fund and the Kreke family. In 2015, the group was sold to CVC Capital Partners, another private equity fund, which was holding 84% of the shares before the IPO. The free float now stands at around 32%, with CVC Capital Partners and the Kreke family holding 54.4% and 10.2% of the shares, respectively. The two private owners have also committed to injecting around 300 million euros to bolster the group’s balance sheet. The group, which sells perfumes, skincare and makeup products in around 1,850 stores in 22 European countries, through brands such as Douglas, Nocibé, parfumdreams and Niche Beauty, closed nearly 20% of its stores in 2021 to strengthen its online sales activity. In the 2022/23 financial year, Douglas generated sales of 4.1 billion euros, an increase of 12.1%, and a net profit of 17 million euros after several years of heavy losses. The company’s goal is to reach the 5 billion sales mark by 2026. The group has launched a program to develop and expand its store network. By the end of the financial year 2025/26, Douglas plans to add more than 200 stores to its portfolio, and more than 400 stores are set to be upgraded or refurbished."
Swedish pharmacy chain limits sales of skincare products to minors,"One of Sweden’s main pharmacy chains, Apotek Hjartat, said Thursday it was limiting sales of certain skincare products to those under 15 in order to combat unhealthy beauty standards for youth. ""Today there is an unhealthy and unnecessary use of advanced skincare products among young people and we want to be a voice that says stop,"" Monika Magnusson, CEO of Apotek Hjartat, said in an email to AFP. ""As a major retailer of skincare products and as a pharmacy we want to take responsibility for the use of skin care according to need,"" Magnusson added. Inspired by influencers on social media networks, more and more children, some as young as 10, are turning to anti-ageing products, according to the company. ""As one of the links in the healthcare chain and a retailer of skincare products, Apotek Hjartat is concerned about the growing trend of children using, or being encouraged to use, advanced skincare products,"" the company said in a statement. The products in question, most of which are anti-aging products, are listed on the pharmaceutical group’s website. They include products with AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids), BHAs (beta hydroxy acids), vitamin A and vitamin C. To purchase these products, customers must be at least 15 years old, have permission from their parents or be able to produce a medical certificate justifying their use. Annika Svedberg, chief pharmacist at Apotek Hjartat, stressed the importance of choosing skincare products based on needs, not beauty ideals. ""Skin care needs are highly individual and depend on skin type and condition, not age,"" she said in a statement. “Using products aimed at reducing wrinkles and evening out skin tone is not something a child needs."" The age limit is currently being rolled out, both online and in Apotek Hjartat’s some 390 pharmacies in Sweden. ""We hope that this age limit will make more people stop and reflect, and that it can lead to important conversations between parents, within families and in society, around ideals and norms,"" Magnusson said."

SVR selects Aptar Beauty’s Airless Micro rPET pack for Palpebral Baume,"For their latest Palpebral collection launch in October 2023, France’s Laboratoire SVR chose Aptar Beauty’s Micro 30ml, a recycled and recyclable airless packaging with a container fully made from recycled PET (rPET). Although recycled materials look naturally greyer than conventional resins, industrial experts at Aptar Beauty managed to colour match the iconic pink colour of the Palpebral range to the container, while keeping the translucent effect of the resin which hints at the precious formula inside. “SVR was looking for a recycled and recyclable packaging capable of both protecting and highlighting the formula, without compromising the look and feel of the product. The Aptar Beauty Villingen teams in Germany addressed this challenge and managed to lower the CO2 emissions [1] by 52% thanks to this rPET container,” explains Magdalena Kaminska, Marketing Director Beauty EMEA, Aptar Beauty. Aptar Beauty’s Micro range is a top-fill airless packaging and is available in 15-50ml with a 300cl dosage, and offers a variety of shapes, materials, and a multitude of personalization options to fit their brand aesthetic."
Swedish fashion brand Acne Studio to launch first fragrance with Fredéric Malle,"For its very first fragrance since its creation in Stockholm in 1996, the Swedish fashion label relied on the experience of Éditions de Parfum Frédéric Malle. Frédéric Malle and Jonny Johansson, founder and creative director of Acne Studios, met at the Café de Flore in Paris. Driven by mutual admiration, the two men entrusted Suzy Le Helley, a young perfume designer at Symrise, who was trained by Annick Ménardo and Maurice Roucel, with the mission of composing a fragrance combining the audacity and classicism of the brand, relying on elements of inspiration from Swedish culture. “Personally, this is my first major solo launch, and I thank Frédéric’s audacity and confidence in entrusting such a project to a young designer. I hope that this perfume will reach a new generation who are less familiar with the great classics and who would be curious to discover a great aldehyde floral, seen through a new prism, a new look,” explained Suzy Le Helley. Overdosed in aldehydes, the scent reminds freshly washed laundry, with floral notes of rose, violet and orange blossom. Vanilla and peach follow in the middle while the base is sandalwood, incense, and musk. “Frédéric Malle manages to combine the classic and the avant-garde perfectly. For him, creativity always comes first. Nothing is dictated by marketing, simply by the desire to do beautiful things,” highlighted Johansson about this collaboration. Acne Studios x Frédéric Malle will be launched on April 17, 2024."

Stoelzle creates the bottles for the first AMG Thrill perfume line,"Drawing on a successful collaboration for the Mercedes-Benz Parfums brand, INCC Parfums has entrusted the French glasswork division of the Austrian Stoelzle Group to produce the bottles for their first AMG Parfums collection. The inaugural AMG Parfum line-up features three fragrances – Silver Thrill, Black Thrill, and Red Thrill – crafted by Fabrice Pellegrin, principal perfumer at dsm-firmenich. For this launch, INCC Parfums has opted for recycled glass for the bottles, ensuring they are refillable with the new SNI15 screw cap standard. Each full-size bottle (100ml) features a glass heart, protected by a metallic shell. For Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie, the design challenge lay in crafting glass fittings adaptable enough to accommodate the plates and their precise tolerances. The three bottles were lacquered in transparency, the Silver Thrill in orange, the Black Thrill in red and the Red Thrill in dark yellow. The smaller 60ml bottles also feature the same lacquering technique, mirroring the colour codes of their larger counterparts. In this format, the brand logo and fragrance names are screen-printed directly onto the glass. Notably, these smaller bottles are presented without a shell, expanding the product range with a lighter, more portable option. “Stoelzle successfully addressed the challenges posed by the bottles’ height and thinness, ensuring uniform glass distribution throughout,” said the glassmaker in a statement. The AMG Parfums inaugural collection has been available since September 2023."

Metsä Board: fresh fiber paperboards for a reduced carbon footprint,"Thanks to the use of fossil free energy during their production and their lighter weight, Metsä Board’s folding boxboards allow to reduce significantly the carbon footprint of packaging. Assessments [1] conducted by Metsä Board demonstrate the significant carbon footprint reductions that pharmaceutical manufacturers can achieve by switching from commonly used grades to Metsä Board fresh fibre paperboards. Indeed, switching from a solid bleached board (SBB) to Metsä Board folding boxboard can reduce the carbon footprint of packaging by over 50%, and replacing white lined chipboard (WLC) with Metsä Board folding boxboard can result in a 60% reduction or even higher. These assessments have been verified by IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute. The technical background report and the verification statement are available on Metsä Board’s website. Despite the lighter weight, Metsä Board’s folding boxboards still retain the durability and functional properties of traditional heavier grades. “As a responsible materials supplier it is our job to provide pharma brand owners with transparent, unbiased information that helps them evaluate packaging materials to make better-informed and sustainable choices to reduce their carbon footprint,” says Anne Uusitalo, Product Safety and Sustainability Director at Metsä Board."

Germany launches major subsidy scheme for greener industry,"Germany on Tuesday launched what it called ""an innovative"" multi-billion-euro subsidy scheme aimed at turbocharging investments that will make industrial production in Europe’s top economy more climate friendly. Energy Minister Robert Habeck said four billion euros ($4.4 billion) would be up for grabs in the first round of the programme, with companies in energy-intensive sectors like glass, steel and paper-making invited to submit proposals for green technology projects that will slash their emissions. ""We are the first industrial country to introduce this,"" Habeck told a press conference, calling the scheme ""an innovate, new instrument"" that would cut red tape, boost technological innovation and help Germany reach its climate targets. The ""climate protection contracts"" will run for 15 years, Habeck said, with the government awarding subsidies to those firms that can decarbonise their production processes at the lowest cost. The government has set aside a ""mid-double-digit"" billion euro amount for the programme overall, Habeck said. The next round of bidding will open in the autumn for 19 billion euros in subsidies. The scheme comes as Germany’s crucial manufacturing industry is suffering through a downturn, battered by inflation, weaker global demand and soaring energy costs after Russia’s war in Ukraine cut off access to cheap gas imports. ""We need this as stimulus for the economy and of course for climate protection,"" Habeck said. The scheme is expected to help reduce carbon emissions from industry by 350 million tonnes by 2045, according to the economy ministry. Germany aims to be carbon neutral by 2045. Habeck said the subsidy programme was also ""a good answer"" to the green incentives offered by the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act, which have already prompted some German firms to mull moving production abroad. ""We need production in Germany, I want energy-intensive industries here and I want that production to be climate neutral,"" he said."
L’Oréal addresses localized skin pigmentation issues with a new ingredient,"The French cosmetics giant is unveiling some details about Melasyl, its new multi-patented molecule designed to address localized pigmentation issues that lead to age spots and post-acne marks. Already available in La Roche Posay’s Mela B3 franchise, including MelaB3 serum and MelaB3 SPF30, the new ingredient helps provide a more even, natural skin tone, addressing even the most persistent marks across all skin tones, claims L’Oréal. According to a landmark, worldwide epidemiological study on pigmentary disorders, half of all people report having at least one skin pigmentation issue [1]. “With half of all people reporting skin pigmentation issues and a third of these experiencing lower quality of life as a result, the impact of visible spots or post-acne marks is clearly more than skin-deep,” said Anne Colonna, Global Head of Advanced Research at L’Oréal Groupe. “Melasyl is a first-of-its kind ingredient that helps to address localized skin pigmentation issues, with proven efficacy and wide accessibility that will enable more people to regain their self confidence.” The L’Oréal group said its L’Oréal Paris and Vichy brands will follow with future product launches, expanding consumer access to expert formulations containing the new ingredient. Melasyl was first presented at the World Congress of Dermatology 2023 in Singapore, alongside the first worldwide epidemiological study on pigmentary disorders. Melasyl was recently featured at the American Academy of Dermatology’s annual meeting in San Diego from March 8-12, 2024."

New studies show scalp microbiota benefits of Lubrizol’s Fensebiome peptide,"Lubrizol Life Science Beauty has unveiled results of new tests for Fensebiome peptide applied on the scalp. The ingredient had previously shown to have transformational effects on the skin by reinforcing the double cutaneous barrier, promoting microbiota balance and enhancing the physical barrier, helping to achieve a healthier and younger appearance. The new data showed that when applied on the scalp, Fensebiome peptide led to an increase in beneficial scalp microbiota that tends to decrease with age and a modulation of age-induced microbiota changes, associated with a rejuvenated and healthier scalp. The ingredient was also tested on two panels of volunteers: a group of women with sensitive scalps and a group of men with bald sensitive scalps. Both groups found that Fensebiome peptide soothed the scalp, leaving it feeling hydrated and with less itchiness and desquamation. In addition, new in vitro tests showed a reduction of Kallicrein-5 and PAR-2 activation, which helps relieve inflammatory and itching skin and scalp conditions. According to Lubrizol, the heptapeptide can now be incorporated into scalp care formulations designed to reduce sensitivity, prevent dehydration, and rejuvenate the scalp."

"Competition and immobilism explain the demise of The Body Shop, says Ecovia","Once a trailblazer in the cosmetics industry, the iconic cosmetics retailer has gone into administration with over 40 percent of its UK stores to close and most of its international subsidiaries have or are expected to declare bankruptcy. According to Ecovia Intelligence, a London-based specialist research and consulting company that focuses on global ethical product industries, the demise of The Body Shopgives some insight into how fast the sustainability arena is changing. The collapse of the cosmetics firm came as a surprise as it has only been under new ownership since November. The private equity firm Aurelius acquired The Body Shop from Natura & Co. in a deal worth GBP 207 million (EUR 240 million). The Brazilian cosmetics giant sold the business after acquiring it from L’Oréal in 2017. Many saw Natura & Co. as a ‘natural fit’ for The Body Shop since the Brazilian company is one of the most sustainable (large) corporations in the beauty industry. Its flagship brand Natura Brasil has pioneered many green initiatives, involving carbon management, green packaging, and ethical sourcing of raw materials. However, Natura & Co. sold off The Body Shop to the private equity firm for a fraction of what it paid L’Oréal: GBP 880 million (EUR 1.02 billion). However, Ecovia emphasizes, The Body Shop has long innovated in terms of ethics. It was one of the first brands to actively campaign against animal-testing methods. It was also one of the first to introduce refillable packaging, something that has become fashionable in recent years. It was also one of the first companies to ethically source natural ingredients with its fair trade initiative in 1987. More recently, it was the first beauty brand to use fairly traded plastics in its packaging. In January this year, it was the first major brand to have all its products certified by the Vegan Society. So what has been responsible for the demise of The Body Shop? Ecovia Intelligence believes it hasn’t been a case of the ethical brand losing its way, but it stood still. The Body Shop was indeed a trailblazer with many of its green initiatives in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the beauty industry has moved on since then. Sustainability is now an integral part of beauty, with almost all cosmetic brands undertaking some green / ethical initiatives. In short, being ethical was no longer good enough. Competition has played an important role, says Ecovia Intelligence. The Body Shop initially offered shoppers an array of natural cosmetics, made from raw materials sourced from the far corners of the world. Natural cosmetics are now well-established, with major high street retailers like Boots and Superdrug also marketing these products under their private labels. Competition has also come from rival brands. Lush has taken ethical cosmetics to new levels with its green campaigns and innovative natural products. The UK brand is a pioneer with packaging-free products, selling solid shampoos and naked mascara. About a third of its cosmetic products are sold without packaging. It operates almost 900 Lush stores in 50 countries; some new store openings are ‘naked’ i.e. all cosmetic products have no packaging. One can argue that Lush took the ethical baton from The Body Shop shortly after its formation in 1995. Changing consumer preferences are another factor, according to Ecovia Intelligence. The Body Shop initially offered consumers a unique shopping experience offering novel natural products, essential oils, and ethical gift packs. Natural cosmetics are now mainstream, whilst mass market brands are also marketing themselves on sustainability attributes. Ethical consumers no longer look at just natural ingredients, but also consider packaging impacts, carbon footprint, social causes, and related green issues when making purchases. There are questions on whether younger consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Y, resonate with the Body Shop brand. According to Ecovia Intelligence, the demise of The Body Shop highlights how competitive stakes are rising in the sustainable cosmetics arena."
"Puig exceeds EUR 4,300 million in revenues 2023","The Spanish beauty giant [1] closed 2023 with record net revenues of 4,304 million euros, an increase of 19% on 2022 (also +19% comparable perimeter and with constant exchange rates), with double-digit growth across all segments and geographies. These results are significantly ahead of the company’s plan, established in 2021, to reach 3,000 billion euros in revenues in 2023. Net profit rose to 465 million euros, up 16% compared to the previous year. Puig grew in all segments (fragrances and fashion, makeup, skincare), with double-digit revenue growth vs 2022, ahead of the market average. Puig registered a 17% increase in the fragrances and fashion segment compared to 2022. This segment represented 72% of Puig net revenues in 2023 compared to 74% in 2022. Key highlights in 2023 included Rabanne’s launch of a new brand identity and becoming the first Puig brand to exceed Net Revenues of 1 billion euros, while Jean Paul Gaultier became the fastest growing brand in the Puig portfolio. The makeup business segment recorded a 23% increase in revenues in 2023 and made up 18% of Puig’s net revenues (vs 17% in 2022). Momentum in this segment continued to be driven by the success of Charlotte Tilbury, which celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a positive performance in the United Kingdom, North America and Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Singapore. The strong growth in the segment was further fueled by the acceleration in the Middle East and Latin America, the performance of Christian Louboutin Beauté and the positive reception of the launch of Rabanne’s make-up line. Revenues from the skincare segment rose by 31% in 2023, becoming the fastest-growing segment for Puig and representing 10% of its net revenues. This increase was once again partly driven by the success of Charlotte Tilbury’s leading product Magic Cream, in line with its commitment to providing a complete skincare regime. Growth was further fuelled by sales of dermatology products from Uriage and Apivita. Finally, the incorporation of the full-year results of Loto del Sur and Kama Ayurveda, both acquired in 2022, was key to achieving this strong double-digit growth in 2023. The segment was once again reinforced with the acquisition of Dr. Barbara Sturm in January 2024."

French antitrust authority to investigate product rating systems,"The French antitrust authority (Autorité de la concurrence) has announced it is starting inquiries ex officio to analyse the competitive functioning of the product rating systems sector, in particular when it aims to provide consumers with information on the sustainability-related characteristics of consumer products and services. Available via digital applications or labels that voluntarily affixed by manufacturers, these rating systems focus on nutritional quality, environmental impact, energy efficiency, and so on, said the French Authority. Present in a wide range of sectors (agri-food, cosmetics, textiles, toys, household appliances, interior design and tourist accommodation), some systems may be created by public bodies, while others are offered by consumer associations or independent companies in the sector of the products or services rated. Lastly, some rating systems are the result of individual or collective initiatives by companies in the same markets. The Autorité intends to analyse how the information provided by the rating systems is likely to guide consumer purchasing decisions and thus constitute a parameter of competition. It will examine whether the systems encourage companies to innovate to create products or services that are more virtuous in terms of sustainability. In addition, the Autorité will explore the question of relevant markets with a view to providing a market analysis grid. Lastly, it will strive to understand the consequences for competition of the multiplication and coexistence of rating systems within the same sector. Rating applications — such as Yuka, Beautylitic and Clear Formula — have disrupted the cosmetics market in France, and strongly stimulated the demand for products of natural origin. But manufacturers are not left out and are also seeking to implement rating scales, particularly in environmental matters, with the Green Impact Index or EcoBeautyScore projects."
"A minority of TikTokers produce the vast majority of content, research finds","Despite its growing popularity, TikTok remains a platform where the majority of users are content to consume videos. A recent study by the Pew Research Center reveals that the most active 25% of US adult users produce 98% of public content on TikTok. Moreover, the report states that about half of all US adults on the site have never actually posted a video themselves. The top 25% of US adult TikTok users who are the most active in terms of posting produce 98% of all publicly accessible videos from this group, according to analysis from Pew Research surveying 2,745 US adults using TikTok in August 2023. The research highlights a significant concentration of publishing activity, with a minority of very active users generating the majority of content. The research reveals that almost half of the American TikTok users surveyed have never posted a video. What’s more, most of them haven’t even filled in their biography. Users aged 18 to 34 (52%) are more likely to use TikTok than their elders. However, only about half of them have actually posted content, a figure similar to that of the 35-to-49 age group (60%), the study points out. Users who post videos are generally more active on TikTok: they follow more accounts, are followed by more people themselves, are more likely to have filled out their bio, and are somewhat more likely to find the content of their ""For You"" page highly interesting, the research reports. The analysis found that the median poster has uploaded six videos and received a total of 149 likes. Moreover, a median poster will also follow almost four times as many other accounts as someone who doesn’t post. TikTok’s recommendation algorithm, experienced via the ""For You"" page, seems to be working effectively for the platform’s users. Indeed, 85% of users find the content of this page at least somewhat interesting, with 40% describing it as extremely or very interesting. Only 14% found it of little or no interest."

General Elections: CTPA calls for a UK strategy to support the beauty industry,"As the United Kingdom is heading towards a General Election this year, the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) — the UK trade association representing companies involved in making, supplying and selling cosmetics and personal care products – is calling for the next Government to develop a strategy for the cosmetics and personal care industry to secure the continued sustainable growth of the sector. The association’s 12 key asks are developed in its first ever Manifesto (www.ctpa.org.uk/CTPAmanifesto2024). Gathered under five pillars (Essentiality, Regulation, Science, Sustainability and Business) these 12 asks are described as “the most important things Government can do to help ensure the continued growth and success of the sector.” According to CTPA, the next UK Government should: promotes the essentiality of the industry’s products and services, maintains strict risk-based safety legislation, protects science-led decision-making, provides a framework for growth with sustainability at its core, enhances the competitiveness of the UK industry for both import and export, champions the UK industry as a leader in product manufacture, design and innovation. For instance, CTPA says a formal UK/EU cooperation structure for the cosmetics and personal care industry should be created to facilitate trade and regulatory cooperation. The association also explains the Government will have to ensure consistent implementation of new rules within the UK internal market across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and be supportive of take-back schemes and to invest in a harmonised infrastructure for recycling. CTPA also advocates for the return of tax-free shopping in the UK to boost tourism spending in stores and at airports… “To date, the cosmetics and personal care industry has not had a dedicated Government strategy focused on this vital sector. CTPA would like to work with the UK Government after the General Election on a strategy recognising the essentiality of the industry’s products and services by maintaining the strict risk-based safety legislation, protecting science-led decision-making whilst providing a framework for growth with sustainability at its core. The strategy should also enhance the competitiveness of the UK industry for both import and export and champion the UK industry as a leader in product manufacture, design and innovation,” said Dr Emma Meredith, CTPA’s Director-General. The full Manifesto, including all key asks and rationales is available at:

L’Oréal USA launches second edition of its inclusive beauty fund,"L’Oréal USA just launched a new edition of its Inclusive Beauty Fund, which provides financial support and resources to small businesses and entrepreneurs across the beauty industry. Administered in collaboration with the NAACP’s Economic Empowerment Fund and Hispanic Federation, respectively, L’Oréal has partnered with GlobalGiving to provide 40 one-time grants to small businesses and entrepreneurs in the beauty industry across the United States. In 2021, recognizing that beauty businesses were some of the most acutely impacted by the economic fallout of COVID-19 and resulting shutdowns, L’Oréal USA partnered with the NAACP to provide much needed support in terms of funding and business mentoring to 33 small beauty businesses. Grant recipients used the funds to grow their inventory, refine marketing strategies, and open new retail locations. “The grant provided by L’Oréal USA and NAACP came at the perfect time for us. It truly provided us with the fuel to invest in inventory, as well as marketing. The resources were really the linchpin for us. As a business it provided us with a gateway to connect with salon owners and stylists in a whole new way,” said LaToya Stirrup, Co-Founder and CEO of Kazmaleje, a recipient of an Inclusive Beauty Fund grant in 2021. While progress has been made, L’Oréal says it is important to continue supporting beauty entrepreneurs who are still facing economic hurdles and headwinds. According to the beauty giant, these challenges limit their potential to scale their businesses and provide essential beauty services to consumers nationwide. In 2024, L’Oréal USA is expanding the program to include NGO partner Hispanic Federation and grant administrator GlobalGiving. In addition to one-time funding, the company is committed to providing grantees with professional mentorship and business development support with the participation of top executives from its leading beauty brands and its professional beauty products distributor, SalonCentric. “The Inclusive Beauty Fund is one of the cornerstones of L’Oréal’s broader commitment to advancing inclusivity within the beauty industry,” said Liliahn Majeed, Chief Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer, North America, L’Oréal Groupe. “We value the role small businesses play in bringing vital products and services to consumers across all backgrounds and lived experiences and we want to do our part to support beauty businesses and entrepreneurs who are working to navigate economic challenges.” Beauty businesses, extensions artists, braiders, estheticians, barbers, salon owners, suite owners, students and stylists nationwide are invited to apply for the Inclusive Beauty Fund.   How to apply? Applications for the Inclusive Beauty Fund will be administered by the NAACP and Hispanic Federation, respectively. The NAACP and Hispanic Federation will each award 20 one-time grants of $10,000 each and applications opened on February 20. All submissions must be conducted through either the NAACP or Hispanic Federation’s websites, with links included below. The candidates selected to receive the grants will be announced in April 2024. – To apply via the NAACP, please use this link:

Quadpack reimagines the dropper with a new tube solution,"The Wanderer by Quadpack is a dropper tube created to provide precise and targeted application, thanks to an exclusive internal design. The Wanderer features a unique flow control disc, which disrupts the flow of the product. By applying pressure to the tube, the formula enters the pipette and ‘wanders’ around the disc’s circuit, giving the consumer better control. A slanted tip facilitates direct application to targeted small areas, with visibly separated drops. The new item is designed specifically for low-viscosity formulations, such as oils, light serums and boosters. Available with a 19mm or 25mm diameter, it supports capacities of 7-20ml and 15-50ml. The functional, minimalist design has just four components: tube, disc, pipette and cap. The cap and pipette come in polypropylene, while the tube is made of polyethylene. It can be monolayer or multilayer, with an EVOH (ethylene vinyl alcohol) barrier for extra protection of complex formulations. The tube and cap offer the possibility to include PCR content. Brands can play with the tube’s proportions – from short and wide, to long and thin – along with a host of decoration options to ensure it matches brand identity. “The Wanderer is a perfect example of optimal control in a mono-family pack. When designing a high-performance product, it is important to consider sustainability right from the start,” said Quadpack Category Specialist Alejandra Isern. “The flow control disc works wonders. It’s amazing how such a small part can impact performance. With regard to external design, having this applicator in a tube makes the user experience comfortable and completely intuitive, making it an easy but effective self-care solution.” Like every product in Quadpack’s catalogue, life-cycle assessment and other impact data for The Wanderer are available in its Environmental Report, to help brands make conscious decisions and achieve their sustainability goals."

Pure Trade celebrates Lunar New Year with Christian Dior,"Every year, some time between late January and early February, an estimated 2 billion people across the globe, many of them in East and Southeast Asia, celebrate the Lunar New Year. To celebrate this important event in China and in other Asian countries, Dior has entrusted Pure Trade with the creation of a specially designed set of boxes and envelopes. The box soberly combines the codes of the House of Dior and those traditionally associated with this time of year. Typical of these festive days, the ""Lucky Money"" envelopes are made of red-tinted FSC paper, decorated with a glossy transparent pattern, a gold hot-stamped band and the Christian Dior logo, also hot-stamped in gold. They are presented in batches of eight, in a large envelope, accompanied by a greetings card from the House of Dior. A case, also in red-tinted FSC paper, perfectly accommodates a lipstick. It closes with a golden eyelet that wraps around two buttons, embossed and gold stamped with the monogram. Finally, two rigid boxes (S & M) and two folding boxes (M & L), in red-tinted FSC paper, make majestic gift boxes. They too are decorated with embossed patterns and gold hot stamping, including the brand logo."
Coty strengthens its perfume portfolio with Italian fashion brand Etro,"The fragrance and beauty giant has signed a new agreement with Italian luxury fashion house, Etro. The deal establishes a long-term partnership (beyond 2040) between Coty and Etro to produce and distribute signature fragrance lines and home scent collections. Upon entry into force of the agreement, Coty will assume the development, production, and distribution of all Etro perfumes and fragrances, including Etro’s iconic fragrances Shantung and Paisley. The two companies said they will work together to explore new categories and innovations to grow Etro’s beauty portfolio. Acquired by L Catterton in July 2021, Etro was founded in Milan Etro in 1968. The brand offers a full range of men’s and women’s ready-to-wear collections. Etro’s presence is driven by the brand’s retail stores consisting of more than 130 locations in over 20 countries across Europe, North America, Middle East and APAC with a prestigious positioning in the symbolic cities of luxury shopping such as Milan, London, Paris, Dubai, New York, Beijing, and Tokyo. Etro’s distribution network also includes omnichannel, travel retail, and selected global wholesale retailers. “This agreement further underscores Coty’s focus on fashion driven licenses with significant multi category potential which resonate with consumers in our key markets. We are excited to collaborate with Etro, building on the brand’s existing beauty offering and bringing its unique brand identity to life through new categories and launches,” said Sue Nabi, Coty’s CEO.

"What the future for sustainable cosmetics, according to Ecovia Intelligence?","Ecovia Intelligence, a London-based specialist research, consulting and training company that focuses on global ethical product industries, has given its predictions for the year ahead for sustainable cosmetics… The range of cosmetic products with sustainability attributes will continue to expand. Natural and organic cosmetics are the most established, with their market share approaching 10% in the US, Germany, and Switzerland. But new products will be launched with green attributes. Waterless products such as shampoo bars, solid moisturisers, and sheet masks will continue to make headway this year. Other sustainable products that are gaining popularity include microbiome-friendly products and refillables. The number of ethical labels in the cosmetics industry will continue to mushroom. Natural and organic are the most established labels; COSMOS and Natrue are the leading standards, having over 35,000 and 6,400 certified products respectively. Other popular eco-labels include Nordic Swan, Fairtrade, Non-GMO, and Climate Neutral. As more consumers switch to a vegan lifestyle and / or reduce their intake of animal-based products, they are seeking plant-based cosmetics. More brands are expected to market their products as vegan. The Body Shop announced this month that it became the first major brand to have its entire product range certified by the Vegan Society. Cosmetic ingredients are increasingly made using precision fermentation, plant cell and new technologies. Geltor and Modern Meadow are two companies that have created collagen alternatives using precision fermentation. The proteins are marketed as vegan, animal-free and sustainable. The Californian start-up Debut is making active ingredients using a cell-free biotechnology model. Expect to see more companies using carbon captured molecules to make cosmetic ingredients, packaging, and finished products. Last year, Coty launched the first widely distributed fragrance using alcohol from industrial carbon emissions. Recently, the Element Packaging obtained CO2 Carbon Captured certification for its packaging materials. Growing consumer concerns about deforestation is encouraging organisations to develop green ingredients. The Dutch-Indonesian enterprise Forestwise is marketing butters and oils made from wild harvested raw materials sourced from the Borneo forest. They are marketed as rainforest ingredients. In 2022, Palmless was launched as an alternative to palm oil in the US; almost chemically identical to palm oil, the material is marketed as deforestation-free. In Europe, NoPalm Ingredients and Äio are creating palm oil alternatives from agricultural by-products. Expect to see more such ingredient launches this year. The move away from single-use plastics is encouraging cosmetic brands to experiment with new packaging materials. Bamboo, beeswax, wood chips, agricultural fibres and other bio-based materials are finding their way into cosmetic packaging. Some brands are looking at dissolvable and compostable packaging. There will be greater scrutiny of green marketing claims this year as regulators bring in new legislation. The EU parliament gave the go ahead for a new directive that will require companies to substantiate environmental or sustainability claims they make about their products. Ecovia Intelligence will showcase these developments at the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit throughout the year. The North American edition will be hosted in New York on 4-6th June, European edition in Paris on 28-30th October, and the Asia-Pacific edition in Hong Kong on 11-12th November 2024.

Cosmogen creates the applicators of the Lancôme x Louvre’s Richelieu palette,"For its Lancôme x Louvre Richelieu Wing limited edition eyeshadow palette, Lancôme entrusted Cosmogen with the creation of the two mini double applicators included in the Richelieu palette. Their black handle with aluminium ferrule accommodates three NBR foam tips and one bevelled tuft of PBT bristles, to apply shades and materials professionally to all areas of the face. With the Richelieu multi-use palette, Lancôme celebrates the sculpture of Corine, a Greek poet from the 5th century BC, presented in the Richelieu wing of the Louvre. The poetry of this palette, created by Lisa Eldridge, is inspired by the magnetic light of the gallery, punctuated by the relief of the sculptures revealing their silent but surprising beauty. ""The texture is very creamy, easy to blend. With these shades, you can use it as a highlighter, for light and deep complexions. You can apply it with your finger or brush, on the eyes, lips. The green shade is sublime as a liner or for a smoky eye look,"" said Lisa Eldridge."

Geka continues to score high when it comes to sustainability,"The German manufacturer of cosmetic applicators has been awarded its fourth consecutive Platinum Sustainability Rating from EcoVadis. This result places Geka within the top 1% of assessed companies. EcoVadis independently assessed Geka across four categories, consolidating results to achieve a final rating. Geka scored in the top 1% for the Environment, Ethics, and Labour & Human Rights categories, while landing in the top 3% for Sustainable Procurement. “This is a great result and illustrates our commitment towards the creation of a responsible cosmetics industry. Our improved performance this year, even with expanded criteria from EcoVadis, is evidence that our long-term sustainability strategy is working. It also shows our customers and users that our approach to beauty is more than skin deep, and that we’re committed to preserving our planet and supporting society too,” commented Oliver Vogel, CEO of Geka. Geka is enacting structured sustainability initiatives across its business, one of which is introducing sustainable materials into its products. In 2023, Geka launched the first ever commercially available post-consumer recycled (PCR) fibre filaments for vegan friendly mascara and eyebrow brushes. Furthermore, its Reborn Collection of mascara, lip gloss, eyebrow brushes, cleaning pads and accessories contains at least 93% PCR and bio-based materials. Furthermore, Geka’s commitment to reduce its 2029 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% compared to 2019 has been independently validated by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi). The company has also pledged to send zero waste to landfill by 2025."
"dsm-firmenich wants to focus on health, flavours and beauty","The Dutch-Swiss giant wants to separate from its Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) division by 2025 to focus on its three other businesses Perfumery & Beauty (P&B); Taste, Texture & Health (TTH) and Health, Nutrition & Care. The merger of DSM and Firmenich created a world-leader in nutrition, health and beauty, however the ANH business “is driven by different dynamics to the rest of the Group,” said the multinational in a statement. Based in Kaiseraugst, not far from Basel, Switzerland, the ANH business generated a turnover of more than 3.2 billion euros last year, or a quarter of the dsm-firmenich’s revenues. However, it weighed on the results for the 2023 financial year, in particular due to the volatility of the vitamin market. “This is a difficult moment, but we strongly believe that a separation would be better for both businesses and their employees,” commented Dimitri de Vreeze, CEO of dsm-firmenich. According to dsm-firmenich, the sale of the ANH business would enable the group to strengthen its position as a world-leader in nutrition, health, and beauty. “By fully focusing on Perfumery & Beauty (P&B); Taste, Texture & Health (TTH); and Health, Nutrition & Care (HNC), the company can further develop its complementary world-class scientific research, technologies and manufacturing excellence. Full focus on these businesses is expected to enhance their commercial potential and synergies, supporting an attractive and consistent growth outlook alongside robust margins,” detailed dsm-firmenich."
A PET bottle from Quadpack for Collistar’s new concealer,"For their new LIFT HD+ Smoothing Lifting Concealer, Collistar has chosen Quadpack’s monomaterial Gala dip-in pack with The Essential applicator, for super soft and easy application. The Gala dip-in pack features a thick-wall bottle entirely made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), meeting the brand’s criteria for the exclusive use of recyclable materials. “Among our main sustainable development objectives are those linked to packaging and eco-design. Specifically, we are committed to releasing only refillable or recyclable packaging by 2025. This means reducing the complexity and quantity of materials by favouring monomaterial choices to ensure that our packaging, once correctly disposed of by the consumer, can be recovered and recycled through standard recycling technologies. By choosing the monomaterial Gala bottle, Lift HD+ Corrector has been revisited in a modern and eco-conceived way that is aligned with our objectives,” explained Matilde Rossi Scota, Head of Sustainable Development at Collistar. Developed by Quadpack, the 4.5ml Gala bottle exudes prestige with its substantial size impression and clean silhouette. Having tried out the choice of matching applicators, Collistar selected The Essential as the right tool to deliver the formula. Its round-tipped spatula has dual reservoirs on opposite sides to load the right amount of product. The flexible wand and soft tip make application gentle, easy and pleasurable. Quadpack ensured the decoration met the brand’s exacting requirements. A black matt varnish is applied to the cap, with the logo discretely hot stamped on the top. The bottle is left transparent, keeping the formula within view, with the lettering silk screened in black along the side. “Collistar, a long-time client of Quadpack, was delighted with the result. For the next iteration, the brand is considering the use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) PET. Quadpack’s life-cycle assessments show that a switch to a full PCR version would improve the pack’s circularity index by 60%, with a 25% reduction in the brand’s Scope 3 carbon footprint,” added the supplier in a statement."

Swiss retail giant Migros wants to divest from cosmetics manufacturer Mibelle,"The Swiss retail giant intends to refocus on its core business and invest more than eight billion francs, particularly in the modernization of its supermarkets.  At the same time, Migros has indicated that it wants to sell off companies that no longer correspond to the group’s strategy and is looking for new owners for the Mibelle Group, which manufactures cosmetic products and ingredients, as well as home care products. According to Migros, the Mibelle Group’s currently achieves around 70% of its turnover on foreign markets. “The link with the core business of Migros in Switzerland is increasingly tenuous. The Mibelle Group certainly produces many products for the Migros supermarkets, but in small quantities compared to its global sales,” explains the company. Migros therefore says that the Mibelle Group will have better growth prospects with a new owner."
"Sulapac, Verescence and Albéa create refillable glass jar with biobased lid","Albéa Cosmetics & Fragrance refillable Twirl jar is now available with a lid made of biobased and recyclable Sulapac and Verescence’s glass base. According to the three partners, the solution provides a reduced carbon footprint while securing excellent functionality and aesthetics. ""The Twirl glass jar with a Sulapac lid is the accessible choice for beauty brands aspiring to integrate cutting-edge sustainability with a luxurious touch,"" says Colin Strobant, Sales Director at Sulapac. The 50 ml jar answers to the trend of refillable packaging, which has been steadily growing in the skincare market in recent years and is becoming increasingly popular among environmentally conscious consumers. Replacing conventional plastic in the lid with Sulapac’s sustainable material takes the environmental credentials of the packaging even a step further. “We are always looking for new materials for our products that tick both the reduction and the recyclability boxes,” explains Aline Roland, Marketing Director at Albéa Cosmetics & Fragrance. “The Sulapac lid is an interesting option for brands for two main reasons: it provides a premium look in combination with glass, and it does not interfere with the glass recycling stream at the product’s end-of-life. The synergy of the three materials, PP plastic, glass and Sulapac makes Twirl a perfect example of a more sustainable packaging.” The glass base of the jar, produced by Verescence, incorporates 20% post-consumer recycled (PCR) glass. ""The Twirl jar is available in our standard collection and is customizable with many decoration techniques such as lacquering, pad printing, and silk-screening,"" says Bérangère Raguenet, Marketing & Communication Director at Verescence."

Groupe Pochet partners with ABO Wind to secure renewable energy sourcing,"The French manufacturer of luxury packaging is preparing the commissioning of its first electric furnace — scheduled for the end of 2024 — on the Pochet du Courval glassmaking site in Normandy. The group has secured its supply in green electricity through a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with ABO Wind. The agreement covers the supply — at a specific price — of solar electricity over 20 years from a 20-MWp [1] solar farm being built by ABO Wind AG in France. The photovoltaic park will be in operation by early 2025. The contracted volumes will be used to cover part of the power needed for the new electric furnace for the manufacturing of luxury fragrance bottles and cosmetic jars. “This long-term power purchase agreement will enable us to produce sustainably for Luxury Differently,” emphasizes Benoit Marszalek, Pochet du Courval’s Director of Operations. Eager to source its supplies in France and as close as possible to its production, the Pochet Group said that similar projects will be announced in the coming months. As part of its decarbonization plan, the Pochet Group announced in 2022 the construction of a new furnace using Prium E-Melt cold vault fusion technology. The group has stated an objective to reduce CO2 emissions of its production by 50% by 2033. Decarbonization is one of the major challenges for the glass industry. Verescence also announced the construction of an electric furnace in 2025 in its Mers-les-Bains plant, in France. Other glassmakers, such as Bormioli Luigi or Heinz Glas, already have partially or fully electric solutions."

Sol de Janeiro continues to boost L’Occitane Group’s sales,"L’Occitane International maintained its sales momentum in the nine months ended 31 December 2023, with net sales reaching EUR 1,915.3 million, representing 18.9% growth at reported rates and 24.8% growth at constant rates. The growth was mainly driven by the continued surge in sales of Sol de Janeiro, the decent performance of Elemis and the steady growth of L’Occitane en Provence in China. In the three months ended 31 December 2023 (FY2024 Q3), net sales amounted to EUR 843.4 million, representing growth of 19.5% at reported rates and 24.6% at constant rates. In terms of performance by brands, L’Occitane en Provence’s growth slowed slightly to 2.6% at constant rates in the nine first months of fiscal year 2024 (-2.6% in reported rates). According to the group, this was the combined result of double-digit sales growth in China and strong holiday performances in the US and the UK, partially offset by a single-digit sales decline in EMEA and a low-teens percent sales decline in the travel retail channel. Thanks a solid performance in the UK and the US Elemis, returned to double-digit growth of 12.0% at constant rates. Sol de Janeiro maintained its stellar sales momentum with 199.1% growth at constant rates in FY2024 9M. The brand saw triple-digit growth across all geographies. Other brands (LimeLife, Melvita, Erborian, L’Occitane au Brésil and Grown Alchemist) together delivered a growth of 10.9% at constant rates for FY2024 9M. Erborian and L’Occitane au Brésil performed particularly well with 32.8% and 36.8% growth respectively at constant rates. In terms of regional performance, the Americas led the growth with 67.1% at constant rates in FY2024 9M, mainly driven by Sol de Janeiro in the US. “We delivered a decent holiday season, which enabled us to maintain our growth momentum and relative outperformance in the premium beauty market in China and other key markets. It was also pleasing to see Elemis return to growth in light of our ongoing premiumization strategy to support its long-term profitability,” said André Hoffmann, Vice-Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of L’Occitane. “We will continue to build on the accelerating growth of Sol de Janeiro as we steadily expand its product and category range, and the scale and reach of its distribution. We will also further build on the healthy growth of other brands, including our recently acquired luxury home fragrance brand, Dr. Vranjes Firenze, to round out our portfolio,” he concluded."
Texen launches an eye version of its Multi Intensity Brush,"The Texen Beauty Partners teams did not wait for the official launch, planned for the MakeUp in Los Angeles trade show in February!  The company previewed the prototype of their new Multi Intensity Brush for the eyes during the last edition of the Paris Packaging Week show, an exclusivity for existing clients and the media. The complexion version, known as the Multi Intensity Brush and whose launch was particularly acclaimed, received an IT Awards at MakeUp in Paris in 2023. As a reminder, the Multi Intensity Brush enables a full facial makeup with just one brush, thanks to a patented rotating mechanism that allows to adjust the length and density of the tuft. Texen is now rolling out the technology for the makeup of the eye area. In order to offer consumers all the essentials that are required for an eye makeup routine, the brush has a double tip. On one side, the modular tuft can be placed in variable positions in order to apply a neutral base or a shade on the eyelid, to widen the appearance of the eye area, darken or blur it ... On the other side, a tip fixed bevel has been integrated so as not to omit a key feature of any beauty routine for the eyes: the eyeliner. “This unique brush guarantees a makeup result that would have required five brushes of different shapes and densities,” highlights Nathasha Marquez, Marketing Manager at Texen Beauty Partners. Eventually, as far as development is concerned, the High Intensity Brush Eyes can be designed in any type of material — wood, plastic, or biosourced materials — it can also be decorated on demand and also sold in a custom pouch. In short, anything is possible!"

Coverpla and Estal seal a commercial partnership,"Coverpla strengthens its offer of ultra-personalized, ready-to-go solutions through a marketing and commercial partnership with Spanish company Estal. Estal offers extensive lines dedicated to fragrance, cosmetics and home fragrance. Its concepts are subsequently developed by a range of major European glassmakers. This offer is partially complementary to the one of Coverla, which has chosen to work with Estal to enhance its home fragrance collection with a range of diffusers in various sizes (from 100 to 750ml) and associated accessories. Thick-based candle jars with a premium feel complete the collection. As far as cosmetics are concerned, three new products are joining the Coverpla catalogue: two 50ml jars and a 30ml vial. And the fragrance offer is enhanced on the one hand with Estal’s “Doble Alto” concept, which combines the appearance of a heavy base in line with luxury codes with a range of models in lightweight glass (a 35% reduction in glass weight) with classic shapes. Finally, Coverpla is enhancing its green offer with three lightweight bottles. Bandeau, Tote and Cloche are based on Concept Bubble, with an indented base borrowed from that of champagne bottles, compensating for the reduced scale of lightweight bottles, that confer an identical format to a traditional flacon. These three designs are available in 30, 50 and 100ml formats with a choice of three different necks: FEA15, SNI 15 and flat necks for fragrance diffusers. They are compatible with all the caps in the Coverpla catalog. The products in the range are offered in pure, naturally colored glass or in amber glass. They are also available crafted from 100% recycled, non-sorted household waste. This type of glass varies in color, and sometimes presents other irregularities. Such a choice represents a strong environmental standpoint, a commitment to a “raw” product that consumers must accept or alter their perception of “imperfections.” Estal has asserted itself by offering this bold solution; Coverpla has chosen to open its catalog to the concept."
Wellness is Gen Z’s latest obsession,"Feeling better about yourself in mind and body is the key to being more confident, more successful, and better equipped to face a world in crisis. More than previous generations, Gen Zers seem to be obsessed with all things relating to well-being, or at least, things that could improve it. Such are the findings of the Future of Wellness report from McKinsey, surveying over 5,000 consumers in China, the UK and the USA. Respondents are generally inclined to take charge of their physical and mental health, and are turning to science-backed solutions to do so. Contrary to what you might think, it’s not older consumers who are driving the popularity of wellness activities, practices and other solutions, but younger people. The report reveals that Millennials and members of Generation Z spend more than their elders on wellness products and services. Appearance and overall health are among their top priorities, but they are also keen on products and services related to nutrition, fitness, mindfulness and sleep. Looking specifically at American consumers, it would seem that physical activity acts as a pressure release valve, or at least helps them feel good. More than half of American Gen Zers (56%) see fitness as a ""very high priority,"" compared to 40% of all American consumers. The youngest generations are also turning to preventive solutions, particularly to slow down the aging process. ""There are a bunch of possible reasons why Gen Z is so interested in health and wellness at such a young age. For one thing, Gen Z has more exposure and access to information about health and wellness at an earlier age than other generations have had .... It’s also possible that the Covid-19 pandemic — which catalyzed a global focus on health and wellness — coincided with Gen Z’s formative years. And to stave off loneliness, Gen Z is looking for friends in so-called third places, which often include gyms or fitness classes,"" the report suggests. According to the data presented by McKinsey, younger people’s attraction to activities and practices dedicated to their physical and mental well-being has already begun to transform offers in certain sectors. This is particularly true in the tourism sector, where establishments are adding wellness centers and gyms, as well as proposing new types of excursions or packages. This has been seen in recent months with new activities such as ’silent walking,’ ’quiet parks’ and sleep tourism. The emphasis on well-being, and more broadly on mental health, could also have consequences for the relationship between young people and the world of work. A recent survey conducted in several European countries showed that mental health was more important than career success in the eyes of Gen Z women."

Seppic enriches Alariane CV tests results with scalp care benefits,"Like other cosmetic ingredient manufacturers, Seppic is getting a closer look at the skinification of the hair care products market. Indeed, more and more consumers around the world have realized that healthy hair is directly linked to having a healthy scalp. According to Mintel, in China, over 90% of those who use hair products believe that scalp care can enhance their hair health. To meet this demand and offer a solution to protect the scalp against daily aggressions, Seppic is re-exploring the potential of Alariane CV [1], an anti-aging active ingredient of marine origin initially launched in 2008, in order to provide a double protective effect on the scalp: protection of hair follicles cells as well as protection of scalp lipids from exposome [2]. Alariane CV is an extract of Alaria esculenta, also known as the “Irish wakame”. It is a traditional food along the far northern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, eaten for its excellent health properties as well as for its binder/detoxifier effect against heavy metals [3]. Tests have been carried out to illustrate the effect of Alariane CV protection capacity against cadmium, a heavy metal present in overall pollution due to cigarette smoke or phosphate fertilizers for example. In contact with cadmium, the scalp is weakened and submitted to inflammation, and thus, hair follicles are no longer able to produce healthy hair. According to Seppic, the use of Alariane CV demonstrated, by in vitro protocols, a significant diminution of 27% of hair follicles inflammation compared to non-treated one, after cadmium stress. Microscopic observations of cells in presence of Alariane CV show an increase in their number and an improvement in their morphology, similar to cells not exposed to cadmium. Alariane CV has a protective action on the hair follicle against inflammation induced by cadmium, and helps to preserve scalp function and maintain healthy hair. The in vitro data have also shown the protection of lipids peroxidation after a UVB stress."
Yellow Wood Partners’ Suave Brands acquires ChapStick from Haleon,"Yellow Wood Partners, a Boston-based private equity firm focused on investing in consumer brands and companies, has announced that its portfolio company Suave Brands has signed a binding offer to acquire the ChapStick brand from consumer health company Haleon. The transaction is intended to close in the first half of 2024 upon completion of customary closing and regulatory approvals. ChapStick pioneered the lip care category in the 1880s with the launch of a now-iconic lip balm that made ChapStick a household name.

Jimmy Choo fragrances, now the Group’s top-selling brand, had more than EUR 200 million in sales, up 16%, driven by the established Jimmy Choo and Jimmy Choo Man lines, and above all the continuing international success of the I Want Choo and I Want Choo Forever lines, launched in 2021 and 2022. With sales also exceeding EUR 200 million, up 12%, Montblanc fragrances’ steady gains continued to be driven by the solidity of the Montblanc Legend franchise, the enduring strength of the Montblanc Explorer franchise, plus an additional boost from the launch of the Montblanc Explorer Platinum line at the beginning of the year. Nearly all regions reported growth, with the exception of the Middle East and Africa. With sales of EUR 323 million, up nearly 13%, North America’s strong momentum remains intact. “Despite an extremely complex global context in terms of geopolitics, the economy and also the supply chain, we had a very good year in 2023, significantly exceeding our initial forecasts. Our portfolio’s three top-selling brands posted double-digit growth based on annual sales now ranging between EUR 180 million and EUR 210 million. 2024 will be highlighted by the start of operations for the Lacoste brand.We are convinced of its significant potential and are extremely confident in our ability to establish its position as a major brand in our portfolio in the near future,” commented Philippe Benacin, Chairman and CEO of Interfparfums. “While H2 2023 gross margins will be to some extent affected by inflation of certain components, this impact should be largely offset by sales price increases introduced at the beginning of the year. By maintaining tight controls over all expenses, especially marketing and advertising, the operating margin for 2023 should exceed 19%,” added Philippe Santi, Executive Vice President."
Groupe Berkem extends its H2OLIXIR range of 100% natural floral waters,"The group specializing in bio-based chemistry has announced the extension of its 100% natural, 97.5% organic floral water range, H2OLIXIR, designed for the Health and Beauty industries. After having debuted its range with two solutions launched in March 2023, namely peppermint water and lemon balm water, Groupe Berkem is now launching two new products composed of plant extracts with natural qualities particularly sought after in the composition of many cosmetic products, namely: – Lavender water: features a soothing and antioxidant action that reduces discomfort, its properties can be used in a wide range of cosmetic applications, such as facial care and sensitive skincare, soothing skincare and the fight against premature skin aging;
– Thyme water: providing a wide range of benefits, from its antioxidant action to its purifying properties, it is used in facial care for combination, oily or acne-prone skin, as a purifying cleanser or as a repairing facial treatment and also purifies oily hair and cleanses the scalp. As with its two previous products, these new solutions have been designed by Groupe Berkem using a process known as desiccation, which involves drying plants to extract the water they contain, while preserving the benefits of the original plants. This method ensures that the best possible properties are drawn from the very heart of plant extracts to address the cosmetics market. Each floral water in the H2OLIXIR range is guaranteed 100% natural and 97.5% organic. All are upcycled, organically grown in France and certified COSMetic Organic and natural Standard - COSMOS (Organic and natural cosmetics). “The extension of our H2OLIXIR range is further proof of Groupe Berkem’s ability to innovate in a market where naturalness and performance are key themes. Thanks to these two new solutions, with their multiple applications and recognized virtues, we intend to address new, high value-added segments of the cosmetics market, while guaranteeing our customers their natural, organic properties and sourcing in France,” said Eric Moussu, Vice President of Sales of Groupe Berkem."
Flock Box: A zero plastic and fully recyclable premium gift box,"Developed by four companies – Holmen Iggesund, Krekelberg, Inmaco Solutions and Van de Velde Packaging Group – in a collaborative approach, the Flock Box is a new packaging concept that combines natural fibre flocking technology with paperboard to create a fully recyclable premium gift box. A plastic-free packaging concept, the Flock Box consists of an embossed outer box and an inner tray with tailored cavities of various shapes and forms which can be used to present different items. The insert’s luxurious look and feel have been created with flocking technology, which uses static electric currents to make fibres stand up and resemble a velvet-like material. “The Flock Box has been enabled by the development of Holmen Iggesund’s highly formable paperboard Inverform, which has unique characteristics that allow it to be press-formed in the required shapes,” says Per Berglund, Head of Formables at Holmen Iggesund. For this joint project, the Dutch company Krekelberg, which has been manufacturing flocked materials since 1948, has flocked Inverform with cellulose fibres, adding a high luxury feel to the board. The fibres can be coloured in any specific shade required. Inmaco Solutions, a Dutch machine builder, made the tools to press-form the flocked Inverform inserts for the Flock Box. In addition, Van de Velde Packaging Group has created the outer Flock Box packaging from Holmen Iggesund’s Invercote DUO paperboard, and die-cut the top part of the inserts made from Inverform. The gift box surface was treated to emphasise the embossing and luxury feel of the gift box. “We are seeing more and more conscious luxury brands wanting to replace plastic with fibre-based solutions. The Flock Box is made of board and fibres that are 100% recyclable in the existing paper collection stream, contributing directly to a circular packaging ecosystem. Flocked fibre-based inlays could replace large quantities of plastic inlays,” highlights Berglund. The Flock Box is made from paperboards supplied by Holmen Iggesund from sustainably managed forests. The paperboards consist of fresh wood fibres, a renewable raw material well suited for recycling. The outer box is made from Invercote DUO, which has printing surfaces that enable optimal reproduction of the most sophisticated printing images. The inner tray is made from Inverform, a paperboard with high stiffness designed for stable pressed and folded trays with high visual appeal."

Clarins and Albéa Tubes partner for lighter samples with recycled plastic,"Clarins is upgrading its range of sample tubes with EcoLittle Top, the latest addition to the EcoTop range from Albéa Tubes. This new flip-top closure system, adapted to the sample format, responds to the triple CSR challenge of weight reduction, recyclability, and the use of recycled materials. Thanks to the removal of one component, EcoLittle Top offers a 47% weight reduction on the complete tube. In line with Clarins’ and Albéa Tubes’ commitment to circular economy, the tube incorporates 45% recycled material, thanks to the Albéa Tubes’ PCR Max range. This PCR PE solution combined with EcoLittle Top in HDPE is therefore mono-material, making it recyclable in HDPE streams. The incorporation of recycled plastic reduces the amount of virgin plastic used to produce the tubes. “This innovation is the result of two years of close collaboration between our two teams,” says Isabelle Séry, Sales Director at Albéa Tubes. “Clarins’ and Albéa Tubes’ CSR commitments and premium quality requirements were at the heart of product development. EcoLittle Top is a further consolidation of our CSR roadmap."" ""We view all our innovations through the prism of sustainability, so it was natural for us to turn to Albéa Tubes for our samples. EcoLittle Top will be used for most Clarins ranges (Skincare and Make-up), with very few exceptions. We’re proud of this innovation, which is another step towards a more responsible industry,"" adds Philippe Briand, Director of Packaging Design, Direct Purchasing & Launch Coordination for Clarins."
’Soap nails’ are taking over as the minimalist manicure of the moment,"After the ’no make-up’ trend in beauty and the ’quiet luxury’ aesthetic in fashion, here come ’soap nails.’ Going against the grain of the maximalist trends often highlighted in this sector, nails in turn are embracing a certain minimalism — more natural and chic than ever — emphasizing care over colour and superfluous details. This incoming trend has been on the rise since the beginning of the year. While red, chrome or 3D nails remain among the main nail trends forecasted in 2024, more minimalist inspirations also appeal to many fans. Following in the footsteps of the fashion world, which propelled quiet luxury to the top of the trend list in 2023, or the rise of ’no make-up’ beauty looks, nail art enthusiasts are now turning to more discreet manicures. And it looks as if they’ve found just what they’re looking for in ’soap nails’. The idea is to craft a minimalist manicure on perfectly groomed nails, with an ultra-shiny, glossy, wet-look finish. The trend is already attracting a huge following, and is spreading at lightning speed on social networks — as in real life. On TikTok, the hashtag has already racked up several million views, even though the phenomenon is still in its infancy. The social network is home to a multitude of tutorials featuring these soapy, super-shiny nails. And, whether they’re milky white or pale pink, above all, they’re always perfectly manicured. In fact, this is the very essence of ’soap nails’, whose almost ’naked’ finish contrasts with the work they actually require in terms of care and prep. In this respect, nails are echoing skincare, which is gradually taking over from complex, highly crafted makeup looks. So, how do you actually get ’soap nails?’ While there’s no specific technique, it goes without saying that this manicure requires a glossy varnish, a top coat and all the tools you need to push back cuticles, as well as file, polish, smooth and shape your nails to achieve a flawless manicure. Once all that preparation is done, simply apply the gloss varnish — some opt for a transparent pink, others a milky white — then finish off with a glossy top coat. That’s all there is to it! Be careful, though: a perfect manicure also means a perfect hand care. Remember to exfoliate and moisturize your hands for ideal results."
Eurazeo takes minority stake in niche fragrance brand Ex Nihilo,"Investment group Eurazeo spent about EUR 25 million to become a minority shareholder in Ex Nihilo Paris, a perfume brand created in 2013 by Sylvie Loday, Olivier Royère and Benoît Verdier, the majority owners. The brand has earned global recognition for its iconic and widely successful Fleur Narcotique perfume. Ex Nihilo leverages technology through its “Osmologue” machine – a high-precision fragrance blending system – to offer personalization services to customers allowing them to customize existing fragrances. The House also offers collectible pieces and unique fragrances on demand. Since the opening of its first boutique in Paris, at 352 rue Saint-Honoré, Ex Nihilo has experienced rapid growth, reaching a global customer base through a combination of digital and physical channels, in particular in prestige department stores such as Harrods, Bergdorf Goodman, Galeries Lafayette, and Saks Fifth Avenue, complemented by selective partnerships with specialty stores, niche perfumery shops. In addition, its network of seven flagship stores serves as hubs for discovery and experimentation with personalized services. The brand has achieved a turnover of more than 50 million euros. Eurazeo is interested in the strong potential of Ex Nihilo on global markets. After the Middle East, the brand aims to accelerate its expansion in North America and Asia. ""We have targeted the niche fragrance space given trends towards premiumization driven by consumer aspiration for uniqueness and experiences. Ex Nihilo – through its high-quality products, brand authenticity and selective distribution – is ideally positioned to benefit from the current market momentum,"" said Laurent Droin, Managing Director of Eurazeo, Brands."
Beautycounter founder Gregg Renfrew is back at the helm the brand,"Gregg Renfrew, Beautycounter’s founder, will return to the brand she founded in 2013 and will officially assume the role of Chief Executive Officer as of February 1st. Renfrew launched Beautycounter in 2013, after spending two years preparing its creation, in particular through a list of ingredients that she deemed harmful and potentially harmful and that the Santa Monica, CA-based brand would never use in its formulations. Under her leadership, Beautycounter grew as pioneer of the clean beauty movement and became an iconic brand of the so-called ‘clean beauty’ movement in the United States, pushing other brands to begin taking steps to increase their own safety standards and transparency. Beautycounter was also involved in several advocacy actions to strengthen the cosmetic legislation in the U.S. or to promote a clear definition of what are ""natural cosmetics"". In 2021, she decided it was time to sell the brand and signed a deal with US capital-investment group Carlyle, which acquired the majority stake of Beautycounter in a transaction valuing it at USD 1 billion. While initial plan was for her to stay on as CEO, she stepped down in 2022 and Marc Rey, formerly the head of Shiseido Americas, was brought on as CEO. The Carlyle Group aimed to increase the brand footprint through an omnichannel business model. Beautycounter thus partnered with beauty retailer Ulta to be available on Ulta.com and in Ulta Beauty stores across the U.S. In addition to Ulta Beauty, Beautycounter intended to continue selling through its own DTC e-commerce site, its network of 45,000 direct sellers in the United States and Canada, and its two standalone stores in New York City and Denver, Colorado. However, Rey departed the company a year later and was replaced by Board Director Mindy Mackenzie as Interim Chief Executive Officer. And eventually, Carlyle decided it was time for Renfrew to return as CEO while Mackenzie stay as a member of the Board of Directors. ""Without question, Beautycounter’s greatest opportunities are ahead of us. Consumers are demanding, now more than ever, the things that we have brought to the industry from the very beginning: transparency, health & safety for people and the environment, innovative products, an engaged community and a business that is much more than its bottom line. Who we are, and the work we do, truly matters to so many people. I’m energized to build on our history of disrupting to create a movement for change and a higher industry standard,"" Renfrew said in a statement. ""I am looking forward to getting back to working with the team (including some familiar faces joining me again). It’s not going to just be business as usual, and I’m looking forward to raising the bar even higher for our company and the industry at large,” she continued."

Sisley calls on Lumson for the airless bottle of Supremÿa La Nuit,"Sisley’s latest innovation, Supremÿa La Nuit, The Supreme Anti-Ageing Skin Care, was launched in September 2023, after 15 years of research. Designed with chronobiology in mind, the treatment works during the night, a crucial time for skin regeneration. According the brand, the product unlocks every ounce of the skin’s regenerative power to help it recover from daily damage sustained during the day, thanks to state-of-the-art active ingredients that target 25 anti-ageing markers for immediate and long-term results. Soft and gentle, its lightweight, fluid texture blends quickly into the skin for a unique sensory experience and scented with the line’s signature floral notes. For this precious formula, Sisley has chosen to call on Lumson’s skills in airless technologies. The Italian packaging supplier has developed for the brand a custom airless glass bottle adorned with a series of high-end details and precious finishes. Gold reigns supreme: refined and sophisticated, with metallic glares that highlights the lines of the bottle. The gold pump and the overcap covered in brushed gold aluminium with debossed logo give the bottle an elegant allure. The “mirror-effect” inner lacquering combined with an external lacquering in shaded semi-transparent shiny gold with UV screen printing on the outside round off the design. According to Lumson, the airless pouch system keeps the formula totally intact and protects it from any external contamination. After use, the glass can be separated from the other components and recycled appropriately."

TNT’s patented removable stainless-steel ball is held by magnetization. It offers unlimited fluid movement, as well as a cold effect contact surface that is increased by 300% compared to a classic roll-on applicator.

After use, the removable ball of the applicator can be completely cleaned or placed in the freezer for added benefit. Replacing the refill is easy with the key provided, also produced by TNT Group. “After seeing the concept of the removable rollerball I was immediately inspired and designed a refillable skincare system in our unique brand aesthetic incorporating this patented rollerball,” said Angela Piner, Chief Design Officer at Westman Atelier. The Skin Activator Rollerball includes two 20ml serum refill bottles, one of which comes pre-loaded into the device. The refill bottles are made of tubular glass, custom tactile matte paint finishing then screen printed.

"TikTok is driving Gen Z spending trends, especially among women","The popularity of TikTok among Generation Z women is proving to be a driver of consumer trends and financial behavior. The app, popular for its short videos, captures the attention of its female audience in particular, with a notable impact on purchasing decisions. In the United States, Generation Z women are more likely to use TikTok. Three quarters spend time on the app, compared with 62% of men of the same age. This difference may explain why young women are driving trends in purchasing and financial behavior. It may also explain why the consumption patterns of Gen Z women are more likely to be influenced by TikTok. According to a survey conducted by Morning Consult, from November 2 to 8, 2022, among a sample of 1,000 Generation Z Americans aged 13 to 25, 53% of women in this age bracket buy beauty products featured on TikTok, versus 13% of men. Women are the biggest spenders on fashion accessories, jewelry and watches, at 35% versus 21% of men, as well as home decor (26% versus 17%), clothing (49% versus 41%) and shoes (34% versus 32%). Men are more keen on books and games (48% vs. 38%), electronics (30% vs. 19%) and sports equipment (16% vs. 15%). Morning Consult analyst, Ellyn Briggs, points out that TikTok, as a platform centering around Gen Z women, defines what is considered ""trendy"" on the internet. This effect is reinforced by influencers who create aspirational content, notably through ""haul"" videos showing recent purchases, often sponsored by brands. However, this display of wealth can be misleading. Although these influencers are roughly the same age as their audience, their often high incomes don’t reflect the financial reality of the majority of their followers. Research from LendingTree reveals that Gen Z’s non-mortgage debt almost doubled between March 2021 and the first quarter of 2023. On average, young consumers accumulated over US$21,000 in debt, an increase of US$10,797 in two years. While auto and student loans account for nearly 80% of their debt, personal loans and credit card balances have risen sharply since 2021 (+207.4% and +174% respectively)."

Water-based Inner lacquering according to Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie,"At Luxe Pack Monaco last October, Stoelzle Masnières has introduced its new water-based inner lacquering technique. To ensure thorough coverage, accommodating the bottle’s specific volume and glass density, the inner lacquering coats the bottle’s interior. Since there is a direct contact with the liquid product inside, the glassmaker creates a unique formulation that prevents any risk of fragrance contamination, even with alcohol-containing products, eliminating the need for an internal pocket. “The lacquer’s formulation is meticulously crafted by our in-house team, allowing for customization to meet specific customer requirements. Beyond being water-based, the lacquer is free from CMRs (carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to reproduction), SVHCs (substances of very high concern), and migrating pigments, ensuring product integrity. This commitment to quality aligns with Stoelzle’s eco-friendly principles and complies with California Proposition 65 safety standards,” says the company. The inner lacquering solution provided by Stoelzle Masnières offers design versatility with a range of tones, from translucent to opaque. Ongoing research and development efforts aim to expand the colour palette further, ensuring precision in each shade. However, a dedicated development remains necessary for the development of specific shades. “This technique seamlessly complements various bottle shapes and sizes, making it a versatile addition to glass bottle decoration. It harmonizes well with other decoration methods, such as screen printing, hot stamping, digital printing, and embossing, typically applied externally,” concludes Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie."

Wella celebrates its third year as an independent company,"Wella Company has marked its third year as an independent company, demonstrating broad-based growth balanced across brands, categories and geographies. The company achieved high single-digit growth in constant currency in Fiscal Year 2023, which closed at the end of June, cementing its foothold as one of the fastest-growing companies in the hair and nail sector. Wella Company’s portfolio of professional and retail hair, nail, and beauty tech brands includes Wella Professionals, O·P·I, ghd, Briogeo, Nioxin, Sebastian Professional, and Clairol. Since its inception in 2020, when Coty sold it to KKR, Wella Company has reported year-over-year growth in both developed and emerging markets.

Squalene market driven by demand from Asia-Pacific and the cosmetic industry,"The global squalene market is expected projected to reach USD 202 million by 2028, at a CAGR of 6.3%, between 2023 and 2028, according to MarketsandMarkets’ latest report [1]. Its size was estimated at USD 141 million in 2022. Squalene is a natural emollient and moisturiser that is used in various end-use industries including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food and others. As a result of its striking resemblance to the skin’s natural sebum, it makes a fantastic ingredient for skincare products. It aids in moisture retention, avoiding dryness and keeping the suppleness of skin. The cosmetics segment is estimated to be the largest end-use industry of the squalene market during the forecast period. Squalene has antioxidant properties, which can help protect the skin from oxidative stress and free radical damage. This makes it a valuable ingredient in anti-aging skincare products, as it can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Increasing demand for cosmetic products specially skin and hair care products is expected to fuel the demand for squalene in cosmetics end-use industry. Europe accounted for the largest market share for squalene, in terms of value, in 2022, with North America being the second-largest market. However, Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing market over the period, with a rising demand from the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. In the past, the traditional source of squalene, shark liver oil, has faced restrictions due to concerns about overfishing and the conservation of shark populations. Some regions have imposed bans or limitations on the extraction of squalene from shark liver oil. Several regulatory bodies have imposed restrictions such as fixed quotas for shark fishing, which, in turn, has resulted in supply shortage of shark liver and, thereby squalene. These restrictions are expected to remain strictly enforced during the forecast period. As a consequence, the offer of vegetable squalene has grown steadily, however, according to the report, vegetable oils only contain very low squalene quantities and tons of olives and amaranth are therefore required to produce a small quantity of squalene. This has led to high squalene retail prices and creates new opportunity for the players to come up with new technologies to develop squalene from alternative sources. Sugarcane and other sugar-containing biomaterials are identified as the sources of producing squalane (hydrogenated squalene). An environmentally friendly substitute for conventional sources of squalene is biosynthetic squalene. The need for materials obtained responsibly has increased as environmental and social issues become more prominent. Squalene can be produced by biosynthesis without having an adverse effect on the environment. All these factors are expected to drive the demand for biosynthetic sourced squalene during the forecast period. In addition, biosynthetic production allows for better control over the quality and purity of squalene. Manufacturers can ensure that the product meets specific quality standards, making it attractive to industries like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals."
Arcade Beauty acquires Orlandi’s scented strip business TruEssence,"The NYC-headquartered manufacturer specialising in sampling, small-size and turn key beauty solutions has acquired the TruEssence scented strips product line from Orlandi.

As a result, on January 1, 2024, Orlandi will no longer manufacture or sell TruEssence and will be exiting the category of scented strips while maintaining its other sampling product offerings. Arcade Beauty already manufactures scented strips under the trademark ScentStrip, a business the company pioneered in 1979. According to the company, the technology remains “the most cost-effective way to deliver a quality rendition of fine fragrance.” Scented strips have a multifaceted application strategy, “where brands can showcase fine fragrance in magazines, catalog inserts, direct mail and at retail,” claimed Arcade. ""We are excited that we were able to come to this arrangement with Orlandi,"" said Jorge Garcia, Arcade Beauty’s Executive Vice President and CFO. ""This acquisition creates a necessary synergy that will protect this category for our customer base in the years to come."" ""We see this divesture as a win-win for Orlandi, our customers and the beauty industry as a whole,"" said Sven Dobler, CEO of Orlandi. ""Given the decline in magazine print volumes, the scented strip business had structural overcapacity. This consolidation will correct this trend and will secure the long-term availability of this sampling technology for our common customers in the future."" Simultaneously, Arcade Beauty has entered into a strategic Lease Agreement for the facility located at 7026 Discovery Drive, Chattanooga, Tennessee, to consolidate and relocate its existing laboratory and production processes for scented strips and label technologies.

Gerresheimer wants to supply its German sites with green electricity,"The German manufacturer of glass and plastic packaging solutions for the pharma, biotech, and cosmetics industries, has signed a long-term electricity supply agreement with wind turbine operator company PNE AG. The power purchase agreement, which covers around 35 GWh of wind power per year, will enable Gerresheimer to reduce its CO2 emissions by around 18,000 tons each year starting in 2024 [1]. As a result of the deal, the company will also further increase green power as a share of the energy supplied to its German production sites. Gerresheimer aims to switch its entire electricity supply to renewable sources by 2030. “The power purchase agreement with PNE AG is another important building block in expanding green power as a share of the supply of energy to our German locations,” says Dietmar Siemssen, CEO of Gerresheimer AG. “EcoDesign, green energy, and the use of the latest production technology are the key factors for us in reducing our CO2 emissions by 50 % by 2030.” “We are seeing growing interest from industrial companies in power purchase agreements with higher volumes and longer terms,” adds Markus Lesser, CEO of PNE AG. “Companies like Gerresheimer are thus actively shaping their own energy transition and securing long-term capacities for clean electricity at attractive conditions in a volatile market environment.” Gerresheimer’s glass production locations in Essen, Lohr, and Tettau, which are particularly energy-intensive, will benefit from the power purchase agreement on a priority base. However, the medical systems’ production sites in Bünde, Pfreimd, and Wackersdorf are set to benefit as well. Gerresheimer expects that, combined with other planned projects, the newly signed agreement will push green electricity as a share of the power supplied to production sites worldwide to over 50% by the end of 2024. In June 2023, Gerresheimer signed a 32 GWh power purchase agreement with the operator of a hybrid wind and solar farm in India, which will supply electricity to the production site in Kosamba."
"Metsä Board to expand folding boxboard capacity in Husum, Sweden","The Finnish maker of pulp and paperboard is starting the expansion of its folding boxboard production capacity at its Husum mill in Sweden. “With the modernisation of the board machine 1 (BM1), the annual production capacity of folding boxboard (FBB) will be increased by 200,000 tons to reach 600,000 tons. This will make the Husum BM1 the largest, and most modern, paperboard machine in Europe and further strengthen Metsä Board’s position as the leading European supplier of folding boxboards,” said the company in a statement.

Lessonia invests in a new dry granulation technology,"Specialized from its creation in the manufacture of powder cosmetic ingredients (exfoliants, fine powders, active ingredients, extracts...), Lessonia has acquired a renowned expertise in this area, from grinding and sieving to blending and sterilizing powders. Gradually, the French manufacturer has also developed expertise in dry cosmetic formulation (clay masks, peel-offs, scrubs, cleansing powders...). However, formulating this kind of dry cosmetic requires using and mixing fine powder ingredients with different particle sizes leading to untangling, flow problems and powder safety issues (dust). In order to improve powder flowability and avoid dust, Lessonia decided to innovate in a dry granulation technology and has acquired a new production line comprising a roller compactor, granulator and sieve. From a fine powder, the aim is to obtain a larger and more homogeneous granulometry, optimized to ensure good powder flow. “By compacting a fine powder, we obtain a fine tablet which is then grinded and sieved to obtain the desired particle size,” the company explains.

"Mibelle launches RejuveNAD, a natural NAD+ booster for skin care","Mibelle Biochemistry has developed a holistic solution to increase NAD+ levels in the skin through cosmetic applications. NAD+ is the oxidized form of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a coenzyme central to metabolism. NAD+ plays a crucial role in various cellular processes and has received significant attention in anti-aging supplements. “However, the use of NAD+ in cosmetics failed so far, as the molecule has a very poor stability in formulations and cannot be taken up into skin cells,” said Mibelle in statement. To overcome this hurdle, the Swiss manufacturer has created RejuveNAD [1], a natural active ingredient that stimulates the endogenous regeneration of NAD+ by activating the enzyme NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, formerly known as pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor 1). According to Mibelle, RejuveNAD “naturally boosts the longevity molecule NAD+ to optimize cellular processes.” The new active ingredient is sourced from sustainably cultivated sunflower sprouts through indoor farming. Clinical studies show that RejuveNAD can counteract at least five hallmarks of aging in the skin simultaneously: mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, loss of proteostasis, epigenetic alteration and genomic instability. As a result, according to Mibelle, the skin looks eight years younger in just 42 days."

Romania is introducing a deposit-refund scheme for plastic bottles,"With Europeans generating packaging waste on an unprecedented scale, the roll-out of plastic deposit-refund schemes is gathering pace across Europe. The latest country to adopt this kind of measure is Romania, which will refund EUR 0.10 for each bottle returned. The day-to-day system that drives the ecological transition and is perfectly in tune with the codes of the circular economy. It involves a deposit-refund scheme for recyclable plastic. In this case, people will receive the equivalent of €0.10 for each plastic bottle returned. The scheme is due to officially launch on November 30. The launch of the RetuRO program is already a victory in itself, since the project has been repeatedly postponed due to pressure from retailers, who were evidently not ready to integrate the process into their operations. Initially, it was due to be rolled out from January 2021, before being postponed until October 1, 2022. Deposit-refund schemes are not new, but they are on the rise in Europe. Plastic bottles have been returnable in Sweden since 1994, while Norway followed suit in 1999 for plastic and aluminum packaging. Germany, for its part, can pride itself on being top of the class, with its deposit system dedicated to all reusable beverage containers rolled out all the way back in 1990, before being bolstered in 2003 by an initiative integrating all single-use containers, such as yogurt pots. The Netherlands adopted a deposit-refund system in 2004, but waited until 2021 to include plastic containers of less than one liter, paying an average of €0.15 for each bottle returned. In 2005, a deposit system was rolled out in Estonia, where €0.10 is returned for each bottle. In the Baltic countries, Lithuania set an example in 2016 when it introduced this kind of scheme, also requiring companies to pay a ""pollution"" tax when less than 95% of their plastic bottles are recycled. In 2022, Slovakia, Latvia and Malta joined the gradual roll-out of the deposit-refund system across Europe."

A panel discussion was held to better understand skin conditions prevalent in India and the role of ceramides in protecting the skin barrier and improving overall skin health. “We are excited to launch the L’Oréal Dermatological Beauty division in India, starting with CeraVe, one of the most trusted skincare brands globally. According to a study conducted by the Indian Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, we deducted that India has one of the lowest ratios of dermatologists to consumers in the world, and we believe that consumers deserve to have access to dermatological solutions that are effective and safe. We observed an increasing demand among consumers for skincare that is backed by science and recommended by healthcare professionals. With this launch, we aim to bridge this gap and meet the needs of our consumers, by providing access to expert dermatological care and effective skincare solutions,” said Rami Itani, Director – L’Oréal Dermatological Beauty, L’Oréal India at the launch event. In India, CeraVe is available in dermatology clinics, chemist stores, e-pharmacies, and on Nykaa under the dermatological banner."

Travel retail : Dufry changes name to Avolta,"Duty-free store specialist Dufry has changed its name and is now called Avolta. Shareholders approved this change in the company name during an extraordinary general assembly on November 3. The move follows the merger with Italy’s Autogrill. Moving forward, all corporate communications of the former Dufry and Autogrill groups will transition to the Avolta brand family. However, consumer-facing brands, including consumer-facing elements of corporate brands, like Dufry, Autogrill, Hudson and World Duty Free, to name a few, will continue to operate as previously, enjoying their familiarity with travellers. On November 2, the group delivered a strong set of quarter three 2023 (+16.0% organic growth) and nine months 2023 numbers. “Should our current performance continue through the last quarter, we project a full year 2023 organic growth of around 20% versus the previous year turnover,” said Xavier Rossinyol, CEO of Dufry Group. However, due to unfavourable currency movements, the reported growth in Swiss Francs for the fiscal year 2023 is expected to be around 15% versus the previous year."

World’s available CO2 ’budget’ for 1.5C smaller than thought: study,"The amount of CO2 the world can emit and still limit warming to 1.5C is much smaller than previously thought and could be used up in six years at current pollution levels, according to research published on October 30, 2023 [1]. Scientists said the revised ""carbon budget"" meant that humanity was now more likely than not to blow past the Paris Agreement’s safer temperature threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius since the preindustrial era. ""The window to avoid 1.5 degrees of warming is shrinking, both because we continue to emit and because of our improved understanding of atmospheric physics,"" said lead author Robin Lamboll, of Imperial College London. But with climate impacts magnifying as warming increases, the researchers stressed that the findings make every fraction of a degree worth fighting for. ""It’s not that the fight against climate change will be lost after six years,"" Lamboll said, adding however that if there was not a ""strong downward trajectory"" by then, it would be too late for that 1.5 degree limit. The most recent reports from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said to keep 1.5C in play the world had a carbon budget of some 500 gigatons, from 2020, warning that emissions would need to be slashed in half by 2030. This new assessment, which focuses on the main greenhouse gas CO2, calculated that the budget has now dwindled to 250 gigatons, measured from the beginning of 2023. The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, was presented as an update to the IPCC figures, incorporating new expectations for the role of other pollutants, particularly the cooling impacts of aerosols — emitted with planet-heating fossil fuels. Meanwhile emissions remain stubbornly high, despite a slight dip at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and are around 40 gigatons a year. The findings come a month ahead of crucial UN climate negotiations in the United Arab Emirates, tasked with salvaging the Paris deal goals after the latest round of reports from the IPCC made clear that the world was far off track. Co-author Joeri Rogelj, also of Imperial College London, said that high-likelihood options for limiting warming to 1.5C — 50 percent or better — ""are gone"". ""That doesn’t mean that we’re spinning out of control to three or four degrees, but it does mean that the best estimates suggest that we will be above 1.5 of global warming,"" he said. Earth’s average temperature has already risen nearly 1.2C, causing a cascade of deadly and costly weather extremes. While temperatures this year, boosted by the El Niño weather phenomenon, could average out at 1.5C, the Paris target is measured over a period of decades. The IPCC has said 1.5C could be passed by the mid-2030s, with scientists warning this could trigger dangerous tipping points in Earth’s fragile life support systems. The Paris deal’s main target was to limit warming to ""well below"" 2C, but with greenhouse gas emissions still at record highs the world is currently on a path to warm 2.4C or more by the end of the century. Lamboll said the researchers also calculated for 2C as a ""last resort"" and found the budget for a 50 percent chance of limiting warming to this threshold was 1,220 gigatons. To improve the odds to 90 percent, the budget falls to 500 gigatons, or around 12 years at current emissions. The study should make ""uncomfortable reading"" for policymakers, said a commentary published in Nature Climate Change by Benjamin Sanderson at Norway’s Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research, who was not involved in the research. He said the new carbon budget would mean the world would need to reach ""net zero"" emissions by 2034, not in the middle of the century as is envisaged in climate policies across the world. Rogelj said the IPCC had already acknowledged uncertainties in calculating the remaining carbon budget and had given a one in three chance it could be as low as the latest study suggests. ""A one in three chance is far from unexpected, it’s like playing Russian roulette with two bullets. Few people will be surprised if someone gets shot with such odds,"" he said."
Unilever Ventures makes first foray into fragrance with The 7 Virtues,"Unilever Ventures, the venture capital arm of the Unilever Group, has joined forces with True Beauty Ventures, a US based investment firm specializing in scaling beauty and wellness brands to make their first foray into the fragrance category. The two companies have acquired minority stakes in the Canadian clean perfumery brand The 7 Virtues. Founded in 2010 by entrepreneur, author and activist Barb Stegemann, the brand pioneered the clean and sustainably sourced fragrance category. The concept took inspiration from her best-selling book: The 7 Virtues of a Philosopher Queen – a woman’s guide to living and leading in an illogical world, which was published in 2008. The 7 Virtues crafts perfumes with a high 22% fragrance oil concentration and based on aromatherapy principles. The brand’s mantra is Make Perfume Not War, and they do this by advancing period equity in North America and globally. The company is pending B-Corp certification. The 7 Virtues’ fragrance collection is available exclusively on the brand’s website and at Sephora in 18 countries including Canada, US, UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Their fragrance ingredients are sustainably sourced from around the world. The brand has earned the “Clean + Planet Positive” seal from Sephora, awarded only to the most ambitious clean and planet-positive brands. The 7 Virtues global year-on-year sales have grown by more than 80% in FY 2023. ""The 7 Virtues has cracked the code on creating long-lasting, perfumes using sustainable ingredients that their loyal customers love, along with their empowering and authentic story,""  says Anna Ohlsson-Baskerville, Partner at Unilever Ventures. ""Driven by its philosophy, The 7 Virtues is elevating from an exciting indie brand to a legacy brand and we’re delighted to be a part of its growth journey."" The joint investment from Unilever Ventures and True Beauty Ventures will equip The 7 Virtues with the resources to open a New York office to bolster their team and magnify its global expansion with Sephora to create significant inventory to keep up with the rapid demand. The brand also plans to open a ""Maison"" in Nova Scotia, Canada, where clients can come visit and create their own bespoke perfume with classics like Vanilla Woods and Cherry Ambition. ""When an indie brand like The 7 Virtues outpaces brands with million dollar budgets, they prove the revenue potential is explosive with the right type of support,” added Rich Gersten, True Beauty Ventures Co-Founder and Partner. Barb Stegemann, the brand’s fouder, remains the majority shareholder."
FDA proposes ban on hair relaxers containing formaldehyde,"In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing a ban on using formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals as an ingredient in hair smoothing or hair straightening products. Already banned in the European Union (Regulation (EC) 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Annex II) and limited to 0.01% in Canada (Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist – Health Canada) in hair straightening products, inhalation of formaldehyde [1] in the form of vapor when occur when the products are heated (by a hair dryer or flat iron, for example). It is therefore suspected to cause respiratory problems and to be linked to an increased risk of certain cancers. “Use of hair smoothing products containing formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals is linked to short-term adverse health effects, such as sensitization reactions and breathing problems, and long-term adverse health effects, including an increased risk of certain cancers,” said the FDA in the proposed rule. Last year, a research by the US National Institute of Health (NIH) found a link between the use of hair straightening products and a higher uterine cancer risk, with Black women potentially more affected due to higher use. The proposed ban is the first step of the regulatory process. The FDA will now receive public comments on it, and after reviewing those comments, the agency will decide whether further action is needed. The FDA currently discourages consumers from using hair-straightening products that contain formaldehyde and similar ingredients. “Breathing in formaldehyde gas can be harmful and cause immediate reactions ranging from irritation of the eyes and throat to coughing, wheezing, or chest pain to chronic or long-term problems such as more frequent headaches, asthma, skin irritation, and allergic reactions, and possibly cancer,” the agency wrote in a fact sheet published on its website."
Positive Plastics teams up with Roctool to launch a“Positive Surfaces” kit,"Launched by three material experts — Efrat Friedland, Erik Moth-Müller, and Markus Paloheimo — Positive Plastics aims to provide designers, engineers, and product managers a more accepting outlook on plastics. The agency identify and selects the plastic resins and compounds that address the transition of products towards sustainability and circularity. Two years ago, at Fakuma 2021, Positive Plastics launched their first kit, which they annually refresh with innovative plastics. These plastics are suitable for injection moulding to produce high-quality products, such as consumer electronics, home appliances, sports goods, automotive interiors, accessories, etc. At the K2022 they launched their second kit, and now, it is time for the third kit, which was presented at the Fakuma trade show, held on 17-21 in Friedrichshafen, Germany, on the booths of Sabic, Mocom, Poracom and Group Pernoud. For this latest edition, the Positive Plastics team partnered with Roctool to best display the various surface qualities and textures alongside some mechanical properties of the selected materials. This is how was created the Positive Surfaces kit, showcasing materials that are all 100% post-consumer, mechanically recycled grades: PP, PET, ABS, PC/ABS and ABS with glass fibres. Markus Paloheimo, co-founder of Positive Plastics, designed the sample and Group Pernoud performed the mould modifications while Oerlikon Balzers provided the hot runners. Roctool applied their induction moulding Heat and Cool technology to improve the aesthetics of the recycled plastics. ""I simply love the idea behind Positive Plastics. The kit is an excellent tool for any designer who wants to create more sustainable products. But, I firmly believe that the material is not the only parameter to consider. What about the process? How far can we increase the perceived quality of those materials? How can we improve the look and feel of recycled materials without having to coat them? I was missing this perspective, so I offered Positive Plastics to collaborate and investigate this direction,"" said Roctool’s CEO, Mathieu Boulanger. “We are thrilled to equip designers with additional knowhow and tools to create beautiful and circular products”, added Efrat Friedland, co-founder of Positive Plastics. “Roctool is a proven moulding creation of advanced surfaces, from ultra gloss finishes to very low matte levels. Aside from aesthetic advantages, brands also have a chance to eliminate secondary processes and, as a result, reduce production costs. The induction process improves the overall process, with defects elimination, flow improvement and, depending on the resin grade, cycle time reduction. This is a real chance to bring recyclates to light and boost consumer adoption.”"

’Latex lips’ outshine the no-makeup look with glamorous gloss,"After ‘cherry makeup’ or ‘pumpkin spice makeup’, as here comes a bolder beauty look by the name of ’latex lips.’ By bringing glossy lips back into fashion, while ramping up shine to the max, the new trend could outshine the natural or even no-makeup looks that have been riding high since the Covid-19 pandemic. With their catchy name, ‘latex lips’ spell the return of maximum shine, whatever the shade chosen, for a glossy, almost lacquer-like finish. The idea is to recreate the high-shine effect of latex by using very specific products, including gloss, which is poised to make a comeback. As far as trends go, latex lips didn’t actually emerge this fall, with some videos dating back several months on the TikTok social network. But it’s clear that the look has been gaining renewed interest since the start of the fall. And this could well intensify in the run-up to the festive season due to the extravagance and audacity synonymous with this colourful and glamorous period. Practically, it’s all about shine, or rather ultra-high shine, and about giving your lips a luscious glossy finish with a good dose of lip gloss. There’s nothing complicated or expensive about this technique. All you need is a lip pencil, lipstick and lip gloss to get the look. And if possible, use an exfoliator beforehand to get your lips smooth and free of dead skin to optimize the process. Once this has been done, all that’s left to do is apply the pencil to the lip contour, with a particularly strong line, then fill in with the lipstick of your choice. Finally, finish off with a coat of transparent gloss — or a gloss in the same shade as the lipstick for an even stronger effect. Unlike many other trends, latex lips has already been adopted by celebrities and influencers such as Dua Lipa, Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner, and has been spotted on the catwalks of leading luxury brands. On TikTok, the #latexlips hashtag has already racked up over 18 million views, reflecting the younger generation’s enthusiasm for this seasonal aesthetic."

Since then, the company has acquired unique multi-material expertise through the mastery and combination of glass, metal, plastic, decoration, and beauty accessories, developed by its expert business divisions: Pochet du Courval (glass), Qualipac (metal and plastic), Solev (decoration) and Aura (objects, cases and accessories). Drawing on those skills, it creates packaging solutions and accessories with complex and sophisticated designs and decorations for the most prestigious perfume, skincare and makeup brands in the United States and around the world. A privately held French business, Groupe Pochet has been owned by eight generations of what is now the Colonna de Giovellina family, spanning nearly 230 years. The company now owns 12 production sites in three continents with 3,500 employees. In 1970, with the growth of perfume sales in Europe and in America, Henri Colonna de Giovellina employed a sales representative in New Jersey, to develop business contracts with prestigious U.S. brands. It was the beginning of the Pochet of America and Qualipac of America adventure! Since then, the American teams have grown, and the Group opened an office in Los Angeles to develop business with indies and brands form the West coast. The party in New York was part of a year of highlights and commemorative events during which Pochet is celebrating its rich history at its sites and headquarters, together with customers, partners, the public and employees."
Albéa launches Breizhstick a range of recycling-ready made in France sticks,"Among the low-impact packaging solutions showcased by Albéa Cosmetics & Fragrance at this year’s Luxe Pack in Monaco, the Breizhstick collection expands their range of made in France sticks. Following on from the launch of the first Breizhstick guided stick a year ago, the packaging manufacturer has introduced Breizhstick Blunt, which offers a flat top shape for a classic application. The newcomer adds up to the Breizhstick Tilty, designed with bevelled shape for a precise application, available since last year. Both sticks are mostly made of PP. Only their cups contain a mix of PE and PP, two recyclable materials, increasing the functionality of the stick. ""With the Breizhstick Family, we are expanding our offer of recycling-ready solutions while delivering on our commitment to lower the carbon footprint of our packaging. Beauty and dermo-cosmetics brands have now the choice between two designs that are both desirable and responsible,” said Aline Roland, Marketing Director at Albéa Cosmetics & Fragrance. The Breizhstick family is manufactured in Albéa Plouhinec, France."
Bormioli Luigi and Verescence create the bottle of Armani’s new Si Intense,"In order to offer an all-new design with a refillable bottle to Sì Eau de Parfum Intense, the House of Armani teamed up with Bormioli Luigi and Verescence. For this launch Bormioli Luigi took charge of the 50 and 100 ml sizes while the 10 and 30 ml sizes were entrusted to Verescence. Designed to last, the new bottles, whose relief decoration takes on the appearance of a precious piece of jewelry, include a part of recycled glass and are equipped with a screw neck so they can be refilled. On the glass surface, the logo’s two interlaced letters are revealed by a décor pad-printed in gold created using precious metal. “While the surface of the glass displays the shine typical of Armani fragrances, the relief motif required specific attention during the fire-polishing stage,” said Bormioli Luigi in a statement. The “Giorgio Armani” name, placed perfectly centrally on the front of the bottle, is screen-printed in black, a delicate process given its proximity with the relief décor."
"From fashion shows to social media, red is back on everyone’s lips","After latte makeup, a major beauty look of the summer, then with strawberry makeup and chai latte nails, here comes cherry makeup, a bold, uplifting beauty look that puts red center stage as fall’s star color. There’s plenty to suggest that red could stand out as the star color of the season. For starters, it was seen all over the catwalks of the fall-winter 2023 shows. Christian Siriano, Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci were just some of the fashion houses that opted for makeup looks dominated by this hue synonymous with audacity and passion. It then emerged on social networks with the trend for cherry cola lips, a lipstick shade directly inspired by the famous soda. Four months later, it has become one of the season’s leading makeup trends, adorning eyes, lips, nails and cheeks. The #cherrymakeup hashtag already has over 32 million views on TikTok. While cherry red is one of the most popular shades for this trend, carmine, vermilion, tomato and poppy red shades also do the trick. However, on social networks, and TikTok in particular, users are gradually turning to darker reds. The popularity of purple-reds, garnet, burgundy, mahogany, maroon and even deep black/red shades is soaring, as evidenced by the emerging black cherry makeup trend. Thus, fall 2023 seems to have two strong makeup trends: pumpkin spice makeup, dominated by orange hues, and cherry makeup, focusing on shades of red. It remains to be seen which will dominate. For the moment, the former seems to have the upper hand, already proving a hit on TikTok (over 50 million views) and even establishing itself in other areas of beauty. Nail varnish, for example, is getting in on the act, with shades inspired by Starbucks’ famous fall drink, and hair coloration and face masks are following suit. In the UK, the craze is such that the SpaSeekers platform hopes to organize the first pumpkin spice latte spa day later this fall. This will include a hot tub experience spiced with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pumpkin purée and a drop of coffee, as well as a pumpkin-themed facial and massage."

Koesio selects Coverpla for the launch of their first range of fragrances,"Available since the beginning of summer, Koesio fragrances have turned to Coverpla for the primary packaging of their fragrance collection: refillable glass bottles, caps, pumps and pump covers. The brand’s 20 fragrances are grouped into four families (marine, sweet, musk, powdery) for women, men, and young men and young women. A questionnaire evoking life situations helps identify the consumer’s olfactory profile to recommend the perfect fragrance. The brand selected three 50ml bottles from Coverpla’s catalogue: Vertigo, Ulysse and Venus. They are respectively paired with the Top Passion cap clad in aluminium (the brand selected the black and shiny silver shades), and with the Galet and Gény caps, both injected in Surlyn. Coverpla also supplied the matching pumps and pump covers. This mix-and-match selection was then personalized with a range of lacquers selected by the brand. Eager to offer a 100% refillable collection, Eric Moraldo, the brand’s founder, was no less demanding when it came to the design of the packaging. Among his choices in the Coverpla catalogue only the Vertigo design was available in a refillable version. However, driven by the project, Italian glassmaker Bormioli Luigi accepted to produce their Venus and Ulysse bottles with screw necks. As such, these two references are now available in refillable versions. Coverpla and Bormioli Luigi had already cooperated on a similar operation to facilitate Essential Parfums’ transition to refillable."
NHCO Nutrition selects Centric PLM to transform product development,"French dietary supplement producer has partners with Centric Software, a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) specialist, for internationalization, data security and optimized communication. Founded in 2008 by pharmacist, Charles Elkrief, NHCO Nutrition Laboratories has become an essential player in the field of micronutrition.

Plant-powered performance in deodorant application,"In the deodorant category, consumers’ demand is trending towards safer and more natural ingredients that combine effectiveness in sweat absorption and masking body odor, while respecting their skin and offering a pleasant sensorial experience. Roquette Beauté is emphasizing its leading position in the sustainable beauty sphere and focusing on its range of high-quality, versatile, 100% plant-based ingredients in the deodorant category combining high performance and amazing sensorial experiences to match consumers’ expectations! Body odours make us all uncomfortable, and let’s be honest, we all face it! They are caused by natural bacteria that are present all over the body, including the armpits. Some people naturally sweat more or less than others, but it is not the secretion of sweat that causes the smell; it is when the odourless sweat mixes with bacteria. Once the bacteria on your skin mixes with the sweat, the creation of volatile malodorous compounds causes an odour. Body odour also can vary from person to person with specific organoleptic properties; one person can sweat excessively but not smell, whereas another because of the type of bacteria on his skin can generate bad odours (sweet, sour, tangy, or like onions). Deodorants are designed to effectively absorb sweat and mask odor while providing a pleasant sensory experience. Roquette Beauté Solutions in Deodorant Answer Consumers’ Demand for Safe and Plant-Based Ingredients. It is important to absorb sweat to limit the sweat to mix with bacteria. For this, our ingredient Beauté by Roquette® ST 005 zea mays starch can absorb sweat and is as efficient as talc while being COSMOS approved with a natural index of 1 (ISO 16128) offering consumers a safe and natural alternative. As explained previously, sweat is not only responsible for bad odors but bacteria also are. Beauté by Roquette® LS 007 gluconic acid, caprylyl/capryl glucoside, and cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass) leaf oil inhibits the growth of microorganisms responsible for unpleasant odor while respecting the skin microbiota. Beauté by Roquette® LS 007 is Microbiome-Friendly approved by MyMicrobiome standard at 1% and 2% of use. In addition, our exclusive range of cyclodextrins acts on sweat malodorous compounds and encapsulates perfumes to offer long-lasting efficacy. Beauté by Roquette® CD 110 hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin encapsulates fragrances with a high ethanol content. Beauté by Roquette® CD 102 cyclodextrin encapsulates axillary malodorous compounds and fragrances in aqueous solutions to mask bad smells and protect fragrances, for a long-lasting release of scents for up to 24 hours. Besides encapsulation of axillary malodorous compounds and fragrances, Beauté by Roquette® CD 100 cyclodextrin also brings sensorial benefits. To go further and provide consumers with a highly natural and readily biodegradable complete solution for efficient deodorant, Beauté by Roquette® DE 006 dextrin acts on skin health. This microbiome-friendly soothing agent can help sensitive and irritated skin while respecting the skin microbiota. Consumers are including their deodorant application within their beauty routine; sensory aspects are as important. Beauté by Roquette® ST 118 sodium carboxymethyl starch has a great capacity for sweat absorption and enables the creation of deodorant formulations that bring freshness to the skin and a soft powdery after-feel.

TNT Group manufactures the cap of Penhaligon’s new fragrance portrait,"The Omniscient Mr. Thompson, the latest addition to the Penhaligon’s Portraits collection, is a discreet, devoted butler and, above all, the keeper of family secrets, who finds himself a spectator to the Penhaligon’s family dramas. For the elephant-shaped cap, which identifies the fragrance, the Spanish group Puig once again called on TNT Group. The 100% recyclable zamak component is made up of three parts: one for the animal’s head and two for the tusks. TNT Group has achieved this fine exercise with great precision to convey the majesty of the elephant. For an ergonomic closure, the PP insert snap fits onto a gold-anodized aluminium collar seated upon a gold-plated brass pedestal. A manufacturer of premium primary and secondary packaging, TNT Group has already produced the 18 previous zamak caps for the Penhaligon’s Portraits collection. The Penhaligon’s Portraits collection celebrates the English establishment, and its sense of humour and provocation. The personality of each aristocratic character is expressed in the fragrance caps, each in the shape of an animal’s head, each with its own specific symbolism. The essence of Mr. Thompson’s character is expressed through notes of black pepper, oak wood and bewitching vanilla."

Rissmann: A prestige 100% paper bag with a suede effect and a sensual feeling,"At Luxe Pack Monaco 2023, Rissmann has introduced Velvet Bag, a prestige 100% paper bag with a suede effect and a touch as sensual as that of an animal fur. The German manufacturer has designed a prestige bag in flocked paper, FSC certified and produced from eucalyptus pulp. The bag’s surface offers a suede effect both to the sight and to the touch.

Dubai-based Beauty Brands Global acquires France’s La Bouche Rouge,"French luxury beauty brand La Bouche Rouge, which pioneered plastic-free beauty, has been acquired by a new holding company founded by Designer Parfums’ Dilesh Mehta. Founded in 2017 by ex-L’Oréal Nicolas Gerlier, La Bouche Rouge established itself as an eco-luxury brand with a mission to eliminate single-use plastics from cosmetic products. The brand had a strong influence on the beauty industry’s approach to sustainability thanks to its refillable high-end packaging made of a variety of materials, including aluminium and leather. After having focused on lip, eye, and face makeup, La Bouche Rouge recently entered the perfume category with a range of five natural and upcycled fragrances packed in glass bottles that can be refilled with 100% aluminium tubes. Despite a successful funding drive that saw the brand raise EUR 12.5 million since September 2020, the company faced financial difficulties and was placed under judicial administration by the Paris Commercial Court in July. However, the brand’s operations continued without interruption and the Court eventually ruled in favour of an acquisition by Beauty Brands Global, a Dubai-based holding company led by Dilesh Mehta, president of British fragrance house Designer Parfums (Cerruti 1881, Ghost Fragrances, Jennifer Lopez, Ariana Grande, Hawaiian Tropic, etc.). Confirming the acquisition, Mr Mehta said: “This new venture is especially close to my heart and marks the start of a new strategic orientation into luxury and eco-responsible brands (…). La Bouche Rouge carries a unique DNA based on innovation, sophistication and a remarkable eco-responsible business model.” To ensure a smooth transition and to capitalise on the brand’s French origins, Beauty Brands Global will set up a new company based in Paris and will maintain the manufacturing laboratory in Orléans. Luxury industry veteran Florence Rollet will join as General Manager while founder Nicolas Gerlier will transition to Creative Director. “I am confident that the uniqueness of La Bouche Rouge, associated with the entrepreneurship spirit and solidity of the wider Group, will bring a lot of excitement and success for the future,” added Dilesh Mehta."

Global Bioenergies awarded EUR 16.4 million for their isobutene plant,"The French government has awarded Global Bioenergies EUR 16.4 million – in the form of a subsidy (60%) and a repayable advance (40%) – to help fund construction of the world’s first bio-sourced isobutene plant. The start-up specializes in the conversion of plant-derived resources into chemical compounds. The new plant, which is due to start operating in 2027, will be capable of producing 10,000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year. In August, Global Bioenergies announced that it was accelerating the ramp-up of its production capacities to respond more quickly to demand from the cosmetics industry before moving on to the production of aviation fuels. Indeed, the technology developed by Global Bioenergies for producing isobutene from natural resources and thus biosourced and renewable and isododecane and isohexadecane. In addition to allow the cosmetics industry to increase the naturalness of its formulas, the technology should also help the aviation industry to gradually reduce its dependence on oil, without sacrificing performance and without the need to adapt existing equipment and facilities. “This support from the government is essential and represents the cornerstone of the overall financing arrangements for the plant, which we hope to finalise by mid-2024. Located in France, the plant will contribute towards adding value to the region’s abundant resources, reviving local industry and establishing a totally new economic sector,” said Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies."

"""Grace Box"": Procos’ new luxury and eco-responsible box","At Luxe Pack Monaco and for its 25th anniversary, Procos is introducing the ""Grace Box"" a patented packaging solution that addresses the growing demand for environmentally friendly alternatives. Three versions are available: a lacquered version with a magnetic closure, a single-material version without a magnet in two colours and two constructions (Construction 1: Box + lid; Construction 2: Box with groove + lid).

Texen designs the cap for Yves Saint Laurent new men’s fragrance MYSLF,"For this major launch, the house of Yves Saint Laurent chose an ultra-premium, refillable pack. It entrusted Texen with the development of a specific cap with a multitude of technical and esthetic challenges. With an understated, minimalistic look, MYSLF Eau de Parfum is available in three sizes (100 ml, 60 ml and 40 ml) with an identical cap. For this product, Texen continues its historic collaboration with the brand. Once the body of the cap and its insert are injected, each component is decorated and assembled in-line. The finished product is thus delivered pre-assembled to the brand. The YSL logo is engraved inside the insert and on top of the cap, both perfectly aligned with the cap and the face of the bottle. The aesthetic quality of the decorations is are based on a high-solid varnish with extremely low solvent content, followed by pad printing on the top; this creates a daring contrast between the shiny sides and the matte top, highlighting the elegant ridge of the cap’s edges. In addition, the pad-printing hugs the slightest contours of the letters, revealing their texture. The fineness of the grain and the ultra-smooth surfaces can be clearly distinguished, making the technical complexity of making the parts undetectable. “Texen ran a multitude of tests and invested in the highly sophisticated processes to achieve the level of quality to which it was just committed in partnership with the L’Oréal development teams (calibration and adjustment of industrial processes, decoration techniques, inspection by camera…),” said the manufacturer of beauty packaging in a statement."

"Trends: One in 10 Japanese are older than 80, government data","More than 10 percent of Japanese people have crossed 80 years or older for the first time, new official data showed, as the nation faces a rapidly greying population. Government data released on October 17, ahead of Monday’s ""Respect for Aged Day"" national holiday, also showed that the share of Japan’s population at 65 or older expanded to a record 29.1 percent from 29.0 percent a year ago.

"Fake belly buttons, the latest beauty craze among China’s social media users","Followers of the trend can get around 30 fake belly buttons for the equivalent of EUR 0.50 on Pinduoduo, one of China’s largest e-commerce platforms. An offer that seems to appeal to thousands of regular users of the Douyin and Xiaohongshu social networks, as recently reported by the South China Morning Post. Originating in China, this phenomenon is starting to spread on social platforms like TikTok, showing that ideals surrounding body image are still very much a part of women’s daily lives, all over the world. Videos posted under the hashtags dedicated to these fake belly buttons, whether on Douyin or Xiaohongshu — two of China’s most popular social platforms — show young women cutting out and then sticking on what look like temporary tattoos in the shape of a navel, a few centimeters above the real orifice. The latter is concealed by pants, a skirt or shorts, while the fake navel is highlighted by a crop top. For those involved, the purpose of this ploy is to create an optical illusion. Indeed, fans of the trick claim that a belly button raised by around 10 centimeters will allow a skirt or pair of pants to be pulled up by the same amount, subsequently lengthening legs and slimming the silhouette. Or at least giving the illusion of doing so. On Xiaohongshu, videos are accompanied by captions extolling the virtues of the trick. ""It’s not a fake belly button patch, it’s a tool to lengthen short legs!"" one user posted with their video. ""Every beauty has two belly buttons! Here’s the secret to lengthening your legs!"" says another user. In addition to applying the temporary tattoo, some women also apply makeup around the area to ensure a more harmonious effect. While this craze for fake belly buttons poses no risk to physical health, it does, however, raise questions about the persistence of certain body image ideals, such as equating long legs with a standard of beauty to be attained. And it’s just one example among many. Fake freckles, fake breasts, fake buttocks and even fake noses are just some of the ’tools’ that abound on today’s social networks, when it’s not a question of makeup tricks designed to refine or smooth this or that part of the face, again reflecting a desire to attain a certain beauty standard. Ultimately, these temporary tattoos are akin to the social media filters that are the subject of much debate. As well as proving a source of stress and anxiety for young people, they can also contribute to body dysmorphic disorder, the tendency to obsess over an imaginary flaw. A phenomenon that, in turn, increases stress and anxiety, and impacts self-esteem. ""I wonder how these women can still face their true body figures after removing the fake belly button stickers, breast pads, buttock pads, and other enhancements,"" observed one internet user, quoted by the South China Morning Post. Numerous studies have suggested that social networks, through their filters and editing apps, can have a negative impact on the mental health of users, particularly the very young. It’s a fact that worries parents the world over, to the point that some would now like to see beauty filters subject to an age limit, or even banned altogether. Despite the emergence of numerous movements in favour of the acceptance and appreciation of all body types, the ideals linked to appearance and to the ’perfect body’ — if that exists at all — die hard, demonstrating the need for action to limit associated risks and dangers."

Sustainability: How to measure the impact of cosmetic products?,"Taking place in Paris on October 30 - 1st November 2023, the next edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will discuss the various impacts of cosmetic and personal care products. The summit will feature green ingredients, sustainability metrics, and biodiversity & customer impacts. The highlights of the agenda include: For the first time, the summit will give detailed insights into how sustainability associated impacts of personal care products are measured. Professor Miguel Mendonca Reis Brandao from KTH University (Sweden) will host a workshop on sustainability metrics. He will show how environmental, social, and financial indicators can be utilised by cosmetic and related firms in their sustainability programmes. The EcoBeautyScore Consortium will give an update on its science-based approach to measure impacts and its harmonised scoring system for cosmetic products. Ioana Dobruscu from Water Footprint Implementation will explain how operators can measure the water footprint of such products. Aurelie Weinling from Garnier will show how the brand is reducing its impacts via its Green Beauty initiative. Garnier has pledged to move away from virgin plastic and to have CO2 neutral factories by 2025. The climate emergency is putting pressure on cosmetic companies to reduce their carbon emissions. Lucy Kirkup from ClimatePartner will discuss how operators can measure, reduce, and offset their carbon emissions. Details will be given of its certification scheme, which is gaining traction with cosmetic brands. Sabine Kaestner from one of Europe’s leading natural cosmetic companies Lavera, will share their experiences in adopting the ClimatePartner label. A growing number of cosmetic & raw material firms are looking at adopt regenerative agriculture because of its sustainability merits. Davines is a frontrunner, setting up the European Regenerative Organic Center in partnership with the Rodale Institute. Its Research Director Dario Fornaro will give details of the cosmetic raw materials it is growing according to regenerative agriculture, which improves soil fertility, enhances biodiversity, sequestrates carbon, and can have socio-economic benefits. Coconut oil is widely used in personal care products, however the industry is facing a crisis. Many of the coconut palms in South-East Asia are reaching the end of their lives, whilst farmers are leaving the industry. Laura Schlebes from AAK will explain how the Sustainable Coconut Charter aims to improve farmer livelihoods, lessen the carbon footprint of coconuts and boost supply to meet rising global demand. AAK is one of the first signatories of the Sustainable Coconut Charter. At last year’s UN Biodiversity conference, 195 countries made a commitment to protect 30% of land and water by 2030. An industry expert will discuss the implications of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, especially in terms of sourcing of cosmetic ingredients. Emma Trogen, Deputy Director General of Cosmetics Europe, will share some of the initiatives the industry association is undertaking to protect biodiversity. New technologies are facilitating the move to green cosmetic ingredients. There is high interest in precision fermentation as it can produce sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based ingredients. The Danish start-up Biosyntia will show how it is using fermentation techniques to produce cosmetic ingredients. Dr. Prateek Mahalwar, Founder of Bioweg, will explain how it is using new technologies to make micropowders and rheology modifiers from agri-food waste. The start-up recently partnered with Ginkgo Bioworks to create sustainable alternatives to plastics. Other speakers will cover innovations in upcycled materials and ingredients for waterless cosmetics. Details will be given of the new EU deforestation-free regulation which ensures products sold in Europe do not come from deforested or degraded land. The regulation applies to palm oil, soya, cocoa, and other agricultural commodities. Farmforce will show how its technology can help operators develop deforestation-free supply chains for their raw materials. Greenwashing is a major issue in the cosmetics industry, as many products are marketed as natural, organic, vegan, free-from, etc. without meeting any industry standards or certification. The EU Green Claims Directive aims to establish clear criteria for companies to make such claims. The Obelis Group will give details on the proposed directive and its marketing implications to brands. Various studies show the highest environmental impact of cosmetic and personal care products is at the consumer level. For rinse-off products like shampoos and soaps, over 95% of carbon emissions are from consumer use. Approaches to encourage responsible consumption and disposal of cosmetic & personal care products will be discussed. Dr. Helen Holmes from the Sustainable Consumption Institute (University of Manchester) will discuss approaches to modify consumer behaviour for sustainability. Julien Kaibeck from the Slow Cosmetique Association will share its experiences in encouraging consumers to make greener choices when buying personal care products. As sustainability issues rise on the corporate agenda, there are questions about the future. How will raw materials and packaging change so there will be more sustainable cosmetics? How are emerging trends likely to influence product development? How will consumer behaviour evolve in the coming years? The futurist Monique Large (PollenConsulting) will give some of her predictions in the opening keynote of the summit. Organized by Ecovia Intelligence, the European edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will be hosted at the Crowne-Plaza - Republique Paris.

Pace of increase in CO2 concentration has increased three-fold: report,"The pace at which the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing — due mostly to the burning of fossil fuels — has jumped three-fold in five decades, according to the State of the Climate in 2022 report published by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 2022, there were on average 417 parts per million (ppm) of the planet-warming gas in the air, up 2.2 ppm from the year before. This is 50 percent more than pre-industrial levels. Annual growth in global mean carbon dioxide averaged across the last decade has tripled since the 1960s, it found. Unsurprisingly, the level recorded in 2022 is ""the highest in the modern atmospheric record and in paleoclimate records dating back as far as 800,000 years"", the report noted. Throughout 2022, ""the climate continued to respond to the ongoing increase in greenhouse gases and resulting warming,"" it added. Temperatures reached record-breaking highs during the year across multiple continents, including peaks above 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in Western Australia and 47C in the American southwest. Sustained heatwaves ravaged South and East Asia, with China enduring the worst heatwave ever recorded anywhere in the world. Tempered by the impact of a climate-cooling La Nina, a naturally occurring weather phenomenon across the southern Pacific, 2022 was ranked as the fifth or sixth warmest year since reliable records began in the mid-19th century. The last eight years — 2015 through 2022 — are the eight warmest on record, and 2023 is on track to be warmer than any of them, the EU’s climate monitoring service said Wednesday. The increase in global drought area that began in mid-2019 continued into 2022, according to the report. August 2022 saw a new high for the percentage of global land area — 20 percent — experiencing moderate or worse drought conditions. More frequent and intense heatwaves last year also contributed to the second-greatest loss of mass for mountain glaciers across the globe since satellite tracking began in the 1970s. Glaciers in the Swiss Alps lost a record six percent of their volume. Across the two-thirds of the planet covered by seas, nearly 60 percent of ocean surface waters experienced at least one marine heatwave, according to the report. Oceans have trapped and stored more than 90 percent of the excess heat generated by global warming, keeping Earth’s land surface liveable for most of its inhabitants."
Knoll Packaging shortlisted for two UK Packaging Awards,"Knoll Packaging has been shortlisted for two UK Packaging Awards, Knoll Ecoform Molded Pulp Compacts in the Best New Concept Award category and Knoll Gives Back Day in the Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative of the Year. The awards will be announced at the annual gala in October and showcases Knoll’s commitment towards setting the standard for sustainability in its industry. Shortlisted for Best New Concept Award, Knoll spent two years on research and develop their 100% Knoll Ecoform molded pulp compacts. Knoll Ecoform is a plant material made from bamboo, wood and sugar cane fibers. The material is certified recyclable in the paper recycling stream, and can be molded, cut to order and color matched. This latest innovation can replace traditional plastic make-up compacts and is engineered with a magnet-free option and removable mirror. The compact utilizes two layers of molded pulp, which has a smooth luxury feel finish on the interior and exterior of the compact. The design is fully customizable to meet the aesthetic of a brand, including any configuration of pans. Additional decoration also includes embossing and stamping or adding a FSC paper mask for additional decoration. It is Knoll’s goal to eliminate plastics from their supply chain, and this new molded fiber solution for compacts continues their mission to create a better world. “The evolution of Knoll Ecoform molded pulp has been extraordinary. We first introduced the material over 5 years ago as a replacement for plastic platforms and it quickly evolved into a disruptive 100% packaging solution. We’ve built on years of technical expertise with the material to launch our 100% Knoll Ecoform make-up compacts, which are fully customizable and aim to continue eliminating plastic from our supply chain.

Each location, including USA, UK, Europe, Hong Kong, China and Philippines, volunteered with a local non-profit organization of their choice in activities such as cleaning up beaches and local trails, tree planting, volunteering with underserved communities, and assist at a local food pantry. Knoll Gives Back Day aligns with our values and mission to protect our people and planet and continues to raise employee’s awareness on social and environmental issues by having them involved in these initiatives. “Social and environmental issues that each community experiences are unique which might not be widely known. We believe that awareness can spark action and Knoll Gives Back Day is a great opportunity for our teams globally to understand what is happening in their local community. Additionally, this is also a great opportunity for our team members to interact with each other outside the work setting further enhancing cohesion and teamwork in Knoll. This initiative is an annual activity as we seek to continuously give back to our community,” added Wincy Cheng, Sustainability Director of Global Operations at Knoll.

The use of recycled and bio-sourced materials is skyrocketing at Texen,"While the use of recycled materials might represent a major challenge for packaging manufacturers, Texen’s teams can boast impressive results in this area, as shown in the group’s latest sustainable development report. Actually, the use of recycle materials was multiplied by 4 during the year 2022. More than 10% of the plastics used for new references were recycled or bio-sourced, compared with 2.5% in 2021, an 8% increase. In 2022, 75% of the group’s offer included an eco-designed solution, compared with 57% in 2021, an 18% increase. As to reducing CO2 emissions, the work undertaken at the group’s eight factories involved the insulation of 150 presses, the detection of compressed air leakage and the optimization of temperatures in processes, making for a reduction of the equivalent of 738 tons of CO2. Texen Décoration, the company’s site specializing in surface treatments, reinforced its biofiltration system for VOCs (volatile organic compounds) in order to recuperate them on three of the site’s seven painting machines, a saving of 75,000m3/h. The site achieved ISO 14001 certification, and Texen Poland was certified ISCC+. For the second consecutive year, Texen has received the Platinum medal from EcoVadis. “We don’t earn such recognition by acting alone. We owe this second Platinum medal to the group’s CSR excellence and the ceaseless commitment of all our stakeholders,” comments Rémi Weidenmann, Managing Director of the Texen Group. “It confirms our leadership in the metamorphosis of cosmetics packaging.” At the same time, Texen made its staff’s employability a key challenge for the group. “It is up to us to put our employees at the heart of our transformation to make Texen an attractive company where everyone is an actor for change,” explains Fabien Blanchet, Human Resources Director. In 2022, the group’s training program progressed to offer employees new skills (more than two days training on average per employee). This is in addition to internships and traineeships (the group employs more than 35 trainees in France alone). Mobility is key to the group’s career development projects: more than 70% of managers are recruited in-house. As well as training, inclusivity is a major concern for the group. It has put in place a program for integrating people with disabilities in collaboration with French national body Agefiph."
"Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie produces Maison Berger Paris’ latest lamp, Joy","For latest addition to its collection of lamps, Maison Berger Paris once again entrusted to Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie for the glasswork.

Gotha has put gather three main trends – Dare to Care, Green Lab, Metadisruptive – under the title Realignment: Move Fast, Embrace Low. According to the company, as far as the beauty industry is concerned, the Realignment trends consist in offering product solutions that feed the sense of wellbeing while encouraging consumers to prioritize health-centric practices and flexi-lifestyles. “After years of rapid industry, technological and social acceleration, 2023 ushers in an era of Realignment with ourselves, our workplaces and our planet. Thanks to the Realignment of values consumers will prioritize products and experiences that are nourishing rather than being extractive and exhausting. Uncertainty will remain a dominant force due to ongoing economic, political and environmental crises, but consumer will be seeking ways to balance their uneasiness with optimism,” explained Gotha Cosmetics in a statement. The three trends will be illustrated through three new collections of products: Driven by the understanding that the beauty ritual is a very intimate, personal and almost spiritual experience, this micro-collection of products combines instant and long-term beauty benefits, to create a sensorial journey that elevates senses and provides maximum results across all age, ethnic and gender groups. “Through the selection of products of Dare to Care we are proposing product solutions dedicated to consumers who want to rediscover their love for cosmetics, embracing makeup that is both special and practical. As people prioritize well-being, new beauty moments will emerge, and they will seek mindful products, democratized design, and people-powered initiatives that allow them to live their best, most balanced life. This trend promotes the joy of makeup, offering products that support self-expression and connection while leveraging multifunctional makeup hybrids for all,” said Gotha. Focused on meeting the highest standards set by the most demanding consumers the “Green Lab” collection is on the mission to deliver beauty results that go equally skin-deep as they are impactful on the surface. All of that with a reduced environmental footprint. According to Gotha: “Green Lab addresses those consumers who are sophisticated, knowledgeable, and curious but also uncompromising in terms of safety and quality. There is no trade-off when it comes to beauty performance either: product transparency will be a priority moving forward along with science-backed beauty, lab-grown ingredients that are good for the skin and planet.” The Metadisruptive phygital avant-garde collection comprises overwhelmingly sophisticated, expressive and borderline “otherworldly” products. “By 2024, consumers and brands will inhabit increasingly fluid realities, moving seamlessly between the digital and physical worlds. This new circular existence will inspire new phygital aesthetics, while the acceleration of beauty into the metaverse will unlock unlimited possibilities for consumer and products interactions: accessible virtual beauty experiences that make everyday tasks simpler and more enjoyable are unlocking a new world of beauty experiences,” highlighted Gotha."
Lancôme unveils a limited edition collection with Le Louvre,"Inspired by nine masterpieces from the sculpture department, as well as the museum’s lights and colours, Lancôme has designed a limited-edition of skincare and makeup products signed Lancôme x Louvre. The campaign supporting this unprecedented collaboration was filmed at the Louvre Museum with Zendaya, Aya Nakamura, Amanda Seyfried and He Cong, all ambassadors of this collaboration.

Thus, Lancôme was inspired by the Venus de Milo, Victory of Samothrace, Corine, Diana of Gabies, Nymphe with a Scorpion, Echo, Hygieia, Venus of Arles and, finally, Hermaphrodite. Each of these masterpieces, through its story and that of the myth it embodies, inspired Lisa Eldridge: Global Creative Director of Lancôme Makeup, to create this makeup collection. ""The choice of the Venus of Milo, Nymphe with a Scorpion, or Diana of Gabies as ambassadors for this campaign brings new perspectives on iconic and inspiring images of antiquity, contrasting them against contemporary representations and standards.

Castor oil sourcing: Inolex joins Sustainable Castor Association,"Inolex has joined the not-for-profit organization founded by Arkema, BASF, Jayant Agro-Organics Ltd, and Solidaridad. The Sustainable Castor Association (SCA) is focused on enhancing the environmental, social, and economic profile of castor farming throughout the supply chain. The aim is to enable a more traceable and verified castor oil supply chain through certification, and to build programs that support the livelihood of castor farmers. The castor standard code, SuCCESS, which is managed by the SCA, is the standardized certification criteria for sustainable castor. Currently SuCCESS certified supply represents about 1% of global castor oil supply and includes over 6,200 farmers and 6,000 hectares. In addition to building traction in the certified castor supply chain, the community around SCA supports farmers through educating on good agricultural practices that boost yields, create water reduction efficiencies. According to Inolex, “castor is an inherently sustainable crop.” Indeed, it is naturally drought resistant with the ability to thrive in marginal soil, it can grow on rotation with staples such as cumin, mustard, and other local crops, the plant does not compete as a food source, and what is not extracted from the seed pod as castor oil is generally repurposed as fertilizer. Further, because the cash crop has a long storage life, the farmers have more flexibility and autonomy in the marketplace. 80% of the world’s supply of castor seed is produced in India by smallholder farmers and their families. While these benefits are extensive, “there are always opportunities to better support growers and contribute to improved outcomes via the environmental, social, and governance impacts of farming,” said Audrey Wesson, Corporate Sustainability Manager at Inolex. “When we look at the work that the Sustainable Castor Association members are doing, all of these actions are positively impacting farmer livelihood, local ecosystems, and the security and sustainability of the value chain,” added Wesson. “We are excited to be part of SCA.”"
Natura considers possible sale of The Body Shop,"After selling Aesop to L’Oréal for USD 2.5 billion, the Brazilian cosmetics giant could now part ways with The Body Shop, which it acquired in 2017... from L’Oréal. Natura &Co announced today that the Board of Directors has authorized the group’s management “to explore strategic alternatives for The Body Shop, which may include a potential sale of this business.” However, there “can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction,” the Brazilian multinational added in a statement. Last year, Natura &Co appointed Fabio Barbosa as CEO with the mission to reorganize the group, reduce costs and return to profitability. The task has been partly accomplished, but The Body Shop remains the weak link of Natura &Co, which has chosen to refocus on Latin America. Last week, Natura &Co announced that The Body Shop’s Q2 net revenue declined by 12.5% at constant currency (-12% in BRL), with sales showing continued steep decline in all core distribution channels (stores, e-commerce and franchise). In a report released today, the Itaú BBA bank considered the recent news as positive. “Given the efforts undertaken by Natura &Co to streamline its structure and improve its financial situation, we believe that a possible sale of The Body Shop would be a positive outcome for Natura &Co as it could reduce the operating risk identified within the overall company’s investments and improve its consolidated results in the years to come"", said the bank."

Global Bioenergies accelerates the ramp-up of its industrial capacities,"The company, which specializes in the conversion of plant-derived resources into chemical compounds used in many cutting-edge fields such as cosmetics and energy, has raised its industrial ambitions. In order to meet the expectations of its partners in terms of decarbonization, Global Bioenergies has decided to focus as of now on a plant project with greater production capacity than initially scheduled. This new plant, designed to produce 10,000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year (compared to 2,000 tonnes in the previous project), will target the cosmetics market, followed by the sustainable aviation fuel market, for which Global Bioenergies has just obtained ASTM certification. “We have delivered our first orders and our first-half revenue totalled €2.4 million. Guided by the current trend of a ramp-up in renewables, along with strong markets traction on the topic and technical progress regarding our direct path process, we are changing our roadmap. The commercial activities of the Pomacle unit, while generating sales but with a low associated margin, are no longer a priority. We are now focusing all our efforts on building this larger plant, scheduled to come on stream at the end of 2027. At the same time, we are already starting to deploy our technology in other regions and using other feedstocks alongside international industrial groups,” said Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies. For L’Oréal, Global Bioenergies’ biggest shareholder via its BOLD (Business Opportunities for L’Oréal Development) investment fund, the plan for a large-capacity plant resonates with the environmental challenges and commitments taken as part of its L’Oréal for the Future programme. “Our commitment for 2030 is for 95% of the ingredients used in our formulas to be bio-sourced, derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes. This new ambition for Global Bioenergies will make bio-sourced isobutene derivatives accessible at competitive prices to cosmetics markets and, beyond that, will enable everyone to play an active part in the environmental transition,” highlighted Ana Kljuic, Vice President R&I L’Oréal for the Future & Green Sciences. Global Bioenergies will release design and construction schedules for the new plant by the end of 2023. After having started in 2022 the commercial production of the first biobased isododecane — Isonaturane® 12, a key ingredient for the makeup industry — Global Bioenergies launched at in-cosmetics 2023 the first natural and renewable Isohexadecane, under the trade name Isonaturane® 16."

Coty posts excellent results and relaunches Marc Jacob Beauty,"The owner of Kylie Cosmetics, Rimmel, Covergirl and Bourjois, has reported a strong Q4 performance, with double digit growth in both sales and profits. For the full fiscal year 2022-2023, closed on June 30, Coty posted sales growth of 12%, to EUR 5.55 billion, ahead of expectations.

Texen creates a PET version of the iconic Le Blanc de Chanel foundation case,"The French luxury brand has entrusted Texen with the transition to PET of the compact case of its Le Blanc foundation, one of its iconic references. The choice of this complex material represented a strategic step for the brand and a new challenge for Texen. Until now, this large, refillable compact was crafted from ABS, it is now made entirely from PET (with the exception of the pin and mirror). With this strategic choice, the brand is anticipating changes in European legislation on cosmetic materials and pursuing its quest for eco-design. Chanel chose to switch its packaging to PET, all the while maintaining their rigorous technical and esthetical requirements. Another recent development, the big-sized compact for Les Beiges, involved a number of challenges for Texen because of its large size and injected thin walls in rPET. This time, Chanel opted for PET and not rPET for reasons of colour stability, given the compact’s pale shades. “This latest development demonstrates the numerous challenges imposed by the transformation and decoration of a new material,” said Texen in a statement. Texen drew on the experience gained during the development of the previous compact to better industrial processes with the design, but also to challenge its partner suppliers. The complex injection of PET was a big challenge, which required multiple test runs, in particular for the lid, with a top and edges in different shades. To inject the edges, Texen used the “Besst Transform” induction technique based on Roctool’s engineering [1]. “The part has perfect aesthetics without any surface flaws,” highlights Texen. The brand’s logo is then applied to the center of the lid using hot stamping. Each part was injected then decorated in-line with a high-solid varnish. The final assembly was performed on a production line equipped with an onboard “zero defect” inspection module for each and every part. The lid and hinge are joined with a pin compatible with the mechanical properties of the material. Inside, the pan is clipped into the well, allowing the consumer to easily replace it with a new refill."

Americans are concerned about the impact of beauty filters on self-esteem,"A recent survey conducted by StyleSeat in the United States reveals that a significant proportion of the population would like to impose an age limit on their use, or even ban them outright. The beauty and wellness booking platform asked 700 Americans to test the ""Bold Glamour"" filter, which guarantees a flawless face, and then asked them about their perception of the beauty filters popular on social networks. And the results were clear: three out of five respondents thought they were bad for their mental health, and 70% feared they would have a negative impact on self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, younger people are not more inclined to turn to beauty filters when posting photos or videos on social networks, or at the very least they fear their effects as much or more than other demographics. Nearly three quarters of Generation Z respondents (72%) think that these filters have a negative impact on mental health. And with good reason: these applications, which modify users’ appearance, often to meet certain unrealistic beauty standards, could be linked to low self-esteem or even body dysmorphic disorder, which is characterized by an obsession with non-existent or imperceptible physical defects. The survey reveals that one in three Americans would like to look the same in real life as they do when they look at themselves through a beauty filter. In this regard, Americans are even more concerned about the impact of beauty filters on the mental health of younger people. Many social platforms have rules and restrictions in place for younger users, especially teenagers and children under the age of 16 (the age required to register depends on the country of origin). But this does not apply to beauty filters. For this reason, one in three Americans now believe that beauty filters should be subject to an age requirement, and one in five believe they should be banned outright. It’s important to keep in mind that beauty filters totally modify appearance according to very specific stereotypes: a flawless complexion, a slimmed-down nose, a perfectly sculpted chin and cheekbones, luminous eyes... A perception of beauty far removed from reality, particularly when taking the diversity of the world’s population into account. So it’s hardly surprising to learn that, after viewing their faces through the ""Bold Glamour"" filter, around 20% of those surveyed said they felt less sure of themselves. And an overwhelming majority (80%) already believe that this type of filter has transformed beauty standards. The impact of social media on mental health and self-esteem is a concern not only in the USA, as shown by a survey conducted by Edelman DXI for Dove, in collaboration with Mental Health Europe, and the e-Enfance association, published last spring. Carried out among the general population, as well as parents, teenagers and experts in youth mental health, it highlighted the growing concern of healthcare professionals about the use of filters in France. More than half of them (52%) felt that content encouraging the intensive use of filters could be the cause of feelings of anxiety, as could content showing perfect bodies or bodies far removed from reality (44%)."

"Dior, Givenchy and Kenzo support a greener production of perfume alcohol","The three perfume houses of the LVMH group will collaborate with Cristal Union — a French agricultural cooperative that brings together more than 9,000 beetroot growers and employs more than 2,000 people to produce and market sugar, alcohol and bioethanol – to improve the agricultural practices in the beetroot sector. The cultivation of beets is a key element in the perfumery supply chain since it produces the alcohol that serves as a support for most luxury fragrances. This year, Parfums Christian Dior, Givenchy Parfums and Kenzo Parfumsare financing a project aimed at supporting the agroecological transition of 380 hectares of beetroot cultivation in the east of France to produce the equivalent of 45% of their alcohol needs (“Mass balance” approach). The project is based on the Regeneration Index, a tool developed by French NGO Pour une Agriculture du Vivant. It allows to assess the agro-ecological score of farms and to support farmers on their path to progress. “This collaboration sets an important milestone on the path traced by the LIFE 360 program towards the regeneration of 5 million hectares of ecosystems. Beetroots hold a prominent place in the supply chain of the LVMH Beauty business group. The implementation of new, virtuous production models in this sector represents a key step on the way to our commitments,” highlights Hélène Valade, Environmental Development Director of the LVMH group. In addition, and for a period of five years, LVMH finances a Research & Development program with Cristal Union within 12 farms with the objective to test new agronomical practices with a particular focus on: – Reducing nitrogen inputs in beetroot cultivation by optimizing cover crops.
– Limiting the addition of fertilizers of mineral origin through an increased use of organic matter. As part of these trials, the three Maisons will work with Genesis, selected by the Maison des Start-ups LVMH and awarded for its tool measuring the health and quality of soils. Genesis will be in charge of collecting precise data about soil health on a regular and geolocated basis in order to assess the impact of agricultural practices on their health and their contribution to ecosystem functions. Perfumery brands have made very different sustainability choices when it comes to perfumery alcohol. Some of them, usually niche brands, have opted for organic alcohol, but quantities of organic beet alcohol is very limited and they usually have to switch to organic sugar cane alcohol. Others, like Coty, have opted for synthetic alcohol from carbon recycling. The transformation of the perfume industry in a context of ecological transition will be one of the key topics of the next Fragrance Innovation Summit on November 30 in Paris."
Amyris files for bankruptcy and sells consumer brands to focus on ingredients,"Amyris and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries have commenced voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The company said the decision was taken in order to facilitate its business and financial reorganization. Amyris intends to streamline its business portfolio to focus on its core competencies in R&D and the scale-up, commercialization, and applications development of its sustainable ingredients derived through biofermentation. The company is therefore planning to exit its consumer brands and will begin marketing them for sale. Amyris’ portfolio of consumer brands includes: Biossance, Costa Brazil, JVN, Olika, Onda Beauty, Menolabs, Pipette, Purecane, Rose Inc., Stripes, Terasana, and 4U by Tia. “As the sale process progresses, Amyris will continue to operate these brands, including through retail partners and the brands’ e-commerce platforms,” said the company in a statement. An entity affiliated with existing lender Foris Ventures has committed to USD 190 million of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing to support continued day-to-day operations as Amyris works with its key stakeholders to negotiate a consensual go-forward plan. Last June, as part of its cost reduction targets Amyris announced the resignation of John Melo as president, CEO and a member of the board of directors, as well as a global reduction in force. In February, Amyris had sold a large part of its cosmetic ingredients to Givaudan. The two companies signed a long-term partnership agreement under which Amyris would continue to manufacture cosmetic ingredients for Givaudan, who will become the commercialization partner for future sustainable beauty ingredients. To ensure a smooth transition into Chapter 11, the company filed with the Court a series of customary motions seeking to continue operating as usual and uphold its commitments to its employees and other valued stakeholders during the process. These ""first day"" motions include requests to continue to pay wages and provide benefits to employees as usual and maintain its customer programs and policies. ""Over the past months, we have been hard at work on a strategic transformation plan to reduce costs, improve operational effectiveness, and achieve sustainable growth. We believe the step forward our company has taken today puts us on the best path to address our financial challenges and achieve a comprehensive solution. At the end of this restructuring process, we believe that Amyris will emerge as a financially stronger company with a more focused business model and well-defined path to profitability,"" said Han Kieftenbeld, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Amyris."

EU industry calls for a swift ratification of the agreement with Mercosur,"Cosmetics Europe, Cefic and a coalition of 17 other business associations representing different European industrial sectors call for a swift ratification of the EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement. In an open letter sent to the President of the European Parliament, Ms. Metsola, the President of the European Council, Mr. Michel, and the President of the European Commission, Ms. Von der Leyen, they claim the agreement is key to preserve their competitiveness and secure supply chains. The text was supported by a wide variety of signatories including the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA); The Brewers of Europe; the European Confederation of the Footwear Industry (CEC); the Committee for European Construction Equipment (CECE), the EU wine companies committee (CEEV); the European Association of the Machine Tool Industries (CECIMO); the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic); the European traders in agri-food commodities (CELCAA); the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA); the European association of cosmetic industries (Cosmetics Europe); the Confederation of National Associations of Tanners and Dressers of the European Community (COTANCE); the European Dairy Association (EDA); the European Services Forum (ESF); the European Apparel and Textile Confederation (EURATEX); the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry (EUROCHAMBRES); the retail sector (EuroCommerce); Europe’s Technology Industries (ORGALIM); SpiritsEUROPE; and Toy Industries of Europe (TIE). “Free, fair and sustainable trade is key for our industry to leverage its strengths. The EU-Mercosur agreement is one of the key Free Trade Agreements that can foster multilateralism across regions. Without such fundamental agreements, it will become increasingly difficult for Europe to maintain its competitiveness, also in comparison with other leading nations such as China or the USA. The ratification of EU-Mercosur agreement should be a priority on Europe’s agenda,” said Marco Mensink, Cefic Director General. Finalized in 2019, the EU-Mercosur agreement provides for a gradual reduction of nearly 90% in customs duties between the two zones over a period of 10 to 15 years depending on the sector. However, its signature and ratification came up against the hostility of a large proportion of citizens, opposition from the European agricultural sector, and hostility from several left-wing political forces. The agreement has also raised many questions about its impact on the environment."

The subsidiary of Air Liquide Healthcare, which specializes in the manufacture of specialty ingredients, has unveiled a new clinical study demonstrating the efficacy on hair of active ingredient Ceramosides, obtained from wheat lipids and rich in phytoceramides. A gold standard clinical study was carried out on a panel of women of all ages suffering from non-pathological hair loss. In only three months, the results highlighted significant effects on various key hair parameters: – A significant growth by 12.5% in hair length vs. placebo;
– A 2-fold increase in the number of hairs in the growth phase: +11,000 (vs. less than 5,000 for the placebo group);
– A significant reduction by 27% in hair loss vs. placebo;
– A significant improvement in hair resistance to breakage through enhanced hair elasticity;
– A significant reduction of scalp sebum in women with a tendency towards oiliness. This new study thus extends the field of application of Ceramosides, whose anti-aging and moisturizing efficacy on the skin has already been proven by three clinical studies. “At a time when one in two women is likely to suffer from excessive hair loss in their lifetime [1], the hair care segment is increasingly gaining interest within the global nutricosmetics market,” said Seppic in a statement. “The maintenance and renewal of healthy hair is directly correlated with its lipid composition. This is why ceramides, known for their involvement in the formation of intracellular lipids, play a key role and act as a barrier protecting the hair cuticle.” Ceramosides is vegan, guaranteed with no GMOs, no additives, no preservatives and is gluten-free. It is also certified kosher and is available in organic grade."

The Body Shop has a long history of using textiles as tools for change, upcycled tote bags, aprons, t-shirts, scarves – all designed to communicate our Canadian activism efforts over the years. With the textiles stitched together to shape a map of Toronto, the quilt represents the power of community, and The Body Shop’s long history of changemaking in Canada. Key features at the workshop stores include: – A central sink area where customers can smell, lather and test The Body Shop’s best-loved products.
– A gifting station for people to personalize gifts with ribbons and recyclable paper.
– A dedicated ACT area that gives customers the chance to learn about and engage with issues that impact their communities.
– A refill station where customers can take The Body Shop’s 300ml aluminum bottle and fill it up with any 12 of the brand’s best-loved shower gels, shampoos, conditioners and hand washes.
– Sustainable countertops that are created from recycled plastic destined for landfill.
– A range of upcycled and reclaimed materials such as reclaimed wood and part-recycled plastic storage crates."
Boots to shut 300 stores across UK over the next year despite strong growth,"Despite posting strong sales over the latest quarter, British health and beauty retail chain intends to continue cutting store numbers in the UK. Boots has announced plans to close a further 300 stores across the UK in the next year. This will result in 1,900 branches left across the UK from a base of 2,200, however Boots does not plan redundancies as staff will be offered work at nearby stores. “In addition to uplifting existing stores, over the next year Boots will continue to consolidate a number of stores in close proximity to each other. Evolving the store estate in this way allows Boots to concentrate its team members where they are needed and focus investment more acutely in individual stores with the ambition of consistently delivering an excellent and reliable service in a fresh and up to date environment,” said the retailer in a statement. During the three months ended 31 May 2023, Boots’ retail sales grew by 13.4%. The retailer said it represents its ninth consecutive quarter of market share growth with gains across all categories, led by beauty. Indeed, beauty sales were up over 18% year on year, led by skincare and May saw the biggest week for the category outside of Christmas. City centre flagship and travel stores saw the biggest increase, while digital sales also continued to grow, up 25.2% year on year. Overall, e-commerce is a very dynamic channel for beauty products in the United Kingdom and the phenomenon has only increased since the pandemic. A trend that probably explains the retailer’s desire to close its less profitable stores in the country. ""Our focus on offering our customers the best in healthcare and beauty, together with a continued commitment to great value, has been well received, and it is lovely to see more people choosing to shop with Boots. It is particularly pleasing to see our owned brands proving popular, including an exceptional No7 performance,” said Seb James, Managing Director, Boots UK and ROI."

Through this operation, Kering Beauté acquires a brand whose growth potential is perceived as significant, particularly in China, in thebtravel retail and in e-commerce channels, as well as in new categories, including women’s fragrances, and body and home products. The move also provides Kering Beauté with the required scale, as well as a platform supporting the future development of other fragrance franchises, by leveraging in particular Creed’s global distribution network and its production site near Fontainebleau, France. “The acquisition of Creed represents Kering Beauté’s first strategic initiative, and demonstrates our commitment to developing a strong position in the luxury beauty segment.

TNT designed the latest Loubimar miniature for Louboutin Beauty,"The Spanish group Puig entrusted TNT Group with the creation of the Loubimar 9ml miniature, echoing the 90ml size of the Loubimar Eau de Parfum Légère. This is the fourth miniature that TNT Group has designed for the Louboutin Beauty Loubiworld 11-miniature collection, that is now presented in a newly unveiled box. The stylized cap recalls the marine world that inspired this eau de parfum with notes of citrus and salt water. It is adorned with a ship’s anchor and mooring line posed delicately upon a sea urchin and is finished with a rose-gold e-coating. A PP (polypropylene) insert ensures its retention. Producing this new cap was a real challenge for TNT Group, due to its small size. TNT Group had already produced the three miniatures with orange-gold e-coated caps, for the Middle East collection, whose level of precision is just as impressive for such a small format. For example, there is a great quality of detail in the representation of the scarab, the snake and the falcon. This 100% recyclable creation celebrates the association between luxury and sustainability, while retaining the essence of Maison Louboutin."

"TikTok’s multi-use makeup trend claims to save time, money and the planet","‘Multi-use makeup’, TikTok’s latest viral beauty tip, which has now racked up over seven million views, involves using just one product for your entire beauty routine. According to its promoters, it’s a time- and money-saving hack, which also helps to protect the environment by banishing a whole load of plastic from the bathroom. User @EhlieLuna, with over 35,000 followers, is the creator of one of the most viewed multi-use makeup tutorials on TikTok. In this short video, we see her crafting her entire beauty look with a single product, in this case a matte liquid lipstick from Sephora. And contrary to what you might think, the young woman doesn’t just use it to enhance her lips, but also uses it as eyeshadow and blush. This trick hasn’t gone unnoticed, and has even gained quite a following with a lot of positive reactions about the beautiful result, and the fact it can also be a means to save time and money while consuming less plastic. A word of warning, however: not all cosmetics are designed to be applied anywhere on the face and body! Some sensitive areas, such as around the eye, require suitable products. This is by no means the first time that users of a social network have used a beauty product, or any other object, for something completely different from its intended function. In recent years, TikTokers have got creative using a lip pencil to create a smoky eye, swapping their primer for lube, using an eyebrow pencil to get the perfect shade of lipstick, or using a blush to camouflage under-eye bags and dark circles. All these tricks have not only gone viral, but have also been adopted by many brands, including beauty giants."

It will be the responsibility of the Executive Management to ensure the operational management of the business and the implementation of short and medium-term strategies. “While the group has become heavily internationalized over the past ten years and is facing significant challenges, Bris Rocher is initiating this new governance structure to adapt the group to market changes and maximize its future development.

Afyren Neoxy delivers first batches of low-carbon biobased molecules,"The greentech company specializing in the production of bio-based, low-carbon ingredients using a unique fermentation technology based on a fully circular model has delivered the first batches from its Afyren Neoxy plant, located in Carling-Saint Avold, East of France. Inaugurated at the end of 2022, Afyren Neoxy – the world’s first plant for the industrial-scale production of bio-based carboxylic acids from sugar beet by-products – has already manufactured several metric tons of acids and delivered the first batches. “The production and delivery of the first lots of biobased organic acids from the Afyren Neoxy plant marks an important stage in the industrial start-up of this first-of-its-kind plant. These significant achievements are the fruit of the highly motivated Afyren and Afyren Neoxy teams, whose commitment I salute. I would also like to thank our customers for their unfailing support for our innovative project. We will now continue to ramp up our production to meet the expectations of our customers. Faced with growing demand from manufacturers for rapidly available biobased alternatives, we are working in parallel to increase our production capacity, particularly internationally. More than ever, we are motivated to make a low-carbon and circular industry possible by providing biobased solutions built with our partners to benefit the environment,” said Nicolas Sordet, CEO of Afyren. Afyren has previously announced commercial commitments for 75% [1] of Afyren Neoxy’s annual production of acids and 100% of the fertilizer, representing total cumulative sales of more than EUR 165 [2] million, to be realized over the coming financial years. Afyren’s teams are constantly working to make operations more reliable, with a view to starting continuous production in the autumn of 2023. Afyren then plans to gradually ramp up volumes to produce 16,000 tons of carboxylic acids per year at full capacity, for total annual sales (including fertilizer sales) of around EUR 35 million [3]."
LVMH brings Tap to Pay on iPhone to its US stores,"At this year’s Viva Technology show, LVMH announced that it will begin rolling out Tap to Pay on iPhone to select LVMH Group stores in the United States later this year. Introduced by Apple in February 2022, Tap to Pay provides an easy, secure and private way to accept in-person contactless payments using iPhone. With Tap to Pay on iPhone, client advisors in the US stores of the LVMH Group will have the possibility to accept Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets anywhere in the store simply by using their iPhone and a partner-enabled iOS app. No additional hardware is needed, regardless of the purchase amount. Tap to Pay on iPhone will be available in the LVMH Group Houses in the US later this year, starting with Sephora, Christian Dior Couture, Celine, Tiffany & Co. and Louis Vuitton. “Our stores are the prime showcase for the excellence of the products we create, and we do everything possible to guarantee that the customer experience is absolutely impeccable, from the moment people walk in the door to payment for a purchase. The introduction of Tap to Pay on iPhone in LVMH US stores will contribute to offering our customers a purchase experience that is fluid, transparent and protected. This solution also reflects the growing demand among our customers for contactless payment and digital wallet transactions,” says Franck Le Moal, LVMH Group IT Director. Apple’s Tap to Pay on iPhone technology uses the built-in features of iPhone to keep the customers’ data private and secure. When a payment is processed, Apple doesn’t store card numbers on the device or on Apple servers. The introduction of Tap to Pay on iPhone is the next step in the LVMH Group’s clienteling strategy. To date, all the group’s customer advisors are equipped with a dedicated clienteling app allowing them to access the product catalog as well as various CRM tools, and offer customers tailor-made support in their buying journey."
BASF expands capacity for bio-based APGs to meet demand for green surfactants,"The German chemicals giant has announced it would increase its global alkyl polyglucosides (APGs) production capacity with two expansions at its sites in Bangpakong, Thailand, and Cincinnati, Ohio. This expansion in two regions in parallel will help BASF to address the increasing demand for bio-based surfactants, and serve customers even faster and with more flexibility, while reducing cross-regional volume flows. The additional capacities are expected to come on stream in 2025. “With this investment, we will solidify our position as a leading supplier of APGs in all relevant industries,” said Mary Kurian, President Care Chemicals. “Both our customers and consumers around the world are aware of the importance of sustainable formulations. At BASF, we are committed to providing sustainable products with strong performance. This expansion will enable the future of bio-based and biodegradable surfactants worldwide by offering diverse applications.” BASF currently produces APGs in Düsseldorf, Germany; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Jinshan, China.

Sweet Paradox: Chromavis’ new proposal at MakeUp in Paris 2023,"On the occasion of MakeUp in Paris 2023 Chromavis presents Sweet Paradox, a quest to venture beyond the expected definition of performance and colour of a make-up product. This new proposal focuses on multiplied product identities, unimaginable colour results and indefinable sensorialities that challenge the senses in the most diverse ways. The Sweet Paradox concept is explored through three collections which focus respectively on the three main features of a make-up product: sensoriality, colour, and performance. “Untold Senses” collection represents a hymn to investigating new forms of expression through unbiased creativity. Going beyond existing definitions, the collection encapsulates ultra-concentrated fluids with an ethereal lightness, powders with transformative and indefinably touches, flares of color that melt into misty blur tones, textures of unexpected plasticity and pure-light payoffs that come in breath-taking visuals with spectacular reliefs. “Spare Spectra” collection ventures into unknown kaleidoscopes. The paradoxical nature of the notion of colour itself is here explored in new forms, going as far as imagination can extend.  Products showcase new possibilities of colour artistry, boldly pairing warm and cool shades, walking the fine line between blur and shine, playing with daring visuals and shifting tones, revealing the softest creamy core of glassy crystals. “Altered Ego”  collection acts as a reminder of the illusory nature of physical perceptions: nothing ever is as it seems. Resulting in renewed trompe l’oeil illusions, the textures look identical yet boast completely opposite performances. Visuals have contrasting appearing consistencies while being made of the same make-up formula. Packaging solutions act as doubles, containing multiple versions of the same product, or allowing for various possible applications and results. For the first time, Chromavis will also present a special collection to introduce its ‘Atelier Service’. A business model that provides influencers, creators and brands with smart cosmetic creations, offering full marketing services, operational support, and a never-before-seen time to market. Featuring the “Wild Harmony” collection that recalls the iconic effortless-chic Parisian attitude, formulated with Atelier best-selling clean, highly natural, and talc-free formulas, presented in sustainable packaging solutions.

"’Cherry Cola Lips’, the lipstick shade that makes the buzz on social networks","It’s not a tip or a hack that’s currently buzzing on TikTok, but rather a lipstick shade, dubbed ’Cherry Cola Lips’ in reference to a famous sparkling drink. The shade has become the star of the summer. The words ’Cherry Cola’ are currently running wild on social media, with no fewer than 64 million views on TikTok. Through this hashtag, users can find numerous tutorials entirely dedicated to lip makeup, detailing different ways — gloss, pencils, lipsticks, or a combination of all three — to achieve the coveted shade. And that’s not all, since the #CherryColaLips hashtag has racked up over 2.5 million views to date, with several beauty bosses – including makeup artist, influencer and brand owner Huda Kattan – having already tried and tested this tasty new shade. The ’Cherry Cola’ shade is essentially a bright, vibrant red that gradually turns darker red, then brown, like the colour of the fruity soda. In her video, Huda Kattan first uses a brown lip pencil, which she applies around the contour and gently blends over the edge of the lips. She then finishes with a matte red lipstick to fill in the lips, before adding a final stroke of brown pencil to accentuate the ’Cola’ effect. But techniques vary from user to user, the idea being simply to recreate the viral shade as best as possible. There’s nothing revolutionary about using brown lip liner — as anyone already doing their makeup in the 1990s can testify. However, back then, the idea was to combine a brown contour with a transparent gloss, and not such a vibrant lipstick colour. So, are bold colours back? The fact is that the shade hasn’t just made its mark in the world of makeup. Actually, it could also become the star hair colour as we head into summer, this time dubbed #CherryCokeHair and with some 20 million views and counting on TikTok."

Texen: A cap made of RPET for Yves Saint Laurent’s All Hours new foundation,"Yves Saint Laurent’s new All Hours foundation promises full coverage and staying power with a luminous matt finish without caking. Mirroring that of the Libre fragrance, its packaging sports a new design with the YSL logo as its standout feature. The Yves Saint Laurent logo enlaces the cap like a vine, a decorative feature which, when added to the technical challenge of a manufacturing a lid made with recycled content, demanded both audacity on the technical front and industrial maturity on the part of Texen’s teams. In line with the brand’s expectations and its environmental commitments, which Texen shares, the project involved adopting new-generation materials. Texen pushed the boundaries of its industrial capabilities with a dual challenge: esthetic imperatives and the use of RPET. The cap is a single part thanks to in-mould engraving of the logo, for which the thickness of the relief added complexity. In order to optimize the conception of industrial tooling, Texen’s teams relied on rheological research. As such, the experts were able to perfect the various injection parameters, anticipating the performance of the material to avoid gluing lines so the moulded part would be completely uniform. “This expertise perfected over time offers a major advantage when product specifications are both technical and esthetic,” said Texen in a statement. The second complex operation was the decoration of the cap and the hot-stamping of the décor in a single pass. “This technically complex product and the use of recycled material required close collaboration between Texen’s technical and development teams at the service of the brand,” concludes the company."

Oriflame chooses Albéa’s (Re)flex recyclable tubes for its Duologi range,"Swedish brand Oriflame relies on Albéa’s (Re)flex 2 technology for two products of its new hair care brand Duologi. The Duologi Rich Creme Conditioner and Duologi Light Creme Conditioner both feature a Reflex 2 tube, an aluminium-free, plastic barrier laminate (PBL), combined with a low-profile cap. Albéa’s (Re)flex 2 technology is RecyClass approved and fully compatible with the European rigid high-density polyethylene (HDPE) recycling stream. “Developing more sustainable, responsible and innovative packaging, as well as formulation, is our core value and focus area,” explains Asimina Lulja, Packaging Technologist at Oriflame. “The Duologi range has been designed in alignment with our sustainability goals. The combination of a (Re)flex 2 tube with a low-profile cap provides a reduced carbon footprint while contributing to the circularity of plastics as both components can be recycled.” For the cap, the brand opted for a PP Slight Cap, one of the lightest on the market. “We are honoured to support Oriflame Cosmetics deliver on their sustainable development commitment with this eco-designed solution,” says Aude Laclaire, Sustainability Director at Albéa Tubes. “This long-term partnership is key to drive the ambitious sustainability targets of both our companies in accordance with the upcoming packaging regulations, and more largely to support the plastic industry transformation towards lower carbon solutions,” she adds."
Seppic’s Solagum Tara also helps to formulate more natural hair care,"The hair care market is transforming itself! To meet consumer demand for more natural ingredients, brands are modifying their formulas and, according to Mintel, naturalness claims in these products have been growing strongly over the last five years [1]. To help brands better address consumers demands, Seppic has teste the effectiveness of Solagum Tara [2] in hair care formulations. Launched in 2012, Solagum Tara is a polysaccharide derived from Tara seeds, an emblematic shrub native to the Andean valleys of Peru. According to Seppic, this natural gum can be used to thicken and stabilize emulsions and cream-gels and also acts as a texturizing agent by providing them with a structuring effect and soft feel. According to Seppic, thanks to its high thickening power, Solagum Tara has demonstrated equivalent performance to Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), a common ingredient in hair care formulations, while offering a better natural and sensorial profile. Indeed, Solagum Tara is 100% natural origin, according to the ISO 16128 standard, and easily biodegradable, according to the OECD 301F standard. “In a more minimalist formulation approach, Solagum Tara is also an ally of choice for hair formulas because, in addition to thickening, it plays a role in controlling volume and frizz in curly hair care,” adds Seppic in a statement."
Coty to explore dual listing on Paris Stock Exchange,"Already listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the U.S. cosmetics maker is considering a second listing in Paris, with the aim of strengthening its presence in Europe and attracting new investors. According to the group; such a decision would be consistent with Coty’s 100+ year heritage in France and its substantial business footprint in Europe. If the company initiates a listing process on the Paris Stock Exchange, Coty Inc. would become a dual listed company on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Paris Stock Exchange. Luxury and beauty groups today play a preponderant role in the Parisian stock market. LVMH, Kering, Hermès and L’Oréal currently reach a cumulative market value close to 1,000 billion euros, representing almost 40% of the CAC 40, the stock market’s flagship index. “Paris is the historic home of beauty, and the industry still holds a special attraction for investors there,” said Peter Harf, Coty’s Chairman. In support of this move, Coty also highlights the results obtained since the appointment of Sue Y. Nabi as CEO in September 2020, which have been reflected in the “quadrupling of the group’s market capitalization.” “The Board’s interest in exploring a potential listing on the Paris Stock Exchange has been made possible thanks to the progress Coty has made under Sue’s leadership. We have seen consistent growth over the last 10 quarters, in line with or ahead of market expectations, underpinned by targeted investment, disciplined cost controls and a clear debt reduction program,” added Peter Harf."

When it comes to use on a daily basis, YouTube is followed by Facebook, then Line and then TikTok, fifth in the top at 60.5%.

Banderas entrusts FaiveleyTech for the cap of their latest women’s fragrance,"FaiveleyTech, a French-based group specialized in plastic injection, through its Beauty Business Unit in Orgelet manufacturing site, produced the cap for Icon, the latest women’s fragrance by Banderas Perfumes. While the packaging of the men’s fragrance offered sharp and sober lines, in bluish tones and graded transparency, the women’s version is distinguished by an assumed roundness and sensuality, enhanced by the power of a bright pink. By combining PET and recycled material, the cap was developed in line with eco-design principles and circularity in sight. It incorporates a part of recycled material (thus requiring less virgin PET for a lower carbon footprint) while being recyclable in the existing streams. The overmoulding process, the need to have no injection point visible from the outside, as well as the round shape, the massive single-piece structure, and the perfect match between the cap and the bottle implied to overcome a series of technical challenges.

With its 100% biodegradable formula, Geogaia enriches Givaudan’s Gaia collection, already featuring Phytogaia — which captures the wellbeing benefits of molecules emitted by forest trees – and Thalassogaia – which mimicks the composition of the marine environment. “Demonstrating the emotional dimension of this new creation, 81% of consumers observed an “After the Rain” olfactive effect in the compositions containing a significant level of Geogaia, describing a pleasant natural outdoor sensation [1]. Being the most accurate translation of this universally evocative wet weather smell, Geogaia opens new creative perspectives, across all product categories,” said Stéphanie Martin, Home Care Category Director. Givaudan added that Geogaia aligns with their objective of achieving a biodegradable fragrance palette by 2030, and of being climate positive by 2050."
Groupe GM relaunches its’ Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle amenity line,"The international expert of guest amenities has relaunched the luxurious line created in partnership with Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. A true perfume lover, Frédéric Malle’s decision to found Editions de Parfums in 2000 was driven by his ambition to revive quality and authenticity in the increasingly commercial perfume world of the mid-1990s. He also truly believed in the idea of perfumers being artists. The concept of Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle was thus born: a publishing house for perfume, where scents are created and published as unique works of art. The new hotel line leverages on Eau de Magnolia, which was created by America’s perfumer Carlos Benaïm.  The fragrance smells of blooming citrus. Carried by a woody undercurrent, a citric balance of bergamot, lemon and grapefruit evolves towards darker notes of oak moss and patchouli. The Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle hotel line features iconic red 40ml plant-based tubes of shampoos, conditioner, body wash, and body lotion tubes. They are also available in a 50ml and 80ml cylindrical bottle format reminiscent of the brand’s perfume bottles. These products, as well as a luxurious bath foam can also be found in elegant 50ml black aluminium tube packaging. Two perfumed soaps in pleat wrap available in 30g and 50g, and a modern wooden tray printed with the brand’s name complete the line. For an even lower environmental footprint, larger format dispensers of 300ml and 400ml have also been added to the amenity line. The Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle hotel line now features body wash, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and hand wash in 300ml large-capacity Ecopump dispensers made from bio-based plastics. Several secure wall bracket options are available in combination with the Ecopump made of stainless steelor black or white ABS plastic and can be fixed to the wall with screws or double-sided tape. The range also offers 400ml liquids in Groupe GM’s new Ghost packaging format. As its name suggests, Ghost is a dispenser fixed on a hidden rail which gives the impression that the product is levitating. This eco-designed large-capacity dispenser of 400 ml is made from sugarcane and lasts around 40 days. Its’ level of product is easily visible thanks to a discreet visibility window. Tamper proof, it can be removed with a secured key when empty. Finally, the Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle amenities also comes in the refillable dispenser Ecofill, which is refilled with up to 400ml sealed pouches made with only 8g of plastic, for a minimum packaging and total cosmetic traceability. Ecofill is also available in a 300ml black aluminium format. Ecofill bottles also come with a stainless steel or ABS recyclable plastic wall bracket that can be fastened to the wall using two screws or double-sided adhesive tape. A black aluminium base can be used to place it on bathroom furniture. Groupe GM consistently prioritizes the usage of plant-based materials, post-industry or post-consumer recycled plastics and the sourcing of 100% renewable raw materials. “We are delighted to update this successful collaboration and introduce more eco-friendly amenities to this luxurious line. Similar to the Frédéric Malle vision, we at Groupe GM, are constantly striving for creativity, quality and innovation. This line deeply reflects our core values and will enable hotels worldwide to pamper their guests with expertly fragranced amenities,” said Laurent Marchand, President of Groupe GM."

The Body Shop CEO David Boynton steps down,"Brazilian cosmetics giant Natura &Co has announced David Boynton is stepping down as Chief Executive of The Body Shop. Ian Bickley, member of the Natura &Co Board, has been appointed as interim CEO. Boynton was named CEO in late 2017, following Natura’s acquisition of The Body Shop from L’Oréal in June the same year. He was previously the CEO of British men’s clothing chain Charles Tyrwhitt and also held several positions at L’Occitane during a 10-year period. In a statement, Natura thanked David Boynton for having led a brand and business transformation following the acquisition and having steered the company through “extraordinary circumstances”, including the global pandemic, the war in Ukraine, supply chain and cost inflation challenges, and consumer uncertainty. Succeeding David Boynton, interim CEO Ian Bickley is an expert in the retail and branded consumer goods sector, with a successful track record in accelerating the international growth of Coach and Crocs. In his new role, Ian will be working closely with The Body Shop’s Executive Leadership Team to refine and expand upon the current business plan and accelerate the transformation agenda, to speed up the road to profitability together with a return to sustainable revenue. He will also be working closely with Natura &Co Leadership to find a permanent successor to David. “Ian’s experience and insights during his tenure will be invaluable in shaping the future of The Body Shop,” added the group."
"As U.S. consumers spending decreases, product innovation is much needed","In March 2023, discretionary U.S. general merchandise retail sales revenue fell 7%, compared to March 2022, and unit sales fell 8%, which is double the average monthly declines in January and February. These steeper sales declines remained consistent during the last three weeks of March, spanning both units and dollars for the first time this year, according to Circana, the new market intelligence firm formed by the fusion of IRI and The NPD Group. “Consumers are beginning to spend less on both discretionary and essential purchases with more consistency,” said Marshal Cohen, chief retail industry advisor for Circana. “In order to create some spending elevation, there needs to be new products and new ways of thinking to reflect the changed consumer behavior and retail landscape.” Simultaneously, Circana notes that product innovation has reached a historical low. “Before the pandemic, new general merchandise products represented more than 5% of the market. By the end of 2022, that number was less than 2%,” underlined the market research firm. Indeed, investment in new product development was put on hold due to uncertainties caused by the pandemic and most companies adjusted priorities to fulfill demand while addressing supply chain issues, and then focused on selling excess inventory. “One of the biggest retail casualties of the pandemic has been the availability of new and refreshed products for consumers, and now economic uncertainty is putting even more pressure on the consumer’s interest in spending,” said Cohen, “Manufacturers and retailers need to broadcast their value and prove their worth to the consumer now, in order to avoid a downward spiral later.” According to Circana, the trends in consumer spending and new product deficits in the marketplace have directional similarities that are intensified by elevated prices. Compounding these consumer distractions are news stories about inflation and bank insolvencies that continue to raise consumer concerns about the economy, which can adversely affect consumer sentiment and spending."
Pai opts for a 100% PCR version of Cosmogen’s Needle tube,"For the new and improved version of its Feather Canyon “cloud-light” eye cream, Pai has chosen the Cosmogen’s Needle tube in a version made with 100% PCR plastic version, with a removable cooling metal precision tip for an efficient application. “With its ultra-thin cannula, the Needle tube was particularly indicated for Pai’s ultra-targeted eye contour care.

By creating a new version of one of its bestsellers, Pai wanted to improve the product’s skin care benefits but also reduce its environmental footprint. “We would never recreate a bestselling product unless we believed we could make it exponentially better through true innovation. This latest release of our beloved Feather Canyon is better for both skin and planet, with an enhanced Hyaluronic Acid-fuelled formula and impeccable sustainability credentials – including the use of zero-waste Argan, Sweet Almond, Safflower and Sunflower Oils. It’s part of our commitment to keep evolving our products and business – and leading the march to be first to drive real change wherever we can. Updating and improving existing products is what we should be doing as an industry, rather than adding more and more similar products to our portfolio for perceived newness.

Cosnova removes 100% of microplastic particles from its cosmetic products,"Since March 2023, all products by Cosnova’s brands essence  and Catrice  are completely free of microplastic particles [1]. This is a result of a decision dating back to 2020, when the German beauty player decided to remove microplastic particles from all its ranges of cosmetic products. According to the Sulzbach-headquartered company, each year in Germany, 977 tonnes of microplastics are released into the environment through wastewater from washing off cosmetics and cleaning products. However, cosmetics only account for a small part of microplastics that area released in the environment (between 0.1 and 4 percent of the total): for instance, the highest proportion of microplastic particles in Germany is caused by tyre wear. “Even decorative cosmetics contribute to water pollution with microplastic particles. I am very proud that we have now succeeded in permanently removing the particles from the products of our brands,"" says Katrin Steinbach, Technical Unit Expert Corporate Responsibility at Cosnova. To curb the enormous impact of these tiny, solid insoluble and non-biodegradable plastic particles, Cosnova began updating its formulas in 2020. However, switching to microplastic particle-free formulas with the same quality is not easy. Indeed, microplastic particles have been very popular in the cosmetics industry for a long time. They can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different effects: for example, they can mattify, give the skin a soft feel or make the product last longer on the skin. ""Microplastics cannot be replaced one-to-one, nor can they be removed retrospectively. We had to completely renew our formulas to make them work without the plastic particles. Together with project partners and our own project team, we went through every single product and tested alternative ingredients, especially natural substances such as corn or rice starch. But it was worth the effort,"" says Katrin Steinbach. However, Cosnova is not stopping at the elimination of microplastic particles and is also working on formulas that are free of volatile silicones. “The spectrum of silicones and their applications is very broad, as is their health and environmental relevance. Like microplastics, these synthetic plastics enter the environment via wastewater, where they are difficult to break down,” says the German group. Cosnova therefore aims to completely eliminate volatile silicones from its formulas by 2025."
Silab puts the spotlight on its CSR program via an eco-designed website,"At the occasion of the 2023 edition of the in-cosmetics Global trade show, the manufacturer of cosmetic ingredients unveiled its new website dedicated to its CSR program: activelycaring.silab.fr/en Dubbed “Actively Caring”, Silab’s CSR program that sets down the company’s multi-year objectives and action plans for sustainable development. “It is based on a highly transversal vision comprising five major pillars: sustainable strategy, development of human potential, responsible sourcing, preserved environment and societal dimension,” said Silab in a statement. With a view toward transparency with all of its stakeholders, Silab has chosen to develop a website dedicated to this program, explaining the initiatives implemented by the company and whose purpose is to replace the paper report published annually until now. This site enables users to easily obtain the desired information, whether it is overall views or factual and precise elements. It also highlights the main initiatives of the current year. “CSR is an important component of our development strategy. By bringing this new site on line, it is our desire to give it heightened visibility and to bring a new impulse to our Actively Caring program. We also want to provide our partners with the latest news and data, made possible by this new format that will enable us to update the contents very regularly,” explains Jean-Philippe Cosson, General Manager of Sales, International subsidiaries and CSR at Silab. For this development, Silab has opted for an eco-designed site consistent with digital simplicity, available in both English and French. The environmental impact of consulting websites is steadily increasing, and so this site was designed to reduce energy consumption by the suitable technical and editorial choices such as: green hosting, responsible development, “mobile first” design, streamlined design, seamless user experience, relevant contents, only essential functions and a measurement of impact. “This technical challenge is part of Silab’s overall sustainable development strategy, focusing on continuous improvement,” highlights the company.

Pierre Fabre acquires dermo-cosmetic brand Même,"The Pierre Fabre Group has acquired Même, the first French dermo-cosmetic brand for patients experiencing the side effects of cancer treatments. A minority shareholder for 5 years, Pierre Fabre has acquired the remaining capital from the co-founders and the Eutopia investment fund specializing in “emerging consumer brands”, via its Otium Consumer fund. Launched in 2017 by Judith Levy Keller and Juliette Couturier, who will continue to manage the company, Même has won over the hearts of people affected by cancer by offering the first skin, scalp and nail care range, developed in collaboration with oncologists and dermatologists, to address the side effects of cancer treatments. “With the Pierre Fabre teams, we will be able to develop excellent synergies to accelerate our development, particularly on the international front, and turn our dream into reality: making MÊME accessible to those who need it, everywhere in the world and for many years to come,” said Judith Levy Keller and Juliette Couturier, co-founders of Même. The brand was born following the painful personal experiences of the co-founders. Judith Levy and Juliette Couturier have first-hand experience of the physical (adverse effects on the skin, mucous membranes and hair) and psychological difficulties that cancer patients often encounter both during and after their treatments. They refused to accept defeat and created a range of dermo-cosmetic care products and make-up based on natural ingredients, with formulas that have been tested to guarantee tolerance and efficacy. According to Frédéric Ennabli, CEO of Pierre Fabre, Même – which has established itself as a reference brand when it comes to heal skin damaged by cancer treatments – is a perfect fit with Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetics’ mission to provide solutions for skin conditions and improve the lives of patients and consumers. The acquisition of Même by Pierre Fabre signals the continuation of the commercial partnership signed in December 2017. For three years, the sales network of the Eau Thermale Avène brand introduced the philosophy and products of Même in pharmacies and drugstores. Today, the brands offers a portfolio of 46 products, in 4,800 pharmacies and drugstores, as well as on its online store. The brand is already distributed in 10 other countries (Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Morocco, Romania, Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy and, more recently, China) with significant potential for growth in numerous markets. “Through this acquisition, we confirm  our strategy of investing in innovative  brands and products in our priority areas of oncology, dermatology and dermo-cosmetics. Through its positioning, MÊME is at the very crossroads of these 3 strategic priorities. When I first met Judith and Juliette 5 years ago, I realized very quickly that we shared common values and that their project had strong development potential. We will now continue to write this meaningful story together in service to those affected by cancer,” concluded Eric Ducournau, CEO of the Pierre Fabre Group."

DNA & Cosmetics call on to a mobilization for botanicals traceability,"Created two years ago under the impulsion of DNA Gensee (a small sized company specializing in the DNA analysis of plants, algae and beehive products), the DNA & Cosmetics consortium aims to guarantee the traceability of plant-based raw materials. At the beginning of March, a new step was taken with the signing of a pre-consortium agreement by the historical players. This new phase is accompanied by a call for applications for companies, cosmetic groups and ingredient suppliers, wishing to join the first cosmetics consortium serving the traceability of natural resources through DNA analysis.

Maison Sambin chooses Aptar’s Silk pump for a sensual dispensing,"Maison Sambin is the first brand to leverage Aptar Beauty’s patented Silk diffusion technology, which was launched in 2021 within the Inune range. The result of five years of research and development, Silk by Aptar offers a spray described as “continuous and ultra-soft, like a veil of perfume.” The traditional one-way insert is replaced by a new-generation nozzle with multiple micro-holes, allowing a better diffusion of the fragrance on the skin to optimize sensation. Dosage depends on the duration and force of pressure exerted on the pump. The ultra-fine and gradual diffusion can be up to ten times longer than that of a classic spray. The spray-pump thus helps to highlight the sensorial benefits of fragrances, bestowing “the enveloping feeling of a veil on the skin.” “Indie prestige brands tend to have pioneering approaches that inspire, stimulate and revolutionize the beauty market. The innovative Silk by Aptar perfume experience combined with the essence of the Maison Sambin is definitely in line with this trend,” Patrick Bousquel, Marketing Director Beauty EMEA, Aptar Beauty. Luxury French fragrance house Maison Sambin offers genderless fragrances. The brand strives to pay tribute to the African diasporas. Their first collection features three fragrances – Osun, Oya, and Shango – are inspired from divinities of the west Africa’s Yoruba people. The entire collection is equipped with the Silk by Aptar spray. “The softness of the spray offers a unique olfactory and sensory experience that seems to suspend time, reinforcing our values, as each perfume tells its own story. The new Silk spray is a breath of fragrance filled with history. We are truly proud to be one of its pioneers,” commented Erold Sambin, Maison Sambin Founder & Artistic Director. From the design to the filling, all the brand’s perfumes are made in France. The same goes for the Silk pump, which is manufactured at Aptar’s fragrance facility in Le Neubourg, in the Normandy region."

Natura &Co sells Aesop to L’Oréal for USD 2.525 billion,"Brazil’s Natura &Co has agreed to sell Aesop to French beauty giant L’Oréal as part of an agreement valuing the Australian luxury cosmetics brand at USD 2.525 billion. Acquired by Natura & Co in 2012, Aēsop was created in 1987. The brand is renowned globally for its skin, hair and body products. With its signature amber packaging, plant-based ingredients, sustainable vegan formulations, and its bespoke customer service, Aēsop has evolved into a global brand available across luxury retail, beauty, and hospitality locations around the world. Aēsop currently operates around 400 points of sale across the Americas, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, with a nascent footprint in China where the first store opened in 2022. The brand posted sales of USD 537 million in 2022. Natura &Co says the sale of Aesop will help the group reduce debt while freeing up resources for its strategic priorities, such as strengthening the Avon brand in Latin America, and improving The Body Shop operations. “With a strengthened financial structure and a deleveraged balance sheet, Natura &Co, exercising strict financial discipline, will be able to sharpen its focus on its strategic priorities, notably our investment plan in Latin America,” explains Fábio Barbosa, Chief Executive Officer of Natura &Co. Aesop will be integrated into the luxury division of the L’Oréal group, with the aim of reaching a turnover of one billion dollars. “I am very excited to welcome Aēsop and its teams to the L’Oréal Groupe family. Aēsop is the epitome of avant-garde beauty, whose products are not only made with great care and exceptional attention to detail; they are a superb combination of urbanity, hedonism and undeniable luxury. Aēsop taps into all of today’s ascending currents and L’Oréal will contribute to unleash its massive growth potential, notably in China and Travel retail,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, Chief Executive Officer, L’Oréal Group. The closing is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and is expected to close in Q3 2023. “Targeted acquisitions of emerging and established players with engaged audiences have allowed L’Oréal to stay relevant in the rapidly evolving beauty industry. L’Oréal has employed this strategy to consistently align with shifts in consumer behavior and preferences, and its latest acquisition of Aesop is no different. Aesop’s clean aesthetic resonates with Gen Z and Millennial consumers and although its products have a high price tag – a 500ml hand soap is GBP 31 (EUR 35) – it has broad appeal that enabled it to launch in various premium retailers. Aesop’s products will continue to resonate with the 38% of global consumers who associate high quality products and ingredients in the beauty & grooming industry with value for money, as identified in GlobalData’s 2022 Q4 Global Consumer Survey,"" commented Lia Neophytou, Lead Analyst of Health & Hygiene at GlobalData."
Bolloré Logistics launches an air charter service between Singapore and Hainan,"To support the growth of the travel retail market in Hainan, Bolloré Logistics recently launched a new air charter service. The air charter service will operate weekly from Singapore to Haikou via Hong Kong. With these flights, Bolloré Logistics intends to provide perfumes and cosmetics, and luxury retail brands with secured transport capacity to grow in the Hainan market. The service offers end-to-end monitoring for both Dangerous Goods (DG) and Non-Dangerous Goods (Non-DG). “Coupled with the warehousing capabilities and value-added services in the Bolloré Logistics’ three hubs, the solution will provide brands with the agility and flexibility required for their business,” says the company. On the Singapore-Hong Kong-Haikou route, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel, is used. Made primarily from used cooking oil and waste resources, the use of SAF reduces CO2 emissions of the charter by 25% as less natural resources is used. “Many of our customers share similar goals when it comes to sustainability and reducing carbon emissions in their supply chain. Using SAF in this charter is therefore in accordance with our group’s program ‘Powering Sustainable Logistics’ and showcases our capability to set up and expand our services for clients,” said Loig Pavard, CEO of Bolloré Logistics Singapore. Over the past three years, offshore duty-free spending has skyrocketed in the city of Haikou, the capital of Hainan island, which hosts the largest stand-alone duty-free shop in the world. To support Hainan’s booming travel retail industry, Bolloré Logistics has worked to enhance its transport and logistics services and provide end-to-end supply chain solutions for retailers there. Sun Bo, Vice Mayor of Haikou city, said, “This February, we discussed the constructive cooperation plan in Haikou with the Bolloré Logistics team. The launch of the new air charter service, together with the distribution hub that Bolloré Logistics will build in Haikou, will support Haikou’s strategic development plan to be an international travel retail center.”"
Berkem acquires Biopress and secures its vegetable oil sourcing,"The group specializing in vegetable chemistry has just acquired Biopress, a French producer of 100% vegetable oils and proteins, thus securing its supply of vegetable oils while increasing its extraction capacities. Located in southwest of France, Biopress is one of the first French agri-food companies to specialize in the production of vegetable oils extracted from organic oil seeds from local farms. With properties similar to petroleum derivatives, while being renewable and biodegradable resources, vegetable oils can be used in a wide variety of applications such as cosmetics, coatings, inks, and lubricants. Also, the vegetable proteins contained in oil cakes, which result from the crushing process that is used to extract the oil from the seeds, are particularly prized in the nutraceutical field. With this acquisition, Groupe Berkem adds to its value chain the sourcing of a raw material essential to its activity of integrating plant-based chemistry. The group now benefits from a local supply of technical vegetable oils, as Biopress is geographically close to the Berkem’s plant. Biopress’ facilities also provide significant new storage space for the group as it anticipates the future growth of its business. Berkem can thus expand its production capacity and ensure the processing of more than 8,000 tons of plants per year. With this acquisition, Groupe Berkem is consolidating its offering in the ""Health, Beauty & Nutrition"" area of expertise and more specifically in the cosmetics market thanks to the virtues of its oils and the nutraceutical market because of the benefits provided by plant proteins. According to Groupe Berkem, this transaction is fully in line with the acquisition of i.Bioceuticals, a North American distributor of nutritional supplements, announced on 16 February 2023, and paves the way for new opportunities for growth in this booming market [1]. Surfactants derived from these vegetable oils are also used in numerous industrial applications, being particularly prized for their solubilizing, detergent, wetting and emulsifying properties. These products will therefore find applications in sectors already addressed by the Group. Finally, the integration of Biopress will provide Groupe Berkem with new commercial opportunities in the agri-food market. ""Raw material sourcing has always been a real know-how for Groupe Berkem and, faced with an inflationary and geopolitically complex environment, we felt that it was necessary to internalize this ability through a dedicated subsidiary. With the acquisition of Biopress, Groupe Berkem now manages its supply of vegetable oils, essential raw materials for its extraction and formulation activities, while at the same time significantly increasing its storage capacity in the direct vicinity of its production facilities. Through local and 100% plant-based sourcing, we will strengthen our Health, Beauty & Nutrition, Industry and Construction & Materials business areas, which fully benefit from the recognized virtues of so-called technical vegetable oils and plant proteins. Finally, this acquisition gives us access to a new market, that of agri-food, where we intend to develop new sustainable solutions for manufacturers looking for naturalness,” explains Olivier Fahy, Chairman and CEO of Groupe Berkem. The integration of Biopress into the consolidated accounts of Groupe Berkem was completed on April 1, 2023. The acquisition of Biopress was made by Berkem Développement (a wholly owned subsidiary of Groupe Berkem), financed out of equity and fully paid in cash. The 11 employees of Biopress joined Groupe Berkem on April 1, 2023."
Zero-waste: Cosmetic brands take the plunge into powder formats,"Already beloved by DIY enthusiasts and promoted by many indie brands, the powder format is now also being used in more classic products, in everything from cleansers to scrubs and deodorants. Unlike traditional beauty products, powder cosmetics contain zero water. So, it’s up to the consumer to add the required amount of water. The environmental-friendly solution appears as an ideal alternative to appeal those who do not like the texture of solid cosmetics. The brands Yanne Wellness, Tatcha, Yodi and Eyden are among those that offer numerous powder cosmetics, from revitalizing masks to exfoliating powders to purify the skin, as well as shampoos and facial cleansers. Perlucine, which specializes in cosmetics featuring white oyster shell powder, offers a wide range of products of this type, from shampoo to deodorant, toothpaste, and shower gel. Luxury houses and consumer brands have also started using powder formulations. Dior, for example, has its Hydra Life Time to Glow – Ultra Fine Exfoliating Powder, and Klorane sells a 3-in-1 Purifying Powder that transforms into a foam on contact with water. Note that other brands, such as 900.care and Mono Skincare, have chosen in-between offerings, with solid cosmetics that also turn into a liquid on contact with water. This is the case with the brand’s shower gels, that can be customized in line with individual tastes and desires. Powdered or solid, cosmetics have well and truly set a transformation in motion, helping consumers shift to zero-waste alternatives."
in-cosmetics Global 2023 results exceed Brazilian companies’ expectations,"The companies supported by the Beautycare Brazil sectoral project traded USD 2 million in deals during the in-cosmetics Global 2023 show, with an expectation of reaching USD 7.9 million for the next 12 months. Organized by Beautycare Brazil, the internationalization project of the Brazilian Cosmetics, Toiletries, and Fragrances Industry and its correlates, conducted by ABIHPEC (Brazilian Association of the Cosmetics, Toiletries, and Fragrances Industry) in partnership with ApexBrasil (Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency), the Brazilian pavilion featured the participation of 16 Brazilian companies [1]. During the event, which was held on March 28-30, in Barcelona, Spain, the Brazilian companies presented their launches and featured products to visitors from across the world. According to Beautycare Brazil, during the four days of the event, 2,187 business meetings were held, generating a total of USD 2 million in international sales, with an expectation of reaching another USD 7.9 million for the next 12 months. One of the highlights of Brazil’s participation in the event was the visit of a delegation from the Brazilian Consulate in Barcelona, headed by Consul General Clemente Baena Soares. “In-cosmetics Global exceeded our expectations and reiterated its position as the most important event for the ingredients manufacturing industry in the world, opening up opportunities for relationships with the main global players in the sector, expanding commercial partnerships, and reinforcing already established business,”  declared Gueisa Silvério, International Business Manager at ABIHPEC.

The 16 Brazilian companies at the fair have already confirmed their participation in the next edition, scheduled to take place on April 16-18, 2024, in Paris."
in-cosmetics Global award winners unveiled in Barcelona,"The organisers of in-cosmetics Global have unveiled the winners of the 2023 Awards at a ceremony held at the end of the first day of the show on 28 March at the Fira Barcelona Gran Via. The winners were selected by a panel of industry experts among more than 250 entries. Scooping the Gold award for the Innovation Zone: Active Ingredient Award was CALMandrin by Mibelle Biochemistry.

Furthermore, it can form completely transparent formulations including with anionic ingredients and does not require pH neutralization. Ingredients that are both biodegradable and deliver strong performance were also highly commended by the judges, with Aristoflex Eco T from Clariant and Evonik Industries’ Tego Filmstar One MB presented with the Silver and Bronze awards respectively. Celebrating ingredients that make a significant environmental or social difference, the Green Ingredient Award is granted in partnership with Ecovia Intelligence. Taking the 2023 title was Rootness Awake from Clariant – described as an “eco-friendly eye contour illuminator”, the natural active ingredient is extracted from the roots of the ipomoea batatas thanks to Plant Milking technology.

Also recognized in the Green Ingredient category, this year’s Silver Award winner was A-Sensofeel MFC by Minasolve SAS, while SeaBalance 2000 by CarbonWave took the Bronze Award.

"Coty appoints Caroline Andreotti as Chief Commercial Officer, Prestige","Coty has appointed Caroline Andreotti as its Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) for its Prestige division, effective April 1st, 2023. She succeeds Isabelle Bonfanti, who stepped down from the role after almost three years in the position.

Microplastic pollution impairs seabird gut microbiome health,"Scientists have long known that wild seabirds ingest bits of plastic pollution as they feed, but a study published on 27th March 2023 [1] shows the tiny particles don’t just clog or transit the stomach but can subvert its complex mix of good and bad bacteria too. Plastic-infested digestive tracts from two species of Atlantic seabirds, northern fulmars and Cory’s shearwaters, showed a decrease of mostly beneficial ""indigenous"" bacteria and more potentially harmful pathogens. There was also an increase in antibiotic-resistant and plastic-degrading microbes, researchers reported in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Certain types of microplastic, the findings suggested, may be leeching chemicals that disrupt the birds’ so-called gut microbiome. Microplastics — produced when plastic products break down in the environment — are directly and indirectly ingested across most animal food chains. They can be found in every corner of the world, from the deepest oceans trenches to top of Mount Everest. In humans, they have been detected in the blood, breast milk and placentas. The new study supports previous findings that prolonged ingestion of microplastics causes an imbalance of healthy and unhealthy bacteria in the stomach, a condition known as gut dysbiosis. The implications are far-reaching. Like humans, birds have evolved with a vast network of microbes, including bacteria, that live in our bodies in communities called microbiomes. Some microbes cause diseases, but most exist as ""friendly"" bacteria with a critical role in digestion, immune response and other critical functions. ""There’s a symbiosis that goes on — and that’s the case in the seabirds as well as in humans,"" lead author Gloria Fackelmann of Ulm University in Germany told AFP. The authors hope the findings in seabirds will spur related studies for humans. ""If this manmade substance could alter our microbiome, I think that should make people think,"" said Fackelmann. *"

Greentech unveils a new skin care ingredient that acts on the holobiont,"Holobiosys, the latest achievement of Greentech’s research, is a wild yellow gentian roots extract enhanced by an upcycled fermentation process with a rare and cold-tolerant bacteria from French aerobiota. According to Greentech, it restructures skin from surface to its heart, boosts hyaluronic acid and lipids synthesis and restores skin hydration with smoothing effects, while invigorating the skin holobiont. To counteract dehydrated (lack of water) and dry (lack of lipids) skin, Holobiosys boosts hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis both in the epidermis and the dermis. It also stimulates HA receptor CD44 and its signalling cascade allowing the reinforcement of epidermal barrier. Indeed, tight junction and differentiation markers are upregulated as well as lipid synthesis in keratinocytes for a more cohesive epidermis able to lock in skin moisture. Holobiosys also stimulates dermal-epidermal junction markers expression for a better diffusion of water bound to HA within the skin. Finally, antioxidant cell responses are upregulated after treatment with Holobiosys both in keratinocytes and fibroblasts for a protection against HA degradation by free radicals. Clinically tested on volunteers with dehydrated skin, Holobiosys increases skin hydration index after 28 days of application at 1% vs placebo and smoothes wrinkles. It also protects hydrolipidic film and has even a lipid-replenishing effect on a sub-panel presenting dehydrated and sebum-deficient skin. However, with Holobiosys, Greentech R&D goes a step further by studying the skin holobiont (the assemblage between the skin and its microbiota) with a metaproteomic study. With age and loss of hydration, the Greentech research shows that there is a slow-down of skin barrier and antioxidant functions both from human and microbial origins. “By focusing on the host/microbiota interactions, Holobiosys stimulates these functions and contribute to a more harmonized and invigorated holobiont, allowing a deep hydration-restructuring action,” explains Greentech. According to Greentech, studying the holobiont provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between the skin and its microbial ecosystem, helping to take a step further than a simple study comparing the skin on one side and the microbiota on the other.

L’Oréal’s Thierry Cheval elected as Chair of CTPA’s Board of Directors,"A new Chair and a new Vice-Chair were elected at the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA)’s Board of Directors meeting on 21 March 2023. Thierry Cheval, Managing Director & Chairman L’Oréal UK & Ireland, has been appointed as Chair, taking over from the previous incumbent, Debbie Rix, who has moved from her role at Kao and therefore resigned from the CTPA Board at the beginning of March 2023. In-coming CTPA Chair, Thierry Cheval commented: “I am honoured to take the role of CTPA Chair, and I look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with the talented CTPA team, the wider Board and all members. It has never been more important to have an active and responsible cosmetic industry and to work together to ensure that the industry continues to act to protect the consumer and the environment, whilst allowing for the continued development of innovative products that are essential for health and self- esteem. The Personal Care sector plays a critical role in society, from its value and contribution to the economy, to offering employment opportunities, to the wellbeing of consumers. I am fully committed to supporting a positive and progressive future for the industry.” Chris Barron, General Manager Personal Care Unilever UK & Ireland, has been appointed to the role of second Vice-chair, taking the place of Thierry Cheval. “I’m delighted to have the opportunity to serve as Vice-chair of the CTPA, having been a board member for over five years. Unilever has had a longstanding and strong relationship with the CTPA and I am looking forward to contributing further to the valuable work it undertakes for the industry as a whole,” said Chris Barron. Current CTPA first Vice-chair, Anna Bartle, and Treasurer, Andrew Field, will continue in their roles to support the new Chair until the current end of term for all roles in June 2024. “I am very much looking forward to working with Thierry Cheval as Chair having already seen the benefit of his wealth of expertise and advice during his time as Vice-chair over the past year.

Indian cosmetic brands seek to benefit from their support to gender equality,"As two Indian cosmetics brands, Lakmé and Sugar Cosmetics, have launched distinct marketing campaigns highlighting the theme of women’s empowerment to mark International Women’s Day 2023, connecting with gender equality issues can help Indian cosmetics brands win consumer loyalty, said GlobalData. According to the data and analytics company, campaigns linked to relevant social causes, such as women’s rights, beauty brands are connecting with young Millennial and Gen Z cohorts, who will power the future growth of the USD 16 billion Indian cosmetics and toiletries market. [1] Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL)’s Lakmé launched its #UnapologeticallyMÉ campaign to encourage women to wear fashion and beauty styles boldly without feeling guilty or justifying themselves to society. “The campaign sheds light on the social prejudice against women who wear fashionable makeup or clothing. HUL plans to extend the campaign through the Lakmé Fashion Week in March 2023, where the company will launch new products that imbue the campaign’s philosophy. With the new campaign, HUL’s is aligning the 70-year-old Lakmé brand with pertinent issues of the youth,” commented Bobby Verghese, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData. Simultaneously, Sugar Cosmetics unveiled its #BeYourOwnMuse campaign to inspire women to overcome insecurity and be confident. The company posted an Instagram video featuring nine ambitious working women being asked what advice they would give to their younger selves. The women emphasized self-belief and confidence in chasing passions and opportunities. According to Bobby Verghese: “This ties in with the company’s 2022 campaign, #EveryWomanIsAWonderWoman, which encouraged women to embrace their virtues and flaws and love themselves completely to overcome self-consciousness in the social media age.” “These marketing campaigns are stimulating conversations on the social issues that impact modern-day Indian women. Brands espousing such social causes can win consumer goodwill as revealed by GlobalData’s Q3 2022 consumer survey, wherein 34% of Indian respondents said that they actively look for ethical brands and brands that support social causes when making a purchase,” added Francis Gabriel Godad, Business Development Manager, GlobalData India. “The emotional connection forged by the brands can elevate the user experience beyond the product’s features. Consumer experiences linked to social causes, such as gender equality, can help brands in winning consumer loyalty and pockets, especially among new-generation women. This is corroborated by GlobalData’s 2022 survey finding that 45% of female Indians are willing to pay more for products or services that support gender equality causes [2]. Notably, the trend is more skewed towards the Gen Y and Gen Z consumer cohort.” “International trends on gender equality and gender fluidity are influencing young Indian consumers. More cosmetics and apparel makers are pledging support for such social movements. However, companies need to align corporate actions with the ethos of their marketing campaigns. Else, consumers will perceive the branding activity as mere social washing,” concluded Verghese."

Gerresheimer and TruTag simplify the identification of counterfeit products,"Providing brands and consumers with an easy and seamless way to identify counterfeit products is a real challenge for the beauty industry. ""Luxury industries and cosmetics are particularly affected by counterfeiting and the problem is growing steadily due to increased online shopping. Counterfeit cosmetic products do not just harm the reputation of health and beauty brands, they are also dangerous to end-consumers,” explains Nicola Balena, Global Vice President Cosmetics at Gerresheimer. In order to help cosmetic brands and consumers to protect themselves from counterfeiters, the glass packaging producer has partnered with TruTag Technologies, a brand protection specialist, to offer a digitization solution providing an easy and invisible way to authenticate beauty product packed in Gerresheimer glass with a smartphone. The solution offered by Gerresheimer and TruTag involves the integration of invisible microparticles that can be detected and decoded by a smartphone directly from the product’s packaging. Consumers or brand protection experts just need an app to scan and authenticate the beauty product packed in the glass marked with the technology. “Smartphone compatibility enables the mass verification of cosmetics by consumers before they use their products. We believe this is a game-changer from a consumer safety perspective,” says Michael Bartholomeusz, CEO of TruTag Technologies. “Today, almost all solutions that enable authentication of a single product require special detectors or sophisticated equipment. The new solution developed by Gerresheimer and TruTag Technologies requires only a commercially available smartphone.”"
LVMH chooses limestone-based material for Ole Henriksen’s new CC Stick,"On their way to switch the components of their beauty packaging to more environment friendly options, LVMH has chosen a material partly derived from limestone for the launch of Olehenriksen’s new Banana Bright+ Vitamin CC Stick. The product’s primary packaging is made of Limex pellets, a material containing more than 50% inorganic material like calcium carbonate. Developed and distributed by Japanese supplier TBM, Limex is presented as a more sustainable alternative to petroleum-based ABS and PP resins typically used in cosmetic packaging components. Thanks to is composition, Limex helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional plastics while being recyclable, claims TBM. According to the supplier, the injection molding grade of Limex can be used to produce a large variety of cosmetic containers – from lipsticks to jars – with the existing plastic molding equipment and without any additional machinery. Combined with a secondary packaging made of recyclable FSC-certified cardboard, TBM says the material offers significant benefits in terms of sustainability, while being in line with the aesthetic expectations of the brand thanks to a luxurious matte texture and feel. Earlier this year, LVMH’s beauty division announced a partnership with Dow in order to integrate biosourced, recycled and recyclable plastics into their packaging. The goal of the luxury giant is that its packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future."

Firmenich opens new fragrance creation centre inspired by Chinese culture,"The manufacturer of fragrances and aromas has joined forces with China-based perfumery studio Xun Laboratory to strengthen its footprint in China through the opening of a new fragrance creation centre taking rooted in the country’s rich history and culture. Housed in the Jin Ze Arts Centre, an organization aiming at the preservation and promotion of the tradition of Chinese fine craftsmanship and located in the western outskirt of Shanghai, the new centre – dubbed Villa Harmony – is intended to reinforce Firmenich’s cultural and historical understanding of Chinese Perfumery, thus offering an opportunity to connect tradition with modernity.

Lumene chooses Eastman’s Cristal One E Renew molecularly recycled resin,"For its latest skin care innovation — Nordic Hydra Birch Dew Jelly — beauty brand Lumene has chosen Eastman Cristal One E Renew, a recyclable resin with molecularly recycled content that is specifically designed for extrusion blow moulding (EBM). Cristal One E is Eastman’s latest addition to its Cristal One portfolio, giving brands the brilliance and lustre of glass with rigid, thick-wall construction for EBM that is not typically achievable with conventional recycled resins. “Lumene’s ambition is to have 80% of its packaging made of recycled or recyclable materials by the end of 2025.

Pelham Group launches turnkey creation platform with low MOQs,"The UK based contract manufacturer of cosmetic and personal care formulations has launched a new platform dedicated to the fast-track turnkey creation of innovative products. Dubbed Pelham Matrix, the new tool offers ready-to-market formulations created to help brands — big and small — to stay agile in their product launches.

As all products are pretested for stability and safety, and are formulated to the “Clean At Sephora” guidelines and are compliant to many worldwide markets, Pelham says brands can expect delivery in just 8 weeks from artwork signoff, instead of the usual 12 months. As far compatibility is concerned, the ranges are tested in a series of packaging options. “We know how hard it is for brands to react to trends and offer continuous innovation. With large MOQs, lengthy testing timelines and large investment, this often results in brands missing the opportunity completely or by the time products are ready, the market has moved on,” says Oliver Felstead, Founder of Pelham. “Trends come and go quicker than ever, and it’s difficult to distinguish between a trend and a fad, speed is key to taking ’early adopter’ margin before the market becomes saturated and margins are squeezed. We want to give our customers the ability to test and learn to find out what works best for their brand and audience; giving them the opportunity to develop bespoke formulations with the learnings once they have proven concept,” he adds. Pelham Matrix will be dropping new ranges every 2-3 months in multiple product categories across health and beauty based on market trends and innovation, with over 200 products planned for 2023 alone. The first drop, launched on the 1st March, is a range of SPF skincare formulations, all fully tested and ready to go. “We are known as the Indie brand manufacturer, we seek out challenging briefs which allow us to create ‘newness’. Now we’re writing briefs to challenge ourselves so we can showcase our creativity to stand head and shoulders above the competition,” highlights Oliver."
Coquette makeup: the beauty trend that takes romance to the extreme,"There’s a fresh, new kind of romantic aesthetic blowing through social media. We thought users were obsessed with the gothic chic style of Netflix series ""Wednesday,"" but here they are already turning to beauty that evokes the sweetness of spring. And so it is that ’coquette makeup’ has already inspired several million followers on TikTok. An extension of the ’Barbiecore’ aesthetic, this new trend puts pink in the spotlight, but this time, it is not a hot pink shade but rather a soft rosy pastel pink, tinged with romance. The new beauty aesthetic is causing a sensation on TikTok with no less than 7.7 billion views for the hashtag #coquette, 1.6 billion for #coquetteaesthetic, more than 300 million for #coquettecore and over 120 million for #coquettemakeup. A surge that shows genuine enthusiasm for this aesthetic inspired by pretty, romantic stylistic elements. This trend also celebrates an ultrafeminine style – that users own 100% – celebrated with bows, pearls, lace, butterfly patterns, flowers, and other details. All tinged with a touch of retro nostalgia: antique mirrors and ribbon-like headbands in the hair. Sort of a mix between Daphne Bridgerton and Blair Waldorf. Once again, blush is a key element of this trend. After working on the complexion as for a classic beauty routine, it’s a matter of applying a pink blush – stick or powder – to the cheekbones, before finishing the whole look with a pearly powder. A luminous touch that is applied to eyelids, punctuated with a line of black eyeliner for a doe eye. For the mouth, matte lipstick is swapped for a pink or transparent gloss, which adds the dose of signature prettiness and romanticism that characterizes the ’coquette makeup’."
Gotha Cosmetics acquires Beauty Rain to strengthen industrial capabilities,"The Italian manufacturer of colour cosmetics continues its series of acquisitions with the take-over of Beauty Rain Srl, which specialises in the assembly of make-up components. Based in Chieve, near Cremona, in the heart of Italy’s main cosmetic industrial cluster, Beauty Rain was founded almost 20 years ago by the Scandelli family. With a total workforce of about 80 staffs, the company has created innovative automated industrial solutions. With this operation, Gotha is proceeding with its integration plan of its most strategic production processes. It comes on the heels of the acquisition in 2022 of iColor Group, a Chinese make-up and skincare company with two main sites in Shanghai and Suzhou, and of Mia Cosmetic, and Italian filling company specialized in hot-poured, foundation, mascara, gloss, and highlighter products. “This acquisition allows us to consolidate our technical and industrial know-how by insourcing some assembling activities, accelerating the process of integration and simplification of the supply chain. This is a further step in the company’s enlargement of its production processes started with the acquisition of Mia Cosmetics,” said Paolo Valsecchi, CEO of Gotha Cosmetics."
"Decarbonation: Arcade Beauty aims to reduce emissions by 3,000 tons in 2023","Arcade Beauty is going ahead with their decarbonization plan and details their 2030 roadmap on the occasion of their participation in the Convention des Entreprises pour le Climat (CEC) in Paris, France. Arcade Beauty thus aims “to contribute to the beauty and well-being of all,” by reducing waste generated by samples and cosmetic products, while offering consumers eco-designed packaging, that are collected and recycled after having been used. In this context, Arcade Beauty has formalized its SBTi 1.5°C [1] commitment with the aim to reduce their CO2 emissions by 3,000 tons by the end of the year [2]. The work carried out is based on three major areas: – Managing energy (reduction, conversion and optimization);
– Involving partner suppliers in an optimization process (CSR questionnaire integrating EcoVadis, carbon assessment and decarbonization actions);
– Act in a systematic ecodesign logic. For more efficiency in terms of sustainability, Arcade Beauty has integrated the 4 R’s in its eco-design strategy: – Reduce (weight of the packs, number of layers, over-packaging...);
– Recycle/Recycled: to date, 80% of the proposed technologies are recyclable or include a share of recycled material;
– Renew (progressive replacement of plastic by paper), development of compostable technologies;
– Reuse (development of reusable packs & refill solutions). Facts and figures Recyclable paper and mono-resin pouches allow CO2 savings of 58% for paper and 32% for mono-resin.
Recyclable secondary packaging allows CO2 savings of 80% for paper and 74% for monoresin.
In Arcade’s Retail product range, recyclable 3Dpouch in PE allows significant environmental gains (less 19% of CO2, and on average less 50% of material weight). Let’s also mention that Arcade Beauty is working on the ISCC+ certification of its factories in order to promote the use of chemically recycled plastics (PE and PP in particular)."

Rissmann creates gift packs for Valentino and YSL,"The German manufacturer of paper packaging – tailor-made carrier bags and boxes – for luxury brands in cosmetics, perfumes, jewellery, spirits and technology, recently produced a series of new gift boxes and packaging for Valentino and Yves Saint Laurent, two brands of the L’Oréal Group’s luxury division. For their -commerce gift boxes, Valentino required a sophisticated 3D décor. Rissmann managed to create the brand’s logo from golden embossed studs, with a multi-level gold transfer finishing. The use of an uncoated matte paper, printed in a very deep black, is also worth to be highlighted. The glossy varnish finish enhances the luxury appearance of these boxes and emphasises the hot-stamped Valentino logo. Yves Saint Laurent asked Rissmann to develop its collection of gift packaging inspired by its “Indulge in Gold” campaign. Boxes, pouches, bags, envelopes, and cards are made of black tinted FSC paper. Whether in silver or gold, the transfer finished rectangle in the background highlights the black embossed YSL logo. The filigree stars and squares of the metallic decoration echo the embossed patterns of the black surfaces through a play of light. The cord that makes up the handles of the bags is also made of FSC-certified paper. “This collection illustrates Rissmann’s ability to combine expertise and high-tech know-how around the manufacture of luxury packaging in paper and cardboard,” said Sophie Ivens, Chief Executive Officer, Strategy, Sales & Marketing at Rissmann. As far as production operations are concerned, Rissmann relies on its German industrial plant, furnished with semi or fully automatic production lines. The manufacturer also relies on its historical network of Chinese industrial partners, in line with its expectations, and entrusts manual finishing operations to Hungarian workshops which employ people with disabilities, thus promoting their integration through work. Since 2022, Rissmann has a new plant in Bulgaria, manufacturing shopping bags and boxes."
Antitrust authorities investigate over possible price cartel in fragrance,"Antitrust authorities in Europe and the U.S. are investigating over alleged price cartel and other anti-competitive practices in the fragrance industry. Competition authorities in the EU, Switzerland, the USA and the UK have cooperated to conduct dawn raids at various corporate locations. According to Switzerland’s anti-trust commission (COMCO), the undertakings involved in the investigation are Firmenich International SA (Geneva), Givaudan SA (Geneva), International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (USA) et Symrise AG (Germany). “There are suspicions that [the companies] have coordinated their pricing policy, prohibited their competitors from supplying certain customers and limited the production of certain fragrances,” said the Swiss regulator. Firmenich, one of the world’s biggest flavour and perfume manufacturers, confirmed Wednesday that its offices in France, Switzerland and Britain had been subjected to ""unannounced inspections ... as part of an industry-wide investigation."" The European Commission also indicated that it had sent out “formal requests for information to several companies” active in the sector. The Commission added that it had concerns that companies and an association in the fragrance industry worldwide may have violated EU antitrust rules. Shares in Givaudan and Symrise dropped by more than 2% on Wednesday after their names were cited in the probe. Shares of Dutch chemicals group DSM, which is currently merging with Firmenich, were also down."
Berkem extends distribution agreement with Unipex to Benelux and Switzerland,"The French company specializing in bio-based chemistry has extended its distribution agreement with Unipex to the Benelux region and French-speaking Switzerland for all of its ingredients targeting the cosmetics and Personal Care markets. Recently acquired by Barentz, one of the world’s leading distributors of specialty products which already distributes Groupe Berkem’s products in North America and certain European territories, Unipex is present in many markets such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and nutraceuticals. Unipex already distributes Berkem’s wide range of 100% plant-based extracts in France. ""This new agreement with Unipex follows the one we signed together in 2022 for the distribution of our solutions dedicated to the “Health, Beauty & Nutrition” area of expertise in France. We are thus pursuing our internationalization strategy alongside a recognized player in the distribution of specialty ingredients that has already proved its worth in our domestic market. Based on this solid partnership, we intend to meet the demand of cosmetics manufacturers wishing to increase the naturalness of their products while preserving their effectiveness,” commented Éric Moussu, Vice President of Sales of Groupe Berkem."
Brazil bans animal testing for cosmetics and fragrances,"Vertebrates can no longer be used in tests conducted for the development and quality control of fragrances, cosmetic and personal care products in Brazil. The ban, which has been debated for several years in the federal parliament, was eventually enforced by the new Lula government via a resolution (Resolução No 58/2023) of the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (Concea - Conselho Nacional de Controle de Experimentação Animal), a collegial body under the authority of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). The measure applies to products for which formulas and components have already been proven to be safe and effective. For the others, the new text requires the use of alternative methods. According to Kátia de Angelis, coordinator of Concea, 40 alternative methods are currently recognized by the council. “We have recognized methods for assessing skin toxicity using artificial skin, or eye irritation using an artificial cornea. These alternative methods allow us to maintain our autonomy to assess new ingredients, in particular those sourced from our biodiversity, in the Amazon for example, and without using animals or possibly a very small number of animals,” she explained. Kátia de Angelis also pointed out that the new text puts Brazil in line with the most recent international legislation in this area. Today, more than 40 countries around the world have already banned animal testing for cosmetic products, including the member states of the European Union or in Latin America, countries such as Colombia, Mexico and Guatemala. However, the Brazilian text does not provide for a ban on the import of products tested abroad. The text was approved last December during a Concea meeting and was signed on February 28 by the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Luciana Santos. It entered into force on March 1, 2023. At the end of last year, the Federal Senate approved a similar text before sending it to the Chamber of Deputies. In addition to the ban, the project provided for inspection measures and a strategic plan for the adoption of alternative methods."

Sustainable decoration: Quadpack bets on full-cover hot foil stamping,"Full-cover hot foil stamping consists in endowing packaging components with a glossy, premium finish through the seamless application of foil to cover a complete pack, offering a low-emission, solvent-free, more sustainable alternative to metallization. Full-cover hot foil stamping has been incorporated into the decoration portfolio of Quadpack with the acquisition in 2021 of Stefan Wicklein Kunststoffveredelung GmbH, one of the few expert global providers of this complex technique. While metallization offers many advantages, full-coverage hot foil stamping requires less energy and no solvents. The PET carrier film can also be produced in PCR material and Quadpack is developing a process to recycle it. What’s more, typically accounting for less than 5% of the full packaging solution’s material, it does not affect recyclability. “Material usage in general is minimised thanks to low reject rates, facilitated by the know-how of Quadpack’s decoration specialists,” the company highlights in a statement. Aesthetically, full-cover hot foil stamping adds lustre to a pack and offers a variety of creative finishes. Brushed aluminium, wood, and hologram effects can be applied, in matt or gloss, in monochrome or a multitude of colours, alone or in combination. Foils and foiling tools can be standard or bespoke, to match pack designs, budgets, and launch plans. Branding and lettering can be incorporated into custom foils, allowing for single-step decoration, accelerating time to market, while optimising cost and boosting sustainability. Full-cover hotfoil stamping is suitable for regular shapes, including concave surfaces. Quadpack currently has six production lines for caps and closures and two lines dedicated to cylindrical packs including airless, each capable of decorating millions of pieces a year. The supplier plans to add another line at the purpose-built decoration centre in Kierspe, Germany, by the end of 2023."

The Fragrance Foundation to honor L’Oréal’s CEO with Hall of Fame Award,"The Fragrance Foundation will honor Nicolas Hieronimus, L’Oréal’s CEO, with its Hall of Fame Award at the 2023 Fragrance Foundation Awards on Thursday, June 15 at the David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, in New York City. The Fragrance Foundation Awards recognizes innovation, creativity and achievement in the fragrance industry. Through the 2023 Hall of Fame Award, the Fragrance Foundation seeks to honor the contribution of Nicolas Hieronimus, the 6th CEO of the L’Oréal Groupe in its 113-year history, to the world of fragrance. Nicolas Hieronimus has been a major player in the fragrance industry for more than a decade, said the Fragrance Foundation. Beginning in 2011 as President of the L’Oréal Luxe Division, Hieronimus’ unique vision paved the way for L’Oréal to become the world’s fine fragrance leader. Under his leadership, iconic fragrances the world has come to love, such as Lancôme’s La Vie Est Belle, Yves Saint Laurent’s Black Opium and Libre as well as Si by Armani were born. “On behalf of the L’Oréal Group, I am very honored to receive the prestigious Hall of Fame Award from the Fragrance Foundation, which is a recognition of the passion, dedication and fine fragrance know-how of our teams,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, Chief Executive Officer of the L’Oréal Groupe. “Fragrance plays an enormously important role in fostering individual wellbeing and contributing positively to society and culture. Over the centuries, perfume has had the power to stimulate our senses, our memories, and our emotions. And we are seeing today that fragrance is more relevant than ever because it helps us connect with ourselves and with others.” The Fragrance Foundation said L’Oréal cultivates a unique fragrance “savoir-faire,” mastering all the facets of the fine fragrance creation, anchored in French heritage. Throughout the years, with its portfolio of complementary and aspirational luxury fragrance brands (Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent Beauté, Armani, Prada, Mugler, Viktor & Rolf, Valentino, Cacharel, Azzaro, Diesel, Atelier Cologne, Maison Margiela, Ralph Lauren), the L’Oréal Groupe has played a major role in the history of perfumes.

Many of its iconic, blockbuster fragrances, such as Lancôme La Vie Est Belle and Prada Paradoxe, are available in refill. L’Oréal has also been harnessing the power of cutting-edge technology to enhance the fragrance experience for consumers. In 2021, L’Oréal debuted Yves Saint Laurent Beauté’s Scent-Sation, which for the first time used an EEG-measuring headset to help consumers search for their perfect fragrance by analyzing their emotional response to different scents.” “We look forward to honoring Nicolas Hieronimus for his leadership, vision and exemplary results in the fragrance category in the USA and globally. Nicolas is fully committed to #FragranceForwardTFF and shares our values of environmental sustainability and diversity, equity & inclusion,” said Linda G. Levy, President, The Fragrance Foundation."

Kao and Mitsui have cooperated in the sales and marketing of Bioré in Brazil since 2017. The two companies recently carried out a market research that, they say, has shown strong acceptance of the brand by Brazilian consumers. The two companies therefore intend to strengthen the brand’s footprint in the country with the aim to manufacture Bioré products locally."

Brazil: Portuguese labelling of cosmetic ingredients can be done via QR Code,"The labelling in Portuguese language of the full list of ingredients in cosmetics and perfumes sold will be mandatory in Brazil from November 1, 2023. However, the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) recently adopted new rules confirming brands will have the possibility to use a QR Code to make this information accessible to consumers. This clarification was made after a request from ABIHPEC - the Brazilian Association of the Personal Hygiene Products, Perfumes and Cosmetics Industry - which wanted to minimize the impact of this mandatory labelling in Portuguese, in particular for small-size products. Anvisa thus adopted a new resolution (RDC n° 773/2023 of February 15, 2023) modifying an earlier resolution of March 24, 2022 (RDC n° 646/2022), which authorized online information. The latest text clearly states that the presentation in Portuguese of the detailed chemical composition of a hygiene, cosmetic or perfume product can be provided in digital format by reading - through a mobile device - a code permanently printed on the label (for example a QR Code). According to ABIHPEC, ANVISA will also soon publish its own database of ingredients translated into Portuguese. Companies will have a period of 36 months to update the old labelling (in the event of a difference with the translation made available by Anvisa or in the event of an update of the list of ingredients published by the agency)."
"Amouage pays tribute to frankincense, Oman’s iconic ingredient","For the third chapter of its Odyssey Collection, Amouage unveils a quartet of new perfumes portraying all the complexity of Oman’s greatest treasure and pride, frankincense. Each of the four new creations of the Oman-based brand laces frankincense with a broad palette of rare ingredients in a display of tradition-steeped modernity. By exploring introspective themes, Lineage, Search, Guidance, and Purpose speak of escapism, the strive to grow, the search for a new path and the finding of a new life – transformation at last. ""When exploring Oman, you can often feel like touching treasures in a very pure way. A lot of my ideas come from travelling alone, from going somewhere. The third chapter of The Odyssey Collection emulates this escapism and Oman’s memorable redolence. This collection is a singular, introspective olfactory voyage that should stir successive feelings of curiosity with Lineage, courage with Search, inner triumph with Guidance and a sense of awakening with purpose. By focusing this collection on the barren Omani island of Masirah, I wanted to pay tribute to Amouage’s roots in a contemporary language, staying true to the House’s ethos, or ’wave’, to bring cultures and generations together,"" commented Renaud Salmon, who has been at the helm of Amouage’s creative direction since 2019. To bring this new chapter to life, Amouage collaborated with perfumers chosen for their creativity and sense of poetry: Karine Vinchon-Spehner (Lineage) – whom previously worked with the House on fragrances including Interlude Woman, Memoir Man, Overture Man and Boundless – as well as Quentin Bisch (Guidance and Purpose) and Alexis Grugeon (Search). The Odyssey Collection: Chapter III – Escape is available in all Amouage boutiques and distributors worldwide and can be purchased online at www.amouage.com."

Is ’shower makeup’ marking the return of boldness in beauty?,"Launched on social networks by Huda Kattan, ’shower makeup’ is all the rage on TikTok, with no less than 5 million views for the hashtag #showermakeup. The trend could signal the return of boldness in makeup. Actually, it’s all about ditching the matte complexion – which has been popular for years – and adopting shiny skin, subtly rosy cheeks, and slightly puffy lips. To achieve this bold look, which Huda Kattan says is just ’the sexiest,’ makeup addicts have to start with a glowy makeup base. The idea is to banish any mattifying product from this new beauty routine. The founder of the cosmetics brand Huda Beauty then mixes her foundation with a moisturizer for a light and fresh look, and focuses on concealer, which should be lighter than her skin tone, with an emphasis on the forehead and chin. Then comes contouring, with more product under the cheekbones and on the jawline to capture the effect of bathroom lighting and the famous warmth of the shower, all followed by a glossy highlighter to achieve a wet look. All that’s left to do is apply mascara, lip liner, lip gloss and – an essential step – to give hair a matching wet look. And that’s it. Just be careful not to get caught up in the game and leave home in a bathrobe…"

"US consumers spend big to improve their bathrooms, reports NPD","Sales of products related to more substantial bathroom remodels have enjoyed double-digit gains in 2022 in the USA with products like bathtubs, whirlpools, vanities, and tub and shower surrounds retaining positive sales performance in both units and dollars, while most other kitchen and bath categories struggled, according to The NPD Group. “Not only has working from home become normalized, but over the past year escalating economic concerns have also encouraged consumers to save money by doing more at home,” said Joe Derochowski, home industry advisor at NPD. “Consumers are still looking for ways to improve their living spaces and the way they make them feel. They are now looking for their bathrooms to not only be functional, but also a source of tranquillity.” Sales revenue from vanities with tops grew 27%, while bathtubs and whirlpools grew 22%, and tub and shower surrounds grew 20%. Those same categories demonstrated positive demand levels, while also experiencing the highest year-over-year increases in average selling prices, found The NPD Group. Indeed, average prices for bathtubs and whirlpools rose 20%, compared to 2021, while tub and shower surround prices increased 18%. “Even during challenging economic times, the consumer’s willingness to spend on home improvement projects that they are passionate about can have more influence over sales growth than elevated prices,” Derochowski said. A change in behaviour that will certainly have an impact on the cosmetics and toiletries market."

Zero-waste: Metsä Board unveils the winners of the Better with Less challenge,"The winners the Better with Less - Design Challenge 2022-2023 have been announced. A jury of package design experts chose two submissions to share first place: ‘Kid’s Headphones Packaging,’ by designer Kitty Ching and the ’Cardboard Protecting Filler,’ by designers, Marcin Michalski, Monika Klimpel and Adrian Olejnik. The international packaging design competition was organised by Metsä Board for the third time. The competition invited designers to create the zero-waste packaging of the future. 124 entrants from 27 countries joined the challenge with their creative ideas. The first winning design, ‘Kid’s Headphones Packaging’, focuses on consumer usability and recyclability. Through elegant design engineering, the packaging is easy to open and provides excellent protection of the product – showing how simple is often best. The packaging is easy to recycle and considers the reuse aspect, as the inner part of the packaging offers the possibility to store the headphones. The reuse is supported by the aesthetic presentation and pure and clean paperboard material used. The joint first prize winner was ’Cardboard Protecting Filler’, a TV or electronics transport protection solution. The solution creates a protective beam-like structure protecting the contents on each side of the package. The packaging, made of fresh fibre paperboard, is lightweight and durable, supporting the circular economy in terms of ease of recycling and minimising the amount of material used. The first prize winners will share the prizes from 1st & 2nd place and will receive 6,500 euros each. “Choosing the winner from such excellent entries was an incredibly difficult decision, so the jury decided to select two first-place winners,” says Ilkka Harju, Chairman of the jury and Packaging Services Director at Metsä Board. The third prize, 2,000 euros, was awarded to, ’RESHAPE’. Dawid Thiel’s packaging concept is designed to work for a wider range of products thanks to an innovative packaging format, which reduces the number of packaging items that need to be stored. Metsä Board offered an additional prize of an internship for one student at its Paperboard and Packaging Excellence Centre in Finland. The winner was ‘Zero Waste Medication Blister Pack’, designed by Patrick Walby, a packaging for the pharma industry that aims to replace the plastic and aluminum often used in medication packaging with paperboard. Two honorary mentions were also awarded to ‘Totally Bananas’ Packaging, designed by, Max Gubbins and ‘F’lover’, designed by, Mine Koca.

Givaudan translates perfumes into colours with its Myrissi technology,"The fragrance house has announced the launch of their new algorithm that allows to translate into images the emotions of consumers with regard to a perfume. [1] According to Givaudan, being able to determine the best alignment between colours, emotions and scents can help to bring fragrance creation closer to sensory perceptions. Givaudan acquired Myrissi en 2021. The start-up had developed and patented an AI technology capable of translating fragrances into colour patterns and images, relevant to the consumer. “Combined with Givaudan’s expertise of more than 35 years in neuroscience, the Myrissi algorithm deepens the understanding of consumers’ emotional mechanisms. This unique capability, the result of a decade of academic research in brain imagery and AI, decodes the spontaneous olfactory connection with colour, modelled on the basis of a database of more than 25,000 consumer tests,” said the company in a statement. The technology enables us to drive the creative and product development process starting either from a chemical composition to predict the colour code association, or from a chromatic base to determine the appropriate olfactive affiliation. It also generates the visual moodboard and verbal ecosystem surrounding any fragrance: from packaging to campaign storytelling, consumers’ emotional nuances are translated in their most complete and consistent form. Through this, Givaudan intends to support its customers in maximising the emotional impact of any olfactive creation, regardless of the retail channel involved.

As e-commerce remains the privileged channel for customers, we must answer their need of an olfactive digital experience, something impossible to address until now. With Myrissi, we allow consumers to ’smell’ visuals and colours that elicit the same emotions as the perfumes they are facing. This technology also enables Givaudan to support impactful marketing strategies for our customers, by matching their product designs with their scent, making the consumer experience delightful and fulfilling,"" says Maurizio Volpi, President Fragrance & Beauty. “Myrissi offers trailblazing support in crafting consumer-centred solutions, covering a wide scope of product categories, from Consumer Products to Fine Fragrances, driven by the powerful connection between colour and scents,” adds Muriel Jacquot, Neuroscience Development Manager."

Solvay Launches the First ISCC PLUS Certified Mass Balance Vanillin,"In order to meet consumers and brand owner demands for enhanced sustainability and reduced carbon footprint, Solvay has launched the first certified vanillin based on mass balance standards in the market. Obtained in late 2022, the ISCC PLUS certification [1] confirms the controlled use and traceability of renewable feedstock in the company’s vanillin. The goal is to replace fossil resources used to manufacture this substance with renewable carbon (used cooking oils, vegetable oils and wastes), thus helping brand owners meet the growing demand for more sustainable and circular ingredients as they strive to minimize their environmental impact, reduce fossil-based raw materials consumption and carbon footprint. The certification is applicable to the production of the Rhovanil vanillin at Solvay’s Saint-Fons plant in France. “As a world leader in advanced vanillin technology, we have a strategy to offer natural and sustainable ingredients in the food and fragrances markets. We are very proud to offer new solutions to our customers with this world’s first ISCC PLUS mass balance certified range of high-purity vanillin,” says Jo Grosemans, Solvay Natural Growth Director. Solvay’s Rhovanil is primarily used in food and flavor applications and widely used in home and personal care fragrances. “Our new Rhovanil MB solution is now commercial. It can be used as immediate drop-in replacements of incumbent products,” adds Maud Joassard, Marketing Manager at Solvay. The replacement of primary fossil resources by mass balance certified renewable feedstock aligns with the Solvay One Planet roadmap to continuously improve the sustainability of Solvay’s operations while also helping customers reduce their indirect emissions from their suppliers [2]. As part of this journey, Rhovanil MB can make a significant contribution to the efforts of major players in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry seeking carbon neutrality by 2040 or earlier."
Afyren chooses Mitr Phol to expand its low-carbon technology in Asia,"The French Greentech company has choosen Thailand for its second biobased organic acids plant. The company is entering a partnership project with Thai company Mitr Phol, a leading producer of cane sugar and its derivatives and the world’s third largest sugar producer. The two companies aim to establish a biorefinery in Thailand. The project will take the form of a joint venture 70% owned by the majority partner Afyren, with 30% held by Mitr Phol. The agreement is expected to be finalized mid-2023, subject to agreement by the parties on the final terms of the partnership. Thanks to their proprietary technolgy, Afyren produces organic acids using agricultural co-products as feedstock. These acids are identical (drop-in molecules) to ingredients produced using petroleum derivatives, so they can be directly substituted without changing customers’ production methods. The acids produced can be used as such, as ingredients, or transformed into derivatives for the cosmetics and perfumes industries, for example. “With this second plant project, we are organizing our presence in a strategic region in the heart of Asia to better serve our customers,” said Nicolas Sordet, CEO of Afyren. ""By partnering with Mitr Phol, Afyren is securing long-term access to a sustainable raw material from the local sugarcane industry.” According to Afyren, Asia represents 25% of the world market for carboxylic acids. The growth of this market is driven in particular by the dynamics of the food and animal nutrition sectors. Afyren’s bio-based organic acids are used in many food products as preservatives or natural flavourings, as well as in many animal feed products, notably as an alternative to the preventive use of antibiotics. Located in the immediate vicinity of Mitr Phol’s operations, close to Bangkok, the plant under consideration will benefit from direct access to its raw materials, considerably reducing the environmental footprint associated with transport. In addition, the plant will have access to renewable and low carbon electricity and steam, produced by cogeneration of biomass, strengthening the biorefinery and circular economy model. Like Afyren’s first plant in France, the Thai fermentation unit will not consume water, and the mineral by-products of production will be used as a high-value natural fertilizer. With this approach, Afyren continues its commitment to produce biobased acids with a much lower carbon footprint than those produced using traditional petro-based feedstocks. This second plant aims to have a production capacity of approximately 28,000 tons per year, representing an annualized turnover of approximately 60 million euros in full capacity. Production start-up is expected by 2025, with the timetable to be specified at the end of the engineering studies scheduled for second semester of 2023."
LVMH announces record results in 2022 despite China,"The luxury goods giant recorded revenue of EUR 79.2 billion in 2022 and profit from recurring operations of EUR 21.1 billion, both up 23%.

European luxury sector impatient for return of Chinese tourists,"The European luxury sector is welcoming the end of pandemic lockdowns in China, as the return of big-spending Chinese tourists could sustain further growth. Prior to the pandemic, Chinese tourists visiting Europe were a major source of sales for luxury houses. The Chinese accounted for ""a third of luxury purchases in the world and two-thirds of those purchases were made outside China"", said Joelle de Montgolfier, head of the luxury division at management consulting firm Bain and Company. Their return has led RBC bank to revise up its growth forecast for the sector this year to 11 percent, from seven percent previously. ""China reopening is one of the key ’mega-themes’ for the luxury sector in 2023,"" RBC Bank said in a recent note to clients. After a drop in 2020, the luxury sector managed to surpass its pre-pandemic sales in 2021. ""The Chinese consumed, but only in China,"" said Bain’s de Montgolfier. ""In 2022, it was much more complicated with unexpected confinements in the country,"" she added. Nevertheless, that didn’t hold the sector back from making an estimated 22 percent jump to 353 billion euros (USD 384 billion), according to a November forecast by Bain and Company. That growth was supported by the wave of post-lockdown US tourists visiting Europe armed with a strong dollar, as well as Korean and Southeast Asian tourists. Another pleasant surprise was Europeans ""who had been ignored for decades... and were more interested in luxury goods than expected"", said Erwan Rambourg, a luxury industry insider turned analyst and author of the book Future Luxe: What’s Ahead for the Business of Luxury. With the lifting of travel restrictions in China ""there will be a considerable return of Chinese tourists but that will be more likely in the second quarter"", said Arnaud Cadart, a portfolio manager at asset manager Flornoy. ""The pandemic is still very active in China and it will affect lots of people."" The Chinese tourists may be needed if the flow of US tourists slows. ""European boutiques need this rebound in Chinese clientele to replace its American clientele which could buy locally,"" said Cadart. They also need to readapt to Chinese customers, who tend to travel in groups, and will join a large number of US tourists. ""There are already lines in front of the boutiques even without Chinese clients... they need more staff,"" said de Montgolfier. Otherwise, they risk a ""degradation of the experience"" of shopping in a luxury boutique. Another concern: the volume of merchandise that Chinese customers will want to buy is unclear. The sector likes to keep volumes low and does not discount to ensure exclusivity."
"Lumson launches APP Light, a lightweight airless solution in PCR PE","The Italian manufacturer of primary packaging for skincare and make-up is launching a lightweight PCR PE version of their APP 355 airless standard. Dubbed APP Light, the new 50ml PCR PE airless, adds up to Lumson’s large portfolio of pouch airless packaging solutions, which also includes aluminium (TAL) and paper (XPaper) options. Thanks to a reduction in the bottle’s thickness, the new APP 355 Light is 25% lighter than the equivalent standard APP 355. The new airless packaging is made even more sustainable thanks to the use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) and recyclable materials: 80% of PCR HDPE and 20% of virgin HDPE. According to Lumson, APP Light allows a significant reduction of CO2 emissions, compared to a traditional pouch airless. Indeed, results from a SPICE analysis (an international platform that measures the sustainability of products and processes) have shown that CO2 emissions generated during manufacturing of the APP 355 Light are 19% lower when compared with an APP Start (another one of Lumson’s airless in PE). To complete the design, the bottle can be paired with the Lumson AA355 pump in PCR PP, thus making the different plastic components fully recyclable. When it comes to formula protection, thanks to its the multi-layered pouch designed to act as a barrier against external agents, the new APP 355 Light offers the same functionalities than any other Lumson’s pouch airless solutions. ""The new APP 355 Light incarnates all of Lumson’s technical and technological expertise and is a solution that is keeping up with the times. Not only is it a winning choice in terms of safety and sustainability, but it’s also extremely versatile because, like all of our airless packaging solutions, it can be customized with various effects and decorations,"" said Matteo Moretti, President of Lumson. Lumson will introduce APP Light at the Paris Packaging Week tradeshow, which will take place on January 25-26, 2023."

"Verra’s rainforest carbon offsets ’worthless’, according to media analysis","Buying carbon credits by financing projects to protect rainforests has become a popular way for companies to claim they are carbon neutral, even though their activities generate gases that cause global warming. However, some 90 percent of credits offered by the world’s leading provider, Verra, are likely ""phantom credits,"" said a study published on January 18 by British newspaper The Guardian, German weekly Die Zeit and SourceMaterial, a nonprofit investigative journalism organisation. Their nine-month investigation, including an analysis of existing studies into Verra’s rainforest schemes and on the ground reporting, found that the offsets largely did not lead to effective reductions in deforestation or any climate benefit. ""Only a handful of Verra’s rainforest projects showed evidence of deforestation reductions, according to two studies, with further analysis indicating that 94 percent of the credits had no benefit to the climate,"" said The Guardian. Verra, the world’s largest carbon credit provider that has issued over one billion carbon credits since 2009, wrote on its website that the studies cited had reached ""incorrect conclusions."" It said their methodology did not account for ""project-specific factors that cause deforestation."" To generate a ""carbon credit,"" a project must be implemented to protect a part of a rainforest and ensure it is not felled. Thus, the area saved corresponds to an amount of carbon those trees are able to absorb from the atmosphere. A company can buy credits to offset its emissions. Companies like Verra are supposed to ensure that the projects they invest in are real and effective, however questions have long hung over the methodology used to determine this. Verra said it has ""recently"" reviewed its calculation methods and is in the process of standardising its methodology. The voluntary carbon offsets market has recorded impressive growth over the last years to near UDS 2 billion in 2021,quadruplating from 2020, according to the latest State of the Voluntary Carbon Markets report from Ecosystem Marketplace."

"""Blue Beauty"", the new formula kit by Seppic for responsible beauty","During the Cosmet’Agora show on January 10 and 11, 2023, Seppic presented its new collection of seven formulas inspired by the ""Blue Beauty"" trend. Blue Beauty offers beauty products sourced from marine resources while being respectful of nature, in particular the oceans. The formulas Seppic presented at Cosmet’Agora 2023 have been developed to inspire formulators through three axes: Use less water. For this, Seppic offers an oily formula and an anhydrous balm. The balm has been proposed to the Cosmet’Agora formulation contest for its multipurpose moisturizing, purifying and deodorant potential with high naturality (> 99% according to ISO 16128). This melting formula is composed of just over 50% Emogreen L19 and 10% Sepifine BB, two texturizing agents that provide a light and non-greasy feel, despite an anhydrous composition. Preserve the oceans from pollution. To address this, Seppic has come up with two formulas. The first, a powder shower gel to be reconstituted, composed of easily biodegradable ingredients including Proteol APL EF, a mild anionic surfactant, inspired by the characteristic aminogram of the apple, and generating a creamy foam. The second, an SPF 50 sunscreen with fat-soluble UV filters and formulated with Sensanov WR, an emulsifier with film-forming and water-resistant properties. Have more transparent sourcing. The three formulas offered feature active ingredients sourced in Brittany at the Seppic site in Pontrieux. Codiavelane BG PF, a green algae extract with moisturizing properties, is indeed sourced and produced in this same region and is integrated to a transparent bluish gel formula evoking the ocean. Furthermore, Celtosome Crithmum maritimum and Celtosome Eryngium maritimumare derived from the plant cell culture technology, Celtosome. Developed respectively from sea fennel and sea holly, they help target skin regeneration as well as radiance and fit perfectly into a texture for mature skin. Finally, a spa treatment formula with Breton seaweed flakes completes this kit. “Over the past few decades, the beauty industry has evolved and begun to better address consumer concerns about safety, health and the environment. Blue Beauty is the latest step in this evolution. More information on this trend and formulas are available upon request,” said Seppic in a statement."

Idol Woodacity Solo Twist: a Refillable and ergonomic compact by Quadpack,"Woodacity, Quadpack’s range of wooden packaging solutions, is expanding with addition of a new refillable and ergonomic compact designed to bring convenience and sustainability. Idol Woodacity Solo Twist Compact, the new addition to the Woodacity family, features the Solo Twist closure system, bringing a new, inclusive gesture for both right and left-handed consumers, who can open the cap on a quarter turn in either direction.

Thanks to a recess at the base, the godet can be easily extracted by hand and replaced with a filled version.

The wood used in the compact is a renewable raw material and can be PEFC- or FSC-certified. “A precious piece of nature designed to last, Idol Woodacity Solo Twist Compact is made to be used longer, again and again,” said Quadpack in a statement."
Silab adapts its governance to ensure its independence,"The French manufacturer of natural cosmetic active ingredients, which until now was a limited company with a board of directors, has become a limited company with a management board and a supervisory board, effective January 1st, 2023. For Jean Paufique, founder of Silab in 1984, the goal is to allow the company to maintain its independence, which considered the key factor of its success. “This independence gives Silab a large freedom of decision in terms of innovation and investments and places it as a strategic supplier to its main customers,” said the company in a statement. Mr. Paufique has therefore decided to entrust the operational management of the company to the five members of the former management committee: Brigitte Closs-Gonthier, Jean-Philippe Cosson, Xavier Gaillard, Florence Giner-Meilhac and Dominique Muller. This team now constitutes Silab’s new management board, which is chaired by Mrs Brigitte Closs-Gonthier. ""For nearly 40 years, I have worked with my collaborators to build a solid company that is a reference in its market and a vector of strong values. It is now time to put in place a new organization, synonymous with stability and sustainability. I have full confidence in the management team that has worked alongside me for many years, and I am convinced that they will continue to foster the virtuous circle of our development,” said Jean Paufique. This change in governance also includes the creation of a Supervisory Board chaired by Mr. Paufique, with his wife, Josette Paufique, and his daughter, Anne Paufique, both vice-chairwomen. Jean-Louis Nesti and Nathalie Tholoniat join them as independent members. Silab is a 100% family-owned company. The members of the Paufique family remain fully committed to the project through the general meeting of shareholders. “I am very honored by the trust placed in me. What is essential for all of us is to guarantee continuity, whether in terms of strategic choices or shared values. We want all our stakeholders (clients, suppliers, employees, public authorities, etc.) to be assured of our desire to maintain Silab’s identity, and I am personally committed to infusing the same dynamic,” concluded Brigitte Closs-Gonthier."

Estée Lauder launches AI-powered beauty app for visually impaired users,"The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) UK & Ireland has launched what they called “a first-of-its-kind” Voice-Enabled Makeup Assistant (VMA) application. Powered by artificial intelligence, the mobile app helps visually impaired users to apply makeup more easily and confidently. “ELC’s ambition for the launch of VMA is to support the visually impaired community by further enabling self-expression and self-empowerment through their relationship with makeup,” said the company in a statement. VMA uses voice instruction technologies to assist the user in makeup application; users receive audio feedback and tips on whether their lipstick, eyeshadow, or foundation is evenly applied. Using Artificial Intelligence, ELC’s VMA identifies makeup applied on a user’s face and assesses the uniformity and boundaries of application and coverage. VMA identifies any areas on the face that may require more accurate application and audibly describes where touch ups may be needed. In the UK alone, the National Health Service estimates that more than 2 million people are living with sight loss, of whom 340,000 are registered as blind or partially sighted. The VMA App will initially be available via the Apple App Store in the UK and esteelauder.co.uk. The Estée Lauder brand in the UK will be the first to adopt and promote this technology. It is targeted to launch on the Google Play store within the year and across other ELC brands and markets in the near future. The launch is the first iteration of the app, intended to be continuously optimized and improved over the coming months. Future versions of the application will offer expanded services, with the goal of providing new features, including looks to choose from, and makeup education tools to help visually impaired users better utilize ELC’s products and services."

In 2022, more than 10 new employees, with complementary profiles and skills, joined Afyren to support the company’s industrial development in France and abroad. According to Afyren, the new hires, notably for the R&D team, reflect the company’s desire to continuously develop and optimize the best sustainable solutions for its customers and partners. “New employees are also being recruited in engineering and project management to support the existing operational teams and to prepare for Afyren’s international expansion, including the design of future plants.

These products replicate the properties of equivalent petroleum-based molecules. The company recently launched the industrial production of its biosourced organic acids and initiated the first steps of its expansion in the USA, in partnership with Excellentia."

"Le Galion revives L’Astre, Ava Gardner’s mythical perfume","The French perfume house bought and relaunched in 2014 by Nicolas Chabot has signed an exclusive license agreement with The Ava Gardner Trust [1] to relaunch L’Astre, a legendary fragrance created for the personal and exclusive use of the Hollywood star by Paul Vacher (co-creator of Arpège and Miss Dior), which at the time was the perfumer and owner of the brand. Indeed, the actress and Le Galion were inextricably linked at the end of the 1950s, when she became an ambassador for the brand and the face of Sortilège, a perfume tribute to extravagant parties and the signature scent of 1950s high society. At the end of their collaboration, Paul Vacher composed L’Astre, a tailor-made fragrance that remained private for decades. The licensing agreement covers the creation, production (with Givaudan) and distribution of a contemporary reedition of L’Astre. The project was made possible thanks to the contribution of the Ava Gardner Estate and its heirs who offered access to their archives. Created by Rodrigo Florès-Roux, this new version of L’Astre is, according to the perfumer, a “large, exuberant and magnetic floral.” After a catchphrase made of sensual spices, the perfumer worked on “a spectacular floral accord” made of white flowers, before continuing with an amber, warm and enveloping background. Born in 1930, Le Galion soon met international success thanks to several iconic perfumes composed by Paul Vacher, including Sortilège (1936), Special For Gentleman (1947) and Eau Noble (1972). L’Astre will be unveiled to the public on February 1, 2023: www.legalionparfums.com"
Infopro Digital to debut “Clean Beauty in Los Angeles” event next October,"The organizers of the Luxe Pack and MakeUp in trade shows have announced the dates of the inaugural edition of Clean Beauty in Los Angeles, a BtoB event dedicated to the clean beauty industry. The concept was premiered in London last year and is now traveling to California for an inaugural edition on October 24th and 25th 2023 at Magic Box in Los Angeles. The event will bring together contract manufacturers and formulators, turnkey solutions providers, suppliers of accessories, packaging solutions and ingredients for clean beauty brands in the skincare, makeup, haircare and bodycare categories. Experts speakers will also join the show for a series of conferences and talks that will aim to decipher what is the future of clean beauty in the U.S. and globally. ""The development of this concept entirely dedicated to Clean Beauty was an obvious extension of our know-how,"" said Aurélie de Boisvilliers, Marketing and Communication Director at Infopro Digital in a statement. According to Infopro Digital, the United States – where the concept was born about ten years ago – is the key market for clean beauty. Propelled in the 2010s by retailers Credo and Follain, Clean Beauty has become an issue for other retailers: creation of ""Clean at Sephora"" in 2018, ""Target Clean"" in 2019, ""Conscious Beauty"" at Ulta in 2020, or the ""Built for Better"" program at Walmart in 2021. The key players, meanwhile, have entered the game with the acquisition of clean brands (Farmacy Beauty by Procter & Gamble, Drunk Elephant by Shiseido, Youth to the people by L’Oréal, Tata Harper by Amorepacific). And there are also dozens of independent brands that are boosting a booming market in which the American Gen Z [1] (more than 68 million people in 2022) plays a key role. “Our unique professional event aims to inspire and connect beauty brands with suppliers and beauty experts to answer the issues and needs of a market that is still in the making,” added de Boisvilliers. “Over two days, Clean Beauty in Los Angeles will bring together a wide range of experts to help skincare, makeup, haircare and body care brands understand what it means to be clean, and to find the right suppliers for their market,” she concluded."

Beauty tech: L’Oréal unveils two new make-up devices at CES 2023,"After a lipstick customization instrument in 2021, and a new home hair color technology last year, L’Oréal unveiled at CES 2023 two new technology prototypes intended to facilitate make-up application: HAPTA, the first handheld, ultra-precise computerized makeup applicator designed to advance the beauty needs of people with limited hand and arm mobility; and L’Oréal Brow Magic, the first at-home electronic eyebrow makeup applicator that provides users with customized brow looks in seconds. “For L’Oréal, the future of beauty is inclusive. And this future will be made more accessible by technology,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of the L’Oréal Groupe. Still under development, HAPTA is intended to help people who live with limited fine motor skills to steadily apply lipstick at home thus reinforcing their autonomy and self-confidence. The new device will incorporate technology originally created by Verily to stabilize and level food utensils. HAPTA’s leveling device will be piloted with L’Oréal-owned Lancôme in 2023, first with a lipstick applicator followed by additional makeup applications in the future. L’Oréal Brow Magic is an electronic makeup applicator promises users to shape their own eyebrows as well as a professional would. Developed in partnership with the tech company Prinker — a pioneer in printed, non-permanent tattoos — the device uses 2,400 tiny nozzles and a printing technology with up to 1,200 drops per inch (dpi) printing resolution. Thanks to L’Oréal’s Modiface AR technology, L’Oréal Brow Magic scans the user’s face and makes recommendations for microblading, micro-shading, or filler effects. “The strength of L’Oréal’s beauty tech program is supported through the quality of our partnerships,” highlighted Guive Balooch, L’Oréal Global Head of Research and Innovation’s Tech Incubator. “Often, we find a brilliant technology that is being applied to something outside the beauty realm. Combining L’Oréal’s heritage of beauty with these advanced technologies allows us to create entirely new beauty gestures—reimagining the original technology, and the traditional beauty experience, in the process.”"

Neopac launches new range of robust rHDPE caps with high PCR Rates,"Hoffmann Neopac recently launched a new range of post-consumer recycled (PCR) caps suitable for a wide variety of the company’s tube solutions in the personal care and beauty markets. At its inception, the new series will include recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) screw caps from 19-40 millimetres in diameter, a flip-top cap 35mm in diameter, and an octagonal cap for sample tubes. Each is fully recyclable in existing HDPE streams. The range offers a remarkably high content in PCR  material – approximately 70%. Combined with Neopac’s various eco-designed tubes, the result is a capability to create packaging solutions comprised of up to 77% recycled material. According to Neopac, the new rHDPE caps comply with the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC+) requirements, and can come with food-grade light statements from government entities like the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and US Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Neopac’s new rHDPE caps can also help brand owners save on extended producer responsibility (EPR) fees in markets where they are have to be paid. The rHDPE caps are produced using 50% green electricity in Neopac’s Switzerland and Hungary manufacturing facilities. “As tube manufacturers have continued to make progress toward true circularity, caps have always presented a significant sustainability hurdle,” said Cornelia Schmid, Head of Marketing for Neopac. “Rooted in research and materials science, our new rHDPE caps, which contain 70% PCR material, represent a substantial step in the right direction, and we look forward to adding to the series in the coming months.” The rHDPE are the latest in Neopac’s portfolio of EcoDesign packaging solutions. Earlier this year, the company introduced Eco-Stripped Tube, which combines a significantly reduced sleeve wall thickness with a comparable materials reduction in the shoulder and cap. The result is a 30% reduction in overall virgin materials without sacrificing product protection, haptics or aesthetics. According to Neopac, four Eco-Stripped Tubes can be made with the amount of materials it takes to produce three conventional tubes of the same size. Trimmed-down tubes therefore help to substantially reduce the carbon footprint of packaging solutions. Other solutions in Neopac’s EcoDesign portfolio includes Polyfoil MMB, whose mono-material barrier brings vastly improved recyclability; Sugarcane Tube, made from renewable raw materials; and PICEA wood tube, comprised of 95% renewable material in the tube body and shoulder – including 10% of spruce wood from wood waste in sawmills."
"Vivienne Westwood, punk queen turned fashion dame, dies aged 81","Doyenne of British design Vivienne Westwood, who brought rebellious politics to the catwalk, died on Thursday aged 81, her family said. Westwood made provocation itself into an art form — from the leather bondage gear she popularised in the 1970s to the time she went without underwear to Buckingham Palace to receive her damehood from the late Queen Elizabeth II. ""Vivienne Westwood died today, peacefully and surrounded by her family, in Clapham, South London. The world needs people like Vivienne to make a change for the better,"" her fashion label’s Twitter account said. Leading tributes, London’s Victoria and Albert Museum described Westwood as a ""true revolutionary and rebellious force in fashion"", while Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said she had been a ""towering figure"". ""Her punk style rewrote the rule book in the 1970s and (she) was widely admired for how she stayed true to her own values throughout her life,"" she wrote on Twitter. In an ever-colourful career, Westwood sent a bare-breasted Kate Moss down the runway munching on ice cream, and almost broke Naomi Campbell’s ankle when the supermodel failed to stay upright on a pair of her nine-inch platform heels. And she held on to her edge even as she was embraced by the establishment, thanks largely to her energetic activism for environmental causes. It was all a long way from the village of Tintwistle in northern England where Vivienne Isabel Swire was born on April 8, 1941 to a mother who worked in a cotton mill and a father who mended shoes. She made her own tailored suits as a teenager and studied jewellery in London, but quickly dropped out, later saying: ""I didn’t know how a working-class girl like me could possibly make a living in the art world."" She became a teacher, married factory worker Derek Westwood and had a son by the time she was 22. Her life took a major swerve when she left her husband for Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, a few years later. Together, they opened a clothing store on London’s King’s Road that became the epicentre of the punk movement. The shop morphed over time, but at its peak, under the name ""SEX"", the ripped T-shirts, latex and leather bondage gear became the provocative uniform of a generation set on tearing down the last cultural taboos. ""We saw it as a question of youth against age. Who needs leaders who are a total rip-off, who create war and torture?"" she told L’Officiel magazine in 2018. Chrissie Hynde, who worked at SEX before going on to form the band the Pretenders, tweeted on Thursday that ""the world is already a less interesting place"" without Westwood. Westwood later claimed she had no interest in becoming a fashion designer — that she had only done it to support McLaren’s ambitions — but she knew where her talents lay. Her first proper fashion show came in 1981. Remembered as the Pirate Collection, it was an instant hit, modelled as much on Native Americans as nautical miscreants. ""No designer had ever done this before, they’d been inspired by historical clothes, but I actually copied them,"" she told L’Officiel. She continued to plumb British and French history to great acclaim, creating the Mini-Crini (combining Victorian crinoline with the modern mini-skirt) in 1985. Her ""Witches"" collection, a collaboration with graffiti artist Keith Haring, was beloved by Madonna at the height of her stardom. In 1992, she married Kronthaler, an Austrian former student of hers, 25 years her junior. He became her creative director and increasingly took over the design work in later years. By the 2000s, she was a full-fledged celebrity — designing wedding dresses not just for the elite, but for iconic TV characters including Carrie Bradshaw in ""Sex and the City"" and even Miss Piggy. In 2014, Westwood designed glamourous new uniforms for Virgin Atlantic’s flight attendants, with the airline hailing her on Thursday as a ""true British icon and... visionary"". Westwood’s political activism became ever more pronounced in later years, advocating against arbitrary detention, nuclear weapons and especially supporting environmental causes and groups like Greenpeace. Critics have pointed out that Westwood hardly stuck to the pledges in the ""Climate Revolution Charter"" she issued during her 2013-14 fall-winter collection. Advocacy group Remake gave her brand a failing score of 21 out of 100 on its sustainability index. Few, however, could deny that she brought a unique form of engagement and humanity into the world of fashion. She was also a staunch supporter of jailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, protesting on his behalf and even designing his wife’s dress for their wedding at Belmarsh prison outside London earlier this year. WikiLeaks tweeted news of Westwood’s death along with side-by-side photos of her and Assange wearing the same Westwood-designed T-shirt, adding ""Rest in Power""."
Stoelzle Masnières makes the bottle of Parfums de Marly’s new fragrance,"Parfum de Marly has entrusted French glassmaker Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie for the production of the bottle of their latest female fragrance, Oriana. When creating Oriana, Julien Sprecher, founder and Artistic Director of Parfums de Marly, intended to regenerate the brilliant balance between tradition and innovation. This new and refreshing scent was developed by two incredible perfumers, Nathalie Lorson and Hamid Merati-Kashani. Together, they blended a mix of fruity and floral aromas; using the undertones of mandarin, grapefruit and bergamot to complement the more exuberant perfumes of orange blossom, raspberry and blackcurrant. In addition, hints of marshmallow, whipped cream, musk and ambrette are found to subtly ensue. Parfum de Marly uses the same shaped bottle for all their women’s perfumes. Men’s products also come in the same shaped bottle, the only difference is the colour For Stoelzle Masnières Perfumerie, the challenge was to bring to life a unique design with very refined engraving. Oriana’s scent is available in 75 ml and 30 ml bottles and the glassmaker had to maintain the same finesse with each bottle size, ensuring the smaller bottle didn’t lose any of the intricate detail."
Which social network ranked highest among Gen Z and Millennials in 2022?,"As we head into 2023, it’s time to take stock of which social platforms took the lead in this year’s popularity stakes. Between TikTok, Twitter and Meta, social players have done everything to seduce younger generations, but which ones won their favour? With more features, more ways to earn money, or even more freedom, some platforms have managed to attract new users compared to 2021. So reports a study from YPulse, conducted among 1,500 young users, ages 13 to 39, in the United States and Canada. While Generations Z and Y are using each platform for a specific purpose, they are still most likely to use YouTube. The video streaming site remains the most popular platform for young people at 72%, despite a slight drop in use from 74% in 2021. Despite repeated scandals and controversy, Meta manages to hold its own with two of its social networks in the top three. Facebook and Instagram, respectively second and third in the ranking, also show a decline in usage among young people of Generations Z and Y. Just like Facebook Messenger, which has suffered the biggest drop in usage at 10%, dropping from 53% to 43%. WhatsApp, another platform belonging to Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta group, takes ninth place with 26% of respondents saying they currently use this application. Despite being placed at the bottom of the ranking, WhatsApp is among the six platforms that have seen an increase in usage among the young people surveyed in the space of one year. The platform gains 10 percentage points compared to 2021. A feat that Reddit has also managed, going from 17% to 27% usage among young people. On closer inspection, the YPulse Social Media Monitor report shows differences between Generations Z and Y. Millennials are more likely to use Facebook, at 69% compared to 37% for Gen Zers. On the other hand, TikTok is a must-have for 69% of the younger generation versus 49% for their elders. The success of WhatsApp and Reddit is mostly driven by Millennials, while Discord is more popular with Gen Z. For its part, TikTok continues to impose itself among the favorite platforms of the young generation, but it has seen its growth slow down significantly in 2022, reaching 55% usage in November 2022 compared to 48% a year earlier.

Dubbed “Le Grand Numéro de Chanel”, the event takes place at the Grand Palais Éphémère in Paris, France. Admission is free, upon registration. “Chanel perfumery has an existential aim. Le Grand Numéro de Chanel is an emotional journey, an opportunity to discover every facet of a fragrance and the role it plays,"" says Thomas du Pré de Saint Maur, Head of Global Creative Resources for Fragrance & Beauty, Fine Jewelry & Watches.

A dive into 1921 then allows visitors to participate in a re-enactment of the creation of the ionic N°5, and to better understand the historical role of the fragrance, before discovering a succession of rooms dedicated to Chance, Bleu, Coco Mademoiselle, and Les Exclusifs. “A fragrance is more than a name, a bottle, or a scent; it is also everything it brings to mind when we breathe it in, and all it evokes when we wear it. It is a spectacular and extraordinary creation. Many people believe that fragrance is an accessory or the finishing touch on a look, but it is so much more than that.

Founders of first sustainable castor bean program unveil impact analysis,"Arkema, BASF SE and Jayant Agro-Organics, the founders of the Pragati project for sustainable castor beans, along with implementation partner Solidaridad, have published the latest results of the world’s first sustainable castor program. Initiated in May 2016 in Gujarat, India, where the majority of the world’s castor supply originates, the goal of the project has been to enable sustainable castor crop production by: – Using good agricultural practices to increase yield and farmer income;
– Efficiently using water resources and maintaining soil fertility;
– Driving adoption of good waste management practices;
– Enabling better health and safety practices and respecting human rights. After six years, the program has allowed to train, audit and certify over 6,200 farmers and over 50,000 tons of certified castor (Ricinus communis) seed have been cultivated. In addition: – On year 6, lands included in the program have reached a yield 22% higher than the average yield published by the local government for the region.
– Over 6,000 hectares are now being regularly farmed in accordance with the SuCCESS sustainable castor code [1] - more than 19,000 hectares cumulatively; Pragati farmers are increasing their land dedicated to castor farming as it is seen as a profitable crop.
– Approximately 6,300 safety kits and crop protection product boxes have been distributed free of charge.
– Water consumption has been lowered by approximately 30 percent in the demo plots where accurate measurement and control is in place.
– Farmers from more than 80 villages in North Gujarat now participate in the program.
– In 2021, more than 260 individual training sessions were held with farmers. Heavy emphasis is also put on improved personal safety and chemical hygiene (with the use of disposable respirators, safety glasses and gloves, as well as easy-to-understand, picture-based instructions that show where, when and how to use each personal protection item, along with instructions on how to handle chemicals safely). Considering the successful implementation in the previous years, the Pragati members said they are “further committed” to program."

Tokyo exhibit showcases Dior’s passion for Japan,"A hit exhibition showcasing Christian Dior’s work opens in Tokyo this week, with a focus on the French designer’s fascination with Japan and the country’s influence on his pieces. After drawing huge crowds in Paris, London and New York, “Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams” is opening today in Japan, the exhibition features 350 haute couture dresses — including Japan-inspired gowns displayed in settings intended to pay tribute to Japanese culture. Architect Shohei Shigematsu created structures, including a room covered with an undulating three-dimensional facade constructed from translucent traditional washi paper pasted over wooden frames. “When Dior makes a skirt, there is a structure and then the fabric is laid on top of it,” he told AFP. “I was asked to create a Japanese traditional structure, so I thought about shoji screens, for example, which have a wooden structure and are covered with paper.” Each section features a different interior design intended to show various parts of Japanese culture. “There is a section inspired by an orderly tatami room separated by sliding doors. But not everything in Japan is simple and minimal. […] We have different designs like Japanese gardens and flashy kimonos. I wanted to show the sides of Japan people don’t know,” said Shohei Shimegatsu. The Dior house first presented a show in Japan in 1953, and the designer had a well-known fascination with the country. «Dior had a lot of respect for traditional Japanese culture, and he wrote about it in his memoir», curator Florence Muller told AFP. «I think there is a mutual fascination between France and Japan».Starting in the 1950s, Dior also collaborated with Japanese companies, giving them the rights to adapt and reproduce Dior looks to cater to local tastes. In a sign of the brand’s popularity, Japan’s former empress Michiko chose a Dior gown made from Japanese textiles when she married then-prince Akihito in 1959. The Tokyo show, which runs until May 28, includes archive pieces as well as works by more recent creative directors, and showcases several items inspired by Japan. Among them is a John Galliano coat with “The Great Wave Off Kanagawa” print emblazoned on the base of its full skirt, and robes cinched with Japanese obi-style belts created by Raf Simons. Dior’s austere jacket dress named “Rashomon”— the name of a Japanese novel and film directed by the legendary Akira Kurosawa — is also on display. “This exhibition shows the mutual respect between Japan and France in their approach to crafts, fashion, design and art”, said Shigematsu."
Hugo Boss and Coty renew their license agreement,"Coty, which acquired the Hugo Boss license from P&G in 2016, when the American giant withdrew from the luxury sector, has just announced the extension of their agreement with the German brand until 2035.

Hugo Boss aspires to claim a leading global role in men’s fragrances and will place particular emphasis on the U.S. market in the coming years. The joint future developments will complement the Boss Bottled range. In addition, Hugo Boss plans to continue expanding its share of Boss women’s fragrances in key European markets and lay the foundation for this segment to grow into the U.S. market. Another strategic focus area is the strengthening of the top of the brand’s fragrance range, Boss The Collection. This expansion will specifically enhance the relevance of the Boss fragrance brand in specialty markets such as the Middle East and China. The two companies also announced the existing offering for men and women under the Hugo brand will also be reinvented to sharpen the focus on young target groups, including Gen Z. Following this agreement, Coty has no sizeable license up for renewal in the next six years.

Beiersdorf acquires S-Biomedic to strengthen its skin microbiome expertise,"Beiersdorf has acquired a majority stake in S-Biomedic, a life-science company and frontrunner in the field of skin microbiome research. The German group already hold a minority stake in S-Biomedic after an initial investment in in 2018 as part of its corporate venture capital activities.

UK airports to relax aircraft liquid rules from 2024,"The UK government announced on Thursday that it will significantly relax limits on taking liquids in carry-on luggage at airports from June 2024. Currently, only containers of less than 100 ml are allowed in the aircraft cabin at international airports, provided they are placed in clear bags at security checks. Larger containers have to be checked in the hold, and electronic devices such as laptops must also be removed from bags. But under a new bill to be presented to parliament on Thursday, limits for liquids will be raised to two litres. Electronic devices will also no longer have to be checked separately, the Department for Transport said in a statement. The rules, introduced in the early 2000s to prevent the use of liquid explosives on planes, have become a bind for travellers, regularly holding up queues. The relaxation comes as a result of new technology being deployed at major airports in the UK over the next two years, the department said. The ""cutting-edge"" machines will give security staff more detailed three-dimensional images of what people are carrying in their bags. Similar CT X-ray technology uses ""highly advanced threat-detection algorithms"" and is being rolled out at other airports around the world, said Transport Secretary Mark Harper. ""By 2024, major airports across the UK will have the latest security tech installed, reducing queueing times, improving the passenger experience, and most importantly detecting potential threats,"" he added. Rules on liquids were tightened after a British man, Richard Reid, tried to blow up a transatlantic jet in December 2001 using homemade explosives hidden in his shoes. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents airlines, said it hoped the industry and passengers would be given ""plenty of notice"" of any changes. It also called for it to be ""coordinated globally""."

Avatly: A new hybrid shopping mecca designed for avatars,"The first shopping mall, dedicated mainly to fashion is opening in the metaverse. Called Avatly, this digital mall will allow our virtual counterparts to indulge in highly realistic shopping sessions in order to fill their closets with digital clothing. And, if they have some money left over, they might even buy you one or two real-world clothing items. This new shopping destination spans 300,000 (virtual) square meters, and spread over three (virtual) floors, this new kind of shopping mall, mainly dedicated to fashion. The building takes the form of a giant diamond, symbolizing, according to its founders, ""independence, wealth and exclusivity."" The mall is set in the middle of an island in the tropics. Built with the Unreal Engine 5 creation tool, and based on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain, this shopping mall of the future already promises a host of activities and applications, even though it is still in its early stages. ""Avatly will provide the best real-time 3D experience and avatar solutions, taking the shopping experience into a completely new dimension. Avatly will also integrate Metaverse 3D boutiques with e-commerce, dedicated to premium fashion brands and designers,"" reads the website dedicated to this new virtual fashion hotspot. Concretely, visitors will simply be able to enter a store to visualize a brand’s contents, and to buy products directly on its e-store, whether these be virtual or real-world clothes. Thanks to a simple application, users will first be able to create their avatar(s), which the company promises will be ""ultra-realistic,"" before accessing a wide range of clothing and accessory collections. Not content with browsing, users will be able to try on items virtually before buying them (or not) in the various Avatly spaces and even on 3D catwalks. Last but not least, they will be able to buy clothes in two versions, in 3D for virtual use or in physical form via integrated traditional e-commerce platforms. The mall is also expected to feature entertainment areas, including fashion shows and virtual reality parties, catering for those who less keen on shopping — or waiting tirelessly for avatars capable of spending hours locked in a fitting room. It remains to be seen whether fashion brands — as well as users — are ready to take the plunge."
Nearly half of Brits shop online outside the UK to find cheaper products,"Almost half (48%) of British consumers say that they shop online outside their domestic market because it is cheaper than shopping locally, reveals a new survey of 9,000 global consumers commissioned by Global-e, the leading cross-border ecommerce solutions provider, and carried out by Censuswide [1]. The survey of cross-border ecommerce shoppers across nine markets, reveals the UK (25%) is the third most popular market for global consumers to make an international purchase from, behind the US (46%) and China (42%). Meanwhile, among UK shoppers, China (57%) and the US (47%) are the most popular markets for cross-border shopping, followed by Germany (11%), Spain (10%) and France (9%). Affordability was the top reason driving Brits to shop online internationally, slightly higher than the global average (47%). For UK respondents, this is closely followed by the brand having a wide variety of products (33%) and offering low shipping costs (28%). In contrast, expensive shipping (59%) and a lengthy or costly delivery time (43%) are the top reasons for Brits to abandon a cart when shopping internationally. As the busy retail peak shopping period takes hold, retailers looking to maximise their profits this quarter can expect consumers to look online for the best deals. The survey also revealed that 62% of British respondents prefer to shop directly from the brands website, compared to only 33% of respondents preferring to shop on a marketplace. Those aged between 25-34 year-olds are the most likely to purchase from a brand directly (71%) followed by those aged 16-24 (66%). Social channels also play a large role in driving international sales with 46% of British consumers purchasing from an international brand after coming across it on social media. For Brits, social is more prominent in driving cross-border sales than both online search (42%) and online marketplaces (34%). Of those British consumers that have gone on to purchase due to the influence of social media, Instagram (58%) is by far the most popular followed by Facebook/Meta (42%) and TikTok (32%). More than half of those ages 16-24 cite TikTok (69%) as the most popular platform to discover brands on, with Instagram (55%) coming in second. Whilst older platforms like Instagram and Facebook come out on top for the older age groups, 27% of 35-44 year olds have made a purchase because they engaged with the brand on TikTok, showing it isn’t only the youngest demographic that brands can reach on the platform. Clothes, Shoes & Accessories (74%) is the most popular category for UK shoppers when making a purchase online internationally. This is followed by Health & Beauty (29%) and Jewellery & Watches (23%). Globally, Clothes, Shoes & Accessories (61%) are by far the most popular cross-border ecommerce category, followed by Health & Beauty (30%) and Consumer Electronics & Technology (30%). “Amidst the cost of living crisis, it is unsurprising that many consumers around the world are looking for affordable alternatives online, and looking to international markets to make some of these purchases. This is predominantly happening directly from a brand’s website, demonstrating the crucial need for brands to not just streamline domestic platforms but ensure that their international direct-to-consumer offering is tailored and localised to individual markets so consumers are able to shop with ease no matter where they are in the world. Moreover, British retailers can use these insights to level the playing field, by first localising international direct-to-consumer channels then investing in the right channels, such as via key social media platforms, with to drive traffic and ultimately revenue growth,” said Nir Debbi, Co-founder and President at Global-e."

Givaudan Active Beauty: A retinol alternative with a high tolerability profile,"Givaudan Active Beauty is strengthening its well-ageing portfolio with the launch of Siliphos, a natural alternative to retinoids. The new active ingredient is extracted by green fractionation from milk thistle fruits and powered by Phytosome technology. According to Givaudan Active Beauty, Siliphos outperforms bakuchiol - the current plant-based retinol alternative benchmark. Thanks to a high tolerability profile, Siliphos challenges retinoid efficacy by reducing wrinkles without side effects. It is therefore suitable for delicate skin. “Siliphos is the first natural alternative to retinoids and bakuchiol capable of providing well-ageing benefits comparable to retinol. Extracted from Silybum marianum Gaertn fruit, it acts directly on collagen production to provide a natural, safe and efficient skincare solution, suitable for even most delicate skins,” said Giada Maramaldi, Botanical Actives Category Manager for Active Beauty. The well-ageing performance of Siliphos was tested in a clinical study on volunteers presenting crow’s feet and forehead wrinkles. According to Givaudan, all tests demonstrated Siliphos to significantly outperform bakuchiol and act as efficiently as retinoids by reducing: – Crow’s feet wrinkles by x2 (at D56 versus placebo),
– Overall facial wrinkles by x2.3 (at D56 versus placebo)
– Number of forehead wrinkles by 21.2% (at D56 versus bakuchiol)
– Circumference of forehead wrinkles by 17.4% (at D56 versus bakuchiol)
– Redness by 22.9% (at D56 versus retinoid). Siliphos was developed to address the growing demand for efficient natural cosmetic alternatives. According to Givaudan’s global CMI study [1], 77% of the consumers across six countries declared that they would be very interested in a natural version of retinol: enjoying the multiple skin benefits without worrying about the potential side effects, such as redness, dryness and irritation."

Gattefossé focuses on pleasing the senses with new sun care formulas,"The French-based manufacturer of cosmetic ingredients has unveiled eight new sun care formulas containing organic UV filters, mineral or a combination of both and created from four key ingredients of its portfolio. Developed by Gattefossé’s application lab, the new set aims to combine performance, stability, and sensoriality in order to respond to both the challenges faced by formulators and the needs and requirements of consumers. “The sensoriality of sunscreens is a major concern and a challenge for formulators. Addition of UV filters to cosmetics brings greasiness and stickiness that are difficult to hide and unpleasant to the consumer,” explains the company in a statement. Gattefossé has developed four ingredients (three emulsifiers and a texturizing agent) that respond to the major issues encountered in the formulation of suncare products: – Emulium Illustro, a W/O emulsifier compatible with organic and mineral UV filters to create stable formulations with a comfortable feel.
– Emulium Dolcea MB, an O/W emulsifier, to create stable textures with an ultra-soft and non-tacky afterfeel.
– Emulium Mellifera MB, another O/W emulsifier that makes it possible to formulate suncare products with a light and non-greasy finish.
– Finally, Acticire MB, an active texturizing agent that improves sensoriality of suncare products by reducing the greasy and tacky afterfeel. It also improves durability of the protective film on the skin, as observed with the UV camera. Focus on two formulas 2494-1.13 Powdery Stick SPF50+
Some body areas are particularly prone to UV damage and deserve a foolproof sun protection: nose, cheekbones, scars, tattoos... This anhydrous sun stick is ideal due to its targeted application and its SPF50+. Once applied, it leaves a dry and powdery finish.  2177-7.03 Mineral Shield SPF50
Sensitive and sun-intolerant skin deserves effective and sensorial UV protection too! Formulated with Emulium® Illustro, this sunscreen is neither sticky or greasy on the skin. It is easy to apply and gives the skin a sunshine glow thanks to Gatuline Radiance.  “We have been working on suncare for eight years now. Our ingredients enable to create innovative textures with all kinds of UV filters. Our expert sensory panel helps us to optimize the sensory profiles of our suncare products. Performance being a priority, we test our formulas to guarantee the protective efficacy (SPF in vitro and in vivo, UVA), the water resistance and the photostability of UV filters. We offer help to our customers for any suncare related questions, or to provide expertise and assistance for their formulation projects,” explains Malorie Duvent, Cosmetic evaluation manager and Suncare expert at Gattefossé."
Quadpack launches a new refillable monomaterial stick for solid formulas,"The Barcelona-headquartered beauty packaging manufacturer and provider is launching a new generation of its proprietary Panstick packaging in a more sustainable format. Designed to address the needs of eco-driven brands in sustainable materials for their makeup, fragrance and skincare packaging, Quadpack’s new Infinite PP Panstick is fully made in PP, a recyclable material, and now available in refillable format. Launched in October 2022, this eco-designed evolution of the original plastic Panstick offers new environmental benefits. According to Quadpack, a Lifecycle Assessment of the product showed that the Infinite PP Panstick has a carbon footprint 43% lower than the original version, and that its circularity index has tripled [1]. In addition, the evolution to a monomaterial and refillable pack made the product move up from Minimal to Advanced Level of Sustainability on Quadpack’s PIP (Positive Impact Packaging) rating. The new packaging solution addresses the solidification trend in the cosmetics industry, where brands tend to reduce or eliminate water from their formulas, adopting sticks as alternative formats and encouraging different gestures and applications. Thus, Quadpack’s new Infinite PP Panstick can be used for various formulas in solid formats, such as foundations, highlighters, sunscreen, serums and solid fragrances. Thanks to a practical snap-on system, the it can be easily refilled, with top and bottom refilling possibilities. The product is available in cup size 18.2mm (10g and 4.5g) and 21.3 mm (15g), with several in-house decoration options available."

A sustainable approach to packaging means there is no cellophane wrapping on the perfume boxes, instead, there is a self-adhesive hologram label that guarantees the authenticity of products without the use of plastic. In addition to being reusable, these same boxes are entirely recyclable."

"As US men keep their body hairs mowed, trimmer sales continue to grow","While men continue to have body hair removed or cut in order to improve their appearance, sales of men’s body groomers are up 74% over the last two years, according to The NPD Group. Other trimmers, like ear, nose, and pen trimmers, have also grown retail sales by double-digits from the 12 months ending September 2020 through 12 months ending September 2022. According to the market research firm, sales of men’s body groomers and trimmers reached new heights during the early stages of the pandemic when men emerged from pandemic lockdowns with months of body and facial hair growth to remove! For example, in the 12 months ending September 2021, body groomer sales increased by 62% compared to a still sizeable 7% growth in the year ending September 2022, according to NPD’s ongoing tracking of personal care product sales. Although Gen Zs, ages 18 through 24, have been credited with popularizing this “manscaping trend”, buyers of body groomers and men’s trimmers represent all age groups. “Fueling the manscaping trend are innovative manufacturers who recognize the need for specialty trimmers designed for different body and face areas,” says Joe Derochowski, NPD home industry advisor. “The need was always there, and these manufacturers addressed it and brought it to the forefront, and consumers are responding.”"

Afyren Neoxy chooses Excellentia to set sail for North America,"The Afyren production unit has signed a deal with Excellentia for the distribution of its flavors and fragrances in North American. The deal covers the full suite of Flavyren natural organic acids produced by Afyren Neoxy. Excellentia will distribute the Flavyren line to the major North American players in the flavors and fragrances market. Afyren Neoxy produces organic acids using agricultural co-products as feedstock. These innovative acids are identical (drop-in molecules) to ingredients produced using petroleum derivatives, so they can be directly substituted without changing customers’ production methods. Afyren’s patented process is biomimetic, reproducing on an industrial scale a fermentation process that has been occurring in nature for millions of years. The process uses natural microorganisms and is fully circular. It was developed using a “zero industrial waste” approach: water is fully recycled, and the co-product that is left over from the process is used as a potassium-rich organic fertilizer, completing the circular process. Excellentia is a leading player in the supply of natural ingredients to the flavors and fragrances market. “This agreement will help Afyren better serve the major players in a market that is growing and increasingly turning to natural products,” said Nicolas Sordet, chief executive of Afyren. “Excellentia is at the nerve center of the North American flavors and fragrances market and is well established and known for its distribution capabilities and its expertise in using high quality, natural ingredients like ours.” “Excellentia’s primary focus on pure, natural, clean-label & organic flavor & fragrance ingredients will be greatly enhanced by the unique Flavyren Product line,” said Tom Buco, President of Excellentia. “In addition, our manufacturing and product development expertise will enable us to provide customized solutions to our clients taste and aroma challenges. We are very excited about this affiliation and look forward to many years of mutual prosperity.” According to a report from Quadintel, the global market for natural flavors and fragrances was worth USD9.15 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at an annual rate of more than 6 percent from 2022-2029. North America is the No. 2 global market for flavors and fragrances after Europe. New generations of fragrance ingredients produced using green or white chemistry and biotechnology will be discussed, among many other topics, at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit on December 1, 2022 in Paris .

Puig chooses Taiki for the first Christian Louboutin makeup brushes,"The Spanish group has trusted Taiki to produce the first makeup brush line under Christian Louboutin license. These unique beauty accessories were imagined by the brand according to the iconic design of Louboutin. They take up the emblematic codes of the famous French luxury house, with intense red varnished handles, and metalized spikes all around the ferrules. “Taiki Cosmetics Europe’s technical teams worked very closely with Puig to transcribe this unique design and allow its industrialization within the Taiki Group’s factories,” said the supplier in a statement. Materials have been selected to ensure the balance between quality and durability, customer blacklist and industrial feasibility. The handles and ferrules have thus been designed in PMMA, and the synthetic fibres in intensely soft PBT. The Christian Louboutin logo completes the brushes with elegance, with silver hot stamping. A prototyping phase in 3D printing preceded the production of the injection moulds, to validate every detail of the brushes. Particular attention has been paid to the silver picks to allow perfect demoulding during the industrial production phase. Puig is thus launching the first complete line of Christian Louboutin brushes with a lip brush, a complexion set with a powder and a blush references, and an eye set of 3 brushes, offered in elegant red folding boxes."
Clariant’s eye contour illuminator Rootness Awake wins BSB Innovation Award,"Rootness Awake, Clariant’s advanced and powerful active ingredient, that fights under-eye circles and eye bags, has won gold in the Environment and Actives categories of the BSB Innovation Awards. The natural active is Clariant’s eye contour illuminator co-developed with Plant Advanced Technologies (PAT). Extracted from the roots of Ipomoea Batatas, commonly known as the sweet potato, using innovative and environmentally-compatible Plant Milking technology it is rich in DCQEs (dicaffeoylquinate esters) and targets several mechanisms responsible for under-eye circles and eye bags. Rootness Awake decreases the release of inflammatory mediators, helps to reduce the microvascular network, ensures skin thickness, strengthens integrity and firmness and reduces under-eye pigmentation and edema or fluid build-up and visibly lightens and rejuvenates the look. “We are so proud that Rootness Awake has been recognized for both its powerful properties and the environmentally friendly way in which it is harvested. We’ve been on an incredible journey with our partner PAT and it’s wonderful to see the results of this work bearing fruit. Thanks to all the teams who have made this achievement possible,” said Samy El-Khoury, Head of Clariant Actives & Natural Origins. “Patented Plant Milking technology gives access to the previously inaccessible part of a plant, the roots. It allows plants to grow in aeroponic conditions which makes it possible to stimulate their roots in order to increase the production of compounds of interest, still with an economy of resources as the same plants are harvested several times a year,” added Jean-Paul Fèvre, President of PAT. Two other Clariant products on the market based on this advanced technology are Rootness Energize and Prenylium. Prenylium is a white mulberry tree root extract that is a sustainably sourced active ingredient for premium well-aging skincare. It won the PCHi 2020 Fountain Award due to its significant effect on “anti-aging”, while Rootness Energize is an extract of the roots of Luffa cylindrica which promotes skin elasticity to tonicity and firmness. For its innovative production process and its clinical results, Rootness Energize won the bronze prize at the BSB Innovation Awards 2020 in the category ""Skin Benefits""."

Croda bets on biotechnology to combine innovation and sustainability,"In a recent report [1], Croda highlights the almost unlimited potential of biotechnology to produce highly-performant solution without impacting the environment. “The limitless potential of biotechnology allows us to offer smart alternatives for the consumers’ increasing demands for performance and sustainability,” states the developer of cosmetic active ingredients. According to Croda, within the personal care industry, biotechnology uses the cellular and biomolecular processes of living organisms outside of animals in order to develop cosmetic products. ""I am always curious and amazed to know what nature has developed to evolve, survive and defend itself. Indeed, nature is extremely powerful and offers us its incredible capacities to produce molecules of interest,” says Frédéric De Baene is R&D Biotechnology Director at the Croda Group. Its confidence in the unlimited potential of biotechnology has led Croda to strengthen its innovation and production capacity in this field. In 2012, Croda acquired the Italian company IRB, an expert in plant biotechnology, and in 2018, Nautilus, a Canadian company working on marine micro-organisms. Croda’s Sederma, which specialises in the development of bio-based personal care ingredients, is also a dynamic player in the biotechnology sector. To date, one third of Sederma’s catalogue is made up of biotechnology products. Croda announced it will soon present its first functional ingredient based on micro-organism biofermentation. “Using science, intelligently, through biotechnology allows us to offer consumers bio- based ingredients that fit in with their expectations in terms of sustainability and performance. This fits perfectly with Croda’s commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030,” emphasizes the company. In partnership with Canadian company Anomera, Croda recently launched spheroidal cellulose powders to replace plastic microbeads."

Procos debuts “New Material” bag at Luxe Pack Monaco,"At Luxe Pack Monaco, the German manufacturer of eco-responsible shopping bags, hard cases, folding cases, paper or woven pouches for luxury brands highlighted its new smooth single material kraft bag.

Also on the occasion of Luxe Pack Monaco, note that Procos won a Formes de Luxe Award in the “Lifestyle Box” category for its redesigned mono-material version of the Montblanc “Writing Instrument Box”."
"71% of adults have sensitive skin, finds recent study by Aveeno","A recent review of published literature showed the proportion of individuals with self-reported sensitive skin to some degree was 71% in the general population [1], an increase of 55% in just two decades [2]. However, in their recently published State of Skin Sensitivity Report, Aveeno points out that “sensitive skin” – usually defined as as “unpleasant sensory responses to stimuli that should not provoke such sensations” — is not a clinical diagnosis by itself. It can encompass a range of skin issues from a reaction to external environmental stressors, a product or ingredient, to a symptom of an underlying skin disease. In order to better understand the causes of sensitive skin, and explores the connection between body, mind, and skin, the Johnson & Johnson brand conducted an online survey of 1,000 participants (800 females, 200 males, aged 18-65) among self-declared sensitive skin consumers of varying ethnicities. The research validates the relationship between emotions and perceptions of sensitive skin. Results show that consumers believe stress and ingredients cause the majority of skin reactions. Furthermore, those who identified as extremely sensitive were 200% more likely to have been diagnosed with eczema, rosacea, acne, or allergies than those who identified as slightly sensitive. And one-third of patients with skin diseases like acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and rosacea are estimated to struggle with emotional disorders, including anxiety and depression [3]. Additionally, 50 percent of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis reported that it puts a damper on their social functions, sleep, work productivity, leisure activities, and family relationships [4]. “Treating patients goes well beyond simply analyzing their skin. It’s about how their skin impacts their overall emotional well-being, which is something I consistently see with my patients,” said Dr. Mara Weinstein Velez, Board Certified Dermatologist and paid Aveeno consultant. “The mind-skin connection is a powerful one, and the Aveeno brand’s ability to assemble this in-depth report examining the impact of skin sensitivity provides much needed visibility for the dermatology community.” “Our brand heritage is built on leadership and expertise in the sensitive skin state, and this report illustrates the meaningful impact sensitive skin has on people’s lives,” added KC Hagin, Commercial Leader for Aveeno at Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. “We have an obligation not only to provide product solutions but to help de-stigmatize the word ‘sensitive’ and to turn a common struggle into a strength. Aveeno wants to be front and center of the conversation and is encouraging everyone to be proud of their sensitive skin.” To further encourage conversation around what it really means to have sensitive skin, Aveeno is calling on consumers to share their #ProudlySensitiveSkin stories on social media. The campaign aims to highlight various consumer experiences with skin conditions and showcase how people have learned to love their sensitive skin."
LVMH and Hang Lung sign a partnership to reduce energy consumption,"LVMH pursues policy to reduce energy consumption, signing first partnership with a leading shopping mall owner, Hang Lung Properties, creating a framework for energy efficiency collaboration. Hang Lung Properties, which owns a hundred malls in China, has notably committed to cutting its energy consumption by 18% by 2025, to turning off shops’ lights outside business hours, and to ensuring the presence of electricity meters. For its part, LVMH’s commitments include sourcing 70% of its materials from within a radius of 500 kilometres, along with measuring and tracking energy consumption at its stores. The two partners’ objective is to reduce their environmental impact while at the same time ensuring the health of customers and employees, with special emphasis on indoor air quality, for example by installing air quality sensors in all stores. This cooperation with a major landlord will enable LVMH to achieve more quickly its environmental objectives thanks to swift and effective implementation of the standards set by the LIFE 360 roadmap. This includes progress at stores whose premises are owned by third parties outside the Group. This initial agreement is groundbreaking in scope and consolidates efforts to achieve the LVMH Group’s announced target of a 10% cut in energy consumption worldwide by October 2023. The partnership was announced in conjunction with the LIFE360 in Stores event on October 25-26, part of LVMH’s LIFE 360 environmental initiative. Alongside this new partnership, the event celebrates best practices in energy performance at the Group’s stores, with seven awards going to the most outstanding achievements."
Rémy Cointreau Group to tap into the fragrance market with Maison Psyché,"Combining the ancestral know-hows of expertise of the perfumery and spirits worlds is not that new. Killian Hennessy and Frapin are good illustrations of niche fragrance brands with deep roots in the world of spirits. Rémy Cointreau is taking the plunge with the creation of a luxurious perfume house: Maison Psyché. The brand was born when Baptiste Loiseau, Cellar Master of the Maison Rémy Martin, met Sophie Labbé, Principal Perfumer at Firmenich. The two creative souls have selected perfumery’s finest raw materials and have left them to age in Maison Rémy Martin cellars in Cognac, France, within tonnelets (small oak casks) specially designed by Seguin Moreau,  to allow them to expand their range of expression. “Time has done its work and the result is striking, just like for our eaux de vie,” said Baptiste Loiseau. According to the brand, this unique combination of high end fragrance ingredients and wood gave birth to five new fragrance whose longevity on the skin and olfactory richness have “no equal”. Maison Psyché’s fragrances are available in Baccarat crystal bottles, adorned in gold - some with diamonds, numbered and only available in very limited quantities. For Francesco Riosa, CEO of Maison Psyché, “the creation of Maison Psyché is the fulfilment of a wonderful dream. The dream of reinventing La Grande Parfumerie in the 21st century and restoring its prestige by connecting it to the traditional and time-honoured expertise of Exceptional Spirits.” According to Eric Vallat, CEO of Rémy Cointreau Group, high-end perfumery is a natural extension of the group’s spirits business. “The Maison Psyché range is based on the special blending and ageing expertise specific to the world of spirits to elevate the finest raw materials from perfumery and create innovative fragrances. Maison Psyché is a bridge between two worlds, that of luxury fragrance and that of spirits, and a bold venture with terroirs, people and time at its very heart.”"
Woman sues five companies over claim hair straighteners spurred uterine cancer,"Civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump and mass tort counsel Diandra Debrosse Zimmermann have filed a lawsuit on behalf of Jenny Mitchell, a 32-year-old Missouri resident, claiming that her uterine cancer “was directly and proximately caused by her regular and prolonged exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disrupting chemicals” found in hair straightening products sold by L’Oréal USA, the maker of Dark & Lovely products, and other companies including Namaste Laboratories, Godrej Consumer Products and Dabur International. According to the lawsuit, Mrs Mitchell was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 28, and underwent a full hysterectomy at Boone Hospital Center in Missouri on September 24, 2018. She attended mandatory medical appointments every three months for two years and now has appointments every six months. At a news conference, Mitchell said that she started using chemical hair relaxers around 2000, when she was about 8 years old, “as most young African-American girls.”  She continued using hair-straightening products until March 2022. She claimed to have no family history of cancer or uterine cancer. The lawsuit comes on the heels of a study published last week in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute that found the risk of developing uterine cancer in women who use chemical hair-straightening products frequently was 4% by age 70, compared to 1.6% in those who hadn’t used any of the products in the previous 12 months. The study was conducted by the National Institute of Health’s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences among 33,497 American women aged 35 to 74, over a period of nearly 11 years. “Black women have long been the victims of dangerous products specifically marketed to them,” said Ben Crump in a statement. “Black hair has been and always will be beautiful, but Black women have been told they have to use these products to meet society’s standards. We will likely discover that Ms. Mitchell’s tragic case is one of countless cases in which companies aggressively misled black women to increase their profits.” “The fact that these companies targeted Black and Latin women for their own profit motive and without regard to the serious health risks that these hair-straightening products cause is a serious wrong that needs to be corrected,” emphasized Diandra Debrosse Zimmermann. “We have commenced this important litigation to seek and obtain justice for those women and their families.” Commenting on the study conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Kimberly Norman, Senior Director, Safety and Regulatory Toxicology, at the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the trade body representing personal care and cosmetics manufacturers in the US, said it failed to establish a causal link with any specific ingredients in hair products or any specific chemicals. Mrs Mitchell is seeking compensation in excess of USD 75,000, according to the lawsuit."
Nivea adds recycled coffee grounds to latest face cream,"The German skincare brand has joined the upcycling movement: for the first time in its history, a recycled ingredient, coffee grounds, was used in a face cream, in the Naturally Good range. The company is making an effort to emphasize its status as a player committed to preserving our planet, making another step in the circular economy world. One kilogramme of coffee generates 1.2 kilogramme of waste. Every year, on the global level, we consume billions of kilogrammes of coffee, whose residues end up in landfill or, at best, in a compost bin. In addition, as they decompose, coffee grounds release methane, a gas that is harmful for the environment. Thanks to its partnership with Kaffe Bueno, a company which transforms coffee from the hotel and catering industries into cosmetic actives, Nivea offers a second life to coffee grounds. The oil extracted is contained in the new energizing face cream in the Naturally Good range available in supermarkets since late September 2022. Coffee is widely known as an excellent antioxidant, in particular in cosmetics, thanks to the caffeine and chlorogenic acid it contains. These actually help calm the skin, protect it from external aggressors, and prevent redness. To go even further, Nivea has packed this face cream, a formula produced thanks to 100% renewable power, in a jar made from ISCC-certified materials. The FSC-certified cardboard is derived from sustainably managed forests."

Sander van der Laan succeeds Tina Müller as Douglas CEO,"The European beauty retailer has appointed Sander van der Laan as incoming CEO, succeeding Tina Müller who decided to resign and will join the Supervisory Board after five years at the head of the group. Mr. van der Laan (54) will take the lead of the company as of November 1, 2022. Sander van der Laan most recently steered the fortunes of Dutch non-food retailer Action as CEO for more than six years. Under his leadership, the company’s sales increased from 2 to over 5 billion euros. He also played a key role in driving Action’s international expansion in ten European countries, further developing the brand and product range and establishing the company’s digital interface. Prior to joining Action, he spent over 16 years in various management positions at the retail company Ahold Delhaize - progressing to the position of CEO of the leading Dutch retail chain Albert Heijn, from 2011 to 2015. During this time, he was responsible for the transformation of Albert Heijn into a multi-channel brand and headed the company’s expansion into new markets. “I am delighted that we have won Sander van der Laan as CEO of Douglas. He is an excellent manager with proven experience in the retail industry and a strong leadership personality. I would like to thank Tina Müller on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board for her outstanding contribution to the company’s success and regret her departure,” said Henning Kreke, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Douglas. “In the last years, she has redefined Douglas’ strategy and successfully driven the company’s transformation into Europe’s leading digital premium beauty platform. We are very pleased that we will continue to benefit from her expertise and experience as a member of the Supervisory Board.” Since she was appointed CEO in November 2017, Tina Müller has realigned Douglas’ strategy. In addition to the strong focus on e-commerce, she repositioned Douglas with a successful brand relaunch and refined the shopping experience in the stores substantially. Most recently, Tina Müller restructured the European store network and laid the foundation for the company’s expansion into the highly attractive growing online pharmacy market with the acquisition of the Dutch mail-order pharmacy Disapo. Douglas offers nearly 300,000 beauty, health and lifestyle products though a retail network of around 1,900 online and physical stores. In fiscal year 2020/21, Douglas generated sales of 3.1 billion euros."
Huhtamaki and Milliken create mono-material HDPE tube for personal care,"Milliken & Company, a specialist in plastics additive and colorant technology, has partnered g with Finnish flexible packaging company Huhtamaki Group to develop a mono-material laminate for use in tubes targeting cosmetics, toothpaste and other personal-care applications. Milliken said they were able to improve the barrier properties of HDPE film by up to 50 percent thanks to their UltraGuard Solutions that slow down the transmission of oxygen and moisture in polyethylene. According to the manufacturer, these improved barrier properties contribute to packaging sustainability by enabling more mono-material construction of popular products — such as stand-up flexible pouches and tubes — and making them ultimately more recyclable. In addition, they  allow for downgauging of the polyethylene (PE) film, resulting in a lighter-weight end product and a reduction in the amount of resin needed to achieve the desired result. “The tube resulting from this joint development work is opaque with a silver shine, making it ideal for beauty product applications,” said Dr. Detlev Schulz, Senior Manager - Sustainability and Business Development for Huhtamaki’s Global Tube Laminates business. “White would work as well, offering outstanding moisture barrier and improved oxygen transmission for all who don’t need a shiny silver option."" Milliken thinks the most likely end uses will be in 40 to 200 ml tubes. The results of this joint effort will be on display at the K 2022 trade fair in Dusseldorf from October 19-26. Milliken will display high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes produced using Huhtamaki laminates optimized with the UltraGuard Solutions technology."

Credo Beauty acquires rival Follain to scale up clean beauty retail,"Clean beauty retailer Credo Beauty has acquired Follain, a Boston-based retail brand who, alongside Credo, was an early leader in the clean beauty movement in the U.S. Follain was founded by Tara Foley in 2013, one year before the creation of Credo by Shashi Batra and Annie Jackson in in 2014. As part of the acquisition, Credo will absorb Follain’s online retail business and storefront in Beacon Hill, Boston. The Follain-branded skincare line will become part of Credo’s owned brand portfolio, which currently consists of inclusive makeup brand, Exa and mineral sunscreen collection, EleVen by Venus Williams. The Follain store will be rebranded as Credo and will serve as the retailer’s second store in the Boston market. ""The acquisition of Follain, a like-minded company with a shared mission, is an important step forward for Credo and the clean category,"" says Credo CEO, Stuart Millar. ""Solidifying Credo’s clean beauty leadership position allows us to scale our impact in a meaningful way, and we are excited to continue to advocate for change in a highly under-regulated industry,"" he adds. The move to acquire Follain should also help Credo to achieve their goal to create a single “clean beauty“ standard that would serve as a roadmap for brands and consumers alike. ""Since inception, Credo and Follain have been on a parallel path, whether related to clean beauty leadership, affecting positive change in the industry or providing a platform for a brand community that is dedicated to conscientious brand creation,"" emphasizes Credo Co-Founder, Annie Jackson. Follain Founder & CEO, Tara Foley will support Credo as an advisor over the coming months. After the transition, she will continue her work consulting purposeful beauty and CPG brands.

Ex Nihilo expands internationally with new outlets,"Ex Nihilo is continuing its international expansion. The alternative brand, which totalled 135 points of sale in 25 countries last year — a figure that it has almost doubled today — recently opened three new flagship stores. A way of consolidating its global presence by moving eastwards. After establishing its first shop at 352 rue Saint-Honoré, in Paris, at the end of 2013, the brand has established itself in the most prestigious venues of the niche perfumery. At Galeries Lafayette Haussmann, Champs-Elysées, and La Samaritaine in Paris, at Harrods in London, Tsum in Moscow, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks in New York... Undeniably a hotbed of technology, California is very attractive for the brand, whose strength lies in part in its Osmologue. An innovative and exclusive tool, designed to personalise the brand’s creations with beautiful ingredients. For instance, Ex Nihilo opened a store in Los Angeles last February, in the trendy and arty Sycamore Avenue quarter. But Asia is also a major stake for Benoit Verdier, Sylvie Loday and Olivier Royère, the three founders. After starting to lay the foundations with two corners in South Korea and Singapore, Ex Nihilo opened a store in Taiwan in September. This is a key step in Asia, with mainland China remaining an ambitious project in a complex geopolitical context. Ex Nihilo is also asserting its presence in the Middle East: after Dubai, the brand recently opened a store in Qatar, in the brand new Vendôme Mall in Doha. This is a strategic spot as the Football World Cup will soon take place in this country. In early September, it also inaugurated a flagship store in Saudi Arabia, at the Nakheel Mall in Riyadh. Though they follow the codes of the iconic Parisian boutique, each of these three new venues offers a personalised atmosphere, to provide a unique experience to customers on the go. As far as new products are concerned, the brand just launched Santa Calling on September 1st. A creation signed by Antoine Maisondieu, which stages the idea of a Parisian sandalwood, where the wood’s mystical whiff meets the city’s contemporary pulse. Australian sandalwood, hemmed in with milky notes and Bourbon Vanilla absolute, with an addictive trail. True to its distinctive customisation approach, Ex Nihilo will be offering for the holidays three of its fragrances with a musky base, to enhance their staying power, comfort and depth. Next year, new additions are expected to join the Ex Nihilo Collection, which currently consists of 40 creations proposed in 250 outlets worldwide, including six flagships."

Aptar: A new centre of excellence for luxury custom packaging,"Aptar beauty + home will officially open their new Be One production facility in July 2023 in Oyonnax, France. Covering 25,000 m2, this state-of-the-art plant will centralize all of the group’s know-how (technological, logistical and decorative capabilities) for the premium and luxury custom packaging markets. Gathering four sites and five workshops into one, the new facility will be dedicated to delivering agile and competitive solutions to brands, through improved and adapted processes, while minimizing the impact on the environment and the carbon footprint. At the very heart of the “Plastics Vallée”, Be One is also expected to deepen Aptar’s territorial roots by relying on the unique local skills and expertise of the region’s sub-contractors and technical partners. “This will facilitate the delivery of a wide range of increasingly innovative and technically sophisticated products, while being geographically close to its European partners and customers,” explains the group in a statement. This investment of 42 million euros should also enable a significant improvement in the company’s environmental footprint. Projecting a 45% energy savings and a reduction of CO2 by 58% through heat recovery and the end of inter-site transport (projections vs 2018 performance), Be One has already received the Biodivercity label and the LEED v4 Silver level certification. It is Aptar’s first site in France to receive this seal of environmental quality. The transfer of all activities to the new site should be finalized in February 2023."
Sephora is launching online in the UK ahead of a physical return in 2023,"Going online today, the sephora.co.uk website replaces the Feelunique.com store acquired last year. This launch was announced last week as a prelude to the opening of brick-and-mortar stores in the UK, with a first flagship that mgiht open in London for spring 2023. At that time, Sephora’s CEO said the transaction was ""a key step"" in the retailer’s European growth strategy and ""a first step for Sephora’s presence into the United Kingdom.” Indeed, Sephora had exited the U.K. retail market in May 2005 after opening just six stores in five years, the first of which was in the Bluewater shopping centre outside London. In any case, Feelunique’s reward programme will stay in place, under the name Sephora Rewards, with customers receiving £5 off for every £75 spent, as well as other benefits. The United Kingdom is one of the top 10 biggest prestige beauty markets worldwide, with a very high level of digital adoption. However, Boots’ strong positions in this market has long been a big hurdle for the French group. The Walgreens-owned chain claims that its UK market share is above 40 per cent for skin, makeup and premium beauty. Boots also claims that beauty makes up 50 per cent of sales on Boots.com. Other competitors include luxury retailer Space NK and e-tailer Cult Beauty. To celebrate their UK launch, Sephora has partnered with creative agency AKQA with a campaign focusing on the UK’s “living tapestry” of cultures and identities. Dubbed ‘Express All of You’, the campaign, which has been directed by London-born photographer Felicity Ingram, tells the story of relatable expressions of British beauty through the portraits of five individuals. The beauty retailer, said the campaign sets out to authentically connect with the hearts and minds of British audiences by inviting viewers to unleash their beauty power."
Consumer Goods: Strong demand for chemically recycled materials by 2030,"Consumer goods manufacturers will need large quantities of chemically recycled plastics! This is what member companies of The Consumer Goods Forum’s (CGF) Coalition of Action on Plastic Waste are stating in an open letter addressed to suppliers, regulators and investors. The twelve companies - Amcor, Barilla, Colgate Palmolive, Danone, Ferrero, Haleon, Henkel, Mars, Incorporated, McCain Foods, Mondelēz International, PepsiCo, Unilever - estimate their needs and those of the other members of the coalition are about 800,000 tons of chemically recycled material per year by 2030, in addition to their needs for mechanically recycled materials. According to the Consumer Goods Forum system-level emissions would be approximately 40% lower in certain geographies and under certain conditions if at-scale chemical recycling was available to process hard-to-recycle plastics, rather than sending these plastics to waste-to-energy incinerators. The Coalition recognises that although chemical recycling technology is not a silver bullet, it will be an important technology which can serve a vital purpose for the recycling of unavoidable plastic waste which cannot be otherwise recycled mechanically. By expressing their interest in procuring these materials, the member companies of the Coalition are sending a strong signal to regulators and investors of the need for scale in plastics chemical recycling infrastructure while meeting the necessary environmental safeguards laid out in the Coalition’s Vision and Principles paper. According to the Consumer Goods Forum, the demand for chemically recycled material does not reduce the need to continue the scale-up of mechanical recycling infrastructure. It is primarily focused on demand which cannot be met at scale by mechanically recycled materials today (e.g., food-contact flexible packaging applications). The Consumer Goods Forum (""CGF"") Coalition of Action on Plastic Waste was founded in 2020 with the aim of developing a more circular approach to the development and processing of plastic packaging in the consumer goods industry. The development of the Coalition builds off the CGF’s 2018 endorsement of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy."
Armani Code: An aluminium cap produced and assembled by g.pivaudran,"For the guided magnetic collar cap of their brand-new refillable men’s fragrance Armani Code, L’Oréal has chosen to entrust g.pivaudran, a French expert in aluminium components. Thanks to its vast experience coupled with its technological expertise, g.pivaudran has anodised the aluminium cap [1] in intense black offering a sleek black shine, coupled with deep engraving of the Giorgio Armani monogram, on the top of the cap. For a wonderful magnetic open-close mechanism that instantly spells out luxury, g.pivaudran used their magnetised guided technology, which was patented in 2000, allowing a perfect alignment of the monogram and the bottle. The high-speed assembly was achieved using a brand-new machine installed on the g.pivaudran premises in the Lot region of France. The seven components of this high-end cap required an extremely precise design to meet the requirements set out by Armani whilst adapting to the use of a screw-action pump. “For this new collaboration between L’Oréal and g.pivaudran, particular attention was placed on user comfort when handling the lid whilst working on a subtle curved edge,” outlined Marion Kergoat, Commercial Engineer at g.pivaudran."
Smurfit Kappa to invest USD 100 million to drive down emissions in Colombia,"The global producer of paper-based packaging has announced an investment of almost USD100 million in a sustainable biomass boiler in Colombia, which will reduce its global Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions by approximately 6%. The boiler, which will be constructed at its paper mill in Yumbo, Colombia, will replace the fossil fuels currently used with different types of organic waste to generate cleaner energy. The organic waste will be comprised of pine and eucalyptus bark from the company’s own forestry plantations, waste from its wood treatment plant, and ashes and sludge generated during the paper-manufacturing process. The project is part of Smurfit Kappa’s circularity program under which the group has already implemented biomass boilers at several other locations including the Nervion, Piteå and Sangüesa paper mills in Europe. When the new boiler is operational, the mill will significantly reduce the site’s fossil fuel usage and deliver significant cost savings. Laurent Sellier, CEO of Smurfit Kappa in the Americas, said: “This investment reinforces our commitment to Colombia, a strategic growth market, and to our sustainability targets. The commissioning of this state-of-the-art biomass boiler is a further material step towards our 2030 and net zero emissions targets and to protecting the environment and creating a greener world.” ""The construction of this boiler reflects the circularity that is the foundation of our sustainability strategy and runs through all of our operations, as we are finding another use for our own waste. It is also a very important project for the region, as it will contribute to expanding the use of renewable energies and is a timely response to the increased global demand for paper,” added Alvaro J. Henao, CEO of Smurfit Kappa Colombia. The new boiler is expected to be operational by the end of 2024."

Luxe Pack: Wheaton Brasil shifts to biogas and lightweight glass,"At Luxe Pack Monaco, held on 03-05 October, 2022, the Brazilian manufacturer of glass packaging presented its latest innovations and investments in sustainability. Among other things, Wheaton Brasil detailed its recent investments in renewable energy. In particular, the company is the first glass manufacturer in the world to use biogas to replace part of its consumption of natural gas. Obtained from the decomposition of organic matter, biogas will allow Wheaton to reduce their annual CO2 emissions by approximately 7,000 tons, which is equivalent to more than 50,000 trees planted over a period of 20 years, according to the company’s estimates. ""Being the first company in our industry to use biogas for glass production is a source of great pride for us and demonstrates how Brazil is a country that increasingly stands out in the promotion and development of sustainable solutions,"" emphasizes Renato Massara Junior, commercial and marketing director of Wheaton. Wheaton also presented its latest Ecoglass range to the international public attending Luxe Pack Monaco. This eco-designed collection offers lighter bottles requiring a reduced amount of glass material compared to traditional bottles. According to Wheaton, the collection allows a reduction in water and energy consumption, and a reduction of more than 30% in CO2 emissions. In addition, the thread of the bottles’ neck allows the pump to be unscrewed to facilitate refilling of the product and facilitates the separation of the pump and the glass for recycling operations. ""Taking into account the environmental question is an integral part of our business,"" emphasizes Renato Massara."

In addition, thanks to its synthetic biology and modelling capabilities, LanzaTech can introduce new pathways into their biocatalyst to produce a variety of different chemicals through this process. Multiple commercial facilities are already licensing LanzaTech’s technology, converting various waste carbon sources to ethanol, including the conversion of industrial emissions in China, thanks to the power of industrial biology and a proprietary biocatalyst. The research collaboration with Givaudan is one that is expected to leverage this synthetic biology capability and go beyond the production of ethanol, with the companies working together to establish novel pathways to create sustainable fragrance ingredients used across the Givaudan portfolio. Both companies have been longstanding members of the Renewable Carbon Initiative, an organisation whose goal is to support and speed up the transition from fossil carbon to renewable carbon for all organic chemicals and materials. LanzaTech has previously joined forces with L’Oréal to create a plastic bottle made from renewable carbon [1] and, more recently, with Coty to replace the ethanol used in their fragrances with recycled carbon."

Biotherm chooses Lumson’s glass airless for Aquapower Advanced Gel Homme,"The Italian supplier of primary packaging and dispensing systems for the cosmetics industry has supplied the packaging for Biotherm’s Aquapower Advanced Gel Homme. The ultra-hydrating skin treatment for men is protected from contamination in a glass airless with pouch system, which also guarantees optimal product dispensing. Evocative of the ocean’s waves, the glass bottle’s squared shape is coloured with the brand’s iconic green. The airless bottle offers a soft-touch finish that protects the bottle from fingerprints while reflecting the Gel’s mattifying effect. To lower the packaging’s environmental footprint the bottle contains 40% recycled glass while the pump and the cap are both styrene-free. The packaging developed for Aquapower Gel is part of Lumson’s new range of square-shaped airless solutions that are available in various sizes (50, 75, 100 ml) and colours. Thanks to the multi-layer pouch and a patented hermetic closure system, Lumson’s airless pouch systems combine aesthetic and technology, offering optimal protection of the formula, functionality (perfect dispensing of the product), and sustainability (from the use of recycled glass to the possibility of separating the packaging’s various components and disposing of them using the appropriate recycling stream). Lumson’s airless systems also offer a multitude of customization options. “The shapes and materials available, combined with the finishes and decorations that can be applied, give brands the possibility to choose the solution that best fits their needs, enhancing the character and personality of each and every product,” explains the supplier."
Quadpack launches a refillable and recyclable version of their Regula Jar,"The international beauty packaging manufacturer and provider is upgrading its best-seller range of jars and airless products with the launch of New Regula Refill Jar, a “recyclable, refillable, monomaterial and easy to use” jar. The 50ml pack has a thick-walled outer jar in PET, with a premium, glass-like aesthetic, perfect for prestige cosmetics brands.

All components can be decorated using various techniques, as Quadpack offers complete manufacturing and decoration solutions made in Germany."
Albéa’s EcoFusion Top honoured twice at the German Packaging Awards 2022,"Albéa’s EcoFusion Top tube in combination with the Thin-Wall and PCR-Max technologies was awarded this week in the sustainability category as one of the overall 38 winners of the German Packaging Awards. In addition, the tube received a Gold Award honouring groundbreaking innovations from among the Packaging Award winners. With EcoFusion Top, Albéa has addressed the weight reduction of tubes. By replacing the head and cap by a single component directly attached to the tube’s body, the group achieved a weight reduction of 55% compared to a standard solution. The jury praised the significant weight reduction achieved through to the single open-and-close system and the use of Albéa’s Thin-Wall technology. The recycling-readiness of the tube thanks to the use of PE mono-material was also pointed out. “This award is an honour and a great recognition for our teams”, says Stefan Honrich, General Manager of Albéa Germany where the tubes are manufactured. Caroline Hughes, Marketing Manager Albéa Tubes adds: “Reducing plastic use through weight reduction is a top priority in our responsible tubes roadmap and this solution is clearly the most advanced one on the market.” The German Packaging Award is an international, cross-sector and cross-material competition and the largest European showcase for innovations in the field of packaging. It is under the patronage of the Ministry of Economics and Energy. The prize is awarded every year by the German Packaging Institute (dvi) for innovative and creative packaging ideas."
Afyren inaugurates its first biorefinery for perfumery and food,"The French green chemistry company inaugurated, on September 29, its first large-scale plant in Carling Saint-Avold, in the East of France, on the Chemesis industrial platform. Named Afyren Neoxy, the biorefinery has reached production start-up phase and should gradually increase volumes to produce 16,000 metric tons of carboxylic acids within two years. At this stage, 70% of the plant’s target production of organic acids has already been pre-sold, according to Afyren. Based on natural micro-organisms and protected worldwide by ten patent families, Afyren’s biomimetic technology produces seven 100% biobased organic acids. These acids have several applications in various sectors: human food, animal feed, flavours and fragrances, lubricants, materials science and life sciences. Transformed on the Saint-Avold platform through fermentation, extraction and purification steps, the carboxylic acids produced by Afyren are directly derived from sugar beet co-products and offer a low-carbon alternative to their traditionally petro-based equivalents. Thanks to its location in the centre of the European beet-producing basin, the Afyren Neoxy production unit has been able to commit to respecting short supply chains through a contract that provides for the delivery of co-products from sugar-beet crops located within a maximum radius of a few hundred kilometres from the factory. As it is close to its main customers in Northern and Eastern France, the Benelux countries and Germany, the plant can offer secure, low-carbon delivery to its partners. Afyren has raised a total of more than 80 million euros in funding to complete this industrial project. Afyren chose to partner with Bpifrance, through its Société de Projets Industriels (SPI) fund. Afyren Neoxy is thefore a joint venture, 51% owned by Afyren and 49% by the “Société de Projets Industriels” (SPI) fund managed by Bpifrance. “We are convinced of the potential of Afyren’s technology in terms of the decarbonization of industry and its ability to promote a strong, competitive and job-creating bioeconomy,” said Magali Joessel, Director of the SPI fund at Bpifrance. The commissioning of the site involved the recruitment of 60 people, covering the whole range of industrial professions (production, maintenance, quality control, security, and administration). “On the strength of this first success, we are already studying two scenarios for the establishment of a second plant in North America or Asia. We are obviously evaluating the structuring of the financing, but we are also carefully studying the environmental components so that this second plant will also benefit from access to local biomass and short supply chains,” said Nicolas Sordet, CEO and co-founder of Afyren. This new production site could therefore be the first step toward a circular low-carbon industry providing biobased solutions."

"U.S. Black and Hispanic consumers wear more fragrances than others, found NPD","Hispanic and Black consumers wear perfume more often than other ethnicities in the U.S., according to The NPD Group. While fragrance usage in the country remained flat this year, compared to 2021, it grew among both Black and Hispanic consumers. According to the market research firm, over 85% of Hispanic and Black consumers wear perfume and other fragrance products, compared to 78% of the total U.S. population. “Compared to other ethnicities, Black and Hispanic consumers are more engaged not only with fragrance products, but across all beauty categories,” said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. “Understanding the nuances of how Black and Hispanic shoppers interact with the beauty industry by category can help to uncover the opportunities with these very tuned-in consumers.” Black and Hispanic consumers generally wear fragrance products more often than other ethnicities and self-gift more frequently, according to the latest findings from the 2022 “Fragrance Consumer Report” from NPD. Over 60% of Black and Hispanic consumers report they do not leave the house without wearing fragrance and it is part of their daily routines, which is significantly higher than white and Asian users. Among these two groups, demand is also rising for stronger scents. Black and Hispanic consumers are wearing stronger scents more frequently, a behavior that is in line with a broader shift happening in the U.S. prestige fragrance market. Eau de parfums (EDPs) and parfums, which have a higher percentage of fragrance oils, continue to gain market share in 2022, at the expense of cologne, eau de toilette (EDT), and other products with lower concentrations of fragrance oils."

Sederma wants to simplify skincare formulation with an encapsulated retinol,"To address the market demand for stable, easy-to formulate, highly bioavailable and well-tolerated vitamin A, Sederma is launching an encapsulated retinol. Indeed, while having demonstrated its benefits on wrinkles, stretch marks, skin blemishes and scars for decades, retinol is also known for some drawbacks, including possible skin irritation and chemical instability. Dubbed ReVitAlide, the new ingredient is a lipid submicron particle carrying 3% active retinol. According to the Croda Personal Care subsidiary, this high-tech capsule provides enhanced stability, protecting retinol from degradation and making it easy to store and formulate. “The small particle size and unique lipid composition of the capsule greatly improves bioavailability into the skin, with a controlled release process of the encapsulated retinol,” said Sederma in a statement. Skin delivery of ReVitAlide measured on skin explants showed a 7-fold increase in the delivery of retinol into the skin versus non encapsulated retinol. Protection of the active and enhanced delivery into the skin thus reinforce its efficacy and allow to minimise its use level, while offering excellent skin tolerance. ReVitAlide is IECIC [1] compliant and is made of 95.50% natural content (according to ISO 16128). It is 100 % readily biodegradable in 28 days, RSPO approved and can be stored at room temperature."
Gattefossé completes the ERI 360° certification process of two new ingredients,"The manufacturer of cosmetic actives has completed the ERI 360° certification process for two new major personal care ingredients in its portfolio: Gatuline RC Bio and EleVastin. Both ingrdeients have reached the Silver level of the ERI 360° seal. Gatuline® RC BIO is a hydrating skincare active, naturally extracted from beech buds harvested in areas close to the production site of the Gattefossé group in Saint-Priest, France. Buds are manually handpicked on the lower branches to avoid any damage to future development of the tree and respect its natural balance. The beech trees are not irrigated, and the buds are frozen directly on site to avoid any enzymatic degradation and do not need to be washed. This natural active ingredient is obtained through a production process that does not use any chemical solvent. It is COSMOS certified and reaches 96.8% natural origin content according to the norm ISO 16128. EleVastin was design to strengthen skin elasticity and fight gravity-induced skin sagging. It is extracted from the leafy stems of the Murraya koenigii tree, that are manually harvested from pesticide- and fertilizer-free plots in the preserved environment of La Reunion island. Obtained using a mixture of natural solvents belonging to the family of natural LTTM (Low-Transition Temperature Mixture) and gentle extraction process (NaDES), the ingredient is COSMOS approved and reaches 100% natural origin content according to the norm ISO 16128. Co-created by cosmetics industry players and developed by Innov’Alliance and a panel of scientific experts, ERI 360° is a very stringent seal. It allows to accurately assess the sustainability performance of the entire value chain and to measure the ethical, social and environmental performance of concerned ingredients, from harvesting to the factory gate. In 2021, the Gattefossé group had already certifed three active ingredients of its personal care portfolio, Gatuline Link n Lift, Gatuline Renew and EnergiNius under the ERI 360° seal. ""Our responsible and sustainable development strategy, at the heart of our CSR roadmap, begins with the development of our ingredients. We see the ERI 360° label as a key tool for our research and development teams to optimize the sourcing of our raw materials, to integrate the principles of eco-design at each stage of the development of our personal care ingredients and to manage their implementation right up to production. We will therefore pursue ERI 360° certification for other products in our current portfolio and for future developments,"" explains Paula Lennon, Group Director Personal Care at Gattefossé. The Gattefossé ingredients that are ERI360 certified: Bronze: EnergiNius
Silver: Gatuline Renew, Gatuline Link n Lift, Gatuline RC Bio, EleVastin"

Greentech taps into the Brazilian biodiversity and cutting-edge technologies,"Brazil is well known for its extraordinary biodiversity. It is the largest area of biodiversity in the world; it is made up of unique ecosystems: seven distinct biomes, each with a singular richness that represents an inexhaustible source of inspiration, innovation and biotechnology development. Pioneer and expert in biotechnologies for 30 years, it was therefore a clear evidence for Greentech to set up their first factory outside Europe in Brazil, in the heart of all this natural wealth. The French designer and producer of high-tech active ingredients extracted from natural botanical, marine or microbial sources, thus chose to locate its facility within the Diadema Cosmetics Hub, close to São Paulo. “The proximity of local communities that develop fair and socially and environmentally responsible cultivation work, as well as the fact that Brazil is the fourth largest Beauty and Personal Care market in the world, just behind the United States, China and Japan, were also key factors in this choice,” explains Damien Lamquet, General Manager of Greentech Brasil. Thanks to their own industrial tool and state-of-the-art laboratories in Brazil, the company has begun to produce several ingredients locally. At the heart of these active ingredients, all the performance of nature, enhanced by cutting-edge processes (bioguided extraction, enzymatic bio-purification, fermentation, bioconversion...), natural alternatives with proven effectiveness. The knowledge of Brazilian biodiversity has enabled Greentech to develop ingredients that concentrate the full power of the Brazilian biomes. Dandrilys is a natural active ingredient titrated in saponins (jujubosides) obtained from Ziziphus joazeiro bark, acting at different levels to effectively and durably reduce dandruff. It targets the dysbiosis observed in the scalp affected by dandruff (one of the major causes), modulating in vivo the bacteriobiont and mycobiont, towards a healthier scalp. Dandrilys offers a complete solution to dandruff through a systemic approach, modulating both the scalp microbiota and biological pathways for a healthy scalp. A healthy and natural alternative to Zinc Pyrithione 1%. Zoryalys is a natural active ingredient developed through a biomimetic approach, combining highly antioxidant and photo-protective molecules (Shogaol & Gingerol from ginger, and Magnolol & Honokiol from magnolia) with long-chain lipidic fatty acids from Brazilian pracaxi oil, to mimic hair lipids. Thanks to its penetration into the hair core, it protects against protein carbonylation, tryptophan and cystine degradation and maintains the keratin structure, thus restoring hair strength, shine and colour. These ingredients have been presented at the in-cosmetics Latin America show, which was held on 21-22 September 2022 in São Paulo, Brazil. The show was also the occasion to discover Greentech’s 2022 innovation, Myralys, a natural active ingredient COSMOS-certified, highly purified in gentiopicroside, sourced from organic wild yellow gentian roots, to lift droopy upper eyelids and rejuvenate the under-eye contour (dark circles, eye bags and tear trough), offering a total eye contour rejuvenation from 14 days of use, for a time-defying look."

In the U.S., as everywhere else, the key is to keep going and we are particularly confident about the future. The appointment of Amalia Marciano in the West Coast team is an added asset,"" explains Lumson’s President, Matteo Moretti.

Energy efficiency: LVMH commits to a 10% decrease in consumption,"To address the current tensions on the electricity market, which are likely to increase this winter during consumption peaks, the LVMH Group has decided to reduce its electricity consumption as of October, first in France and then worldwide throughout the Group. Two key measures will enable a 10% reduction in energy consumption between October 2022 and October 2023: – Turning off the lighting of the Group’s Maison stores between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. and of the administrative sites at 9 p.m.
– The modification of indoor temperatures in all industrial sites, administrative sites and stores: -1°C in winter compared to the usual temperature setting; +1°C in summer compared to the usual air conditioning trigger temperatures. These measures constitute a framework for the Group’s Maisons upon which they build their energy efficiency plans according to their specificities. As an example, Moët Hennessy efficiency plan aims at a 15% reduction in energy consumption worldwide in 2023 vs 2021, at constant perimeter, says LVMH. In addition, LVMH will mobilize its 34,000 employees in France around new energy consumption behaviors: a major awareness campaign around the New Energy Gestures will be launched to turn off (lighting, screens, computers, etc.), unplug (chargers, electric cars, etc.), choose alternatives (to the elevator, to the printer), and manage consumption peaks. In France, the Group’s employees will be encouraged to use the EcoWatt app, which allows them to manage their energy consumption at home according to peak demand. Finally, investments to complete the Group’s energy transition will be increased and will cover both energy management (sensors, meters) and renewable energy across the world. A reflection on new lighting methods and the use of colours’ thermal qualities has been engaged. As a reminder, LVMH’s energy consumption in France is 354,000 MWh, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of a city of 150,000 inhabitants. The Group had already announced in 2021 as part of LIFE 360, its desire to achieve 100% supply of renewable or low-carbon energy for all its sites (workshops, stores, offices) by 2026. Today, the Group uses 100% green electricity in France and 39% renewable energy globally. These measures will be implemented according to the applicable laws and regulations of each country. LVMH was recently at the heart of a controversy in France because of the carbon emissions linked to the flights of the group’s private jet for sometimes very short routes."

Plastic waste in the Pacific could mostly come from a handful of nations,"According to a recent study published in Scientific Reports, 90% of the thousands of tonnes of plastic waste that form what’s known as the North Pacific Garbage Patch – a huge pile of floating trash that covers an area of 3.5 million square km in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean — could come largely from fishing equipment originating from five industrialized nations. Researchers from the Ocean Cleanup project and Wageningen University in the Netherlands collected 6,093 pieces of trash measuring less than 5 cm from the garbage patch and analyzed them one by one. The most common plastic objects were unrecognizable plastic fragments. However, fishing and aquaculture equipment was the second-largest category of trash. The researchers were able to identify a total of 232 plastic objects and their country of origin based on elements such as language, text, company names or brand logos. A significant portion of this waste was found to come from Japan (34%), China (32%), South Korea (10%), the United States (7%) and Taiwan (6%). The study highlights the important role that the fishing industry plays in addressing the global issue of plastic pollution in the ocean: ""While recent assessments for plastic inputs into the ocean point to coastal developing economies and rivers as major contributors into oceanic plastic pollution, here we show that most floating plastics in the North Pacific subtropical gyre can be traced back to five industrialized fishing nations,"" the researchers conclude. However, the study, only concerns floating plastics larger than 5 and not microplastics that may have a different origin and are not specific to the North Pacific Garbage Patch. “The compositional differences of plastic pollution between coastal and offshore waters therefore suggest that plastics originating from land are predominantly trapped in nearshore areas and may be eventually released to the open ocean as small, degraded plastic fragments,” the authors suggest."

"Regenixir, Silab’s new anti-aging active receives two awards in China","The French supplier of cosmetic actives has been doubly honored by the Chinese beauty industry by receiving two Awards in two weeks for its regenerating anti-aging active ingredient, Regenixir. Designed to stimulate the skin’s capacity to synthesize its own “growth elixir”: Regenixir received two different prizes: the Ringier Technology Innovation Award in the Effective Ingredients category [1] and the ICIC Award in the Technology Innovation Ingredient category [2]. Brigitte Closs-Gonthier, Deputy general manager for innovation, considers that these awards are the result of Silab’s innovation strategy and investment policy (20% of sales is devoted to R&D each year): “We are very pleased to receive these two distinctions, which highlight the high level of scientific expertise in our Regenixir product. For this anti-aging active ingredient of biotechnological origin, we acquired new technological expertise through the establishment of partnerships with two prestigious international research laboratories.” For this development, Silab set up a novel modeling study made possible by the integration in-house of skills required to develop innovative vascularized models and innovative models of immune cells. The company thus demonstrated for the first time that the interconnectivity of the cutaneous, vascular and immune systems, required in the skin regeneration process, is weakened during aging. By revitalizing cellular interconnectivity, Regenixir enables the rapid and overall regeneration of mature skin. For Silab, which achieves 60% of its sales through exports, this recognition testifies to its ability to offer comprehensive solutions that meet the needs of consumers in the global cosmetics industry."

Texen: a 100% European production for Clarins Lip Comfort Oil,"For the launch of the new version of its iconic Lip Comfort Oil range, Clarins has selected Texen’s 100% European production. For this project, Texen managed the production and assembly of several components: the cap and collar, engraved and metallized in gold, the brush holder and the wiper, the bottle with an ultra-premium thick bottom that guarantees formula protection thanks to a specific treatment.

"USA: Higher income consumers boost sales of beauty products, NPD reports","Higher income consumers with annual household incomes of over USD 100,000, spent nearly USD 9 billion on beauty products in the first half of 2022, up 14%, year over year found NPD’s Checkout Omnichannel Tracking. According to the market research firm, higher income U.S. households account for over 40% of beauty sales revenue. This double-digit growth was spurred by a combination of more buyers in the market and consumers spending more compared to last year, with Generation X and Millennials leading the charge. Elevated spending from higher income beauty consumers is tied to their above-average engagement with the industry’s two largest categories: makeup and skincare. While 74% of U.S. women use facial skincare products and 67% use makeup, those in higher income households significantly over-index in each category, with usage over 80%. Based on findings from their Facial Skincare Consumer Report, The NPD Group highlights that Generation X (born between 1966 and 1976) is an untapped opportunity in the skincare market. While facial skincare product usage from other generations declined, Generation X is the only cohort whose usage remained steady compared to last year. They use nearly as many products as Millennials - who use the most - and they are also more likely than any other generation to purchase products that carry higher price tags. In the makeup market, women in higher income households showed the most significant usage increase, rising by 8 points since last year, according to the Makeup Attitudes and Usage Report from NPD. “During this critical time when retail recovery is forced to coexist with mounting economic pressures, it is imperative for beauty brands and retailers to understand which consumers are most engaged and willing to spend,” said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. “These behaviors can vary by beauty category but getting it right and acting on it can provide the competitive advantage necessary to succeed.”"
"British supermodel Kate Moss launches wellness and beauty brand, ’Cosmoss’","The British supermodel on Thursday launched the website cosmossbykatemoss.com selling her own beauty and wellness products called Cosmoss, that she unveiled a few days before on social media. Kate Moss thus becomes the latest star to venture into branded e-commerce, following celebrities such as US actress Gwyneth Paltrow who has forged a second career marketing wellness products on her Goop website. With her sculpted cheek bones, grungy style and famous boyfriends including US actor Johnny Depp and British musicians Pete Doherty or Jamie Hince, Moss epitomised the 1990s-era fashion scene and its hard-partying lifestyle. But in an interview on BBC radio’s ""Desert Island Discs"" in July, Moss said that she now prefers trips to the garden centre and meditation to clubbing, and is ""not into being out of control anymore"". According to Vogue magazine, the development of the new brand took two and a half years. So far the cosmossbykatemoss.com website sells a small range of vegan-friendly products including tins of herbal teabags for £20 ($23), facial oil containing CBD (£105) — an active ingredient in cannabis — and perfume with essential oils (£120). Moss recommends using the products in combination in ""rituals"" that ""balance body and soul with the natural environment and the circadian cycles"". Cosmoss is not Moss’s first venture into personal branding. She designed a line of clothing for teen fashion chain Topshop - which closed its physical stores during the pandemic - and gave her name to lipsticks by Rimmel. In 2016 she launched a talent agency, Kate Moss Agency (KMA), signing her own daughter, Lila Moss, as well as other offspring of stars such as Ella Richards (granddaughter of Keith) and artists such as Rita Ora."
Stella McCartney and LVMH announce the launch of a new beauty brand,"Following a successful partnership with LVMH which began in 2019, Stella McCartney has collaborated with the LVMH Beauty division to develop her new skincare line, STELLA by Stella McCartney. After pioneering the conscious luxury fashion industry, Stella’s ambition is to offer an alternative to luxury skincare. Dubbed “Alter-Care™”, the concept is based on “an approach that supports caring for ourselves and Mother Earth in perfect harmony” with the aim to combine nature, efficiency, and responsibility. If the idea, in itself, is not wildly innovative, its credibility rests on the personality of the designer, who is well known for her vegan and cruelty-free activism. “I am delighted that Stella McCartney, after pioneering a sustainable and responsible luxury fashion, is now partnering with LVMH, committed to change the codes of cosmetics, the packaging and the ingredients. The launch of STELLA by Stella McCartney perfectly resonates with the Group’s longstanding commitment toward sustainability and we are proud to support it,” said Antoine Arnault, Image & Environment, LVMH. “We set out with an idea, and because we didn’t want to compromise – on outstanding results, the origin of our ingredients, and, of course, ensuring we minimised our impact on Mother Earth – we kept on trying. We worked hard for almost three years with LVMH constantly evolving and aiming for what I felt was possible: rooted in nature, truly effective and responsible skincare,” added the designer. Based on Stella McCartney’s personal philosophy of using ‘only what you need’, the range consists of three essential products: Reset Cleanser, Alter-Care Serum and Restore Cream. Offering “impressive clinically-proven results”, in the words of LVMH, the new range has been formulated and challenged to minimise its footprint at each stage of the product lifecycle: from the ingredients to the packaging, to operations all the way through to consumer usage. All product formulas are made with at least 99% natural-origin ingredients, and each is available in a unique eco-conscious refill. The line has a uniquely beautiful scent, ‘High Cliff’, created in collaboration with renowned perfumer Francis Kurkdjian, Founder and Artistic Director of Maison Francis Kurkdjian and Perfume Creation Director of Parfums Christian Dior.
All the products will be available on www.stellamccartneybeauty.com and through a selection of UK retailers and boutiques including: the Stella McCartney UK flagship store on Old Bond Street from early September and Space NK from mid-September. Stella McCartney has chosen to support the conservation NGO Wetlands International, committing to donate 1% of the net sales of STELLA skincare."

Quadpack: A 100% wood cap for Shiseido’s new fragrance collection,"Challenged by the brand, Quadpack has developed a 100% wood bespoke cap for Shiseido’s new fragrances: “L’Eau d’Issey Eau & Magnolia” and “L’Eau d’Issey pour Homme Eau & Cedre”. “The unique 100% wood bespoke caps were a result of intensive research and development, motivated by its desire to answer Shiseido’s dream: to have mono-material, biobased caps for its fragrance collection,” said Quadpack in a statement. The cap is derived from Quadpack’s Woodacity range, a 100% wood solution that doesn’t have plastic inserts, and, thanks to its unique ‘Solo Push’ rib pattern, can provide a tight closing system to protect the formula. Both the female fragrance bottle, topped with an elongated cap, and the male version, with a cap resembling a chunk of cedar wood, have a minimalist design, representing a ‘return to essentials’ and echoing the raw nature by which it’s inspired. “We are very proud of the Woodacity caps we developed for Shiseido. Thanks to our long-term partnership with the brand, who challenged Quadpack to bring this innovation to life, we now have one our most groundbreaking wooden systems,” added Denisa Stircea, Quadpack’s Wood Category Lead. Both caps are made in Europe, and their wood is sourced from sustainably-managed European forests."
Fasten introduces a mono-material refillable skin care jar,"Dubbed “REfill REuse Repeat” Fasten’s latest innovation combines elevated aesthetics with sustainability. Entirely made from recycled polypropylene (PP), the jar is available a standard 50 ml size. All parts are fully recyclable. The concept comprises a lightweight, open outer jar base in conjunction with an ultra-light, thermoformed refill cup. The refill is inserted inside the base with one click, and removed just as easily. To distinguish between creams, differing colours can be used for the refill cup. The open structure of the jar base not only shows consumers which cream refill they are using visually, but also reduces the material needed for the jar. This reusable jar design can save up to 80 percent on material usage compared to conventional 50 ml jars. The IBG [1]’s subsidiary designed its REfill REuse REpeat jar to be 70 percent lighter than comparable standard cream jars, and the refill units were made stackable. The result is a substantial reduction in shipping weight. Combined, these factors lead to a significantly reduced supply chain CO2 footprint. The jar is made even more sustainable by replacing ink with debossing, eliminating the use of glue and utilizing fast-growing elephant grass in the cardboard box that houses the jar. “Our REfill REuse REpeat jar is a unique packaging concept created to satisfy all aspects of sustainability from its reduced material usage, refillable design and full recyclability,” said Ilja Zutt, Managing Director of Fasten."

Baralan adds two sizes to its Maria Jar line,"The Italian supplier of primary packaging for the cosmetics and beauty industries, has introduced two additions to its Maria Jar line: a 150 ml size (Maria Jar 150) and a 200 ml size (Maria Jar 200). Developed primarily for ease of use with skincare products, the two new, larger sized glass jars expand Baralan’s standard product offering, increasing the maximum jar capacity and diameter with a special-sized, large neck. According to Baralan, the glass jars are a fully recyclable alternative to plastic packaging. Made with premium glass, all jars in the Maria Line include a portion of post-industrial recycled (PIR) material, a means of minimizing waste. All Maria Jars can be customized with accessories and with various decoration techniques, including environmental-friendly inks and water-based paints, further reducing the environmental footprint. “We are pleased to expand our popular Maria Jar line with the Maria Jars 150 and 200 – our two largest sizes to date – giving even more packaging options for brand owners,” said Maurizio Ficcadenti, Global R&D Manager at Baralan. “In the cosmetics industry, packaging is just as important as the product itself, and our Maria Jars are a practical, yet elegant pairing for skincare products.”"

YouTube is the platform most used for podcasts in the US,"Between social networks and music streaming services, users have a host of options for listening to their favourite podcasts online. And yet, it’s YouTube that stands out, ahead of podcast giants Spotify and Apple in the US. According to a study conducted by the agency Luminate on podcast consumers aged 13 and over in the United States, 78% of them have used the streaming platform for listening to podcasts. A significant proportion that places YouTube ahead of Spotify and Apple Podcasts, explains The Verge, which relayed the study. This success is notably linked to the growing number of podcasts filmed and broadcast on the platform. If 83% of the respondents indicated that they listen to them, some 59% watch them and 42% do both. If the video aspect is becoming increasingly important for podcast consumption, Spotify and Apple have also understood this issue and now offer video content for podcasts on their platform. In addition to video, nearly two-thirds of users emphasized the importance of subscription price in choosing their platform, and 56% emphasized ease of use. This is not the first time YouTube has been named the platform the most used for listening to podcasts. Back in May 2022, the Cumulus Media and Signal Hill report indicated that the video streaming service had become the number-one platform to access podcasts, ahead of Spotify and Apple Podcasts (16%). Therefore, it’s no surprise that YouTube has now launched its own page dedicated to podcasts, only accessible in the United States for the moment."
Emma Watson stars and directs global campaign for Prada’s new fragrance,"The L’Oréal group’s brand has hired actor and activist Emma Watson to front its women’s fragrance Paradoxe. The Harry Potter star, who is also a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, has also directed the global film campaign which is launching worldwide from August 22nd. For the print campaign, the actress was captured by photographer Harley Weir. Prada said Emma Watson was chosen for her “razor-sharp intelligence, dynamic elegance and an authentic multi-dimensionality.” ""Prada Paradoxe is inspired by the infinite and empowering facets that make every woman unique and Emma wholly embodies this. Her multiple dimensions and ability to speak to highly engaged generations make her the perfect embodiment of Prada Paradoxe,"" highlights Yann Andrea, Prada Beauty International General Manager. Created by master perfumers Nadège Le Garlantezec, Antoine Maisondieu and Shyamala Maisondieu (Givaudan), Paradoxe is an amber floral scent that has benefited from an innovative technology for extracting the fragrance from the neroli bud, before the flower blooms. Tunisian orange blossom and sambac jasmine complete the heart note. Paradoxe is packed in a triangular refillable bottle (available in 30ml, 50ml, 90ml). A 100ml refill bottle thus makes it possible to reduce the environmental footprint of the packaging as it is refilled."

Fasten introduces luxury refill concept for makeup and skincare products,"Made entirely from PP and PET, Fasten’s new Recharge Luxury Refill combines luxe appeal with sustainability. According to the IBG’s company [1], the new refill system is ideal for makeup and skincare products. Available in several sizes including 30 ml and 100 ml, the series is made from materials (PP and PET) that are compatible with almost all recycling streams. Notably, the design also includes the first all-PP cosmetic pump on the market. In addition, the Recharge Luxury Refill system was designed with a bottomless, clear outer frame, instead of a full outer bottle, which leads to significant weight reduction, reduced material usage and full visibility of the refill. The inner refill bottle is lightweight and features an easy click-in system with a pre-assembled PP dip tube that prevents cross-contamination when refilling. Other sustainable features include the elimination of glue and the option to add a debossed logo rather than inked decoration. “At Fasten, our design and engineering teams are constantly on the lookout for new techniques, innovative materials and sustainable solutions, while collectively working towards translating new trends and ideas into unique packaging concepts,” said Ilja Zutt, Managing Director of Fasten. “The Recharge Luxury Refill is a result of this steadfast effort and one we are thrilled to bring to market, with demand for conscious beauty at an all-time high.”"

Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake has died aged 84,"The Japanese designer famed for his pleated style of clothing and cult perfumes, and whose name became a global byword for cutting-edge fashion in the 1980s, died on August 5 in Tokyo at 84. The death was announced today by the Miyake Design Studio. Issey Miyake shook up Parisian style with his highly wearable avant-garde designs, saying he was driven to create clothes that ""bring beauty and joy"" after witnessing the horrors of Hiroshima. Alongside Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto, Miyake was part of a wave of young Japanese designers who made their mark in the French capital from the mid-1970s, following the lead of fashion greats Kenzo Takada and Hanae Mori. Throughout his global career spanning more than half a century, he pioneered high-tech, comfortable clothing — side-stepping the grandiosity of haute couture in favour of what he called simply ""making things"". Among his inventions were the ""Pleats Please"" line, permanently pleated items which do not crease, refreshing an old-fashioned concept to exude fluidity and comfort. The much-copied futuristic triangles of Miyake’s geometric ""Bao Bao"" bag complemented countless chic outfits, and he made more than 100 black turtlenecks for Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Miyake also wowed runway audiences with his ""A-POC (A Piece Of Cloth)"" concept, using computer programming to cut whole garments with no seams. Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake was just seven years old when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city in August 1945, obliterating everything he knew. He survived the blast, which killed an estimated 140,000 people on impact and led to the end of World War II after the bombing of Nagasaki three days later. Although the bombing left him with a lifelong limp, he rarely spoke of his trauma, once breaking his silence in a 2009 New York Times article calling for nuclear disarmament. ""When I close my eyes, I still see things no one should ever experience: a bright red light, the black cloud soon after, people running in every direction trying desperately to escape,"" he wrote. ""I remember it all. Within three years, my mother died from radiation exposure."" In the article, he urged Barack Obama to visit Hiroshima, a wish realised in 2016 when the then US president made a historic trip to the city. ""I have never chosen to share my memories or thoughts of that day. I have tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to put them behind me, preferring to think of things that can be created, not destroyed, and that bring beauty and joy,"" Miyake wrote. Having graduated from Tama Art University in Tokyo, Miyake moved to Paris in 1965, where he studied at the elite Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. As a cub designer he worked under Guy Laroche and Givenchy, but his outlook was also influenced by the huge student-led uprising of May 1968. Seeing protests engulf the French capital made him realise ""the world was moving beyond the needs of haute couture for the few and towards simple more universal elements such as jeans and T-shirts,"" Miyake told CNN in 2016. He established the Miyake Design Studio in Tokyo in 1970, and soon afterwards opened his first Paris boutique. By the 1980s, his career was in full swing as he experimented with materials from plastic to metal wire and even artisanal Japanese paper. Teamwork was essential to Miyake, who preferred the anonymity of his research and development lab full of textile scientists and engineers to the bright lights of the catwalk. ""You always see things in a different way when you allow others to become part of a creative process,"" he told the New York Times. He pulled back from designing his Paris collections at the turn of the century and has since given a series of talented young designers their big break. But he continued to oversee the brand, and his obsession with technology endured — with everything from fabrics to stitching explained in minute detail in the notes of every catwalk show."
IMCD to distribute Quintis’ sandalwood for personal care in Australia,"Quintis, the global leader in the supply of premium and sustainable Indian and Australian sandalwood raw materials, has appointed IMCD Australia as the new distributor of its sandalwood ingredients for the personal care industry in Australia. The partnership will see IMCD distribute Quintis Sandalwood’s Santalum album (Indian sandalwood) oil and powder, and Santalum spicatum (Australian sandalwood) oil across its extensive trade client list in Australia. “Sandalwood is quickly gaining a reputation within the personal care and beauty space as a unique active ingredient. IMCD’s wealth of expertise, executional capability and commitment to sustainability is a perfect fit for our business,” said Carmel Power, Chief Sales Officer at Quintis Sandalwood. Beyond its well-known use in the fragrance industry, Indian sandalwood oil is a multi-functional cosmetic ingredient that provides multiple benefits to a cosmetic preparation. While it is an excellent candidate to be a key active ingredient, it can also work synergistically with other active ingredients in cosmetic formulations, going far beyond being just a wonderful scent in products. The distribution agreement provides that Quintis will be sharing its cellular and clinical trial data, along with its internal technical expertise, with IMCD Australia to support formulation offerings and claims for its customers. “Australian brands can take a lot of inspiration from the latest trends in the industry, and we look forward to connecting our clients to the benefits of sandalwood within Beauty and Personal Care products,” said Tasha Spicer, General Manager of Beauty & Personal Care at IMCD Australia. “The active component in sandalwood oil, alpha-santalol, targets myriad skin issues, including well-ageing, acne, and inflammation, as it has been proven to be a natural anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anti-pigmenting ingredient, along with being a powerful antioxidant. An ingredient we encourage formulators to consider,” Power continued. IMCD Australia is currently preparing for its NeoTech Beauty event showcasing a selection of its partners’ ingredients and state-of-the-art formulation expertise.

A unique global competition was even organized in partnership with the Nail Art France association. Boasting 45% of global exhibitors, the 2022 annual MCB by Beauté Sélection Paris will be most eclectic, with brands from Brazil, Italy, Germany, South Korea, and China! Over 20 Brazilian brands have already confirmed their presence – compared to only four last year. They will all be gathered at the Brazilian Pavilion.

The hosts certainly do not aim to reverse it all, but they are willing to put forward all trends in the hairdressing and beauty industry, since both segments are closely related. Mixed salons are gaining ground, and hair salons no longer hesitate to offer additional activities, like nail care and beauty or makeup services. With about 30 brands, eye and nail makeup should account for about 16% of the offering exposed at the show.

Texen adapts its production tool to make an XXL ecodesigned compact for Chanel,"For the launch of a 10x10cm compact, one of the largest in their Les Beiges line, Chanel has chosen a food-grade recycled PET. In order to meet the brand’s demanding aesthetics requirements and design codes, Texen had to reinvent its productions tool, in partnership with Roctool. Taking into account the technical constraints of the raw material, it was important to be especially attentive to the aesthetics of this thin-walled compact with a hinge that is particularly difficult to assemble. Texen has been investing in R&D, industrial capability and in rebuilding conventional logistics capabilities for  18 months. This optimization work concerned the full value chain: from the sourcing of the recycled material, the use of a high-solid varnish and the group’s investment in the BESST (Beauty Experience Sensation Surface by Texen) technology, which allows the sublimation of the material to give super-premium aesthetics and absolute shine to manufactured parts, including ultra-thin ones. The Texen Lab has a dedicated equipment for creating prototypes in conditions that resemble industrial ones, allowing the material to remain fluid and thus manufacturing a flawless packaging solution. “Among other things, this technology helps to overcome some of the main impediments linked to recycled materials,” highlights Texen."
Brazilian stakeholders agree on a Federal ban on animal testing for cosmetics,"Brazilian manufacturers of personal hygiene products, perfumes and cosmetics, represented by ABIHPEC (Associação Brasileira da Indústria de Higiene Pessoal, Perfumaria e Cosméticos), and Humane Society International (HSI), an animal rights advocacy group, have reached an agreement to work together on the passing of a federal law that would prohibit the testing of cosmetic products on animals in Brazil. The two organizations are now seeking for public support in order to push for the amendment and the vote, on the basis of the consensus, of a bill from the House of Representatives (PLC 70) that has been under discussion in the Federal Senate since 2014. “This vote will make it possible to align legal requirements in terms of animal experimentation with the needs of the industry and the requirements of consumers and society in general”, explains ABIHPEC. Several bans on animal tests for cosmetics are already in force in 12 Brazilian states and in the Federal District. According to ABIHPEC, this situation is a source of legal uncertainty for this sector while a robust federal legislation would harmonize requirements across the entire country. ""With this law, Brazil - which represents around 50% of the market for personal hygiene, perfumery and cosmetic products in Latin America - will join a growing number of countries that have already passed similar laws"", highlights the association. professional. The original PLC 70/14 has been adapted so that the current wording reflects technological advancements that have taken place since 2014, as well as international best practices. These practices involve: – A ban on marketing in the country cosmetics and ingredients intended for the exclusive use of this sector when they have been tested on animals;
– A definition of criteria that would allow using data from tests carried out on animals for other purposes; The two organizations therefore ask member of the Congress, as well as the federal government, to support the text during its discussion, so that a federal law be passed quickly."
Clariant launches biodegradable opacifier for shampoo and liquid soaps,"Plantasens OP 95, Clariant’s new natural-derived, readily biodegradable opacifier, was designed to support personal care formulators in minimizing the impact of shampoos, conditioners, handwashes and other rinse-off shower and bath products on marine and river life. According to Clariant, the new ingredient is a microplastic-free option which delivers powerful opacifying performance even at low concentrations, for a creamy white appearance with luxurious, caring consumer appeal for shampoos and liquid soaps. Plantasens OP 95 is an alternative to the most traditionally-used opacifiers, which are not biodegradable, are considered as microplastics and will therefore be banned in rinse-off formulations if restrictions take effect as expected in 2022 [1]. “Because rinse-off formulation ingredients will usually end up in waterways and oceans, providing readily biodegradable solutions to this cosmetics sector is an important focus of our product development,” comments Hermann Bach, Head of Strategic Marketing and Innovation, Clariant BU Industrial & Consumer Specialties. “This 95% natural origin, microplastic-free opacifier extends options for developing more environmentally-compatible Personal Care. By answering formulators’ needs on multiple fronts, it enables an easy switch from water-dispersible acrylate copolymers without compromising on visual appeal.” Plantasens OP 95 offers formulators an easy-to-use, sulfate-free drop-in solution for opacifying a wide range of hair and body care applications and for supporting eco-conscious consumer behaviour. It also helps to reach ideal viscosity without adding rheological agents, which means less formulation complexity."

""As Nature is the largest R&D laboratory on the face of the earth, at L’Occitane, we’re like explorers who set off towards unknown lands with boundless enthusiasm, never knowing what we’re going to discover,"" said Pascal Portes. According to L’Occitane, this R&D project seeks to rediscover and explore forgotten perfumery plants, and to evaluate the possibility of reintroducing them as present-day ingredients. Hundreds of books were studied, and a variety of experts were inter-viewed. Data was collected regarding identity, history, symbolism, uses, smell, medicinal properties, and hypotheses as to the reason plants may have been forgotten, and with the information obtained, a database containing more than eight hundred perfumery plants was created. The interest of L’Occitane en Provence to respect biodiversity led to a closer look into Hawthorn and Sweet Clover, both identified as forgotten perfumery plants, and each having ecological benefits in terms of biodiversity regeneration. Indeed, the R&D project not only revived precious historical heritage but offered insights into the link between ingredient sourcing and biodiversity regeneration."
India’s fine fragrance house Lilanur Parfums launches exclusively with Harrods,"The luxury fragrance house, which offers attar perfume oils and eaux de parfum celebrating the India’s abundant flora and olfactory riches, has made its debuts at Harrods in-store and online in June. LilaNur Parfums introductory collection of seven eaux de parfum  include: Malli Insolite, Rajni Nocturne, Gul Rouge, Vettiver Mousson, Agar Épicé, Davana Cèdre, and Incarnation. LilaNur is also launching a trio of Attar Absolus - scented oils, made from single-origin floral absolutes steeped in sustainably sourced sandalwood oil for over 100 days: Jasmin Attar Absolu, Rose Attar Absolu, and Tubéreuse Attar Absolu. These perfume infusions are the result of a collaboration between LilaNur Parfums and Firmenich’s Naturals Innovation Group in Grasse. The brand was founded by Anita Lal, Founder and Creative Director of Good Earth India, and fragrance and brand expert Paul Austin, previously Senior Vice President for the Fine Fragrance division at Givaudan. To help bring the fragrances to life, the two founders began their work in the flower fields near Madurai in Southern India, forging a deep relationship with Jasmine CE - India’s largest source of floral absolutes to the international fine fragrance industry - and its community of 5000 farmers and flower pickers. Each of LilaNur’s seven eaux de parfum and three Attar Absolus have been composed around India’s array of iconic flowers, spices, herbs and woods. The three attar perfume oils use Indian-grown rose Centifolia - cultivated and processed exclusively for LilaNur Parfums. For the launch collection, four French perfumers - Honorine Blanc, Olivier Cresp, Fabrice Pellegrin, and Clément Gavarry - were invited to compose a scent using iconic Indian ingredients as their muse and starting point. Many of these ingredients were borne from the joint venture between Firmenich and Jasmine CE aimed at developing unique and innovative extractions of Indian flora. ""Each fragrance is an evocation of India. From the jasmine and tuberose fields of Madurai, the spice gardens of Kerala or the forests of Assam, each scent is a vivid olfactory portrait of our diverse and rich land,"" says Anita Lal, co-creator of LilaNur Parfums. ""India has long been a perfumer’s Garden of Eden, and with LilaNur our goal was to have India’s iconic ingredients play the starring role in each fragrance. We wanted to let them shine,"" adds Paul Austin. Prices range from £225 (for a 100ml Eau de Parfum) to £340 (for a 30ml Attar Absolu)."
Evonik starts a revolution in personal care with rhamnolipid production plant,"Evonik has started construction of the world’s first commercial rhamnolipid production facility in their biotech hub in Slovenská Ľupča, Slovakia. With this new biosurfactant plant - a triple-digit million-euro investment - Evonik aims to become a pioneer of high-quality, sustainable biosurfactants. Indeed, rhamnolipids are a class of biosurfactants which are sustainably manufactured via a fermentation process using European corn sugar as the main raw material, they are essential constituents of cleaning and personal care products. The production of rhamnolipids from biogenic carbon requires no petrochemical feedstocks or tropical oils. In addition, rhamnolipids are fully biodegradable, and their low-impact life cycle means they are a sustainable alternative to conventional surfactants. Rhamnolipids’ exceptional foam-forming properties make them suitable for use in household cleaners and personal care products like shampoos and micellar waters. Their pleasant taste also enables the formulation of oral care products, such as toothpaste, without strong taste masking components. “Today is an important day for our partnership with Unilever, our employees in Slovakia, our Nutrition & Care division, and for our planet. We are delighted that the construction of our new biosurfactant plant is now underway,” says Yann d’Hervé, head of Evonik’s Care Solutions business line. The Evonik Fermas plant was founded in 1992 as a joint venture between Degussa AG and the Slovakian company Biotika a.s. Evonik Fermas originally used biotechnology to produce amino acids for animal feed but quickly became adept at manufacturing a range of fermentation-based products for applications in animal nutrition, pharmaceutical products and the cosmetic and personal care industry. Over the years that followed, the site continued adding new products and investments, improved technologies and infrastructure. In 2016, Evonik Fermas ran the first pilot plant for the manufacture of sustainable biosurfactants via fermentation."

The mill, which produces approximately 500,000 tonnes of paper annually, is now powered by a combination of its own biogas, which is a by-product of its circular water treatment plant, natural gas, and the residual materials or so-called ‘rejects’ which occur in the paper recycling process that would otherwise be considered waste. The project reduces CO2 emissions at the Zülpich paper mill by more than 25% and saves 55,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, which represents a 2% reduction in Smurfit Kappa’s global CO2 emissions. Smurfit Kappa has the goal of achieving a 55% intensity reduction in fossil CO2 emissions by 2030 and at least net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The packaging leader has also had its 2030 emissions reductions targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative as being in-line with the Paris agreement. The Zülpich circular approach also extends beyond its own operations to create loops with Smurfit Kappa’s Parenco and Roermond paper mills in the Netherlands. The rejects from Parenco and Roermond are a valuable source of fuel for Zülpich’s boiler. Commenting on the Zülpich project, Pim Wareman, CEO of the Smurfit Kappa Recycled Paper Cluster, said: “The unveiling of this state-of-the-art multi-fuel boiler is yet another example of how, at Smurfit Kappa, sustainability is part of our DNA. The project shows that economic efficiency and sustainability are by no means mutually exclusive but can go together hand in hand taking the mill on a very positive journey.” Andreas Zeitlinger, Managing Director of the Zülpich paper mill, added: “We are delighted to have this high-performing new boiler up and running. This investment has reinforced our commitment to a circular business model. By turning side streams from the paper manufacturing process such as the rejects and biogas into steam and electricity, we are well on track to meet our sustainability targets.” The Zülpich mill is currently planning a series of initiatives over the coming months to further enhance its sustainability performance."
Fragrance Creators makes entry into the metaverse and unveils research results,"During its panel session — ""Fragrance Stewardship in a Digital Age” — at the World Perfumery Congress in Miami, Florida, Fragrance Creators President and CEO, Farah K. Ahmed, announced the association’s bold leap into the future: Fragrance Creators has become the first trade association to join the Metaverse. “We are a forward-thinking and doing association,” said Ahmed. “We know it is important to address the challenges and opportunities of today while also securing a stake in shaping our future. By becoming a first entry trade association to join the Metaverse, Fragrance Creators is well positioned to shape policy in the virtual world and to influence on new frontiers. I am excited to engage in this new platform and discover novel, digital ways to advance industry stewardship in aspects we have yet to imagine.” The trade association representing the majority of fragrance manufacturing in North America also announced new research, sponsored by the association, that explores why humans have consistently relied on scents and what makes fragrance an essential part of household products. Published earlier this year in Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, this study was formally introduced to the public at the World Perfumery Congress during a panel titled “Benefits of Fragrance in Daily Life.” Using a three-factor benefits framework, this research aims to explain the attraction to scent in household products. The novel framework focuses on functional benefits (malodor mitigation, base odor coverage, freshening), in-use experience benefits (cleanliness, efficacy, pleasure), and emotional benefits (increase in confidence, mood, and nostalgia). Also during their panel session, speakers Farah K. Ahmed, Cynthia Reichard, Co-Chair of Fragrance Creators’ Board of Directors and Executive Vice President at Arylessence, Inc., and Sumit Bhasin, Fragrance Creators Board Member and Senior Vice President, Innovation, Product Development, Corporate Research and Development at The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., emphasized the importance of value chain collaboration and supplier diversity, and how digital can continue to enhance collaboration and meaningful transparency. The speakers reinforced the association’s commitment to advancing marketplace policies that allow all responsible businesses opportunity to create, innovate, and thrive while also delivering good for people and the planet. The association also used the World Perfumery Congress as an opportunity to survey perfumers from around the world, asking attendees to predict which scent will trend next in home care and in fine fragrance. Of the over 275 attendees surveyed, the results were: Sandalwood for Home Fragrance and White Musk for Fine Fragrance [1]."
"Elle Fanning, the ambassador of Fame, Paco Rabanne’s new feminine fragrance","The brand of the Puig group has chosen American actress Elle Fanning as brand ambassador for its new feminine fragrance, Fame. The young woman, a rising icon of cinema and television,  will have to bring to life this new sensual fragrance mixing notes of jasmine, mango and incense, made from 90% of natural ingredients. The fragrance’s bottle (Pochet du Courval, Heinz Glas, VPI Faiveley, Solev) reprises the Paco Rabanne’s iconic chainmail dress.

WAAM Cosmetics raises 5 million euros and launches a range of powder products,"The French do-it-yourself (DIY) cosmetics brands has just completed a second financial round of 5 million euros with the We Positive Invest 2 fund, recently created by Arkéa Capital, and Pierre Cazaux, the founder of the French design and branding agency Dragon Rouge, alongside Karot Capital, a specialist in early stage investment and an investor in the company since 2020 which is also participating in the operation. This fundraising aims to accelerate the development of the company. Founded in 2016, WAAM (which stands for “we are all metis”) offers vegan and organic certified formulations in recycled or recyclable and European made packaging. The brand draws inspiration from traditional beauty rituals around the world through a multicultural, minimalist and transparent approach to beauty. The brand’s products are available on its website, at Monoprix and in various independent points of sale in France, at DI in Belgium, and in some pharmacies in West Africa. In parallel with this fundraising, WAAM Cosmetics has launched a new line of powder products (toothpaste, shower powder, shampoo and facial cleanser). Dubbed ‘Magic Powders’, the line features 100% naturally derived active ingredients that turn into foam on contact with water. The new line is packed in eco-designed containers made from glass and aluminium, that are 100% recyclable and refillable. Developed without a drop of water, these powders make it possible to use dramatically small packaging compared to industry standards, and therefore to significantly reduce transportation-linked CO2 emissions. “This fundraising will allow us to carry on our virtuous pathway and new products are already scheduled for 2023. We will strengthen our teams, especially commercially, and accelerate our development in Europe,” explains Dieynaba Ndoye founder and General Manager of WAAM Cosmetics."

Meiyume launches a new collection of sustainable packaging for face and lips,"Meiyume, the beauty arm of the Fung Group, launches Canvas, its latest sustainable packaging range for the face and lips. The line is designed to be simple, so it leaves room for brands interpretation. Drawing parallels to a blank canvas brought to life with a splash of paint, the outer packaging is purposefully minimalistic to allow the colour formulation within to take centre stage. The Canvas range integrates simple, sustainable materials such as paper, aluminium, and PCR. Amongst the curation, a few of the highlights include mono-material PCR PET and aluminium lipstick tubes, paper and moulded pulp push-up sticks, dual-function refillable sticks, and slim-sized options. In addition to primary packaging, the range also includes secondary packaging for lipstick refills. The refill packs are made of two simple parts – a moulded pulp front and a cardboard backing. Moulded pulp offers flexibility and can be shaped to accentuate the contours of the product within. The flat cardboard on the back provides a place for product information to be printed. Alongside these product packaging options, the Canvas line offers vanity clutches to complete the consumer’s beauty experience. Brands can opt for sustainable materials such as RPET or Piñatex, a low-impact material largely made up of pineapple plant leaves, to create go-clutches that can hold a lipstick and up to two refills. Meiyume can decorate the range to fit with the brands’ DNA and the story they want to tell."
"Reaching 100 members, UEBT says commitment to ethical sourcing is rising","The international non-profit association promoting ethical sourcing has reached 100 members. According to the organisation, its rapidly growing membership signals the growing commitment of business in the beauty and food and beverage markets to sourcing with respect for people and nature. The Union for Ethical BioTrade’s 100th member is OLIPE, an olive oil producers’ cooperative based in Spain. The cooperative has 930 producers cultivating 14,000 hectares of olive groves specifically for the extra-virgin and virgin olive oil market, and sells olive by-products such as bioplastics made of olive pits. The growth also comes at a time when the international focus on biodiversity is on the rise, with the lead up to the UN Global Biodiversity Summit, later this year. According to the Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, “We are at a decisive time in history, where everyone must contribute towards a shared vision to live in harmony with Nature by 2050. So we are very glad to see that momentum is building and commitments are on the rise in these important sectors such as beauty, pharma and food, to align business actions with biodiversity.” “We are proud to be UEBT’s 100th member, as the OLIPE cooperative has been working for many years on organic practices, with 70% of our production now certified organic and biodynamic. Together with UEBT we will deepen our ecological work, and strengthen our social, cultural and education actions in rural Spain,” said Juan Antonio Caballero Jiménez, President of OLIPE.

Beekman 1802 launches facial scanning tool for microbiome education,"The goat milk-based skincare company has launched My Skin Biome, a facial scanning tool that assesses the skin and educates around microbiome health. The AI-powered tool was developed in partnership with AI and AR tech solutions provider Perfect Corp. My Skin Biome assesses skin attributes and then offers a custom skincare routine based on skin’s redness, wrinkles, dark spots, hydration, and texture scores, while teaching users all about the microbiome and why it is important to overall skin health. ""Our My Skin Biome tool customizes a shoppable skincare routine in 30 seconds based on their overall biome score while our expert Goatie teaches tips and tricks on how to obtain and maintain a healthy microbiome,"" said Jill Scalamandre, CEO of Beekman 1802. The skin’s microbiome is a community of good and bad bacteria that live on the epidermis, that when unbalanced by the external environment - air pollutants, sunlight, harsh cosmetic chemicals, over exfoliation, hormones, stress, etc. - can lead to skin issues like inflammation, acne, wrinkles, rosacea, eczema, dark spots and other problems. The microbiome is quite complex, so with the help of the brand’s mascot Goatie, the tool will provide Beekman 1802’s customers with a basic understanding of how healthy skin is linked to a healthy microbiome. After assessing the skin, Goatie will also recommend a personalized skincare regimen based on skin’s needs and curate a list of the brand’s clinically proven goat milk formulas that will best feed and balance their microbiome."

Ecovia Intelligence to host masterclass on veganism and clean beauty,"Ecovia Intelligence is hosting its first Natural Cosmetics Masterclass in over two years. Taking place in London on 13th July, the event will cover two of the fastest growing sectors in the cosmetics industry: veganism and clean beauty. The event comes as demand for clean beauty products has strengthened during the pandemic, driven by rising consumer concerns regarding the potential health risks of synthetic chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries.

The Vegan Society, the world’s largest certifier of vegan products, says that cosmetic products now represent the largest share of its 52,000 certified products. The Masterclass comprises various seminars and a training workshop. Industry experts will give an update on market trends and developments. The latest data on the UK natural and organic personal care products market will be presented. Since the UK’s departure from the EU, there is high interest in the UK market from North American, Australasian and Asian brands. Representatives from NATRUE and COSMOS will give an update on their certification schemes. Almost 40,000 cosmetic products are now certified according to these two standards. Elsie Rutterford, Co-Founder of BYBI Beauty, will give details on how it has developed its clean beauty product range. The BYBI brand is using superfood ingredients in its formulations. It has also created carbon negative products by using sugarcane-based plastic packaging. A leading organic food retailer will share its experiences with clean beauty products, whilst a research agency will present marketing and consumer trends. The second half of the programme comprises a formulation workshop. Judi Beerling, a chartered cosmetic scientist, will discuss the issues when re-formulating clean beauty products. Technical advice and guidance will be given to brands looking to formulate with green functional ingredients, such as preservatives, surfactants, emulsifiers, etc. The Natural Cosmetics Masterclass aims to help operators develop and market clean, natural, organic and / or vegan cosmetic products.

Faiveley Plast Beauty (VPI) transforms Sulapac’s biomaterial for Shiseido’s Ulé,"Launched in France on the 20th of April 2022 by Japanese beauty giant Shiseido,Ulé is and eco-conscious skincare brand, inspired from the nature and environmentally-friendly. For their jars and vials made from lightweight glass (Bormioli Luigi), Ulé has chosen the biomaterial created by Finnish start-up Sulapac. This is where Faiveley Plast Beauty (VPI) was able to assist with its expertise. The expert in the transformation of bios-sourced materials, worked alongside the R&D and Purchasing divisions at Shiseido to develop and produce all of the caps for the new range including: – Two caps of different sizes for the Je suis chill cream (15ml and 30ml caps),
– A cap for the balancing floral mist Le beau Reset. The caps comprise two parts made from Sulapac’s organically-sourced alternative to plastic. This material offers a host of eco-responsible benefits – organically-sourced FSC wood, sustainability, compostability, eco-design, low carbon impact, European manufacturing – as well as in terms of quality and functionality. For Faiveley Plast Beauty, there were several technical challenges for the production of the Ulé caps. It was necessary to have control of the injection and assembly of two Sulapac materials – the premium material and barrier material – and to do so in harmony with the clean and elegant design of the brand. The caps also had to match the specifications for packaging approval. These require, on the one hand, perfect production of the formulas (oxygen barrier) and on the other, degradability (compostable in industrial settings). Together, Faiveley Plast Beauty and Sulapac undertook a considerable work on the colours of the caps, so as to blend perfectly with the brand’s product range. Finally, the brand’s logo was inlaid on all the caps. “Faiveley Plast Beauty is proud to release its second full range of products made using Sulapac. The challenges proposed to us by brands are a source of inspiration and innovation for our teams. They motivate us to always go one step further and push the boundaries of our expertise,” said Marc Beltrami, Commercial Director for the packaging manufacturer. Let’s also mention that wher a spray pump was required, Ulé opted for Silgan Dispensing’s SP22 Maximist fine mist sprayer, incorporating a high percentage of post-consumer recycled (PCR) resin."

"SGD Pharma expands cosmetics glass offering, appoints industry leader","SGD Pharma - a leader in pharmaceutical-grade molded glass vials - intends to expand in the cosmetics and beauty segment globally. The company’s Beauty and Care division is already the APAC market leader in this segment, supplying both global and local beauty brands through their Zhanjiang, China-based factory. SGD Pharma intends to build on this experience to address the needs of luxury beauty brands globally, in particular as the “glassification” trend continues to grow significantly. “More brands are switching from plastic to glass packaging primarily due to the sustainability benefits of being able to reuse and recycle, as well as the superior compatibility with various formulations. Glass also offers the benefit of being a customizable and high-end packaging solution for the beauty industry,” said the company in a statement. For instance, SGD Pharma is now offering its Constellations stock range of glass cosmetics packaging to customers globally, which includes solutions of different sizes for a variety of beauty products, including skincare, nutraceuticals and beauty creams, as well as custom designs and shapes to brands, making their products instantly recognizable. To support the global beauty market, SGD Pharma has re-appointed Sheherazade Chamlou as Vice President of Sales Beauty Americas, located in New York. Mrs Chamlou started her career with SGD Pharma in Paris, as part of the perfumery division at Saint-Gobain Desjonquères and has since held roles leading sales teams at Verescence, and most recently at Aptar as Vice President of Beauty Sales, North America. She will be leveraging SGD Pharma’s presence in the US, Europe and Asia to grow the global beauty division, and developing global propositions for leading luxury cosmetics and beauty brands, who can take advantage of SGD Pharma’s design capabilities, its French know-how, and its international footprint. “The key trend in the beauty packaging industry right now is sustainability - brands and consumers want their luxe products to be recyclable, reusable and refillable, while not missing out on quality. SGD Pharma can offer brands the ability to stay on trend, while also feeling confident that their packaging is of the highest quality to match their product specifications,” commented Sheherazade Chamlou on the new strategic direction of the SGD Pharma beauty division. “It’s great to be back at the company where it all started for me and I’m excited to grow the beauty offering at SGD Pharma across America and Europe, as well as Asia, to provide brands with the European quality and heritage that we pride ourselves on. Innovation is key for us, and we will continue to support customers with new cosmetics packaging solutions that suit their needs and to stay ahead of global trends. We have access to a wide range of glass molds developed over 20 years and can also custom-design bespoke packaging for brands to suit their go-to-market needs,” she added."

From waterless to holistic: Beautystreams identifies eight beauty trends,"In its annual Cosmotrends report, based on the analysis of the most innovative products chosen among the exhibiting companies at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, Beautystreams highlighted eight key beauty trends: – Lash it Up! places the focus on eyelashes (and brows) as men and women get more creative, colourful and bolder, combining self-expression with fun and experimentation. – Derma Nerd highlights the surge of AI-boosted intelligent delivery systems that boost the power of active ingredients and make products more efficient, for example through smart encapsulation, nanosome technology or micro-dosing. – Beauty by Numbers is another tech-driven trend; with product customization reaching new heights as ever more sophisticated forms of AI allow detailed diagnoses and tailored product recommendations and formulae for a truly personalized beauty solution. – No to H2O refers to the increasingly popular water-conscious cosmetics, such as anhydrous (water-free) dry products or solid cosmetics. As water shortage is slated to be one of the biggest global problems in the near future, cutting down on the water footprint in beauty manufacturing will be key. – Tribute to Ancestral is highlighting the recent surge in traditional ingredients and age-old beauty rituals. These confer a sense of stability and reassurance in a time of uncertainty, as well inspire curiosity and a desire to experiment. – Surprise me, Delight Me is all about embracing sensation and pleasure of use; a renewed focus on tangible touch-points and tactile sensations after several years of everything becoming more digitalized.  This trend focuses on surprising sensorial benefits, interesting textures and formats to turn product application into a fun experience. – Mind, Body, Soul reflects how people increasingly view well-being through a broader lens, incorporating every aspect of life. A new generation of beauty products are not only delivering skin care benefits but also helping to create a holistic experience of well-being, sparking joy and boosting the mood. – Eventually, Lab-Born Naturals is another sustainability-driven trend, focusing on the possibilities of biotechnology to create powerful actives and natural ingredients without negatively impacting the planet. Developing natural ingredients through synthetic processes increases the use of renewable natural resources and is more environmentally friendly."

AMA Labs owner sentenced to 5 years in prison for falsifying test results,"Gabriel Letizia Jr., the owner and executive director of AMA Laboratories, Inc. (“AMA”), a consumer product testing company based in Rockland County, New York, has been sentenced to 60 months in federal prison (5 years) for fraud scheme involving fabricated test results. “For three decades, Gabriel Letizia defrauded AMA’s customers and jeopardized the safety of millions of consumers, all in the name of greed,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. Letizia began operating AMA in the early 1980s, and became its sole owner in approximately 2003. AMA purported to test the safety and efficacy of cosmetics, sunscreens, and other products on specified numbers of volunteer panelists for consumer products companies.  Clients of AMA used the test results to support their claims that their products were safe, effective, hypoallergenic, or provided a certain Sun Protection Factor (“SPF”), including after exposure to water.  AMA clients that manufactured sunscreens used the test results to comply with FDA regulations requiring sunscreen manufacturers to have their products tested and to maintain the test results for possible review by the FDA. From 1987 through April 2017, Letizia and AMA personnel operating at his direction defrauded AMA’s customers of more than USD 46 million by testing products on materially lower numbers of panelists than the numbers specified and paid for by AMA’s customers. According to AMA employees, the majority of AMA’s tests contained fraudulent results, for two reasons: First, at Letizia’s instruction, AMA personnel rarely tested products on the number of panelists requested by AMA’s clients. Instead, AMA tested products on a far lower number of panelists, typically 20 or less, rather than the 50 for which the clients had paid.  AMA’s fees for tests were based, in part, on the number of panelists that were to participate in the study.  At Letizia’s direction, AMA sent its clients fraudulent test results in which AMA personnel included fictitious data for “phantom” panelists who had not actually participated in the tests. Second, at Letizia’s direction, AMA personnel routinely falsified test results relating to its clients’ products, which included suppressing adverse reactions and deviating from testing protocols. According to the court, from 2012 through April 2017, AMA received USD 46.2 million in revenue from the fraudulent reports. In addition to his prison term, Letizia, 72, was sentenced to three years of supervised release, restitution in the amount of USD 1,440,238, and forfeiture in the amount of USD 46,200,000."

Maison Berger Paris entrusts Stoelzle Masnières for its new glass bottles,"To complete its collections, French heritage brand Maison Berger Paris has renewed its collaboration with the French subsidiary of the Stoelzle group, which produced the glass bottles for the its latest launches. Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie thus produced the curvaceous bottle of the Lampe Senso Verte, designed by Rozenn Mainguené. Produced in N°1 Luxe glass, the aesthetics of this 300 ml bottle with hollowed facets is enhanced by a peacock green lacquering. Another recent creation: the Duality 300 ml bottle, by designer Anthony Gambus, explores the multiple facets of femininity. Its original shape reveals a harmonious pleats, highlighted by a plum shade. The entire artefact is outlined by a black silicone band embossed with the name of the brand. This textured material effect contrasts with the rest of the glass bottle. This new collaboration with the Maison Berger Paris teams was also another big challenge for Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie. “Indeed, the striations made it necessary to make adjustments to the model at the parting line, in order to avoid any alteration of the design during the removal from the mould. In addition, the place where the silicone (and therefore deformable) accessory is located required a very special adaptation work related to tolerance and dimensions,” said the French glassmaker. Eventually, in the wake of the nude and the white bottles released in 2021, the brand’s Glaçon (Icecube) collection was completed by the Glaçon Gingko (silver grey) and Glaçon Mountains (gold) bottles. The know-how of Stoelzle’s teams made it possible to obtain total flatness on all four sides of this 250 ml cube with rounded corners. This flatness is essential with regard to the complexity of the decorations, which are repeated identically on each of the sides, in order to guarantee the colours after several annealing sessions."

Boxboard: Metsä Board to expend its production capacity at the Husum mill,"To meet the growing demand for sustainably produced packaging materials, Metsä Board announced last year an investment to increase the annual folding boxboard production capacity at its Husum mill, Sweden, by 200,000 tonnes. Extension works are underway and the kick-off of the renewed board machine is planned for the autumn of 2023 with full production capacity estimated to be reached by the end of 2025. The board machine will be extended by 54 meters which requires an extension of the machine hall basement as well. “We have built a building in the building to be able to do the extensive civil demolition works safely and at the same time to be able to continue production,” says Håkan Jonsson, Project Director. The extension of the folding boxboard machine has been planned using simulation and 3D models. The dry end area of the board machine will be renewed, and the reel handling will be fully automated. There are also several improvements to the infrastructure to enable a smooth-running operation at the site.  All the main machinery purchases for the project have been undertaken, said Metsä Board in a statement. “The upcoming fully automatic reel handling is impressive and will enable smooth production flows.  We’ve conducted a simulation to make sure that there are no bottlenecks built into the system. The operators will be able to focus on the machine performance and the quality of the paperboard,” adds Håkan Jonsson."
"Keys Soulcare launches Make You, color-skincare line of hybrids","A year after launching her brand of skincare, Keys Soulcare, the singer of ""If I Ain’t Got You"" unveiled her first collection of makeup during Monday night’s Met Gala, in New York. The artist’s new hybrid line goes beyond a makeup collection and intends to bridge skincare and makeup. In 2016, Alicia Keys was one of the first public figures to opt to go makeup-free, preferring to care for her skin rather than cover it with artifice, a statement of self-affirmation. However, the singer now intends to fuse skincare and color. This first ’color-skincare’ collection, simply called ""Make You,"" consists of a handful of products formulated to take care of the skin, while giving it that touch of pep that is sometimes missing for those who have given up on makeup. The aim is to allow women — and men — to define their own beauty standards. Key products include a transparent gel for smoothing and defining eyebrows, a nourishing and moisturizing blush, and a nourishing lip balm in vitamin-rich shades. “Our path into color care started with the Let Me Glow Illuminating Serum,” said Kory Marchisotto, Chief Marketing Officer, e.l.f. Beauty & President, Keys Soulcare. ""This vegan, hydrating, illuminating complexion and makeup priming serum helps brighten, plump, and smooth the look of your skin with antioxidant-rich rose water and niacinamide."" Hybrid make-up is a growing phenomenon in the cosmetics industry, capitalizing on the trend for holistic beauty, with a host of eyeshadows, lipsticks, foundations, and other blushes formulated for skin health. If over a decade ago, the emergence of BB creams paved the way for this phenomenon, the pandemic has clearly accelerated the shift to the all-in-one concept in the world of makeup. Complexion creams, tinted serums, complexion enhancers, and lip oils are all a product of this trend, which permits a growing number of consumers to no longer have to choose between makeup and (natural) skin beauty."
"U.S. beauty market to grow as fragrance and makeup drive sales, finds Kline","The U.S. beauty and personal care market surpassed $85 billion in retail sales in 2021, an increase of $7 billion from 2019 sales levels, according to Kline. This is the market’s strongest performance in the last 10 years but growth is expected to continue as the market research firm forecasts a 6% CAGR [1] through 2026. Some categories, such as fragrance and makeup, are back on the radar for consumers and retailers alike, with escalating sales of these products fueling total industry growth, wrote Dana Kreutzer, Project Lead, Consumer Products, at Kline, in a recent blog post. “ Makeup , which jumped 12% in 2021, is moving in a direction where hybrid experiences, or skin-improving makeup, are becoming more common when it comes to product innovation,” said Kreuzer, mentioning recent launches such as Kosas’ Revealer Skin-Improving Foundation SPF 25, with brightening and plumping claims, and Chanel’s new N°1 de Chanel Revitalizing Foundation, with moisturizing and plumping claims. Fragrance recorded an even higher activity last year, with an increase of 25% within the luxury segment. The category also witnessed an influx in male consumers. According to Kreutzer, the importance of makeup and fragrance is further supported by recent results from market leaders; for instance, L’Oréal’s recently released Q1 2022 sales report showed that makeup was a top growth contributor and its fragrance portfolio continued to drive the performance of its Luxe division in North America. More broadly, the growth of beauty sales is driven by consumers coming back to stores. Based on foot traffic data from SafeGraph, Kline found that Q1 foot traffic was up 25% versus year ago and up 14% from 2019 levels for select beauty retailers such as Sephora, Ulta, and Bath & Body Works. In such a context, big retailers are now transforming their beauty operations to keep shoppers coming back. According to Kreutzer, mass retailers like Target and Walmart are tapping further into beauty via store remodels and partnerships with premium beauty retailers, including Ulta (Target) and Space NK (Walmart)."

Iberchem launches its own biodegradable fragrance encapsulation technology,"Spain-headquartered fragrance house Iberchem is launching new biodegradable capsules. Iberchem’s Vernovacaps is the second biodegradable fragrance encapsulation technology to be released on the market. According to the company, it is also the only one with a biodegradability corresponding to the OECD’s standards of Readily biodegradable (greater than 60% within 28 days with further degradation afterwards). Available to all Iberchem’s customers worldwide, the new fragrance technology consists of a minimum of 60% bio-based materials. Vernovacaps meets ECHA’s (European Chemical Agency) proposed 2022 legislation on microplastics and 2027 ban on non-biodegradable microplastics due to its high level of biodegradability. “The fragrance technology department worked closely with the perfumers of Iberchem to present a new biodegradable capsules that meets the customers’ expectations on both olfactory and performance levels,” said Michael White, Fragrance Technologies Director at Iberchem. “Our new Vernovacaps offer stable and robust fragrances that are not affected by the encapsulation process.” According to Iberchem, the new technology offers the same performance as their traditional encapsulation technology NeoCaps. The first variant of Vernovacaps has been formulated for fabric softeners but the technology will eventually be extended to other ranges of products such as personal care, Iberchem added. Last year, French perfume manufacturer Sozio launched a new natural and COSMOS-certified encapsulation technology for personal care dubbed Cosmocaps. This alternative to synthetic microcapsules aimed to eliminate micro-plastics from formulations while providing cosmetic benefits."

LVMH and Origin Materials to partner on low-carbon footprint packaging,"Origin Materials, a US company specialised in manufacturing carbon-negative and carbon-neutral materials, and LVMH Beauty, the fragrances and cosmetics division of the global leader in luxury products, have form strategic partnership to develop low-carbon footprint packaging for LVMH’s perfumes and beauty products. Through this deal, LVMH Beauty is looking to buy carbon-negative PET (polyethylene terephthalate) for use in packaging for perfumes and cosmetics. In order to secure its supplies, the French group has signed a multi-year capacity reservation agreement with Origin Materials. “At LVMH, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future. Origin’s bioplastic technologies are playing a crucial role in helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality,” said Claude Martinez, Executive President & Managing Director LVMH Beauty. Origin Materials has developed a technology to turn the carbon found in biomass into materials that are usually produced from fossil resources. “PET produced using Origin technology is functionally identical to petroleum-based PET, but with a dramatically lower carbon footprint since it is made from sustainable wood residues which capture carbon,” said the company in a statement. Additionally, Origin Materials’ PET is equally recyclable to fossil-based PET within the existing infrastructure, which is critical to creating a circular economy. “Our mission of enabling the world’s transition to sustainable materials as fast as possible is completely aligned with LVMH’s ambitious environmental initiatives. We look forward to helping LVMH reduce its carbon footprint and achieve its sustainability goals while continuing to deliver superior product experiences to its customers,” highlighted Origin Materials Co-CEO Rich Riley. Earlier this year, Origin Materials has announced a site in Geismar, Louisiana, for the construction of its first world-scale PET manufacturing facility.

Procos produces Patyka’s new eco-responsible boxes,"The Paris-headquartered organic cosmetics brand has chosen Procos for the development of its new digital marketing box. With this packaging, Patyka has made the choice of a resolutely eco-friendly solution: a 100% mono-material box made from FSC certified recycled paper. Patyka approached Procos with a brief to reproduce an existing folding box, with a laminated coating and a construction with magnets and stickers. The Procos experts responded to this request with two alternative options: the first one, matching point by point with the brand’s specifications, and the second one, thought ""out of the box"", by taking an alternative eco-responsible way. This ""eco-friendly"" box, based on an innovative construction without magnets nor stickers, and made of 100% PCW (post-consumer waste) FSC certified recycled paper, immediately impressed and seduced Patyka management. Patyka thus entrusted this project to Procos and proposed to them to deepen their approach.

Convinced by Procos’ proposal and by the relevance of its ""eco-friendly"" box, Patyka has extended its request by entrusting Procos with its institutional boxes as well as its shopping bags, which are now 100% paper and therefore 100% recyclable."

TNT Global Manufacturing continues cooperation with Penhaligon,"TNT Global Manufacturing  adds The World According to Arthur’s cap to the Penhaligon’s family portrait collection, a tribute to the good old English spirit: stiff upper lip, caustic humour, and a knack for provocation. The cap is made of five gold electroplated zamak pieces, like the whole collection.  The technical challenge lies in the realization of the inside of the mouth which required the addition of two zamak parts (among the 5), and the delicate assembly. “Fineness and attention to detail are highlighted, thanks to a perfectly controlled production process: die-casting, unmoulding, assembly. As a reminder, the caps are manually polished before gold electroplating, for high-end finishing,” said TNT Global Manufacturing in a statement. Since 2013, TNT Global Manufacturing has listed more than 20 references, that were produced at more than a million pieces, each. An achievement that also confirms the relevance of their bet on zamak, which is describe as “an agile and noble material that fits easily into a sustainable development policy.” A highly-resistant alloy composed of 95% zinc, 4% aluminium, and 1% copper, Zamak is actually infinitely reusable in its end-of-life, without losing any properties during the recycling process. A correct collection of the material could make it enter a more circular economy."
Zero-waste body care brand Kate McLeod inks retail deal with Sephora Americas,"The maker of the waterless, plastic-free, and zero-waste Body Stone solid moisturizers has entered into retail partnership with Sephora.com.

It’s designed to be used daily and turns something quotidian into an intentioned moment of self-care. By removing water from its formulas, the brand was able to create sustainable, plastic-free packaging, and reduce its carbon footprint. The company’s Body Stone Starter Kits come with a reusable bamboo canister, which provides easy storage. Once purchased, it can be refilled over time with one’s favorite full-size Body Stone. ""Bringing the Daily Stone to Sephora is a big moment for our brand, and for me personally,"" said Co-Founder, Formulator and CEO Kate McLeod. ""This started in my kitchen, and the Daily Stone is where it all began. It took me three years to perfect the formula, and I personally hand poured thousands of Daily Stones when we launched the business. We still hand craft, hand wrap, and hand package every single Body Stone with love at our workshop in the Hudson Valley. We do everything very intentionally, so launching at Sephora with a single hero product felt right for us as a brand, and will allow the Sephora customer to understand that we do things very differently. We’ve made a solid moisturizer without the sticky wax, preservatives, synthetics, or stabilizers traditionally used to make lotion bars. The Body Stone glides on like silk. it’s so nourishing and you really do have to feel it to understand it."" Kate McLeod’s launch in Sephora’s Clean + Planet Positive program comes as the brand announces the launch of its ""Healthy Planet, Healthy Minds"" program, a CSR initiative that addresses environmental sustainability and mental health. The company views these crises as inextricably linked, with the rise of climate anxiety worsening mental health outcomes and aims to address these issues through its product design, business practices, and charitable giving. The company has committed to donating 2% of its total annual revenue in 2022, split equally across environmental and mental health non-profits."
Shiseido is launching eco-conscious prestige skincare brand Ulé in Europe,"Initially comprising eight products, including a Hydra-Fortifying CBD Moisturiser, a Balancing Floral Mist, an In & Out Phyto Nutritive Oil and three serums, the range is set to be launched in France on May 2, 2022, where products will be available on the brand’s e-commerce site and a brand boutique in Paris, at prices starting from EUR 30 to EUR 119. Ulé will be rolled out to further markets, including the UK, in 2023. Ulé is the brainchild of the Lindsay Azpitarte, Vice-President, New Brand Development EMEA, at the Japanese beauty giant. The development of the range has been led by Shiseido EMEA teams, with a focus on “conscious beauty”, a concept described as including responsible sourcing, a list of 1,400 banned ingredients, environmental impact reduction and transparency. While tapping into the Shiseido’s skincare expertise and technology, Ulé is the first skincare brand the Japanese group has developed entirely in Europe, leveraging on open innovation with start-ups and experts including nutritionists and botanists. In order to lessen the environmental impact caused by shipping, most of the ingredients (84% on average [1]) were sourced in France, where the products are manufactured [2]. Partnering with Tower Farm, a start-up that drives to develop an urban agriculture model through responsible local indoor production, Ulé built a vertical farm near Paris [3], where it is growing the three key exotic plants used in its formulas. Operating its own urban farm allows Ulé to be less dependent on global sourcing while locally producing fresh, pesticide free, and fully traceable botanical ingredients. As far as packaging is concerned, Ulé has chosen to combine lightweight glass and bio-sourced caps. Paper envelopes have been preferred to cardboard for secondary packs. For optimum transparency, Ulé pledges to disclose on its website all information on the ingredients and the origins of the products as well as the packaging."

Lumene partners with Sulapac for a sustainable plastic-free skincare jar,"The Finnish cosmetics brand has collaborated with material innovation startup Sulapac on a pilot project to sustainably package two of its most popular skincare products Nordic-C [VALO] Glow Reveal moisturizer and Nordic Hydra [LÄHDE] Intense Hydration 24H moisturizer. The two products will be packaged in Sulapac jars made from FSC-certified wood chips from industrial side streams and plant-based materials. The inner lining of the jar consists of the world’s first barrier technology for cosmetics made of industrially compostable material that protects the sensitive cosmetic product. “Up until now, the main challenge of using bio-based material in jars has been the fast evaporation of moisture, which is why it hasn’t been deemed a workable solution for water-based cosmetics. Through this pilot, we are making an investment towards the future of innovation in the cosmetics industry,” says Essi Arola, Head of Research and Development, Packaging at Lumene. According to Sulapac, four years of scientific development and testing were required to create an innovative jar made of industrially compostable material that would be able to host a water-based formula. The design philosophy of Sulapac is to mimic nature – similarly to a same-size piece of wood left on the forest floor, Sulapac jars can be digested by naturally occurring microorganisms and break down into carbon dioxide, water and biomass, leaving no traces behind. The products will be available internationally on Lumene’s online store and in selected stores in Finland."

Exsymol bets on silanols for invisible pores and a perfect complexion,"With age, pores enlarge, doubling in diameter between 25 and 50 years due to a loss of skin elasticity. But, with the selfie phenomenon and the growing importance of self-images on social media, the pore has become the new wrinkle. Thanks to its expertise in silanols, Exsymol has developed Adenosilane, an active ingredient composed of bio-functional Silicium and Adenosine obtained by fermentation. By acting on the pore sheath, it improves skin firmness and therefore helps to prevent pore dilation. By optimizing fibrillogenesis, it allows the reconstruction of the sheath (collagen, MMP1) and densifies the network of fibers around the pore for a better quality of this sheath (MAGP1: Microfibril Associated Glycoprotein 1). It increases the level of available energy (ATP) and allows recovery of the pore’s elasticity. After 28 days of use, 75% of volunteers (clinical tests) have fewer visible pores and 70% observe a reduction in their size.

BASF and Henkel focus on renewable raw materials in consumer goods,"BASF and Henkel have commit to replacing fossil carbon feedstock with renewable feedstock for most products in Henkel’s European Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care businesses over the next four years, said the two companies in a joint statement. The move follows a successful pilot with Henkel’s cleaning and detergent brand Love Nature in 2021. Through the cooperation, the fossil feedstock for around 110,000 tons of ingredients per year will be substituted with renewable feedstock using BASF’s certified biomass balance approach. As a result, Henkel’s core brands like Persil, Pril, Fa and Schauma will come with a reduced carbon footprint, avoiding around 200,000 tons of CO2emissions in total. “We are delighted to build on our ongoing cooperation with BASF and significantly increase the share of biomass in our value chain for our products used by millions around the world every day,” said Carsten Knobel, CEO of Henkel. “To foster a regenerative planet, we are on a journey toward an environmental transformation of our business model. We intend to continuously enhance our processes, products and use of raw materials for a resource-efficient, carbon-neutral future. Integrating BASF’s biomass balance approach into our supply chain as an early-mover is a right step in that direction.” The replacement of fossil feedstock is possible through BASF’s biomass balance approach: renewable resources are used in the very first steps of chemical production. The bio-based feedstock amount is then attributed to specific products by means of the certified method. BASF has established a closed chain of custody from the renewable feedstock it uses through to the final product. TÜV Nord, an independent certification body, supports the practical implementation and confirms according to the REDCert2 certification scheme that BASF replaces the required quantities of fossil resources for the biomass balanced product with renewable feedstock."
Aptar achieves new milestone in the use of PureCycle recycled plastic,"The packaging manufacturer has announced that it has successfully converted prototype material from the PureCycle Feedstock Evaluation Unit into multiple colours of hinged closures with performances similar to conventional resin for food, beverage and cosmetic applications. The progress achieved in testing and transforming PureCycle Technologies, Inc.’s Ultra-Pure Recycled (UPR) plastic are an important milestone in the efforts Aptar and PureCycle are making to determine the right material combination to create hinged closures made with this recycled material. Aptar and PureCycle have partnered in 2019 with the aim to achieve a more circular economy through an innovative portfolio of rigorously tested sustainable materials. PureCycle is actively working to begin commercial production of UPR at its first commercial facility in the United States. “Aptar believes that the packaging industry must move beyond the ‘make, use, dispose’ behaviours of the past and actively work toward a circular economy. By circulating used plastic and packaging, we keep it in the economy and out of the environment,” said the company in a statement. As a signatory of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, Aptar has set itself the objectives to incorporate more recycled content into its product offerings and have its dispensing solutions for the beauty, personal care, home care, food and beverage markets be 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025."

Cosmetic Victories: Innovative gelation and epigenetic tests in the spotlight,"The winners of the 7th edition of The Cosmetic Victories, the international contest dedicated to innovation in the cosmetic industry, were unveiled on 22 March, during a ceremony broadcast on Cosmetic Valley TV. Organised by Cosmetic Valley, the competition aims to spotlight the most promising cosmetics industry research conducted by start-ups, SMEs, and university laboratories, around the World. For this 2022 edition, more than 80 projects from 18 countries were examined. Then, the six teams having reached the finals stood before a jury [1] presided by Cosmetic Valley’s president, Marc-Antoine Jamet. As every year, two prizes were awarded: The Academic Prize was awarded to Dr Sami Halila, Researcher in Glychochemistry at the CNRS [2] for the project : CARBOGEL, a Simple and Eco-Friendly Carbohydrate-Based Gelling Agent for Oily Phase. The project relates on the supramolecular gelation of organic liquids, such as organic solvents or oils, with monosaccharide derivatives that self-assemble into hierarchical 3D network of nanostructures. The sweet gelators are made from an eco- friendly and efficient method (reaction in water). Gelation could be performed by sonication, or by heating/cooling, or by dilution. The gel is considered as a stimuli- responsive and controlled delivery matrix for cosmetic agents. Finally, our project contributes to ""green"" and sustainable cosmetics by limiting our environmental and social impact The Industry Prize was awarded to Stefan Mazy, CEO & Founder of Australia’s Derma Health Solutions Pty Ltd. for their project: SkinRNA Micro-cell Test. A world-first, this repeatable, epigenetic diagnostic skin patch and laboratory test quantifies skincare effectiveness via real- time gene expression activity. A device collects more than 15,000 genes, while algorithms provide gene expression activity scores for skin functions including collagen and elastin production, and skin inflammation. After product intervention, a second test is performed measuring new gene activity against initial benchmarks. Consumers can then repeat testing at intervals to track and monitor skin improvement at a genetic level without waiting for visible signs."

"BASF obtains certification on sustainable castor products, an industry first","BASF has been certified according to the SuCCESS (Sustainable Castor Caring for Environmental & Social Standards) Code, successfully finishing the whole certification process by an external body, a first in the chemicals industry, said the company. The production site in Düsseldorf-Holthausen, Germany is also the first site in the personal care industry to be certified. BASF has now started supplying its first sustainable castor ingredients to the personal care industry. “Sustainability in general and sustainable sourcing specifically are gaining increasing importance within large parts of society and among industry stakeholders. For this reason, responsible sourcing is a key element of BASF’s sustainability strategy. With the SuCCESS certification of the Düsseldorf-Holthausen site, BASF continues to strive to creating chemistry for a sustainable future,” said the company in a statement. BASF, Arkema, Jayant Agro-Organics Ltd, and the international civil society organization Solidaridad launched project ‘Pragati’ [1] in May 2016 to improve working conditions, create awareness for sustainable farming and increase yields thanks to more efficient farming practices. The Pragati project was driven by a baseline survey of more than 1,000 castor farmers in Gujarat, India, where the majority of the world’s castor supply originates. The goal is to support the sustainable production of castor beans to establish sustainable supply chains that amongst others increase the yields and income of the farmers. Since the project was initiated, more than 5,800 smallholders and over 13,300 hectares of land have been certified for sustainable castor cultivation. The Code SuCCESS is designed by multiple partners and stakeholders to ensure the objective of Pragati project and to develop sustainability principles for castor seeds that will guide and further allow castor producers to offer certified sustainable castor in the global market. The SuCCESS Code adopted 11 principles of ownership and provides smallholders with on-field support for ensuring monitoring and compliance with 41 mandatory and 25 non-mandatory control points. Only SuCCESS-certified Sustainable Castor Association (SCA) members can claim to supply sustainable castor products. As a wide range of natural ingredients are now used in cosmetic and personal care products, ethical sourcing is becoming the norm in the cosmetics industry. Cosmetic companies and raw material suppliers are investing massively in ethical sourcing programmes. According to market research firm Ecovia Intelligence, palm kernel oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the cosmetics industry. About 20 percent of palm oil is now produced according to RSPO or related sustainability schemes. Large cosmetic firms, including Unilever and L’Oréal, have committed to source only sustainable palm oil. Over 20 operators have joined the Action for Sustainable Derivatives, an industry-led collaboration that encourages responsible production and sourcing of palm oil derivatives. Sustainability charters and certification schemes are extending to other types of vegetable oils, including castor been oil with the Sustainable Castor Caring for Environmental & Social Standards (SuCCESS) Code, and coconut oil with the Sustainable Coconut & Coconut Oil Roundtable, which introduced its first charter in 2020."

L’Oréal continues to roll out its recyclable eco-refills with Arcade Beauty,"Arcade Beauty continues to support the L’Oréal group in the environmental optimization of its packaging. After Elsève, Garnier and dermocosmetic brands such as La Roche Posay, L’Oréal confirms its expectations, this time on professional skincare and a successful refillable concept.

Orlandi makes an eco-friendly single-dose sample for Caron’s scented hand gels,"In order to diversify our perfuming rituals, French fragrance brand Caron has created a hand sanitizing version of six of its iconic perfumes. Jean Jacques, Caron’s on-house perfumer, has adapted the formulas of the brand’s perfumes to compose the new range, which is now available in a box of 6 small-sized bottles (45ml) and in a 200ml format. To promote this collection, Orlandi has produced an exclusive eco-responsible mono-dose sample in partnership with V-Shapes. Designed to be recyclable, the new V-Shapes single-dose is entirely made of polypropylene (PP). The difficulty of this single-material choice was to design an aluminium-free barrier that was sufficiently air-tight to accommodate and preserve the alcohol in the scented gel solution. This 100% mono-material single-dose has recently benefited from the TOMRA verification and the Interseroh certification, two leading organizations focused on recyclability in the industry. With this major innovation, Orlandi is strengthening its offer of eco-responsible products. So far limited for use in skincare sampling, the V-Shapes mono-dose can now offers a new eco-responsible sampling solution to the world of premium perfume."

"L’Occitane takes over Australian premium beauty brand, Grown Alchemist","In a move that marks the Group’s second brand acquisition in less than 6 months, after Sol de Janeiro last November, the L’Occitane group has acquired a majority control in Australian cosmeceutical, clean skincare brand, Grown Alchemist. According to the terms of the agreement, L’Occitane will acquire 49.24% of Grown Alchemist’s shares (representing 76.18% of the voting rights).

Hair product sales expected to post double-digit revenue growth in the US,"With nearly 50% of US consumers willing to spend more on hair product that works for them, The NPD Group expects hair product sales to post double-digit revenue growth in the US through 2024. According to the market research firm over 90% of U.S. consumers continue to show strong purchase interest for hair-related products and are even taking their routines to another level. This category is expected to continue along its positive sales trajectory through 2024, averaging 15% growth in the U.S. over the next two years. Compared to the previous six months, more consumers plan to purchase more targeted hair-related products, including hair and scalp treatments, relaxers, chemical straighteners, hair gummies, and vitamins, according to the latest “Future of Hair” report from NPD. The heightened demand for hair care, coupled with consumer allegiances to products with high efficacy, are factors contributing to the category’s continued success. Just over half of hair product consumers say that when they find something that works for them, they stick with it — and, in fact, found NPD, 49% are willing to pay more for it. “Both functional and fun, the hair category is winning with consumers in more ways than one,” said Larissa Jensen, Beauty Industry Advisor at NPD. “Since the onset of the pandemic, consumers have taken more of their hair routines in-house, sought ways to treat themselves outside of the salon, and have grown more educated on hair conditions and product ingredients. We can expect the category to continue to show strength, as consumers strive to look more polished re-entering society, and product innovations continue to capture their interest.”"
"Singapore to lift travel curbs, in ‘major milestone’ to live with the virus","Singapore will lift restrictions for all vaccinated travellers from next week, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday hailing it as a ""major milestone"" in the aviation hub’s efforts to live with Covid-19. The city-state is the latest Asian country to ease travel restrictions in a region that has generally been more reluctant to lift barriers than Europe and North America. A gateway for many travellers arriving in the Asia-Pacific, Singapore had already started quarantine-free travel schemes with some countries in recent months. From April 1, fully vaccinated adults and unvaccinated children will be allowed to enter the country without quarantining, as long as they take a pre-departure test, officials said. Easing travel curbs will ""reconnect Singapore with the world,"" said Lee Hsien Loong in a televised address. ""It will give a much-needed boost to businesses, particularly the tourism sector, and it will help Singapore reclaim its position as a business and aviation hub."" Only travellers on a ""restricted list"" will face curbs in entering Singapore, although there are currently no countries on the list.  A raft of other coronavirus measures were also eased, with people in Singapore no longer required to wear masks outside, and limits on group sizes raised to 10, up from five previously. The pandemic plunged Singapore into its worst-ever recession in 2020 as the trading hub closed its borders. International visitor arrivals dropped to just 2.7 million that year from more than 19 million in 2019. The country of 5.5 million initially kept Covid-19 cases low through border closures and a tough lockdown. However, it has faced sizeable outbreaks since last year but, with some of the world’s highest vaccination rates, authorities have shifted to a policy of living with the virus. Singapore’s approach stands in contrast to rival financial hub Hong Kong, where arrivals are still required to undergo lengthy quarantines in hotels. Following Singapore’s announcement, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam was forced to defend her administration’s approach, insisting the Chinese city remained an ""attractive"" financial centre. ""The policies and measures to be adopted by each government in combating Covid differ,"" she said. Like mainland China, Hong Kong has stuck to a zero-Covid policy, but the approach has led to an exodus of foreign and local residents, and failed to stop a fierce Omicron outbreak in recent months. Taking into account these different approaches, BolognaFiere Group and Informa Markets, the organisers of Cosmoprof Asia have announced that the 2022 edition of the leading trade show dedicated to the cosmetics industry in Asia-Pacific will be relocated from Hong Kong to Singapore, from 16-18 November 2022. Other countries in the Asia-Pacific that have recently announced an easing of travel restrictions include Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Malaysia."

Designed by virtual creator Alex Box, the NFT will be available in several thousand copies and will be free. Even more than offering its customers a first experience in the metaverse, this first foray will help Estée Lauder make itself known to those who are already used to spending time in these virtual worlds. It could also be a way for the cosmetics brand to test out this parallel world in order to potentially join others in adopting it as its new playground. L’Oréal Paris USA, Clinique, Givenchy Beauty and Gucci are among the beauty brands that have already entered the metaverse, showing keen enthusiasm for what looks like a new El Dorado for the luxury world."

Symrise has submitted a binding offer to acquire 100% of R. Romani - Société Française d’Aromatiques (SFA Romani), a family-owned fragrance house specialized in high-end fine fragrance products. SFA Romani is running a combined development and production site in Saint-Cézaire-sur-Siagne, in the Grasse area, the French perfumery cradle. Symrise would acquire SFA Romani from its current owners, the Romani-Caruso family, Keensight Capital and Sofipaca. Founded in 1963 in Grasse by perfumer Rodrigue Romani, SFA Romani is internationally recognized for its choice of fine natural raw materials, its craftmanship in fragrance creation and the quality of its compositions. In addition, Symrise submitted a binding offer to fully acquire Neroli Invest DL (Groupe Neroli). Groupe Neroli was formed by the merger of perfume houses Créations & Parfums and Floressence, both founded in the mid-1980s in Saint-Cézaire-sur-Siagne. Floressence was acquired in 2017 and merged with Créations & Parfums in 2021. To build a strong position in natural fragrance ingredients, Groupe Neroli established long-term partnerships with local farmers for the sustainable cultivation of flowers in the Grasse area. Last November, Symrise had already announced a joint venture with Groupe Neroli. With these transactions, Symrise intends to reinforce its fine fragrance presence in southern France, strengthen its competitiveness in the creation of fragrance compositions and broaden its presence in key countries in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The combined annual sales of SFA Romani and Groupe Neroli amount to more than EUR 40 million.

VPI creates a 100% recycled polypropylene refill for L’Occitane,"Reusable or refillable solutions have been at the core of L’Occitane en Provence’s strategy ever since the brand launched its first eco-refill in 2008. For their latest project, L’Occitane entrusted VPI, a French specialist in injecting plastic parts for the luxury industry market, to make a refill from 100% PCR (Post-Consumer Recycled) polypropylene (PP) material. The 100% PCR PP cup of the Ultra Rich Body Cream Shea Butter refill thus helps to preserve natural resources, to support recycling sectors while reducing the environmental footprint of the whole supply chain thanks to the lightness of the material. “The use of 100% recycled PP and the creation of the cup represent genuine technological strides through which VPI has demonstrated its ability and commitment. It has been a truly impressive feat by VPI, on behalf of L’Occitane, to manage and ensure the traceability of batches of recycled material and expertly produce a 200ml container all within a tight turnaround time,” said the supplier in a statement. Close work between the brand’s and VPI’s teams - which involved studying the design of the grip and perfecting an unsnapping and re-snapping closure - led to the invention of a new user-friendly and pleasant mode of use. The refilling cup contains 200ml and is heat sealed after filling. At the first purchase the tub fits in an aluminium packaging and then stands alone for reloading. ""We at VPI are honoured to work with committed companies such as L’Occitane en Provence. We are grateful to the teams on site who think ahead about eco-design and, when it comes to developing and mass producing products, invest so that they can oversee wonderful, genuinely eco-designed projects. We are proud to have been able to complete such deep research on recycled materials and to have helped bring such ambitious action plans to fruition,"" said Marc Beltrami, VPI’s Head of Sales. ""This refill solution enables us to substantially reduce our dependency on plastic. Compared to the old product, it accounts for an annual saving of more than 40 tons. It also helps us to fulfil our ambition of using Post-Consumer recycled plastic. VPI’s teams rose perfectly to this challenge,"" said David Bayard, the Packaging R&D Manager of L’Occitane en Provence."

Organized by Informa Markets in India and BolognaFiere Group the new trade show will host international and domestic companies offering raw materials, laboratory equipment, private label and contract manufacturing services, machinery and packaging for fragrances, cosmetics and toiletries. The Indian cosmetic industry was rapidly growing before the pandemic, owing to rapid economic development and a rise in disposable income resulting in changing lifestyle patterns. Covid-19 further increased the attention on personal health and hygiene, thus leading to a more significant demand for beauty and personal care products. New consumers habits, e-commerce and digitalisation, and a radical change in the supply policy for international brands pushed local suppliers to invest in innovative formulations, creative packaging designs, technological production processes and industrial solutions, focusing on high-quality standards.

Anjac acquires Canada’s Pillar5 and strengthens its pharmaceutical activities,"Anjac Health & Beauty has announced a new acquisition, in line with its strategy of geographic growth and product portfolio diversification. The French-based has taken over Pillar5 Pharma, a Canadian contract development manufacturing organisation (CDMO) specializing in the production of sterile ophthalmic solutions and niche solid dose manufacturing (tablets, capsules etc.). The operation reinforces Anjac’s expansion in North America, following its acquisition of Apollo Healthcare in January and of Cosmetix West in 2019. Pillar5, a Canadian company, is one of the main North American CDMOs for the production of sterile ophthalmic solutions and solid dose manufacturing (tablets, capsules, etc.). Moreover, it is the first CDMO to offer multi-dose preservative free capabilities on the North American market. This innovative technology is particularly interesting for Anjac, which notably perceives multiple synergies, both in the fields of health and beauty. Based in Arnprior, Ontario, Pillar5 offers a full line of services ranging from formulation, product manufacturing and custom packaging to providing technical services. Pillar5 has built a diversified portfolio of loyal clients, working with major pharmaceutical laboratories as well as specialists in ophthalmological care.

"Luxe Pack Los Angeles and MakeUp in Los Angeles welcomed 4,183 visitors","Luxe Pack Los Angeles successfully reopened its doors for its 4th edition at the Los Angeles Convention Center on February 23rd and 24th. According to the organizers, the show floor that once again was shared with MakeUp in LosAngeles, the BtoB stage for beauty formulation and accessories, welcomed 4,183 attendees.

Third edition of Beautyworld Saudi Arabia to open doors in Riyadh next week,"The third Beautyworld Saudi Arabia - the Kingdom’s only dedicated exhibition for beauty products, hair, fragrances, and wellbeing - will open its doors at the Riyadh International Convention & Exhibition Centre (RICEC) on March 21st. Organised by Saudi-based Al-Harithy Company for Exhibitions (ACE) Group, under licence from UAE-headquartered Messe Frankfurt Middle East, the three-day event will feature 82 exhibitors from 15 countries. “This third edition of Beautyworld Saudi Arabia, which is only open to trade professionals, will build on its predecessors and enable business penetration of a major market characterized by high income consumers and a growing, image-conscious youth population,” commented Maria Cecilia Canlas, interim Show Director. “For the first time, the show will take place in Riyadh, the Kingdom’s capital and commercial hub, offering a strategic gateway for beauty majors to tap into the vast central and eastern regions.” Canlas said visitor pre-registration levels in 2022 are significantly higher than the show’s previous edition pre-pandemic in 2019, which took place in Jeddah. “It’s clear there is strong intent to re-connect and re-engage with the market.” Sales of cosmetics and beauty products in Saudi Arabia are forecast to reach USD 5.5 billion in 2022. “Saudi consumers are extremely well informed, with social media driving awareness of product ranges and availability,” explained Canlas. “Saudi Arabia has the global highest YouTube watch time per capita with the channel’s beauty focused content attracting over 1.9 billion views in the Kingdom – a figure reported to be rising by almost 187 percent annually – while Google has reported that Arabic beauty content is growing faster than that produced anywhere else worldwide. The Kingdom’s GenZ and Millennial consumers are becoming increasingly conscious about product ingredients and demand for organic, vegan, and ethically sourced cosmetics is growing.  Hygiene has also risen up the agendas of fitness suites, salon, and spa customers who have become more health and safety aware as a result of the pandemic.” Beautyworld Saudi Arabia 2022 will feature four dedicated show segments:
– Fragrance;
– Hair, Nails & Salon Supplies;
– Cosmetics & Skincare;
– and Machinery, Packaging, Raw Materials & Contract Manufacturing. Beautyworld Saudi Arabia will be open daily from March 21-23 from 11am to 7pm."
L’Oréal and Texen develop a new generation of caps made from 100% recycled PP,"For Biotherm’s new skincare collection, L’Oréal continued with its drive to reduce the environmental footprint of its packaging. As a historic partner for the iconic ‘Blue Beauty’ brand, Texen rose to the eco-design challenge, using a new material that takes decoration well. Texen thus replaced conventional materials, “still rarely managed effectively in their recycled version”, while providing decoration solutions and securing the supply chain. In line with strict specifications, notably on the sourcing of raw materials, the optimization of the industrial process and conformity with norms and regulations, Texen has put all of its industrial experience and know-how into the transformation of sustainable materials and their decoration to help develop this strategic project. Its success is the fruit of a close collaboration between both companies’ teams. This cap can be adapted for different shapes of jar and for men’s and women’s skin care formulas like Cera Repair and Blue Therapy. The visual aspect of the development was particularly important: the pieces are hot-stamped across their whole surface without any overlap, a challenge when using this type of material. The same is true for the brand’s logo, created in reserve, voluntarily leaving the raw material visible in the center. To reduce the environmental footprint, the excellent adherence of the hot stamping on the rPP allowed Texen to avoid the application of protective varnish. “This global eco-design approach, for which the use of rPP is the cornerstone, benefits from the agility of a dedicated automated production line,” added Texen in a statement."
Carbios partners with Indorama Ventures to build PET bio-recycling plant,"French green biotech company Carbios ultimately chose Indorama Ventures, the world’s largest producer of recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) for beverage bottles, to build the very first plant using its PET bio-recycling technology. The plan for the reference plant is to be operational in 2025 at Indorama Ventures’ PET production site in France (Longlaville, Meurthe-et-Moselle) with a processing capacity estimated at ca. 50.000 tons of post-consumer PET waste per year, equivalent to 2 billion PET bottles or 2.5 billion PET trays. It will help to meet the growing needs of both demanding consumers and large consumer goods companies including Carbios’ partners and shareholders (L’Oréal, Michelin, L’Occitane, Nestlé Waters, PepsiCo, Suntory Beverage & Food Europe) for more sustainable packaging. After having successfully started-up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand, Carbios is thus moving one step further towards the industrialization and commercialization of its technology. The capital investment required for the project is expected to be around EUR 150 million for Carbios core technology, including in particular an additional purification step, which has been integrated into the process. In addition, an estimated EUR 50 million investment will be allocated for the infrastructure preparation of the site. Indorama Ventures plans to co-invest in this project and will consider expanding Carbios’ unique biological recycling process at other PET sites for future developments. Named C-ZYME, Carbios’ technology allows to convert PET (the most abundantly used plastic in circulation today, with an estimated global production of 82 million metric tons per year [1]) into its core monomers, which can then be used to manufacture 100% recycled and infinitely recyclable PET. Last year, L’Oréal unveiled the first plastic bottles made from enzymatic recycled material through the techinolgy developed by Carbios."
Avery Dennison launches the first certified portfolio of vegan labels,"Avery Dennison has launched a certified portfolio of vegan labels, which are therefore free from any animal-derived components. Additionally, every item in the portfolio was created without animal testing, or the use of GMOs of animal origin. Because of this, the collection has received approval from Eve Vegan, an independent organization created by Vegan France, which works to promote vegan alternatives in different industries. At the time of launch, there are six paper facestocks, three adhesives and two liners in the collection, and they can be mixed and matched according to customer needs. According to Avery Dennison, each item offers a similar level of performance to non-vegan alternatives in both converting and application. Based on converter and end user needs, there are plans to expand the range with new paper facestocks. “Veganism goes beyond diet,” says Luuk Zonneveld, product manager at Avery Dennison. “It’s a philosophy and way of life centered on avoiding animal exploitation for food, clothing and everything else you can think of. Naturally, this extends into the world of packaging, and we’re excited to help brand owners take their dedication to being cruelty-free to the next level with these innovative labels developed by our R&D team.” The new labels are suitable for the beauty, wine and spirits and food and beverage sectors.

USA: Sales of prestige fragrances reached parity with skincare in 2021,"The fragrance category was the star of the U.S. prestige beauty industry in 2021. Revenue growth outperformed all other beauty categories and, for the first time, fragrance sales reached parity with skincare, according to U.S. retail sales data from The NPD Group. In 2021, US Consumers indulge themselves with fragrances in stronger concentrations and higher-priced luxury brands. As a consequence, the average retail price for fragrances rose by 15% in 2021, versus 2020, after averaging a 5% increase during the two years prior. Both men’s and women’s fragrances added nearly USD 10 more per product, on average, in 2021. According to NPD, fragrance higher average prices are mainly due to a shift toward the purchase of eaux de parfum (EDPs) and parfums, which have a higher percentage of fragrance oils and last longer once applied. This was at the expense of cologne, eau de toilette (EDT), and other products with lower concentrations of fragrance oils. Premium luxury brands and private designer collections also command higher price-points and experienced market share gains in 2021. Fragrance juices priced over USD 175 more than doubled in unit sales for the year. “By purchasing fragrances, consumers can find a pocket of luxury that brings them joy and is a welcome addition to their wellness rituals,” said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. “Given their willingness to trade up to more premium fragrances, consumers are exhibiting the high value they place on this olfactive category.”"

Could the bottle deposit model be revived for greener shopping options?,"In order to reduce packaging waste, French start-up Jean Bouteille is offering consumers the ability to buy liquid products in bulk via returnable glass bottles. Wines, oils, fruit juices, as well as detergents, shampoos and cleaning solutions... Jean Bouteille offers a hundred liquid products through 1400 French stores that have got on board with this possibility to reduce packaging waste, in particular plastic waste. Bulk sales appear as an effective solution for reducing packaging waste. Once announced as one of the main packaging trends in 2020, the growth of in-store refill has been temporarily slowed by the pandemic, in particular for foods. However, as far as hygiene and beauty products are concerned, more and more brands are joining the concept. Nivea, L’Occitane, The Body Shop, Biotherm, for instance, have tested and, sometimes, deployed on a large scale, their own in-store refill solutions in a large variety of retail channels. Founded 2014, Lille, France-based Jean Bouteille offers a standardized and customisable solution, mainly for mass e-retailers. For Gérard Bellet, the founder, the deposit system is an emotional reminder of his childhood. “It disappeared without us realizing, but it is part of our heritage, our recent history, and it has a vintage charm that is liable to improve our daily lives, as well as being an ecological tool.” Jean Bouteille fits out shops with dispensers of oil, wine and vinegar, as well as household and beauty products and, more recently beer and even spirits. In exchange for 1-2 euros, store customers receive an empty bottle, which they can reuse as much as they want and return at any time. In this way, they are reducing their waste while making savings: indeed the packaging represents 20 to 25% of the final cost price of the product. Specific solutions can be developed for brands, including reusable and recyclable plastic bottles for use in bathrooms."
TotalEnergies and Honeywell join forces to develop advanced plastic recycling,"Honeywell and TotalEnergies have announced a strategic agreement to promote the development of advanced plastic recycling. Under this agreement, Honeywell will supply TotalEnergies with recycled polymer feedstock (RPF) using Honeywell’s UpCycle Process Technology at the recently announced Honeywell and Sacyr advanced recycling plant, intended to be built in Andalucía, Spain. TotalEnergies will purchase and convert this raw material into virgin-quality polymers, which could be used for food-grade packaging and other high demanding applications. The UpCycle plant, which will be owned by a joint venture between Honeywell and Sacyr, is planned to process and convert yearly 30,000 tons of mixed plastic waste into RFP, that may otherwise be destined for landfill or incineration. The projected startup of the UpCycle plant is expected in 2023, with RPF to be used for the manufacturing of high-quality polymers in TotalEnergies’ European-based production units. With identical properties to virgin polymers, the recycled polymers are expected to be suitable for a wide range of applications including food-grade applications, such as flexible and rigid packaging containers. This first planned project represents the start of the collaboration between Honeywell and TotalEnergies in the field of advanced recycling. Both parties are committed to addressing the issue of plastic waste and helping to build a more circular and sustainable economy in Europe, and the rest of the world. ""Plastics demand will continue to grow, so it’s critical to create a linkage between waste management and plastics production to strengthen a circular flow of plastics,"" said Ben Owens, vice president and general manager, Honeywell Sustainable Technology Solutions. ""The relationship with TotalEnergies will provide a strong recycled polymer feedstock offtake partner and coupled with our recently announced advanced recycling plant with Sacyr, Honeywell is leading the drive toward a more circular plastics economy."" ""We are pleased to partner with Honeywell to tackle the issue of plastic waste through the development of advanced plastic recycling, and thereby the circular economy, one of the pillars of sustainable development. This project, with a 2023 targeted startup, will contribute to meet our ambition of producing 30% recycled and renewable polymers by 2030,"" said Valérie Goff, Senior Vice President, Polymers at TotalEnergies. Recently, Total has partnered with beauty giant L’Oréal and start-up LanzaTech to produce the first cosmetic plastic bottle made from industrial carbon emissions. LanzaTech captures industrial carbon emissions and converts them into ethanol using a unique biological process, while Total transforms ethanol into ethylene before polymerizing it into polyethylene, and finally L’Oréal uses this polyethylene to produce the plastic packaging."
Baralan strengthens the PCR contents of its PP closures,"The Italian company has launched a new range of closures to offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional virgin polypropylene (PP) components. The closures which have been traditionally made in virgin PP by Baralan, will now be available in three PCR levels: a base level of 30%, an intermediate level of 60% or a full level of 100%. The new range is produced in the company’s facility in Italy. Baralan said this new offer aims to promote a circular economy throughout the cosmetics packaging industry. The varying PCR levels offered will allow brands to maintain their desired level of packaging aesthetics, while also achieving their sustainability goals and meeting the increased consumer demand for sustainable products. “Even customers requiring components with premium aesthetics can still incorporate a certain amount of PCR into their packaging solutions,” said the company. The PCR material can be used with existing moulds and equipment, allowing brands to transition to more sustainable products without having to invest in specialized equipment. “This launch is extremely exciting for us in the sustainability perspective – one that signifies our commitment to developing innovative, yet eco-friendly cosmetics and beauty packaging solutions that meet the high levels of quality our brand customers and end-users expect, while at the same time reducing our environmental impact,” said Maurizio Ficcadenti, Global R&D Manager at Baralan. “While our PCR closures mark our latest shift towards sustainability, in 2022 and beyond our team will be keenly focused on making even more sustainable improvements across our product lines that support a closed-loop system for recycling materials and reducing waste.” For more information on the latest beauty packaging innovations, read our special issue : Beauty Packaging Innovation - February 2022.

The collection has been designed by internationally renowned designer Luca Nichetto. Using faces of statues taken from the Ginori 1735 archives, Nichetto gives them a modern re-interpretation — inspired by colourful ’Lucha Libre’ masks and Jean-Paul Goude’s illustrations. “By combining Classicism with colours, with straight and rigorous lines, the newly composed sculptures acquire a mysterious, almost totemic dimension,” said United Perfumes in a statement. As a distributor and licence holder specializing in luxury home and personal fragrances, United Perfumes is one of the leading players in the home fragrance and fragrance markets.

United Perfumes is both a license holder and distributor working across a portfolio of global luxury lifestyle brands within the home fragrance and fragrance categories. Over time the way that United Perfumes approaches and connects with brands has evolved. “With the new LCDC collection we have worked with the production and commercial teams of Ginori 1735, as well as Luca himself in more of an editorial and advisories capacity, which has contributed to define the final range of the collection that you see today,” added Christopher Yu. With a global distribution network spanning 55 countries, United Perfumes work with the world’s most recognised luxury retailers including department stores, e-tailers, independently owned boutiques, concept stores, perfumeries, and interior design showrooms.
