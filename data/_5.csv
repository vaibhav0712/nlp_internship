Evonik launches new conditioning agent with improved sustainability profile,"In order to address new consumers demands, Evonik is launching a new premium hair conditioning agent. The new active ingredient is an esterquat [1] developed to provide superior manageability, lubricity and softness to the hair, and to help to balance the consumers' desire for a beautiful appearance with the necessity to improve the sustainability profile of the hair care industry Indeed, Varisoft®EQ 100 [2] has been conceived to match new requests from consumers. Actually, Evonik found that most consumers around the world are looking for effective hair conditioning as a tool to maintain attractive and healthy hair and request excellent performance. However, at the same time, consumers are increasingly health and environment conscious. As far as efficiency is concerned, according to the cosmetic ingredients supplier, the new Varisoft®EQ 100 ""outperforms leading market standards in both sensorial evaluations and technical measurements."" In addition to efficiency, Evonik also claims the new Varisoft®EQ 100 has a very good sustainability profile, including: – ready biodegradability, – lower eco-toxicity compared to common benchmark, – cold-processability, – and its primarily renewable, none palm-based feedstock. This new conditioning agent therefore supports ""a more environmentally conscious approach in the cosmetic industry."" Furthermore, Varisoft® EQ 100 is a solvent-free and non-flammable liquid with reduced risk during transport or production, and, increased flexibility during processing. Eventually, Evonik explains Varisoft ® EQ 100 is suitable for a broad range of application formats in the hair care market, including conditioning rinses, hair conditioning sprays and treatments, conditioning shampoos, styling products as well as hair dyes."
Cosmetic ingredients: The latest anti-aging launches,"With two new actives, Epigenist ™ and Lox-Age ™, BASF focuses on the epidermis. The first one is presented as an epidermal rejuvenator, which stimulates the epidermal innervation (neuritogenesis) to help the skin regain the quality of its youth. According to BASF, when applied on the skin, Epigenist™, which is extracted from bambara pea (voandzeia subterranea), can reverse the natural decrease of epidermal innervation. Nerves grow again and, ""the epidermis is thicker and better organised and the proliferation of cells is increased,"" claims the supplier of cosmetic ingredients. Regarding Lox-Age™, an extract of chicory (cichorium intybus) leaves, it is a skin relief perfector. According to BASF, the active is capable of restoring the expression of LOX (lysyl oxidase), a key protein that decreases with age, to a similar level as in young skin. Lox-Age™ contributes to the restoration of youthful skin appearance ""with a clinical efficacy similar to retinol"". With Optim Hyal™, Sederma aims at an optimal of renewal of the hyaluronic acid synthesis. This active contains Glycokines™, specific signaling oligosaccharides that structurally and functionally mimic the hyaluronic fragments found in the skin. According to Sederma, these Glycokines™ have been demonstrated to stimulate the hyaluronic acid synthesis on both keratinocytes and fibroblasts for a visible improvement in skin smoothness, moisture and suppleness in just one month. Silab's Nutripeptides® is a comprehensive anti-aging active ingredient designed to provide a youthful and radiant skin. This active is rich in rice di- and tripeptides that can be rapidly assimilated to offset the skin's nutritional imbalances, boosts its cellular metabolism and increases its defence mechanisms. Tested in vitro in drastic conditions of nutritional deficiency, the active stimulates defence mechanisms in response to stress, strengthens the barrier function, and increases protein synthesis in the dermal-epidermal junction and extracellular matrix. ""The skin is better nourished, toned and radiantly youthful,"" claims Silab. The company is also making a foray in epigenetics, the study of cellular and physiological traits that are heritable by daughter cells and not caused by changes in the DNA sequence. Derived from the calendula flower (Calendula officinalis), Epigenomyl® is a new active that limits modification to the epigenome resulting from the passing of time and external factors. According to Silab, the active allows cutaneous cells to better respond to stress and live longer. To fight time and environmentally induced ageing, Mibelle is launching PerfectionPeptide P7, a biogically active hepta-peptide that stimulates the skin's own self-defence mechanisms against oxidative stress at the cellular level. The active is a competitive inhibitor of the Keap1 repression. Consequently, the transcription factor Nrf2 is constantly present in its active form and arms the skin cells for challenges from any stress caused by oxidants or other reactive chemical species. Clinical and cell culture assays have shown the active ability to reduce DNA damage, UV-induced formation of sunburn cells, and the depletion of Langerhans. In order to ensure its stability, the peptide has been encapsulated into a novel soft sphere carrier system that is based on shea butter."
Cosmetic ingredients: Eco-design at the heart of recent launches,"With GlucoTain®, Clariant offers a range of four new non-ionic surfactants (GlucoTain® Clear, GlucoTain® Clean, GlucoTain® Flex, GlucoTain® Care). These sugar-based surfactants have been functionalized with fatty acids, including RSPO certified palm oil. ""We had been working for four years to develop these high performance products that show great sensorial results in particular in terms of softness and skin tolerance, as well as regarding foaming and conditioning properties and ease of use. Eco-design was also at the heart of development,"" said Boris Segalowitch, sales manager. The products are Ethylene Oxyde (EO)-free, PEG-free and boast a low carbon footprint. Developed both for skin and hair care, GlucoTain® are, according to Clariant, intended to replace betaines, which are widely used in personal care products, which have a low eco-toxicity profile but are questioned as potential sensitizers. The GlucoTain® range also allows the formulation of sulfate-free shampoos and fragrance solubilisation in PEG-free formulas. After seven years of research and two patents filed, Seppic builds on its expertise on lipoamino acids with the launch of Sepisun Flash™, the first pro-pigmenting agent which increases, without sun, the production of melanin by the skin. The active provides a naturally tanned complexion within 15 days with a durable effect. In comparison, a sunless tanner, acts in a few hours, but with a more temporary effect. ""Sepisun Flash™ meets market expectations by combining well-being with effectiveness. It's easy ti use and enables our clients to swiftly adapt to consumer requests for products that give a 'healthy ook' all year round,"" says Carla Perez, Seppic's Functional Active Ingredients Product Manager. The active is made from vegetable raw materials and complies with the twelve principles of green chemistry. With ReGeniStem™ Brightening, a lightening active, Lonza is expanding its range of cosmetic ingredients obtained from plant stem cells. The active inhibits tyrosinase in a manner comparable to the market benchmarks - namely kojic acid, arbutin and hydroquinone - and also presents a collagen boosting effect. According to Lonza, the technology allows to obtain more concentrated molecules of active ingredients while respecting sustainable development, without using solvents and without using a significant amount of raw botanical material, namely licorice."
Skin complexion: Naturex launches natural extracts with high AHA concentrations,"The quest for a radiant, perfect skin complexion, for youthful skin, even without makeup, is shared across all continents, with the Asian market leading the category. The number of new skin care products launched with a radiance claim has been multiplied by six over the last ten years in Asia. Moreover, more than half of the product launches targeting perfect skin complexion carried a ""natural"" claim in 2013. To address this growing demand, Naturex has added a line of alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) to its 'New Radiance' collection of ingredients. AHAs are well-known for their skin smoothing properties. Their exfoliating action removes dead cells, stimulates cell renewal and improves skin hydration. They also act as antioxidant scavengers and protect the skin from oxidative damage. ""Most natural AHAs are only available at relatively low concentrations,"" explains Naturex. However, the French supplier of plant-based natural ingredients has designed extracts of hibiscus (rich in specific hibiscus acids) and cranberry (rich in citric, quinic and malic acids) with concentrations in AHAs reaching up to 45-65%. Special attention has been paid to facilitate the use of AHAs in different formulations. Indeed, derived from anthocyanin-rich hibiscus flowers or cranberry fruits, the organic acids were originally coloured in vivid red. Naturex has worked to separate the anthocyanin from the organic acids in order to adapt them for cosmetic use. The powder and liquid versions of the cranberry and hibiscus AHAs have no impact on the colour of the finished product. ""Moreover, natural organic acids are easily soluble in water. This property presents a significant advantage in terms of formulation, avoiding any crystallization or precipitation in the formula. Thanks to their high solubility, natural organic acids have superior activity and improved bioavailability on the skin,"" claims Naturex."
Croda taps into superfoods for skin and hair care,"Ingredients derived from 'superfood' sources have become increasingly popular and the number of personal care products with claims focused on superfood connotations have more than doubled in the last few years [1]. Capitalizing on this trend, Croda has developed Hydroastivum P and Crodasone P, two new biopolymers that provide functional benefits to final products. Both ingredients are derived from pisum sativum or 'pea' which is popular for its high protein content, unique assortment of phyto-nutrients and antioxidant properties. ""In personal care applications, Pisum sativum provides a rich source of amino acids,"" says the company. In particular, Hydrosativum P and Crodasone P contain high levels of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, argenine and lysine. Proteins adsorb readily onto the surface of skin and hair and are generally hygroscopic, meaning they attract water molecules from the air to act as humectants. Traditionally, hydrolysed proteins such as wheat and silk have been used to impart moisture and conditioning properties to the hair and skin. Hydrosativum P is a new generation highly moisture retentive biopolymer. According to Croda, it exhibits ""powerful moisturisation properties in hair and skin care formulations."" Hydrosativum P has additional anti-irritancy properties ideal for skin and scalp care. Crodasone P is a copolymer designed to defend hair cuticles from heat and styling damage. Due to its complex polymeric structure, Crodasone P cross-links on drying to form a conditioning and protective network. ""Studies have shown that Crodasone P can reduce thermal cracking by 49% in an aqueous spray and 38% in a conditioner system,"" Croda claims. Crodasone P is ideally suited to leave-on styling products or conditioners claiming heat defence but Croda says it can also be used in rinse-off applications to defend the cuticles from damage caused during styling. To illustrate how these ingredients can meet the market needs, Croda has developed a range of formulations packed full of superfoods, such as the ""Super Satin Cooling Lotion"", a cooling skin moisturiser that contains Hydrosativum P and blueberry extract, or the ""Scoopable Hair Souffle"", a nourishing hair mask with a novel texture that contains Crodasone P for cuticle protection, Hydrosativum P to lavish the hair and scalp with moisture and is packed full of superfoods including pomegranate, apple and blueberry."
"""Both the environment and populations must be respected when using Amazonian actives"", Aïna Queiroz, ID bio","Premium Beauty News - What are your ambitions in terms of new developments? Aïna Queiroz - My first mission will be to expand the group's offer in cosmetic actives. I have already worked in research on natural active substances, with new organic targets, and this perfectly matches what the ID bio company is willing to do as a plant extraction specialist: playing a greater role on the natural actives market, thanks to a more diversified offer, and plants with a rich history. Our approach will consist in identifying a plant's potential for skin applications according to its origin, traditional use and phytochemical content. We also intend to go further with our research on the use of plant-derived co-products. Premium Beauty News - Can you already talk about your next launches, the new developments you will present at the In-Cosmetics Brasil show in São Paulo? Aïna Queiroz - Our presence at São Paulo's In-Cosmetics will enable the ID bio group to reinforce its knowledge of this large market. Some extracts have already been developed, and are based on annatto (""urucum"" in Portuguese), a plant that South American Indians used as a sun protection thanks to its bixin, a molecule that is close to beta-carotene. The red-orange colour of its seeds explains why indigenous populations were sometimes called ""red skins"". Likewise, camu camu has caught our research teams' attention for its strong content in vitamin C, one of the most important known to this day. Furthermore, we will also make the most of our presence at the show (G09 stand) by presenting our botanical actives and titrated extracts of the TitrExtract® range, which have already seduced companies in other geographical areas. Premium Beauty News - Thanks to your professional background, you now possess excellent knowledge of the natural actives in South America, especially Amazonia. These are increasingly present and popular in cosmetic products. How do you view this trend? Aïna Queiroz - The South-American biodiversity is so rich, and its ethnobotanical history so fascinating that the cosmetics industry just naturally turned towards it. Now, if this is great news for the economic boom in this geographical area, I am still sensitive to the action taken to limit the depletion of these precious resources and protect the populations that have traditionally been using these plants. Even though it may make a scientist or manufacturer's approach more complex when attempting to decipher their mystery. I definitely back up the use of Amazonian plants in our cosmetic products, provided a certain framework is respected. This is what a few South American countries, such as Peru, are gradually implementing to fight against the extinction of particular species and biopiracy."
Beiersdorf's Eucerin targets sensitive skins with Symrise actives,"""My team studied sensitive skin very carefully in recent years and discovered notable differences from normal skin,"" explains Dr. Gitta Neufang, Head of R&D Medical Management at Beiersdorf. ""Sensitive skin reacts much stronger to irritants,"" she adds. Skin irritation mechanism Beiersdorf's team of researchers thus used capsaicin, the pungent component of black pepper to mimic skin irritation and study its mechanism. The R&D team discovered that when capsaicin is applied to the skin surface it activates a protein on sensory nerve fibre endings, the TRPV1 channel. After bonding, the channel becomes permeable to calcium ions that then flow into the nerve fibres, transferring the irritation further along the fibres until it can be felt. The company then conducted a series of tests to select the active ingredients to best counteract this mechanism. According to Beiersdorf, the best results were achieved with SymSitive, a generation of active ingredients developed by German supplier Symrise. ""We have tested a series of ingredients to see if they can prevent this calcium stream caused by capsaicin and the irritation that results from it,"" Neufang explains. ""SymSitive was clearly the best. When used nerve fibres hardly reacted at all and the irritation was not transferred further."" Further studies conducted by the firm on test subjects confirm that SymSitive has a calming effect on very sensitive skin. ""The prickling or burning sensation of the skin from the irritant capsaicin is soothed just minutes after using SymSitive-containing products or doesn't even occur when SysmSitive is used beforehand,"" Beiersdorf says. Beiersdorf used the result of the research to develop the new Eucerin UltraSENSITIVE and AntiREDNESS lines, which hit store shelves this summer. ""The skin's irritation threshold is increased and skin discomfort disappears permanently,"" the company claims."
Kao finds a natural enzyme to produce sustainable surfactants,"Algae are one of the major fields of investigation of Kao's research program on advanced sustainable use biomass, conducted at the company's Eco Technology Research Centre in Wakayama, Japan. The Japanese cosmetics maker recently announced to have found how some algae can produce a large number of C12 to 14 medium chain fatty acids and to have identified the enzyme that plays a key role within the process. These fatty acids are the main components of natural fats and oils, such as palm kernel oils and coconut oils, which are raw materials for surfactants in detergents or shampoos. Additionally, as a first in the field of algae, the company identified a novel acyl-ACP thioesterase with high specificity to medium chain fatty acids from the genus Nannochloropsis. The Japanese company expects that these findings will dramatically accelerate the breeding development of algae for large-scale production of medium chain fatty acids thus providing a large source of fats and oils that are ""natural and not consumed as food"". Kao therefore intends to pursue technological development in this field, with the aim to achieve industrial production. According to the company, algae would be potentially more than ten times more productive than the most efficient alternative natural sources of fats and oils, such as oil palms. These results will be presented at the 1st Asian Conference on Oleo Science, which will be held on September 8 to 10, 2014 in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."
Induchem brings visual spheres into a new dimension,"The Unispheres® XS range is an extension of Induchem's line of 3D visual carriers, which consists in spherical beads from cellulose and sugars and already includes: – Unispheres Original. Spheres that have the property of transforming to a soft and crushable bead in the finished product that disappears with a gentle rub without leaving any shell residue on skin or hair. – Unispheres Natural. The Ecocert certified range. – Unispheres Luxury. Containing gemstones and precious metal. – Unispheres Bicolor. Beads composed of a thick white coating that completely covers the colour of the core which is released upon application and transforms a white cream to a tinted one while leaving no residue during application. The new generation consists in extra small spherical beads of regular size and particle distribution. Their diameter is of 0.2 to 0.5 mm. ""At only 0.3% they create an outstanding colourful visual effect in any kind of transparent water based formula (shampoos, shower gels, serums, gels, lotions, deodorants, toothpastes),"" Induchem claims. ""The cosmetic industry is steadily looking for new visual elements increasing the attractiveness of their products. This is a direct answer to studies showing that consumers are naturally attracted first by the look of the products on the shelves. Unispheres® XS, due to their amazingly small size, create a new visual dimension which enables an instant visual differentiation of cosmetic products in beauty shops,"" explains Fabrice Lefèvre, Global Scientific Marketing Manager, Induchem. The Unispheres XS visual carriers will be launched in five colours: – Flamboyant red, – Powerful green, – Intense yellow, – Pure white, – Deep blue. Furthermore, they are loaded with vitamin E, a well-known anti-oxidant for the skin. As the other items in the line they are eco friendly, due to their composition made of cellulose (the most abundant natural polymer on Earth) and sugars, and do not contain preservatives."
The quest for green actives boosts cosmetic innovations,"Eager to find sustainable alternatives to oil-based synthetic ingredients, suppliers have diversified extraction and production processes. While plant materials were the traditional source of green actives, novel substances are now finding their way from food ingredients or marine sources. ""These novel actives are creating new mechanisms for anti-ageing, anti-inflammation, sebum control, skin moisturisation and related applications. Hair care uses of green actives include hair growth promotion, hair loss prevention and anti-dandruff,"" Organic Monitor highlights. New sustainable extraction and processing methods are providing fertile ground for new green actives. For instance, plant stem cell technology is enabling IRB Tech (Croda) and Mibelle Biochemistry to develop novel actives from rare and endangered plant species. Since the actives are produced from plant cells in a laboratory, they have a significantly lower environmental footprint than traditionally harvested actives. Adoption rates are expected to rise as ingredient firms benefit from scale production. Marine actives are also gaining popularity as formulators look to the oceans and seas for inspiration. Sources include fish oils and fluids, coastal plants, seaweed, sea minerals and algae. According to Organic Monitor, ""ingredient companies like Heliae are focusing on algae because of its high rate of regeneration. Unlike fish and agricultural sources, algae feedstock is also less prone to supply fluctuations giving price stability. The French firm BiotechMarine has developed a range of 80 active ingredients, extracts and stem cells from marine sources."" Actives from food ingredients continue to find new cosmetic applications. Many product developers are using superfoods - such as açaí berries, goji berries, pomegranates and green tea - because of their high level of antioxidants. The trend is leading some brands to develop entire ranges based on food ingredients; examples include Skin Food and Yes to Inc. However, Organic Monitor also found that the use of these novel green actives is bringing fresh formulation challenges. ""Product stability and preservation are major issues, especially if brands want to develop natural or organic personal care products. Differences between standards on accepted and prohibited ingredient sources, synthesis methods, and formulations are also creating technical hurdles."" The growing use of green actives in cosmetic formulations will be featured in upcoming Organic Monitor events. Sustainable Cosmetics Summit North America (15-16th May, New York) and Natural Cosmetics Masterclass (25 June, Paris) will have dedicated workshops on green actives. Practical guidance will be given to formulators and product developers looking at using novel green actives in cosmetic formulations."
Greentech strengthens its expertise in biotech actives,"The latest edition of the in-cosmetics show in Hamburg put ""green"" cosmetic ingredients under the spotlights, including products obtained from environmental-friendly extraction methods, ingredients derived from renewable resources, or obtained from biotech processes providing an alternative to oil-based chemistry. For Greentech, a French supplier of cosmetic actives derived from plants, algae, micro-algae and biotechnologies, the event was an opportunity to showcase its extensive know-how in this field. The company, headquartered close to Clermont-Ferrand, in the centre of France, thus presented two new classes of ingredients obtained by biotechnologies: – The Ferment'actives developed using a customized and controlled fermentation process to naturally enhance functionality, increase efficacy and develop new activities. – A new variety of soft butters, the GTB series that have auto-emulsion capacities and higher feel sensory. The Ferment'Actives are active ingredients stem from an original process in cosmetic area: the fermentation. Actually, Greentech intends to increase developments thanks to the use of biotechnologies. ""This process of fermentation increases the concentration of active molecules, maximises the biological activity and/or creates new biological activities,"" explains the company. Greentech already offers three Ferment'Actives: – Protection Ferment'Active Goji, where polyphenol protective compounds are three times higher than a simple goji extract. – Brightening Ferment'Active Raspberry, highly concentrated in lactic acid (38 times higher than a simple raspberry extract, according to Greentech) for a ""shining "" activity on skin and hair. – Anti-ageing Ferment'Active Pomegranate, wih an antioxidant power boosted by a factor of 1.5. The GreenSofts represent a second generation of Soft Butters. They are 3-in-1 actives that can be used as: self-emulsifiers, lipidic compounds for oily phase (and can constitute up to 100%) and boosters of biological activity. ""They give a soft silky touch and a very nice texture to formulations,"" says Greentech. To date, there are seven GreenSofts offering the biological activities of traditional vegetable oils. However, three of them have been tested on volunteers: – GreenSoft 336 Camelina, provides a strong improvement in the immediate skin moisturization (62%) and particularly after 8h (+24%), – GreenSoft 251 Inca Inchi allows a 66% increase in skin flexibility (at a concentration of 5%) and 90% of volunteers felt a repairing effect on the hair after a single use (in a conditioner and a concentration at 2%), – GreenSoft® 461 Camellia brings strong improvement and maintain in skin moisturization after 24h (+24%). Greentech adds that new GreenSofts can be created on request. In the range Probiophytes, also obtained by biotechnologies, Greentech has presented Probiophyte Fresh, a new active to counteract body odours (foot, axilla) by inhibiting bacteria that cause odours while preserving commensal bacteria that are necessary for the skin to protect against external attacks. Finally, Greentech has presented new in vivo tests on hair and nails on two of the company's oils: – Babassu oil, which has smoothing and styling effects on hair and also provides repairing and smoothing effects on nails. – Apricot oil, which has coating and protective effects on hair fibber.

Solvay suggests to use silica for replacing plastic beads in cosmetics,"Solvay Silica has introduced an eco-friendly grade of its Tixosil® range of highly dispersible silica products, designed to substitute plastic beads in exfoliating body wash, facial cleanser and other specialised personal care formulations. The product is supplied in micropearl form as a replacement for plastics polyethylene (PE) beads, which have recently raised environmental concerns due to their potential pollution hazard when leaking from municipal waste water treatment plants. ""Tixosil® MicroPearl Silica is a non-dusting, environmentally safe and sustainable alternative to plastic beads,"" says Francesca Peditto, Application Manager at Solvay Silica. ""In exfoliating formulations for personal care, it combines equivalent performance with cost-saving benefits, such as superior dispersion in aqueous solutions, a wide scope for the inclusion of actives, lower surfactant concentration and reduced texturing agent usage."" Solvay, which operates manufacturing, research and innovation facilities on four continents, produces its highly dispersible silicas in a precipitation process essentially using sand as a raw material, which is the most abundant mineral present in the crust of the earth. Tixosil® is odourless, chemically inert and considered non-hazardous in manufacture, transportation, handling and application. ""The product range already has a proven fit in oral care and nutrition applications where it must meet the strict provisions of FDA and HACCP regulations. When a leading personal care and cosmetics manufacturer was seeking to replace plastic beads in their body scrub and cleansing products, Tixosil® MicroPearl Silica provided a highly effective and eco-friendly solution. It is commercially available from eight production sites in the Americas, Europe and Asia, all adhering to the same specifications of quality and consistency to serve the growing needs of global customers,"" concludes Delphine Hugenot, Commercial Director for Solvay Silica in Europe. Several cosmetic manufacturers, including giants such as Unilever and L'Oréal, have already announced they would stop using plastic microbeads in their products. Furthermore, legislators in California and in New York have introduced bills to ban these substances."

in-cosmetics: greener than ever?,"The cosmetic industry is not slowing down its efforts in sustainable development, far from that! While formulating cosmetics or perfumes using only plant substances usually remains a real challenge, the palette of green materials has expanded considerably in recent years and the new products that will be launched at the next in-cosmetics tradeshow, which will be held in Hamburg, Germany, on 1-3 April 2014, will just confirm the trend. In such a context, the choice to highlight Brazil during this edition is not only due to the launch of in-cosmetics Brasil (09 and 10 September 2014, Sao Paulo) but also to the growing importance of the Brazilian biodiversity as a key source of natural substances for the global cosmetics industry. The in-cosmetics organisers have also launched a Green Ingredient Award competition, in partnership with Organic Monitor. The award will honour a raw material or ingredient that makes a significant environmental or social difference in the area of sustainability. The competition garnered more than 50 entrants! The 10 finalists were selected by an expert panel of judges including Dr. Pauline Hili, founder and technical director, Neal's Yard Remedies, Katharina Post, head galenic development NOC, Weleda, Dr. Erik Schulze zur Wiesche, basic development hair care, Henkel, Amarjit Sahota, president Organic Monitor and Judi Beerling, technical director, Organic Monitor.

Perfumery: The secrets of French mimosa,"""Mimosa is still a perfumer's mainstay,"" says Sebastien Plan of Robertet, a major international supplier of the raw ingredients that go into perfumes. However, mimosa's heady fragrance, which enjoyed a heyday from the 1950s through the '70s, is used in tiny amounts today. Modern perfumes tend to be ""subtler, with a good, clean and smooth"" effect, says the expert. From a harvest of around 40 tonnes of flowers, Robertet produces some 400 kilos (880 pounds) of a rock-like substance called ""concrete"" - which is in turn purified into about 100 kilos of ""absolute"". Eventually, the mimosa ""absolute"" proves costly for perfumers, who can opt for synthetic alternatives or can also buy cheaper Indian mimosa, which goes directly to Grasse in the form of ""concrete"". Jean-Pierre Roux, the boss of the Grasse perfumery Galimard, pays tribute to this ""symbol of the Grasse terroir"" by distilling the flowers into a refreshing cologne, popular with visitors who come to see the mimosas in bloom. Galimard's perfumer Caroline de Boutiny admits that its mimosa scent is more popular with older customers than with the young. The strong mimosa absolute is little used in modern fragrances, but it can ""lend weight to a composition with its honeyed and powdered notes"", she said. Luxury perfume brands Kenzo and Guerlain use it for this quality in their toilet waters, de Boutiny said. The mimosa tree arrived in France from Australia in the mid-19th century as a decorative plant for gardens and still forms a luxurious forest on the Tanneron hills west of Grasse. ""Mimosa is like velvet,"" says Gilbert Vial, an 85-year-old ""mimosist"" who has never left the town of Tanneron. This year, he said, the blossoms have only flowered for a brief period. To lengthen the season, local mimosa growers first plant the mirandole variety, which flowers in December and January, followed by the rustica and gaulois varieties, which bloom in February and March. Yet the declining use of the flowers in the fragrance industry is being felt here. Vial's 60-year-old son is the last in line to harvest the steep slopes of the family's six hectares (15 acres). ""Before the frost of 1956, thirty families grew mimosa in Tanneron. Today there are just three or four of us,"" he said.

"""Parabens will make their return in cosmetics,"" Bertrand L'Homme, Thor Personal Care","Premium Beauty News - Cosmetics Europe has asked manufacturers to stop using Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) in leave-on cosmetics. For its part, the European Commission should soon limit their use. What will be the consequences of these actions? Bertrand L'Homme - The first consequence is that this substance will be removed from the market. Especially since other countries will follow the European example. Without prejudging the European decisions, we can legitimately anticipate that MIT will no longer be used in leave-on products. For rinse-off products, its use will probably be limited. In all cases, this will result, for manufacturers, in a reduction of their room for manoeuvre, in terms of protection of their formulas against micro-organisms. The range of preservatives available being increasingly reduced by regulations, but also by the limitations that brands - for reasons of marketing and competition - impose themselves. MIT was therefore an alternative to the use of parabens, which are, may I recall, not subject to any ban but simply partially restricted. Today there are more than 50 substances on the list of preservatives authorized in cosmetic products in Europe. In practice, only a dozen are commonly used, and many are in decline or will be limited. On the one hand, this focus on a limited number of substances mechanically increases the risk of allergies and, secondly, it causes a phenomenon of adaptation of micro-organisms and the creation of dangerous bio-films in production. Premium Beauty News - It is true that preservatives have a bad press! Bertrand L'Homme - Indeed there are an increasing number of products claiming being ""preservative-free."" In some markets, like Korea, it has almost become a standard. But in practice, what is underlying behind these claims? Most often, the use of so-called ""alternative"" substances that are not officially listed as preservatives, but have a similar effect. Premium Beauty News - Preservatives who are not called by that name? Bertrand L'Homme - A preservative is defined as a natural or synthetic substance, whose main function is to protect the product against the development of micro-organisms. These ""alternatives"" consist in using substances that do not have as a primary function to protect the product, but yet, also have this characteristic. From my point of view, if we only use so-called alternative substances featuring secondary preservatives effects to be able to boast preservative-free claims, we might find ourselves in an awkward legal position. Premium Beauty News - Beyond the legal aspect, isn't there a safety issue too? Bertrand L'Homme - In any case we can question ourselves. We don't always have much perspective on these alternatives, which can be used without any concentration limits. We are beginning to see irritation and sensitization issues with substances like sorbic acid or sorbitol. The justification of the positive list of preservatives is the control of these substances. To place a preservative on the market, robust files must be provided. We don't always have as many guarantees with the alternatives. But we must also recognize that today, the ban on animal testing has complicated things. In this context, presenting a scientific file for a new preservative is almost impossible, legally and technically speaking. This partly explains the drift of giving another main function to an ingredient with preservative properties. Premium Beauty News - Purely physical solutions also exist to protect formulas! Bertrand L'Homme - These solutions are starting to become really operational. They involve combining processes enabling to decontaminate formulas, to condition them with no risk of recontamination in protective packagings. Delivering such results has a cost, which can be supported in some segments but not in mass-market. Premium Beauty News - So, what are your recommendations? Bertrand L'Homme - First, we recommend our customers to continue using the available and legal molecules. Then to sparingly and cautiously test alternative substances. From a legal point of view and from the point of view of technical efficiency and of safety, the soundest solution is to keep on using a preservative listed in formulas and, if required, to boost it with a non-listed substance. Finally, more generally, I think that the protection should be adapted to the real needs of the formula and diversified. The need for protection of each formula must be assessed, this is also part of the services we offer. The market has trapped itself. I am personally convinced that parabens will make their return."
Greentech: a botanical alternative to zinc pyrithione,"On the occasion of the latest Cosmetagora tradeshow, which was held in Paris on 14-15 January 2014, France-based supplier of active ingredients, Greentech has presented a botanical-derived ingredient that is claimed to be active against dandruffs within 72 hours. Launched a few months earlier, Dandrilys is a complete dandruffs reducer agent, which has been developed from the bark of Ziziphus joazeiro, a tree native from Northeastern Brazil. ""In Brazil, bark and leaves of Ziziphus joazeiro are used in traditional medicine for external application to cleanse hair and teeth, and to whiten facial skin thanks to their foaming properties. Also, Ziziphus joazeiro is traditionally employed for antidandruff hair care,"" says Greentech. According to Greentech, around 50% of world population is suffering from dandruffs. Dandruff appearance is due to abnormal desquamation of cells of epidermis at scalp level. Proliferation of the fungi Malassezia enhances the phenomenon since it provokes inflammations as very unpleasant itching, irritations or sebum excess... Also, many factors can favour dandruff appearance as stress, hormones unbalance, excessive sudation, repeated aggressions to scalp (strong detergent, hair dye, perm hair)... In vivo and in vitro tests conducted by Greentech show that Dandrilys is as efficient as zinc pyrithione, a well-known antidandruff molecule. This efficacy is, according to Greentech, due to the high concentration of Dandrilys in sapponins. In addition, tests showed that Dandrilys contributes to reduce inflammation as irritations and itching. Data revealed that Dandrilys decreases both: the release of itching mediator (histamine) and the activity of enzyme involved in irritations (5-LOX). Auto-evaluations also show that Dandrilys is more appreciated by volunteers than Zinc pyrithione. Another advantage of Dandrilys, according to Greentech, is that it is very soft and even with a soothing effect, and can therefore be used in daily shampoos and not as a limited treatment."
ID bio combines its ingredients for all-in-one products,"According to ID bio, multifunctional ingredients that claim too much functions have lost a part of their credibility. However, that does not mean the end of multifunctional cosmetic products themselves. ""In our fast moving world, the idea is to make consumers turn towards multi-functional cares allowing to save time and increase efficiency,"" highlights Alexia Machado Forestier, marketing and communication manager. ""However, consumers are not only looking for a special ingredient in a beauty formula but they are interested by an alliance of botanical ingredients that enable to end up with a complete and efficient care in one application."" To address this trend, the French supplier of natural ingredients is launching ID Concepts: a combination of several botanical ingredients to address specific beauty concepts. In order to illustrate some of the possibilities, ID bio has developed three examples of formulations based on the concepts of: – cocooning (a feelgood face mask, based on cotton flower extract, titrated extract of marshmallow and date oily macerate), – perfect complexion (a thirst-quenching jelly based on Mandarin extract, ""ID'Clat"" and ""Cell'intact"") – night's dream (an after make-up removal night emulsion based on Gold extract, ""Mang'inTense"" and ""Pepsobiol PF"") Ideal against the «morning rush» of urban/modern consumers that do not underestimate efficiency, those skincare products that contain various synergetic ingredients can be adapted to various applications (skin care, hair care, make-up, etc) and combined in parallel industries (cosmetotextile, wipes, etc) ""The main advantage of «combinology» lies in the creation of a complete and active formula, supported by reassuring concepts and well-known claims,"" says Alexia Machado Forestier. An additional advantage from working with new combinations of already well-known materials: the simplification of regulatory procedures!"
Seppic launches a new 100% natural solubilizer,"Sepiclear G7 (proposed INCI name: heptyl glucoside) is a concentrated non-ionic (electrically neutral) surfactant that is readily biodegradable, obtained in compliance with the 12 green-chemistry principles. It is derived from sugar (sourced from corn or wheat starch) and castor-seeds, with sources 100% of vegetal origin (certified by the Association Chimie du Végétal). It can be delivered in a solid form (more than 70% dried extracts) thus contributing to the reduction its carbon footprint during transport. Sepiclear G7 solubilises lipophilic - and therefore hydrophobic - compounds, notably essential oils, perfumes and vitamin E, in aqueous media. ""As a natural solubilizer, Sepiclear G7, meets the growing need of firms in the cosmetics industry for substances to replace artificially synthesised ingredients,"" Seppic says. Furthermore, unlike other natural solubilizers, it does not produce foam, which is a fundamental point in formulating cosmetic products such as toners, toiletries and aqueous gels. Being a liquid and cold processable, it is easy to use and energy-efficient. ""The arrival of Sepiclear G7 in the solubilizer range once again demonstrates Seppic's commitment to green chemistry and sustainable development, and it enables us to support customers with such priorities in their eco-responsibility initiative,"" as Lucie Maisonneuve, Product Manager, underlines. The product has, moreover, won the Pierre Potier prize, awarded in recognition of innovation in sustainable chemistry. This prize was created by France's Ministry of Economics, Finance and Industry, in collaboration with the FFC (French Chemical Sciences Federation) and the UIC (the country's chemical-industry association), in 2006. The aim of the prize is to highlight chemical-industry initiatives favouring sustainable development and the development of eco-responsible practices in the sector. The list of 2013 Pierre Potier prizewinners was released by the Ministry of Economics, Industry and Employment on 10 September, in the presence of Arnaud Montebourg, the Minister of Industrial Renewal."
From the sea to the skin,"Among the multiplicity of marine actives there are substances of animal origin like marine collagen, very rich in amino acids, that penetrates quickly in the skin, marine elastin, a protein found in connective tissues of certain fish species, that provides elasticity to tissues and helps slow down their ageing, marine DNA, extracted from salmon milt, that plays an active role in the synthesis of protein in the basal layer of the epidermis and which is a perfect moisturiser and cell repairer. The sea also offers many mineral actives, starting with seawater, which has astringent and tonic properties thanks to its content in minerals and trace elements. Sea salt, also, offers an incomparable richness in trace elements and can enter in the composition of various cosmetic products, particularly in those with an exfoliating action or products recommended for peeling. Extracted from seawater, marine magnesium is known to boost skin tone, helping to regulate and optimize the energy capacity of cells. The skin has a renewed tonicity and strength. It is nourished and protected, sustainably. On the side of plant actives, algae are getting increasing attention. Species diversity and a high available biomass across the oceans make it a huge resource. Where does their richness come from? Algae have the particularity of experiencing similar stresses to those of the skin, in often much higher proportions: regular dehydration (tides), attacks from UV radiations, thermal stress (air/water), oxidation, bacterial attacks (wetland), the change in seasons, and shocks against rocks (mechanical protection / healing). The study of algae's protection strategies opens up a vast field of research in the area of cosmetic actives. Algae contain 75% of organic matter among which mineral salts and trace elements. Among the most valuable: anti-infective sulphur, slimming iodine... On the side of vitamins, they contain vitamins A, D and E, not to mention their high content in proteins and amino acids. The singular advantage of algae, in particular of macroalgae, compared to other natural cosmetic raw materials stands in their ""skin-compatibility"". They do not, indeed, present any specific dermal toxicity and are perfectly compatible with skin tissues. Another plus, algae can also meet demand for organic cosmetics. Under certain conditions, including water quality and harvest sustainability [1] wild algae harvested in their natural environment can claim in Europe, to organic certification. In the past thirty years, algal ingredients have boomed in cosmetics. The richness of these algae in polysaccharides of various structures, the multitude of molecules derived from the polymerization of these macromolecules are paving the way for new original actives. To only name a few, the most commonly used are: – Phycolloïdes, who have quickly conquered the market: thanks to their texturing properties they are excellent gelling agents, thickeners and formula stabilizers. – Algal polysaccharides, highly appreciated for their rheological properties. Algae thereby find their place in topical daily skin care applications, cosmetic institutes and spas. Driven by the craze for naturalness and the search for sustainable industries, a bright future undoubtedly lies ahead of algae and other marine ingredients, in the cosmetic industry.

Symrise launches a new natural tanner derived from marine microalgae,"Tanning is a complex issue in European and American markets. ""Being tanned is still much regarded a symbol of a healthy and active lifestyle making it a beauty goal for many. At the same time, consumers show elevated awareness of the risks associated with UV exposure,"" explains Symrise. The main consequence is an increased demand for biological tanners that support the skin's natural capability to produce the tanning pigment melanin or provide a natural tan combined with an efficient skin protection. To address this demand, the Germany-based supplier of cosmetic active ingredients has launched a new a natural tanner, SymBronze 1659, which is derived from a marine water microalgae [1]. A ""natural, sustainable and renewable source"" for this ingredient that ""reliably enhances the pigmentation of the skin that can be used in many cosmetic applications like sunless self-tanning creams as well as products to prepare the skin for the bikini season"", Symrise says. Actually, Symrise has tested SymBronze 1659 efficacy as both a sunless self-tanner and a tan accelerator during UV exposure. ""SymBronze 1659 significantly decreases the tanning time. Without exposure to UV rays, SymBronze 1659 provides a most natural looking tan. The effect actually lasts longer and looks much more natural than that of traditional self-tanners on the market. In after sun products it prolongs the tan. In combination with sun filters, its safe base-tan helps minimizing the risks associated with long-term sunbathing,"" the company claims. With this product, Symrise addresses several consumer concerns simultaneously, including naturality and sustainably, as well as tanning and increased protection against the harmful effects of UV rays. ""We see plenty of potential in this versatile approach and will come up with more inspiring ideas in the future,"" says Dr. Marielle Le Maire, Global Product Director Cosmetic Ingredients at Symrise."
SEPPIC: a new multipurpose active agent for the skin and hair,"A true glycine and sugar biovector, Fluidipure 8G [1] facilitates their transport within the skin, thus aiding in limiting the proliferation of microorganisms on the skin and in formulations. ""Its anionic structure (negative electric charge) prevents the adhesion of microbial biofilms,"" SEPPIC says. According to SEPPIC, Fluidipure 8G helps tp restore the cutaneous ecosystem whilst also preserving the integrity of sensitive skins. When used in haircare, it reduces dandruff, calms scalp irritation and decreases the production of sebum in 3 to 6 shampoo washes. An in vivo test performed by SEPPIC on 40 volunteers presenting seborrheic dermatitis has shown the efficacy of a shampoo containing 10% Fluidipure 8G, used a minimum of every 3 days. The test shows that in only 10 shampoo washes, Fluidipure 8G eliminates redness and soothes the irritated scalp. Furthermore, Fluidipure 8G participates in reducing hair and body odor. As a biomimetic acidifying agent, it helps attacked skin to regain its physiological acidic pH so ensuring its integrity. Lastly, the addition of 5% Fluidipure 8G, in combination with sorbic acid, protects formulations against microbial proliferation. [2] ""Fluidipure 8G offers rare multipurpose efficacy, coupled with real ease of use. It is readily incorporated into deodorants, hygiene products, greasy-skin products, preservative-free formulations, etc. Its liquid form, its efficacy and its affordable formulation cost make this active agent an obvious advantage for our clients. It finally affords a solution to the strong worldwide demand for purifying active agents,"" concludes Carla Perez, SEPPIC's Head of Functional Active Products. SEPPIC offers Fluidipure 8G in liquid and transparent form so as the active can be more readily incorporated into various types of cosmetic care or hygiene products, including processes performed without heating."
Naturex launches new range of botanical oils sourced from the world's biodiversity,"To better address market trends, Naturex offers a range of 13 botanical oils with various properties and meeting strict specifications, both in terms of quality and in terms of sustainability. The range includes well-known oils such as argan oil (Morocco) as well as other more innovative oils, such as Sacha Inchi oil (Peru), Marula oil (South Africa) or the Ungurahi oil (Peru). Already an expert in apricot or cranberry, Naturex has secured a global sourcing focusing on quality and durability for all the other products in the range. In order to select the oils featured in the range and set up the supply chains, Naturex relied on the expertise of ethnobotanist Chris Khilham, which has been appointed as Naturex's ""sustainability ambassador"". ""To be included in the range, the oils had to meet three criteria: availability, efficiency and a manageable environmental and social impact,"" he said. Naturex's global network of buyers and agricultural experts has also largely contributed to the project, in particular in selecting producers supplying the highest qualities. ""Our agronomic experts worked closely with local growers, implementing strict control processes and careful documentation to ensure high traceability of crops. We have developed strong partnerships in order to preserve and encourage biodiversity and guarantee fair wages to local populations through their own organizations,"" said Personal Care business unit director Stéphanie Puel. To formalize its commitment, Naturex will be donating 1% of the sales generated by its NAT oleis range back to the planet and communities where the botanical oils are sourced. The funds collected could, for instance, help to buy new presses in isolated villages in Africa or replant trees in the Amazon rainforest. Naturex said that all oils in the NAT oleis range have undergone a strict and rigorous cold-press process for extracting the oil from the kernel or the fruit. This eco-friendly method does not involve the use of organic solvents and preserves the actives. The group is also able to offer several organic references thanks to the COSMOS certification of its Avignon site in France. In order to preserve the properties of these oils and improve the stability and shelf life of the most sensitive ones, Naturex has also developed a set of natural antioxidant solutions. ""For instance, this proprietary process shows exceptional results for Tsubaki oil, whose resistance to oxidation is multiplied by 29,"" the company stated. As far as the oils' cosmetic efficacy is concerned, Naturex has compiled all the scientific references available. The company also conducted several clinical studies for some them. The oils' sensorial characteristics were also mapped according to three criteria: wetness, absorbency, and greasiness. Naturex has also conducted clinical trials for some of them, especially to test their smoothing capacity and their effectiveness in reducing wrinkles. ""Each botanical oil has a unique composition in fatty acids (monounsaturated and essential) and unsaponifiable compounds and offers different benefits for hair and skin care. For example, the richness in oleic acid of Ungurahui oil makes it the perfect ingredient for repairing dry skin and hair,"" explained the company. The NAT oleis range will be showcsed at the next Sustainable Cosmetics Summit in Paris (21-23 October 2013) and at In Cosmetics Asia in Bangkok (29-31 October 2013)."
Merck addresses skin tone concerns with two new ingredients,"These additions to Merck's RonaCare range of active ingredients address different skin concerns of Western and Asian societies. Whereas RonaCare Bronzyl creates an even, natural-looking tan, RonaCare Pristine Bright produces a flawless, porcelain-like complexion. Both products are based on patent-protected compounds discovered and developed in-house by Merck. The two new active ingredients take into account different, and in some cases, culturally-driven preferences. Indeed, while sun-tanned skin remains a beauty ideal in western societies, light-coloured skin is particularly prized in Asian cultures. However, common to both is the desire to prevent signs of skin aging - an effect that both ingredients offer. RonaCare Bronzyl, which will be marketed predominantly in Europe and the United States, stimulates the production of melanin and activates the natural tanning process. ""Both effects inhibit skin aging caused by exposure to UV radiation,"" says Merck. The company has performed studies on human tissue cultures that showed that the application of RonaCare Bronzyl contributed to a significant, 43% increase in melanin in the basal layer after ten days. ""The market segment for cosmetic active ingredients that use a biological mode of action to allow the body to tan is still very new. We are convinced that this technologically sophisticated segment will see strong growth in the coming years and we look forward to helping to shape it,"" says Michael Weiden, Head of the Functional Materials business field at Merck. Merck's other recent launch, RonaCare Pristine Bright, provides the exact opposite effect as it prevents the skin from tanning, decreases hyper-pigmentation and freshens skin colour. Merck will market it using the slogan ""Skin goes porcelain."" Merck says RonaCare Pristine Bright will help it to tap into a market growing at an annual average rate of five percent. ""Since competing active ingredients often have insufficient toxicological safety and a tendency toward instability and discoloration in formulations, modern ingredients are in high demand in the cosmetics industry,"" explains Merck. Merck has assessed the efficacy of RonaCare Pristine Bright in one ex vivo and three in vivo studies that have demonstrated its capacity to inhibit tyrosinase - an enzyme that plays an important role in the formation of the natural skin pigment melanin. ""Due to its excellent efficacy, low application concentrations suffice to achieve the desired effect,"" says the company."
Beraca's new Brazilian ingredients hit the market,"Beraca believes that in the wake of the worldwide success of argan oil, Brazil's murumuru butter is set to show great promise for hair care products. ""Its natural approach to nourishing and revitalizing the hair fibre has caught the attention of cosmetic giants and has been gaining new fans every day,"" says the Brazilian supplier of natural raw materials. Thus, murumuru butter was used as the key active in L'Oréal's recently launched Absolut Control hair care range, which features six different hair care products and is sold exclusively in Brazilian hair salons. A true success in Brazil, the line has just announced a new addition to its portfolio - the Amazonian Oil to help taming rebellious hair, to provide anti-frizz control and to nourish hair - and is set to reach out to new markets, starting by Japan. The ingredient is extracted from the seed of the murumuru (Astrocaryum murumuru), a palm tree typical from the Amazon region. Rich in lauric, myristic and oleic acid, murumuru butter is a powerful emollient agent, which nourishes and moisturizes the hair and skin. When used in hair care products, it has an anti-frizz effect, reducing hair volume and providing softness and shine. Managing Director of the Professional Products Division at L'Oréal Brasil, Maya Colombani says it is the first time that the company uses murumuru butter as a core ingredient in its products. ""We wanted to launch a revolutionary range by merging nature and technology, which would be able to fully meet the needs of Brazilian women, the world's most demanding consumers when it comes to hair,"" she says. According to a research conducted by the French group, 47% of Brazilian women claim to have thick, rebellious hair; and 76% out of those would like to reduce hair volume and frizz. Murumuru butter is also one of the main ingredients of Surya Brazil new Ecocert certified body and face care line, Sapien Women. A leading natural, organic and vegan beauty brand in Brazil, Surya offers a line of products formulated with natural ingredients sourced from the Brazilian biodiversity. In addition to murumuru butter, products in the Sapien Women line features ingredients such as white clay, pracaxi oils, açai and buriti. Beraca wants to become a bridge between Amazonian communities and cosmetic brands, while promoting sustainable access to resources through responsible collection and harvest. The murumuru butter supplied by Beraca is manufactured through partnerships with local communities working. In the region of Bragança, state of Pará, more than 100 families are involved in the activity, which contributes to regional development and is an important source of income for the local people. ""In order to provide sustainable ingredients to the cosmetic industry, Beraca tracks each and every stage of the supply chain, from sourcing to delivering,"" says Daniel Sabará, Managing Director at Beraca. ""We are committed to the process of empowering local communities, aiming to increase their opportunities in the market while contributing to the conservation of the world's largest rainforest."""
Clariant launches new range of preservative blends to replace parabens,"Clariant, a Switzerland-based manufacturer and supplier of chemical specialities, carries on its research and development on alternatives to parabens, with the aim to help decreasing the quantity of preservatives in cosmetic products. In a context of strong concerns in Europe regarding the impact on these substances on human health, Clariant's strategy seems consistent with the market demand. Nipaguard Zero, Clariant's new range of preservative blends, is based on Velsan SC (INCI name: Sorbitan Caprylate), a synergistic booster developed by Clariant and made from renewable and natural raw materials. Velsan SC enables using a reduced amount of preservatives while providing reliable protection against bacteria, yeasts and fungi. According to Clariant, the Nipaguard Zero range ""provides broad-spectrum preservation, is easy to use, safe and effective at low concentrations and also meets major regulatory requirements."" The four products in the range, all based on Velsan SC, are: Nipaguard SCE, Nipaguard SCM, Nipaguard SCP and Nipaguard SCV. The four Nipaguard Zero blends can be used in rinse-off and leave-on applications, wet wipes and difficult-to-preserve formulations, including an Ecocert approved option. ""We understand the challenges that our customers face, in finding a safe and reliable preservative for their formulations, while navigating the frequently changing trends, regulations and requirements. We work with our customers to provide solutions to these challenges that are innovative, sustainable and effective to deliver confidence in preservation,"" said Anu Desikan, Global Marketing Manager for Personal Care at Clariant."
Worlée Cosmetics launches PE- and PP-exfoliant alternative,"Based on castor oil, the WorléeBeads HCO are sourced from fully renewable resources and are entirely biodegradable. According to Worlée Cosmetics, there use is safe for humans, animals and the environment. They can therefore can be used in environmental any kind of cosmetic rinse-off. Indeed, plastic micro particles (100 - 500 μm) used in cosmetic applications have been pointed out for their negative impact on marine eco-systems. Due to their low particle size, plastic micro particles can pass through filter plants and finally end up in great quantities in the oceans and from there to marine life and finally into the human food chain. Worlée Cosmetics also claims that plastic micro particles finding their way to landfill may still be potentially harmful for decades due to the very slow decomposition of plastics. Based on wax, the WorléeBeads HCO are characterized by a uniformly smooth surface thus resulting in a ""scrub that gently protects the skin."" Unlike pumice, silica sand, silica or walnut shells or crushed wood fibres, the WorléeBeads HCO are free from sharp edges that may cause injuries to the upper layer of the skin and skin dermatitis following, particularly in case of frequent use."
New sunscreen filters mimic coral UV protection,"The development builds on work by scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) who were the first to discover the natural sun screening ability of coral on the Great Barrier Reef. Natural skincare brand, Larissa Bright Australia, who studied the results of over 20 years of AIMS research into how shallow-water corals protect themselves from UV light then approached the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) with the aim to find a way to convert this natural method of coping with exposure to the intensive UV rays from Queensland's sunshine, into a safe and effective sunscreen for human use. CSIRO scientists have spent the last two years adapting the coral's sunscreen code so that it can be s used in human sunscreen. Eventually, the coral's natural sunscreen was improved to create a suite of 48 new sunscreen filters that are resistant to both UVA and UVB rays and are clear and colourless. ""The molecular make up of the coral's natural sunscreen filter was quite complex, but the real challenge was modifying it so that it was resistant to both UVA and UVB radiation in one molecule which is what makes these filters so unique,"" explained CSIRO Research Scientist Dr Mark York, who led the research project in conjunction with Senior Research Scientist Dr Jack Ryan. According to the Australian science body, ""the breakthrough paves the way for a new generation of sunscreens which harness the same protective barriers developed by Australia's Great Barrier Reef corals over millions of years to survive in the harsh Australian sun."" Larissa Bright Australia is now looking for a commercial partner to incorporate the new technology and bring the compounds into full scale production. The broad spectrum coral sunscreen filters are expected to be available to consumers across the globe within five years."
Cosmetopea: botanical knowledge,"Launched by the Cosmetic Valley three years ago, the Cosmétopée (cosmetopea or cosmetopeia) project is the equivalent for the cosmetics sector of the ""pharmacopoeia"" in the pharmaceutical field. The aim of the project is mainly to identify and to formalize the cosmetic properties of the planet's botanical resources, including through the structuration of individual initiatives. An ambitious project thus, that is carried on through several international partnerships and that should also facilitate the access to these resources for concerned companies, especially for SMEs. An interesting array of investigation for the cosmetics industry, which is well known for its permanent quest of new active ingredients, especially of plant origin. While the project covers the census of traditional practices and usages of plants in the beauty field, the aim is not to plunder ancestral knowledge. From this point of view, states the Cosmetic Valley, the cosmetopea project is part of the Nagoya Protocol, signed in 2010, on the use of the world's genetic resources and against biopiracy. ""It is important to know that 60% of botanical raw materials used by the aromas and flavours industry are sourced from wild plants,"" said Christain Moretti of the Research Institute for Development (IRD). In practice, ethnobotanists must always perform wide literature and field researches. The collection of information on traditional uses of plants implies to ""take into account the information related to the origin and location of the interviewee; actually, different populations use similar plants differently and for different properties,"" said Blandine Akendengué of the Department of Pharmacology at the Faculty of Medicine of Libreville, Gabon. However, the collection of data regarding traditional uses and the selection of plant materials is only a first step. For instance, the saponins from the African and Asian biodiversity are well known for their detergent properties. But researches have shown their high structural and biological diversity and have demonstrated that ""some saponins are efficient against skin aging, as they interact with the membrane's sterols at the dermal level,"" explains Marie Aleth Lacaille-Dubois, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, University Burgundy. ""Our research strategy combines complementary studies such as ethnobotany, phytochemistry,and pharmacology,"" she adds. The cosmetopea project also includes the development of new extraction methods. The most recent advances are centred on green chemistry. The supercritical fluids method is a good illustration of such advances. ""It provides highly concentrated fractions, stabilizes and facilitates the production compounds difficult to obtain. This process suits perfectly to the production of samples with low water content and is consistent with the principles of green chemistry,"" said Eric Lesellier, of the Organic and Analytical Institute of Chemistry in Orleans. Other innovative methods, such as sound waves extraction, microwave extraction, or electric pulsed fields extraction, also match ""with the aim of developing low-cost, rapid, and environmentally friendly, extraction processes,"" added Joel Doussot and Christophe Hano from the Laboratory of Wood and Crops Biology at the University of Orleans. There are also promising outlooks regarding objectivation methods. Patrick Trouillas, from the Faculty of Pharmacy of Limoges, uses quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics to evaluate physico-chemical properties relating to the antioxidant activities of natural compounds. ""In silico simulations have a predictive potential that could quickly be made available to the industry. Calculation can already allow us to understand the pigmentation of different compounds,"" said the researcher. ""Thanks to our models, we can measure the ability of antioxidants to interact with membranes, to quantify this interaction, to measure the penetration effects, and to determine the fraction which is responsible for the antioxidant activity,"" said Sandrine Morandet from Compiègne's University of Technology. Considering that, according to Joel Doussot, ""only 15% of the 300,000 terrestrial plant species have been studied in terms of their biological activity,"" a lot of research remains to be done by the cosmetics industry."
Clariant: a new polymer for a velvety skin feel,"Clariant's new Aristoflex Velvet polymer aims at answering the need for ultra soft and velvety skin feel in high-end skin care formulations. Aristoflex Velvet is an ethylene oxide-free and preservative-free ingredient that adds a soft and smooth skin feel to formulations during application and rub in. Clariant explains that its innovative composition does not immediately break on skin when applied, but instead gently melts while applying to leave skin feeling evenly soft and moisturized. ""With Aristoflex Velvet, manufacturers of skin care products can achieve a superior sensory profile for creams, lotions, balms, milks and serums - from light to rich caring products for all skin types. Its broad usage spectrum from pH 3 – 8 makes it compatible with a wide range of preservatives. It has a high compatibility with organic solvents, allowing special formulations such as tonics, hand sanitizers and nail polish removers with a soft, velvety, non-drying skin feel. Aristoflex Velvet also provides excellent suspending properties in a variety of products enabling the stabilization of colorful beads, exfoliating scrubs, microcapsules, sparkling pearls, and shimmering particles, for example,"" explains Clariant. Clariant also underlines that an important feature of the Aristoflex Velvet is its high temperature stability in formulations. In addition, Aristoflex Velvet provides ease of formulation: it is pre-neutralized, ready-to-use and is easy to add at any formulation step, dispersing easily in both the oil or water phase. Aristoflex Velvet was developed in line with Clariant's new Secret Code of Beauty concept that was recently unveiled at the last In-Cosmetic trade show in Paris and most recently at FCE Cosmetique in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Clariant's new ""Secret Code of Beauty"" is a combination of these five keywords (Sensory, Innovation, Xpert, Trend, Ecotain) focused on helping the company's customers achieve new levels of success in Personal Care. ""Today's consumers desire products that make them feel good about themselves,"" says Anu Desikan, global Marketing Manager Personal Care at Clariant. ""Aristoflex Velvet delivers unique benefits to a wide range of applications, giving skin care manufacturers an opportunity to provide their consumers with the luxurious sensory experiences they desire along with the superior performance our customers expect from Clariant's Aristoflex polymer range."""
Alban Muller completes its portefolio of botanical cosmetic ingredients,"Alban Muller International, a French specialist of plant-based cosmetic ingredients and formulations, showcased its two new ingredients at the last In-Cosmetics tradeshow in Paris: Repulpami ER, an anti-ageing active based on the combination of of two Senegalese plants and Amiox ER, an eco-designed antioxidant complying with the Cosmos standard. The company also highlighted Amiderm ER, its solution to maintain the pH of the skin that was initially launched in January 2013 at Cosmetagora. Developed by bringing together White Hibiscus (bissap) and Baobab from the Tambacounda and Louga regions (Senegal), Repulpami ER [1] targets the factors responsible for the visible signs of skin ageing. According to Alban Muller, Repulpami ER acts by a combination of actions: an anti-wrinkle action achieved by reducing face muscle contractions, a plumping action by inhibiting lipolysis and stimulating adipogenesis, and a firming action by stimulating the expression of the genes coding for the proteins responsible for tight-junctions and thus, for the strength and tone of the skin. ""Repulpami is the ideal active for global anti-ageing face care products, mature skin care products, anti-wrinkle, resurfacing, firming, plumping products, bust, neck and décolleté care products, firming products for the arms,"" claims the company. Alban Muller also offers a new natural antioxidant made from rosemary oleoresin on a sunflower oil base. Amiox [2] is an alternative to conventional antioxidants that protects the oil phases of cosmetics from oxidation. Its efficacy was assessed through a RANCIMAT test and a monitoring of the peroxide value conducted over two months. Amiox ER is rich in active principles, resulting from a rigorous agronomic selection. It is titrated in carnosic acid and carnosol, molecules with recognized antioxidant properties. The extraction is made with plant-based ethanol allowing Amiox ER to comply with the Cosmos standard. Eventually, Amiderm ER [3], which was previously showcased during Cosmetagora, completes the list of Alban Muller's innovations. Amiderm ER offers an anti-urease activity which prevents the degradation of urea in ammonia in case of perspiration. Its efficacy stands on the specificity of a witch hazel tannin. Amiderm ER thus enables stabilising the skin pH and maintains its natural protection avoiding irritation and unpleasant smell production. ""Amiderm ER mode of action makes it the essential ingredient in all situations when skin is stressed by an increase in pH: particularly sensitive and wet areas of the body, babies' bottom, normal and excessive perspiration,"" claims Alban Muller."
BASF presents solutions inspired by people's everyday needs,"The second level of BASF's Care Creations brand roll-out, which was presented at In-Cosmetics in Paris, shifted the focus towards observing consumer needs and desires. BASF analysed market research data and transformed them into real-life products. ""We are looking at people's demands up close, as though we are standing face to face with them,"" says Thomas Schroeder, Vice President Business Management Personal Care Europe at BASF. ""That way, we can identify opportunities for new, unique performance ingredients that, on the one hand, are of real value for consumers and, on the other hand, help our customers find success on the market."" Thus, along with this second level, BASF unveiled ""Cosmetics for real life"": a new formulation concept filled with products that have been inspired by people's diverse everyday needs. Actually, BASF employees have been involved in the project by participating in the face-to-face interviews, thus contributing to the definition of consumer's new day-to-day needs and individual preferences. Furthermore, some of them were selected to illustrate the different concepts. ""Over the course of a single day, people assume a number of roles based on their culture, environment, interests and the opportunities available to them. Going to work, raising children, and enjoying hobbies - everyone has many various facets to their life, each of which involves different needs and desires,"" explains the company. Beauty Creations, the cosmetic active ingredient business of BASF, presented Shadownyl, a seaweed (Fucus vesiculosus) extract designed to combat both the formation of wrinkles and ""dark circles"" around the eyes for a fully refreshed and enlightened eye contour. Shadownyl utilizes a novel biological pathway targeting heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme involved in the reduction of free heme content in the skin - a major cause of dark circle formation. In addition, Shadownyl was shown to exhibit antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory properties. It also showed very good in vitro results for collagen type-1 stimulation activity, which may lead to a skin re-plumping effect. Two clinical studies, conducted on 27 and 22 volunteers respectively, highlighted Shadownyl's ability to visibly decrease the coloration associated with dark circles across the eye contour area. Shadownyl also demonstrated a three-dimensional anti-wrinkle effect in just a one-week treatment. Beauty Creations also showcased plant-based Freshaxyl, a natural anti-odour active for the growing deo market. Freshaxyl is a synergistic blend of Moringa polypeptide extract and plant-based glyceryl laurate, which helps to dramatically reduce bodily odours. ""Freshaxyl bacteriostatic activity slows down the proliferation of microorganisms and Moringa has detoxifying properties which help to capture odours,"" says BASF. The active ingredient's ability to significantly reduce perspiration-related odours has been clinically demonstrated and is comparable to that of a market benchmark product. Another new ingredient on display at this year's In-Cosmetics was Lamesoft® OD. A micro emulsion made up entirely of renewable raw materials to enrich body cleansing products with finely dispersed oil. The oil remains on the skin after washing, supporting natural skin protection. BASF also launched Tinosorb A2B, a broad-spectrum UV filter which provides protection from UVB and UVAII wavelengths from 290 through to 340 nm. ""Thanks to its superior UV absorbance capabilities, it is now one of the most efficient UV filters available on the European market, and closes the protection gap in the UVAII range that wasn't covered by UV filters available to date,"" claims the company. Eventually, BASF introduced Luviset One, the latest addition to its hair care portfolio. According to the company, this all-in-one solution for hair styling gels, creams and waxes delivers strong styling performance, long-lasting curl retention and provides a smooth, crystal-clear gel base. BASF will also feature these new personal care technologies and market concepts at the New York Society of Cosmetic Chemists (NYSCC) Suppliers' Day on May 14-15 at the New Jersey Convention and Exposition centre in Edison, close to New York."
"SEPPIC introduces its gourmet ""Cosmetofood"" formulas and a series of new products","Cooking is also meeting success in the cosmetics industry with an increasing use of food ingredients and food-like claims. Capitalising on this trend Seppic presented, during the lastes edition of In-Cosmetics, (16-18 April 2013, in Paris) a series formulations inspired from cooking recipes. Seppic's suggestions feature four salty recipes (""Exfoliating Tapenade"", ""Southern Flavors Gaspacho - Vitality Serum"", ""Egg 2 ways: Marshmallow Yolk & refreshing Whites"", ""Avocado Pulp Mask - Global Anti-aging"") and four sweet recipes (""Chocolate Treat - Body Soother"", ""Melting caramel butter"", ""Raspberry Honey Facial Cleanser - Sulfate free!"", ""Smooth Skin Delight - Coffee Slimming Gel""). To extend the experience, Seppic also propose to fill in a form on its website to search for tailor-made ""Cosmetofood"" formulas using available Seppic ingredients classified according to numerous criteria (by claim, food concept, application, texture, formulation, or raw material). Seppic also showcased a series of new products including: – Survicode, a cellular communication booster, that reactivates intercellular interactions for a more harmonious skin. Seppic has assessed its efficacy with the aid of a cellular aging model. – Simulgreen 18-2, a new green emulsifier for sunscreen lotions providing a non-soaping texture (no white residue on the skin), even in natural formulations rich in vegetable oils and natural gums. – Esculane, an anti-dandruff natural ingredient of marine origin developed by BiotechMarine, and which was awarded the bronze prize at the In-Cosmetics' 2013 Best Ingredient Award competition. – Eliclear 4U, a new rheological modifier and the first outcome of the partnership announced last year between Seppic and Coatex. It addresses the needs of formulators that want excellent clarity for both traditional and sulphate free surfactant based systems containing suspended particles. Eventually, Seppic also presented new data for its Sepiwhite™ MSH, Aquaxyl™ and Simulgreen™ 18-2, as well as advice on formulating «sulphate-free"" hygiene products and micellar water."
Most successful in-cosmetics to date highlights natural and high performance ingredients,"As anticipated, the latest edition of the in-cosmetics trade show, which was held on 16-18 April in Paris, has been the most successful ever. According to Reed Exhibitions, the organisers of the event, more than 9,400 unique visitors - a 20% increase on the previous record for visitor numbers - came to Paris to discover new ingredients, formulations and an extensive educational programme. More than 650 exhibitors packed the show floor, including over 100 companies who had never been to an in-cosmetics event before. Innovation was celebrated at the show in an awards ceremony at the end of the first day. Induchem's new ingredient Neodermyl® was selected as the winner of the in-cosmetics' Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award, recognised for it efficacy and scientific grounding. Silver prize went to Symrise with SymHair® Force 1631, a natural anti-hair loss active, whilst BiotechMarine was awarded bronze for its new anti-dandruff ingredient, Esculane®. Furthermore, Dr Karl Lintner was announced as the winner of in-cosmetics Lifetime Achievement Award. The fact that the three winners of the in-cosmetics' Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award be natural ingredients or of natural origin (Neodermyl® is an active coming from biotechnology, made of a new derivative of glucose combined with amino acids and copper) illustrates brands' always growing interest in natural actives. In order to address this demand, ingredient suppliers continue to consolidate their positions in the sector. Thus, the 2013 edition of in-cosmetics has been preceded by the acquisition, earlier this year, of BiotechMarine, a supplier of marine actives based in Brittany, by SEPPIC, a subsidiary of Air Liquide, or the acquisition of CRM (Cosmetic Raw Materials) International, a French based manufacturer of natural ingredients for the personal care industry, by Clariant. And, most recently, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics (Unipex group), announced the acquisition of Australian company Southern Cross Botanicals. Historical players in the natural segment are not lagging behind, as it is illustrated by Silab's opening of a third production unit at the end of 2012, and the recent certification of five of its ingredients to the Cosmos standard. However, having to cope with an increasing competitive pressure - also from related areas such as cosmetic surgery and dermatological procedures - cosmetic brands are simultaneously demanding ever more powerful ingredients. Therefore, natural solutions proposed by ingredient suppliers must be at least as effective as the traditional actives. Through very extensive claims, the 2013 edition of in-cosmetics thus unveiled he great potential of natural actives. The ingredients innovations listed in PremiumBeautyNews.com's special issue on cosmetic ingredients are a good illustration of this trend. The next in-cosmetics take place in Hamburg, Germany 1-3 April 2014."
Anti-Aging: Protection strategies for mitochondria,"This article was originally published in our last week's special issue ""Cosmetic Ingredients"". To read the entire issue and download it, click here. Mitochondria are small cell organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. They have the particularity of having their own DNA – mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) –, to be able to multiply or self-destruct regardless of the division of the cell itself and to be the main power plants of the cell. Their double membrane, the inner part of which is characterized by many folds promotes an intense transformation activity of substances provided by the supply in energy usable by the cells namely adenosine triphosphate (ATP). But it is also during this respiratory chain that the mitochondrion generates the ROS (reactive oxygen species), making it the prime target of oxidative attacks. [1] Mitochondrial DNA has its own particular characteristics by being smaller than the DNA of the cell, less protected because lacking a nuclear membrane and with fewer repair systems available than cellular DNA. If the alterations of mDNA are too important, the mitochondrion will self-destruct thus leading to cellular death. Beyond energy production, the mitochondrion, or rather the mitochondria (all the mitochondrions) are essential to the proper functioning of body cells. They take a part in complex signalling pathways and are involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. At the medical level, a decrease in mitochondrial functions such as those caused by caloric restriction could have a positive impact on aging according to Dr. Johan Auwerx from the Laboratory for Integrative and Systems Physiology at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale of Lausanne [2]. For his part, Andrew Dillin evidenced that disruptions in the mitochondrial function affected the entire body and its longevity [3]. There is a plethora of research work on this subject and the Congress, ""Targeting Mitochondria"", whose 4th edition will take place on 17 and 18 October 2013 in Berlin will address in detail the subject of mitochondria and how they can be reached. ""The mitochondrion is at the heart of aging, hundreds of diseases are related to its dysfunctions. In recent years, scientific advances were achieved on the early detection of mitochondrial alterations but also on the possibility of finding nanocarriers allowing to reach these difficult targets,"" explained Marwin Edeas, Chairman of the French Society of Anti-oxidants and organizer of the Congress Targeting Mitochondria [4]. Some players like Mrs C. Peyreigne biologist, founder of Oxincell, a company specialized in the study and analysis of the mitochondrial function do not hesitate to say that ""it is likely that mitochondriology will become in the coming years, one of the leading disciplines of the 21st century."" Preserving mitochondria is therefore crucial. Cosmetics manufacturers have realized that and have been offering innovations in this area for several years now. Skin being provided with these valuable substances. The molecules of interest which have been developed act according to different approaches. A first path is to consider the mitochondrion like a power plant that needs to be maintained and stimulated. Greentech with Somitine®, a biotech active, acts on cellular respiration by increasing it at the basal and mitochondrial level without however impairing the energy balance. The cells produce more energy and the radiance and luminosity of the skin are improved. Mibelle with its NanoLipobelle DN CoQ10, a bioavailable concentrate of Q10 coenzyme titrated at 7% combats the decline in energy production and enables, thanks to its antioxidant properties, to act against the ROS. The nanoencapsulation delivery system improves the diffusion of the active to the mitochondria. Exsymol, with Methiopeptide® offers a biomimetic derivative of methionine with antioxidant properties, a protection of the respiratory function at the cellular level. Its ability to regenerate itself under the action of the MSR (methionine sulfoxide reductase) imparts it in addition with a long lasting effect. Codif Recherche et Nature with Hydrofiltrat statice G, stimulates the expression of mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT3, an enzyme the over expression of which increases respiration while reducing the production of ROS, an interesting balance to achieve in the fight against aging. Finally Sederma with Juvinity®, a geranylgeranylpropanol extract in a oil soluble carrier regulates cellular oxidative stress, enables to rebalance the mitochondrial activity (+ 63% in the membrane potential) and to stimulate the ATP synthesis (+ 76%). Its complementary action on ensuring the maintenance of telomere length and on the synthesis of the major components of the dermis makes it a global anti-aging active. Another strategy focuses on protecting the mDNA which is very sensitive to oxidative stress. Codif Recherche et Nature, with Phycojuvenine – a brown seaweed extract of Laminaria digitata – offers to protect mitochondria during UVA exposure. Tested at 1%, the active limits UVA induced cytochrome C leakage. Cytochrome C being a heme protein associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and which is released from it when the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is activated. Barnet, distributed by Inter'actifs repairs the damages caused to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA by oxidative stress, pollution and UV radiation. Their active, Roxisomes V is a liposomal enzyme of the 8-Oxoguanine glycosylase. Solabia with Viniderm derived from a grape juice extract from the French Languedoc-Roussillon region protects the essential components of the skin including the mitochondrial DNA. 0.06% of the active enables to increase by 63% the aconitase activity. Finally, a third approach focuses on molecules enabling an anti cellulite action by acting on mitochondria. A claim recently associated with mitochondria. Codif Recherche et Nature with Actiporine 8G, launched at In-Cosmetics 2013, targets mitochondrial aquaporin 8 in charge of the diffusional transport of H2O2 from the inside to the outside of the mitochondria. By ridding them of this toxic agent, the active maintains their physical and functional integrity and stimulates the original cell activity of adipocytes with namely lipolysis, and of fibroblasts with the collagen synthesis. Sederma with Phytosonic® restores the mitochondrial activity, helps burn the free fatty acids resulting from lipolysis activation and increases the cellular energy while stopping the cellulite induced-oxidative stress. Impag with Corolea Bio stimulates the TGR5 receptor of adipocytes leading to an increase in mitochondrial activity and to a fat burning effect. This active is the result of a partnership with the French company Phytodia. These numerous molecules show why it is really worthwhile targeting mitochondria. To assess their activity, the ICDD company, founded in 2007 by Nathalie Compagnone, offers innovative technologies by working directly on the living cell: ""Our strength lies in two differentiating factors as our assays are conducted in the living cell itself and not on isolated mitochondria, meaning that the latter is studied in its natural environment. In addition, it is a multi-parametric analysis within a same cell population during the same experiment,"" she emphasised. Their patented technologies were first proposed to the pharmaceutical industry and have now been made available for the past 2 years to the cosmetics market. Several models are offered like the Mitoread Anti-âge, Mitoread mtDNA, Mitoread redox c / mt SOD, Mitoread BBS... enabling to measure the effects of actives on the mitochondrion. Undoubtedly mitochondria have still many things to reveal. On the occasion of the in-cosmetics trade show, which was held last week in Paris, Premium Beauty News has offered its readers a special issue dedicated to cosmetic ingredients. Contents : - Main cosmetic ingredients trends, according to Kline - Anti-aging: Strategies to protect mitochondria - 2013 regulatory issues - Water: A vector of efficiency in cosmetics - Exclusive Interview with Dr. Robert Fellous, Intertek - An overview of recent developments in ingredients to be presented at in-cosmetics 2013."
Induchem's Neodermyl scoops gold at in-cosmetics,"The judges [1] applauded Induchem for its scientific innovation, the use of green chemistry and the demonstrated efficacy of the ingredient that offers real benefits in formulation. According to Induchem, Neodermyl reactivates collagens and elastin synthesis in the skin and to reenergise senescent fibroblasts by supplying them with an activated source of cellular energy. This results in a fast and sustainable production of Collagen III, Collagen I, Tropoelastin and Elastin, which lead to visible improvement of skin texture and reduction of wrinkle. In just two weeks Neodermyl gives equivalent results to one needle injection of collagen by a plastic surgeon (-15% wrinkle depth reduction). ""Our R&D and marketing teams have worked incredibly hard to create Neodermyl, a product we're extremely proud of. The other finalists this year all had fantastic products, so to have been recognised with this prestigious award is a real honour. 2013 has so far been a very productive year for us and we look forward to the future,"" said Fabrice Lefèvre, R&D and Marketing Director, Induchem. Furthermore, Symrise's SymHair Force 1631 was awarded the Silver prize. SymHair Force 1631 is a natural anti-hair loss active from a sustainable source of Microalgae that fortifies hair whilst improving density. The judges were especially impressed with the ingredient's proven ability to increase hair shaft elongation by up to 13%. Eventually, BiotechMarine's Esculane, an anti-dandruff natural ingredient of marine origin, was awarded bronze. Also read, PremiumBeautyNews.com's special issue on cosmetic ingredients: here."

Shiseido wants to grow its own botanical raw materials,"Shiseido has started several test operations for in-house cultivation of its own plant-based raw materials. As a first step, the leading Japanese cosmetic manufacturer has installed a container-type facility in its Kakegawa factory, thus enabling plants used as raw materials for active ingredients to be grown in a controlled environment. The next step is the set up of an open field test farm that is debuting full-scale operation from April. Shiseido is thus making another step forward its aims to launch cosmetics products formulated with plants that have been cultivated under the company's supervision by 2014 at the earliest. Shiseido will gradually expand the on-site cultivation and production of sources of plant raw materials while also gaining cooperation from raw material manufacturers. Of course, the aim of this initiative is to address the expansion of the natural- and organic-oriented segment of the cosmetics market. Shiseido also aims at increasing reassurance regarding safety and traceability regarding its products, while standing out from the mass of competitors that outsource their production to other companies. According to the Japanese company, there are at least three main advantages to in-house production of botanical ingredients required for cosmetic products: – supervising culture from the stage of seeds and seedlings makes it possible to procure raw materials that are ""safe and reliable,"" ""of stable quality"" and ""traceable,"" enabling identification of the background of plants and producers, – controlling cultivation conditions will also broaden the potential of producing raw materials that contain greater amounts of active ingredients and using such high quality plant raw materials will contribute to the development of products with strong market competitiveness, – stable harvests will help securing supplies and reducing price fluctuation risk. Furthermore, Shiseido also plans to use natural energy as a heat source in certain parts of the plant farm."
"The natural trend and India drive the growth of cosmetic ingredients, says Kline","According to the latest figures from Kline's Global Personal Care Ingredients database [1], conditioning polymers, antimicrobials, and emulsifiers performed particularly well on the personal care ingredients market in 2012. However, the research firm highlights that surfactants are maintaining their primacy as the largest product category and that polymers are displaying dynamic growth. The ubiquitous specialty surfactants - that are used in many personal care products as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, and/or foaming agents - continue to contribute to the highest volumes of the global personal care ingredients market consumption rate. Kline & Company clasps the combined surfactants consumption across the United States, EU 27, India, Japan, China, and Southeast Asia at 507 million pounds (about 229,97 million kilograms) in 2012. Kline forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.6% to the year 2017. As a global phenomenon, the natural trend drives the growth of specific surfactants in both mature and emerging markets. A biodegradable surfactant, alkyl polyglucoside finds fertile ground in the growing number of shampoos and cleansing products containing environmentally friendly ingredients in Europe. Organic alkyl polyglucoside and lauryl glucoside surfactants are gaining momentum in India too. Kline & Company forecasts a 10% CAGR through 2017 for alkyl polyglucoside consumption and an 8% CAGR for lauryl glucosides. However, India preserves its own specificities. For instance, as many Indian consumers seek cleansing products, which give a ""white glove on the hands"" appearance, an increasing number of manufacturers are adding high foamers, such as Alkanolamides into their personal care products. Conditioning polymers are expected to experience the most dynamic growth, among all the eight product categories covered by research, estimated to post approximately 5% CAGR over the next five years. The strongest growth is expected in India, where conditioning polymers will post double-digit CAGR over the forecast period. Furthermore, Southeast Asia is projected to display high growth rates, while Europe, the United States, Japan, and China will grow more modestly."
Five COSMOS-certified ingredients for Silab,"Just a few months after the establishment of the standard of the new European label, Silab has obtained the COSMOS certification for five active ingredients from its catalogue: Osilift® Bio, Sensiline® Bio, Glyco-Repair® Bio, Structurine® Bio, and Vitanol® Bio. ""The list of these COSMOS-certified active ingredients will grow some time in 2013 with the entire catalogue of active ingredients that are already certified as per the ECOCERT Natural and Organic Cosmetics standard,"" says the company in release. The COSMOS standard is the result of the harmonisation of separate standards of Europe's leading certification bodies (BDIH, COSMEBIO, Ecocert Greenlife, ICEA and SOIL Association). ""More than just a simple ingredient declaration, which is opted for by other market players, Silab went ahead and obtained the COSMOS certification for its active ingredients, which is extremely demanding in terms of quality, traceability and transparency – inherent to the core values of the company. This commitment is based on very comprehensive specifications of the Silab natural active ingredients: safe and sustainable sourcing, scientifically proven efficacy, toxicological validation, intellectual property,"" the company adds. Thus, the list of criteria analyzed by Ecocert Greenlife, the certification body, during the annual audit, features: compliance of industrial procedures, analysis of water waste, industrial waste and power consumption, responsible purchasing policy and supply of plants from organic farming. ""This COSMOS certification confirms the global policy and ethics of Silab, in compliance with the principles of the standard: promote the use of ingredients obtained from organic farming, use processes of production and transformation that are environment-friendly and have no adverse effect on human health,"" concludes the company."
Silab launches natural alternative to hyaluronic acid,"Hyaluronic acid, Silab explains, is an indispensable anti-age biomarker. Thanks to its hydrating properties, ""it consolidates the dermal bed and thereby smooths out wrinkles."" By offering a natural-based alternative to hyaluronic acid, the French supplier of cosmetic ingredients therefore targets the huge market of anti-aging and moisturizing care products. The new ingredient, Prohyal+ [1], acts on the endogenous synthesis of hyaluronic acid, thanks to its high concentration in yeast oligosaccharides from Mexican blue agave leaves. In vitro studies conducted by Silab show that Prohyal+ increases the expression of hyaluronan synthase (HAS2) synthesis enzyme and reactivates the natural mechanisms of hyaluronic acid production which naturally declines during aging. Tested at 2%, Prohyal+ significantly increases the expression of HAS2 by 651% and the synthesis of hyaluronic acid by 237%. A series of in vivo studies also allowed to compare the efficacy of Prohyal+ compared to hyaluronic acid. ""After 28 days of twice daily applications and in comparison to the placebo, Prohyal+ smoothes skin microrelief at the crow's feet. Parameter Sq and parameter Sa are reduced by 6.3% and by 7.1% respectively,"" Silab explains. The study shows a reduction of wrinkles' volume by 14.2% in 70% of the volunteers. According to Silab, the effect is similar to that obtained with hyaluronic acid, the reference molecule, formulated at 0.13% of dry matter and tested in the same conditions. The subjective evaluation also shows the good performances of Prohyal+ compared with hyaluronic acid. After 28 days of twice daily applications, with comparison to placebo, more than 90% of volunteers considered that the formula containing Prohyal+ is a moisturizing and anti-wrinkles emulsion. ""This result is superior to that obtained with hyaluronic acid molecule,"" Silab claims."
Bayer highlights new properties for its active Heterosides of Talapetraka,"The extract obtained from leaves of Centella asiatica and titrated in triterpenes (madecassoside and asiaticoside) was found new properties by acting not only at the cellular but also structural level. Indeed, the last objectification test performed on human keratinocytes showed an increase in the synthesis of ceramides 2 thus improving the skin's barrier and permeability. In addition, previous data showed the active to normalize keratinocyte differentiation through its action on the involucrin synthesis. Its interest also lies in the strengthening of tight junctions ensuring a greater cell cohesion and activation of the deep epidermis layers through aquaporins 3 stimulation. Its broad potential of action on the skin barrier function combined with a modulation of inflammatory drifts (IL-1, IL-8, PGE-2) enables to recommend it for sensitive and reactive skins but also as an anti-ageing active. Bayer Serdex is a division of Bayer Santé Familiale owned by the German group Bayer. It has been involved since the 70s in research and innovation work focusing on the activity of Malagasy plants intended for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. The division takes a careful attention to strictly implement the principles of ethical sourcing."
Soliance : an anti-fat active derived from marine micro-algae,"In order to fight the influence of internal and external factors that, over time, lead to increased fat stocks and affect the body shape, Soliance has selected Dysmorphococcus globosus, a special microalgae with slimming properties that, according to the French supplier of natural ingredients, are likely to give satisfaction to demanding consumers looking for effective slimming solutions. ""At Soliance we believe that the effects of time and life could be delayed,"" says the company. Named Pro-DG, this new ingredient works through a dual action: – Inhibition of lipids storage by stopping the triglycerides synthesis – Stimulation of lipolysis by stimulation of cAMP (Cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cyclic AMP) rate and glycerol release Pro-DG targets adipose tissue and can be applied on the thighs or the abdomen. Soliance recommends a dosage of 3% in cosmetic formulas. In vitro tests conducted by Soliance have shown that Pro-DG inhibits the synthesis of triglycerides up to -85% and visibly reduces the size of adipocytes within 7 days. Furthermore, in vivo tests have shown an extremely effective slimming action with a significant reduction of the thigh circumference by 1.5 cm in 56 days."
The Paris edition of In-Cosmetics is set to break new records,"Each year, In-Cosmetics, the leading trade show in cosmetic formulations, sets a new mark in the number of exhibitors. The 2013 edition should be no exception: With 12,500 m2 (134,500 sq ft) of stands already sold, organizers expect more than 600 exhibitors, against 590 for the 2012 edition in Barcelona, among which approximately 60 are first-time exhibitors at In-Cosmetics. As this year the trade show is returning to Paris, it should also break its previous records in terms of number of visitors. ""In-Cosmetics takes place in Paris every three years. Each time it is the edition for which we record the largest number of visitors,"" explains Cathy Laporte, Group Marketing Manager at Reed Exhibitions Ltd., The organizer of the event. For the first time, in partnership with the French Society of Perfumers (Société Française des Parfumeurs - SFP), a space fully dedicated to the use of perfumes in cosmetic formulations will be made available by organizers. ""We wanted to give a better visibility to a sector that is of interest to more than 30% of visitors,"" underlined Laporte. Located at the heart of the exhibition space, this area, called ""Fragrances In Cosmetics"", will consist of presentation counters and will be complemented with a training session of three and a half hours dedicated to various topics, such as natural and synthetic ingredients, technical and formulation issues, regulations and consumer trends. A round-table themed ""Perfume, pleasure, emotion and cosmetics"" will host several key members of the SFP. ""The use of fragrances in cosmetics constitutes a large percentage of the work our 900 members do so we're really pleased to be partnering with in-cosmetics 2013, , which today is the world's leading international trade show for the personal care ingredients industry,"" explained Patrick Saint-Yves, President of the SFP. Like perfumers, professionals in evaluation and regulations will also have their dedicated area. ""In a first phase, this area will mostly host new exhibitors, but we will create a specific route enabling visitors to identify all the exhibiting companies in this sector. Our goal is to group them all in the same area as of the 2014 edition, which will take place in Hamburg. This sector is the one that is enjoying the fastest growth among our exhibitors,"" said Laporte. ""Specialists in assessment protocols, formula optimization or in regulatory compliance are the unavoidable interface between ingredients and finished products,"" she added. Finally, it is water and its use in cosmetics that will be the thematic route of the 2013 edition, with twenty participants and many varied themes such as reducing the water footprint, moisturising actives, water as an active ingredient (in particular outstanding waters such as water from Tasmania, glacier water,...) which will therefore concern both formulation and industrial or environmental processes."
Oily actives: the innovation dynamics of Oléos,"Premium Beauty News - After 23 years of a career in fatty substances at the Institut des Corps Gras (ITERG), why did you chose to create – quite belatedly if I may say so, Oléos using a relatively old idea, namely the extraction of plant actives with an oily compound? Anne Rossignol-Castera - During the 23 years spent at the ITERG I had the chance to occupy four positions which have formed the pillars of my business creation: A technical experience as a young research fellow after my engineering degree in agribusiness, an experience in team management as a laboratory manager, a mission in marketing and business development, and finally an approach to business strategy in my last position as a Development Director. By working with manufacturers on their needs and the potential transfers with the ITERG, I realized that I was sometimes frustrated at not being able to carry ideas to their logical conclusion. This is how creating my own business gradually emerged as evidence. Premium Beauty News - How was your development undertaken and who were your first customers? Anne Rossignol-Castera - The original idea, which benefited from an envelope Soleau [1] in 2006, emerged from my market observations. Indeed, oily macerated already existed – in ancient times they consisted of compositions made of plants which were left to infuse in fatty substances – but the result was disappointing particularly in terms of oxidative stability and concentration in active ingredients. The first idea, registered with the INPI (Institut National de la Protection Intellectuelle or National Industrial Property Institute) was to develop an innovative and efficient method of oily extraction based on green technology. In 2008, a second envelope Soleau was registered and in parallel, I took leave to start a business. The support of Oséo [2] and of the business incubator of Lunel enabled me to be in contact with the Faculty of Pharmacy and the School of Chemistry of Montpellier. I took this opportunity to further my knowledge of plants and skin biology. I Very quickly I started testing microwave and ultrasound intensified eco-extractions. These techniques improve the solvent power of oils, ensure a good reproducibility of produced extracts, high yields and optimized organoleptic characteristics. The products obtained are very qualitative. In parallel, I prospected potential customers and several of them found the idea very interesting among which the Laboratoires Nuxe which were interested in organic certified oily actives, stable and objectified. We filed a patent for our oleo-extraction process [3] totally green with zero chemicals, zero solvents, zero pollution and Ecocert certified. The company Oléos SAS was created at the end of 2010. Today we have a portfolio of twenty clients with some large groups like LVMH, NUXE and small innovative brands in organic cosmetics like Alorée, Akane, Kadalys... Premium Beauty News - What do the Oléoactifs® offer compared to traditional oily actives such as oil or vitamin E? Anne Rossignol-Castera - Performance, quality, stability and significant opportunities in terms of actives since we can create exclusive and patented custom made Oléoactifs®. These compounds have a concentration in active molecules 10 times higher than a carrier oil and improved associated properties. Measurement tests have delivered very good results in terms of oxidative stress, hydration, improvement of the barrier function and of the dermal bioavailability. The oily carrier offers many advantages for the skin and can be introduced into all formulas for skincare, make-up, massage products. On the marketplace, liposoluble actives are seldom found and we are partnering with several university laboratories including the one of Prof. Patrice Rat at the University Paris Descartes, to develop cellular tests enabling to highlight the great potential of this product category and particularly of Oléoactifs®. Premium Beauty News - What does your range of Oléoactifs® consist of? Anne Rossignol-Castera - 90% of our customers are looking for custom-made and exclusive Oléoactifs® but we have a small range of specific anti-aging Oléoactifs® developed in 2011. These six products support our International development, which is achieved with exclusive distributors. We are present in South Korea, Hong Kong, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and Russia. Premium Beauty News - Now you are taking an interest in the perfume industry with the launch of Oléo'Sense®. Which markets are you targeting? Anne Rossignol-Castera - The Oléoactifs® represent a modern version of maceration, while with the Oléo'Sense® it's enfleurage which is reworked. We use the solvent power of oils to extract the olfactory fingerprint of plants. We work with a perfumer to refine our compositions. The great advantage of our technique is to only extract heart notes and base notes, the heaviest molecules, and to not have the often allergenic volatile terpenes. These are therefore fragrance extracts with a low content in allergens, very suitable for the bio market and hypoallergenic ranges. The Oléo'Sense® are compounds from waxes, butters and perfume plants, they are sensory and active ingredients. We do not intend to replace a fragrance but to provide to skin care products for sensitive and hypoallergenic skins the fragrant note which was up to now difficult to achieve. We can claim zero perfume and zero allergen. Premium Beauty News - Do you have other projects? Anne Rossignol-Castera - To remain innovative, you must constantly renew yourself and keep a broad open mind. So, of course, we have other projects! Right now, we are working on another extraction technique and on the development of nutritional Oléoactifs®. We were laureates of the Oséo contest for the development of this project which provides us a help for the next two years for the funding of our R&D activities. In parallel, we are building a 500 sqm site as part of a beautiful activity park project hosting ""green"" companies, scheduled in 2014. Otherwise, in the short term, our objective is to develop the Oléoactifs® abroad and introduce the Oléo'Sense® in the perfume and organic world."
Preservatives: Methylisothiazolinone blamed for its allergenic effects,"The news about an upsurge in cases of allergies due to Methylisothiazolinone created a huge buzz in French media in December. This substance was often presented as a new preservative used in replacement of parabens, which is not really the case. Indeed, this preservative - which is authorized at a maximum concentration of 0.01% in cosmetic products placed on the European market - was not a newcomer and its potential adverse effects have been well documented for many years. The combination of Chloromethylisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone, in proportion 3/1, is well known in the cosmetic industry under the trade name Kathon-CG. Once widely and commonly used, Kathon-CG was gradually abandoned and its use restricted to certain rinsed off products such as shampoos. Kathon-CG has been gradually replaced by parabens, which had the advantage of being much more tolerated. As a consequence, parabens were present in nearly 70% of cosmetic products, until they were questioned recently. However, the use of Methylisothiazolinone rose again in recent years. Actually, the renewed interest in this substance, often described as less allergenic than Chloromethylisothiazolinone, is directly linked to the disgrace of parabens. Now, Methylisothiazolinone is one of the most frequently used preservatives in various paraben free toiletries (cleaning wipes, soaps, shampoos), but also in several household and industrial products. According to Professor Annick Barbaud, Head of the Dermatology and Allergology Unit at Nancy's University Hospital, the information provided by the French vigilance network on dermatologic allergies (Revidal) shows an upsurge in contact dermatitis linked to Methylisothiazolinone. Dr. Barbaud was taking stock of contact dermatitis on the occasion of Paris Dermatological Days, which were attended by over 6,000 people under the aegis of the French Society of Dermatology (SFD) from 10 to 14 December 2012, also reported ""some rare cases of breathing difficulties and irritation of mucous membranes."" Furthermore, a recent Danish research even shows that non-contact exposure is a growing problem. [1] This upsurge in allergies is not a surprise for experts. Indeed, the frequency of allergies related to preservatives is growing exponentially together with the population exposure, i.e. with the frequency of their use by the industry. It is therefore quite logical that the restored popularity of Methylisothiazolinone be followed by an increase in allergies related to this substance. Does that mean that replacing parabens by safe alternatives is impossible? The French drug regulatory agency (National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products - ANSM) in an information notice, published in May 2011, said it was currently unlikely that ""chemical alternatives offering a better safety profile and preservation efficacy equalling those of parabens could be offered. By definition, all preservatives are biologically active. Accordingly, any preservative can potentially lead to safety problems."" In order to reduce the exposure to preservatives, including parabens, a decrease in the concentration of preservatives is not always possible because the anti-bacterial protection might become insufficient. In both in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic sectors, manufacturers are now encouraged to focus on physical methods, including through new packaging solutions. The development of single-dose and so-called airless packaging directly addresses this need."
New konjac-based dermal filler active to correct wrinkles,"BASF´s Beauty Creations - the cosmetic active ingredient business of BASF, resulting from the merger of BASF Beauty Care Solutions and Laboratoires Sérobiologiques that followed the purchase of Cognis - has developed Ultra Filling Spheres, a new version of Filling Spheres, its previous wrinkle filling concept. ""Wrinkle formation is one of the today's consumer major concerns as wrinkles and fine lines represent the most visible sign of aging. Among the several wrinkle corrective treatments which are available today, dermal fillers are still among the most popular,"" explains the company in a release. The Ultra Filling Spheres [1] are composed of two biopolymers: hyaluronic acid of low molecular weight ( 200 kDa) with high hygroscopic properties. The underlying system is based on the ability of cross-linked and dehydrated spheres to penetrate the upper layers of the epidermis and to absorb the water that evaporates from the deep dermis. ""Cross-linking of both components forms small spheres which after drying, are transformed into Ultra Filling Spheres. Thanks to their high hygroscopic properties, the volume of the spheres increases rapidly in the presence of the skin's water reserve, and work as plumping the skin from inside out which may result in smoothing out the wrinkles and fine lines at the surface of the skin,"" says BASF Beauty Creations. In presence of water, the Ultra Filling Spheres exhibited a higher capability to swell than previous generation Filling Spheres, thanks to the properties of Konjac. According to BASF Beauty Creations, ex vivo tests have demonstrated increased performances in comparison with the former generation: ""their water absorption capability is superior respectively 24 times in weight and 17 times in volume; in addition they were shown to exhibit a water retention capability 20% higher (in tubo gravimetric determination) as well as an enhanced thickness of the stratum corneum by 17 % (ex vivo measurement), both again in comparison with previous generation Filling Spheres."" BASF recommends predispersing the spheres in the oily phase before creating the emulsion and to use them at a concentration of 0.5-3.0% in formulations. They should not be used in aqueous gel or emulsions in oily phase at less than 20%."
In-Cosmetics Asia opens its doors in a booming market,"Opening its doors from Tuesday 6 to Thursday 8 November 2012 at the Bangkok International Trade & Exhibition Centre (BITEC), this edition of In-Cosmetics Asia should confirm the growing importance of the Asian cosmetics market which, according to Euromonitor, may reach the same share of the global market as Western Europe. With more than 300 exhibitors and more than 5,000 visitors expected, this edition is expected to be the biggest in the show's five-year history. ""In-Cosmetics Asia is the must-attend event for anyone involved in the personal care industry in Asia and we're looking forward to opening the doors to encourage innovation, education and the sharing of knowledge across the region,"" said Sarah Gibson, Exhibition Director. Key players including BASF, Croda, DSM & Evonik will attend the show, but In-Cosmetics Asia will also welcome 60 first time exhibitors, such as: At Lab Co Ltd (South Korea), Emery Oleochemicals (Malaysia), Kuo Ching Chemical Co, Ltd (Taiwan), Natural Sourcing (USA), Laboratorios Argenol, S.L. (Spain), Toyo Sugar Refining Co, Ltd, (Japan), Vital-Chem Zhuhai Co, Ltd, (China). This year will see the welcome return of the Innovation Zone, where visitors can discover the most innovative ingredients launched either at the show or within six months of the event. In-Cosmetics Asia will celebrate innovation with two awards: the Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award and, for the first time at the show, Cosmetics & Toiletries magazine will host the inaugural R&D Awards-Asia. The eight finalists of Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award - which honours the development of a novel active or functional ingredient that combines innovative science and product features - have just been unveiled: – Gattefossé with 'Gatuline RadiancE', a new global high-tech anti-ageing active, dedicated to skin complexion and a flawless skin tone. – Lipotec with Delisen for sensitive skin, which helps to restore the damaged barrier function and provides a photoprotective effect, preventing further inflammation. – Lucas Meyer Cosmetics with Body3 Complex, an ingredient which combines a triple action on cellulite, firmness and stretch marks. – Mibelle Biochemistry with DermCom which stimulates cell to cell communication, providing a smart strategy for skin matrix repair. – Rahn with Liftonin - XPress, an instant wrinkle minimiser. – Rhodia Asia Pacific with Miracare SLB Series which provides fragrance enhancements to products. – Sensient Cosmetic Technologies with NatpureO' Gel V, a natural transparent oil thickener, derived from renewable sources. – Silab with Vederine, which offers the restructuring benefits of a natural 'vitamin D-like' active ingredient. Last year Lonza Ltd scooped Gold at the awards with ReGeniStem Red Rice, a sustainable anti-ageing active derived from Himalayan Red Rice. Silver was handed to Lipotec with adifyline, a novel hexapeptide which allows consumers to achieve a younger looking appearance; and bronze to Unipex with Capixyl, an active complex designed to prevent and stop the hair loss process and stimulate hair growth. This year's winners will be announced on Wednesday, November 7 from 18.30."
CPKelco launches two grades of y-polyglutamic acid with broadened functionalities,"The Aquamax™ range from CPKelco is the result of a collaboration with the South Korean company, BioLeaders Corporation, headquartered in Daejon. It comprises two grades: Aquamax™ HM with a high molecular weight (> 2000 kDa) and Aquamax™ LM with a molecular weight lower than 1kDa. Both feature very interesting properties. Research has shown the high efficiency of Aquamax™ on skin hydration. Due to its molecular structure, Aquamax™ HM captures and retains water 2,5 to 4 times more than hyaluronic acid, leaving a silky and soft film on the surface of the skin. The transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is reduced, the skin's hydration rate is increased, the natural moisturising factors (NMF) are boosted. According to CPKelco, compared to hyaluronic acid at 2000kDa, to a collagen at 300kDa or to a γ-polyglutamic acid from the market at 1000kDa, as part of an assessment, the performances of Aquamax™ HM at the hydration level are higher in the short and long term. But that's not all, since the studies conducted by CPKelco have shown that its Aquamax™ γ-polyglutamic acid-acts on the functionalities of hyaluronic acid by potentially inhibiting hyaluronidase, these enzymes that degrade hyaluronic acid. Thus, dosed at 0.004%, Aquamax™ stabilized at 92%hyaluronic acid. The AquaMAX™ LM grade due to its low molecular weight is best suited and a patent on this topic is pending. For sensitive skins, Aquamax™ LM reduces the expression of IL-1alpha, of MMP-1 and partly restores the loss of type I collagen generated by UVB exposure. While for its part, Aquamax™ HM has a calming effect on damaged skin by lowering the levels of IgE and of IL-4. Offering a soft and silky skin feel, these two materials come in the form of dispersible powders in a glycolic or alcoholic medium."
BYK-Gardner: measuring the material effects,"For several years, the dynamism of the market of colour cosmetics is accompanied by a mushrooming of material effects, glitters and pearls, for example, are increasingly part of the products' composition. Nail polishes, lipsticks, foundations, and to a lesser extent, mascaras often contain these multi-faceted particles. Even the skincare market is concerned, since some of these pigments can also be found in creams and serums. Valued for their aesthetic properties, these particles however raise some practical issues. Indeed, their multiple reflection, their particle size, the variety of possible orientations make the control of the good reproducibility of formulas in an industrial process sometimes difficult. BYK-Gardner GmbH, a company of the Division BYK Additives & Instruments from the German Group, ALTANA, specialized in the manufacture, production and after-sales service of equipments for the measurement, control and quality assurance of coloured materials actually took a special interest in effect products developed in cosmetics. ""Since its inception in 1962, BYK-Gardner has a strong presence in the automotive field where we are the leader for measuring brightness, haze and transparency. Cosmetics accounts for, according to countries between 10 and 20% of our turnover and represents a very complementary field to our core expertise. We have worked with the biggest names in beauty to come up with new solutions to help control effects products, based on our expertise and on the very specific demands of this industry. Apply and observe a product in a repeatable manner is essential, but with no suitable equipment, this goal is difficult to achieve. Unlike the automotive industry where it is easy to spread paint, cosmetics require different protocols for each product. The constraints of a lipstick are different from those of a nail polish but also of a foundation"" confirms Piéric Perret, Regional Sales Manager, BYK-Gardner France. BYK-Gardner offers its customers specific application methods. They are to be used with their new multi-angle spectrophotometer, the BYK-mac that measures the colour hue, the scintillation effects as well and textures. ""It is a highly efficient equipment, the only one that gives information on the Sparkle effect. It also makes it possible to create a electronic standard corresponding to a digital fingerprint of the reference thus avoiding its use and physical conservation. This feature is very popular with our customers in particular those with multiple manufacturing sites,"" emphasised Perret. Nail polishes, which are products very similar to paint are applied onto a contrast card or on false nails following a defined thickness. The contrast card displays a white side and a black side and it give information on the product's coverage ability. For the application of lipstick, an automatic applicator is used to spread a film of a defined thickness with a very good repeatability. To meet the different product viscosities, several tools exist The fact that it is a non-contact measurement, enables to be the closest as possible to the application of the product observed on the lips. For the bulk appearance, a spoon of the kind that is used for children syrups was developed. According to Perret, ""these new methods simplify the control of lipsticks, their implementation required significant R & D studies both in-house and with our industrial partners."" Powders, foundations, emulsions, mascaras also have specific non contact measurement supports. This encompasses many formulas even if some customers dream of going even further by measuring for example the colour of a lipstick directly on the raisin. ""All these methods enable to offer repeatable, fast and reliable measurements whatever the operator. We are continuing our researchwork on this subject to further facilitate the work of our customers,"" concluded Perret. BYK-Gardner also offers solutions for the measurement of haze (blur) and transparency with the haze-gard plus. Two very important data material to determine the soft focus effect of a material. With these methods within reach, controlling colours and effects will almost become a breeze."
Formulation of sunscreens: the right balance,"While the formulation of sunscreen products was at the heart of In-Cosmetics latest edition, an expert on this subject that we met, was explaining that in his opinion, ""the formulation of solar products was first a question of knowing how to take into account the various regulations."" As a matter of fact, given the challenge they represent in terms of public health, the regulatory framework for these products has been considerably reinforced. The content of the European recommendations of 22 September 2006 concerning the protection against UVAs, to which can be added the uncertain status of nanomaterials and the different geographical specificities, make the task of formulators particularly difficult. Things get even further complicated because of a still partial harmonization of in vitro evaluation methods. ""Within the European Committee for Standardization, a group is working on the creation, the updating and the harmonization of analytical methods for cosmetics, including sunscreens. The work of the ISO group on cosmetics comes in support. Concerning solar products, results may differ depending on the used protocols. That is why the creation of harmonized international and European standards will ease the work of formulators upstream. The Commission has already given a positive opinion for an in vitro measuring method of SPFs based on transmittance, at the level of their waterproof efficiency discussions are underway,"" summarizes Laurence Mulon, Consultant in strategy development and regulatory affairs. Another relatively recent constraint this one, is the requirement for each product to be efficient against both ultraviolet B rays (UVBs) and ultraviolet A rays (UVAs). During prolonged exposure, UVBs are the cause for sunburns while UVAs by penetrating deeper cause accelerated aging and may contribute to the development of cancers. Europe, via Cosmetics Europe, the organization representing manufacturers, the United States but also Asia, thus demands broad spectrum products. In Europe and in the United States, the requirement focuses on a UVA and UVB ratio equal to 1/3 with a critical wavelength of 370nm. A difficult balance to achieve when looking for high SPFs. It is to overcome this difficulty that Croda launched in 2010 the Solaveil SpeXtra™ range obtained from an exclusive and patented manufacturing process. The TiO2 used enables to have a efficiency on the entire UVA and UVB spectrum. These dispersions help, with no additional chemical filters or ZnO, to obtain high SPFs while respecting the 1/3UVA/UVB ratio. In 2011, the range expanded, with Solaveil XT40W, a dispersion in an aqueous phase thus leaving greater flexibility for the choice of the oily phase and possibly for the addition of chemical filters for very high SPFs. ""With Solaveil XT-40W, formulators can create high SPF natural sunscreens, complying with internationally approved EU recommendations, and with excellent sensory properties,"" emphasised Julie Saintecatherine, Technical and Marketing Coordinator at Croda. This range obtained the award for the best technology at the Cosmetics & Toiletries R&D Awards. For its part, the Zschimmer & Schwarz Group offers, under the name HelioPro, a wide variety of titanium dispersions also compliant with regulatory requirements. The HelioPro BSP 50L grade is very appropriate for the formulation of high SPFs with no organic molecules. As for Kobo, it offers UV Balanced Powder 100, an optimized titanium mixture of different sizes for the 1/3 ratio substantiation. In addition to broad protection requirements, the particle sizes offered by suppliers are broadening as a result of the uncertainty on the regulatory future of nanomaterials. Starting 1 January 2013, the European Regulation [1] will make it an obligation to mention on the list of ingredients those whose size is nanometric with the [nano] indication. The Commission's Recommendation of 18 October 2011 clarifies the definition of nanomaterials as ""a nanomaterial is a natural material which contains particles in an aggregate or agglomerate state, and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1 nm - 100nm"" [2] It is in this context that Kobo offers its Non-nano titanium and zinc range, whose name is unambiguous, with particle sizes higher than 100 nm available as powders or dispersions. At the In Cosmetics 2012 show, Kobo also showcased the ACT-50 composite, an innovative matrix of acrylates containing small size particles of titanium or zinc with a good efficiency, with no bleaching effect and preventing the re-agglomeration of particles and with a soft touch. But sun protection does not stop at UVAs or UVBs and some materials go even further. This is the case with Dermoprotectyl from Rovi, which offers a dual protection thanks to a multiple encapsulation system. This product consists of a mixture of chemical filters combined to a cocktail of vitamins C and E. The technology used enables to maintain filters at the surface of the skin while vitamins penetrate deep in the epidermis thus providing a second line of defence. Tayca, which is distributed in France by Unipex, positions itself with the MP100 a protection against infrared radiation (IR), these radiations that constitute most (55%) of solar radiation. It is interesting to note that Lancaster has incorporated into its new Sun Beauty line, a protection against IRs. Suppliers of active ingredients have also added to the array of possibilities newly developed molecules capable of fighting or repairing induced photoaging. Cosmetochem for example presented in Barcelona, Sereniks a natural extract of Tsuga Canadensis with anti inflammatory, antioxidant, properties and of protection against photoaging. Exsymol with OTZ10 offers a protection against UV and IR induced cell and skin damage. Its optimized bioavailability preserves the quality of skin layers. IRB with Buddleja Davidii Stems G, available in a titrated version in verbascoside is recommended to protect skin against UVAs with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and photoprotective properties. DSM broadens the concept of sun protection by working on the effects of exposure to sub-erythemal doses, i.e., UV doses lower than those leading to sunburn. ""At lower UV radiation doses, we are already able to highlight significant damage at the DNA, Langerhans cells level involved in the immune system, in collagen and elastin,"" emphasised Caroline Ploton, Regional Technical Marketing Manager. DSM recommends the use of Parsol SLX, a polymeric liquid filter that acts synergistically with Parsol HS, a water-soluble filter to reach high SPFs with a light and non greasy texture. PArsol 1789, a universal standard and the most efficient UVA filter, will be added as a complement to UVB filters. Another important challenge for formulators, although few brands communicate on this subject: products photostability. This ability of the product to keep its efficiency after sustaining a dose of light irradiation, is however very important. A photostable filter re-emits the absorbed energy without being degraded while a photounstable filter under a luminous radiation will fragment into free radicals, change conformation or join other molecules present in the formulation and lose in the process, its UV absorption potential. Several solutions can help such phenomena from occurring. HallStar, distributed in France by Arnaud-Azelis, is very active in this field. The American company proposes Solastay S1, a molecule of ethylhexyl methoxycrylene, known as an excited singlet-state quencher, that is to say, it can recover the energy absorbed by the chromophores of the UV filter before the latter destabilizes leading it to an excited triplet state or to a change in its structure into free radicals. This activity focusing on the singlet state level is innovative and enables to photostabilize sensitive filters like avobenzone, octyl methocycinnamate (OMC). The photostability potential is greatly increased: 3% of Solastay S1 enables a photostabilization of avobenzone in UVAs of 90% and of 98% in UVBs. For the avobenzone/OMC mixture, the photostabilization potential is of 80% in UVAs and of 84% in UVBs. This year, HallStar marketed Polycrylène S1 which adds water resistance capabilities to photostabilization. The obligation to provide information in connection with the photostability of sunscreens has not yet become a topical issue, but who knows what the future holds! Meanwhile, to help the general public be aware of the techniques and of the importance of sun protection, Croda has made available to consumers an educational website: www.solaveil.com. The website provides simple and clear information on the science of solar products. It has just been translated into French this year. No more excuses then for not understanding what are SPFs, UVAs, UVBs and other technical terms..."
Anti-aging: Laboratories target glycation,"Glycation is still drawing a lot of attention because the phenomenon observed on the skin is one of the reasons for skin aging. And staying young, we all know is a quest that seems eternal. The Laboratoires Jeanne Piaubert were among the first to have made an anti glycation claim, with in1996 the launch of the Certitude range. Since then, many players in cosmetics have invested this niche: Chanel, Clarins, Pola, La Roche-Posay and many more. And more are coming... ""It's a theme that reappears in a periodic manner every 3-4 years and on which we are constantly working to offer our customers the latest advances on this issue"" agrees Anne Laurie Rodrigues, Communication Manager for BASF Beauty Care Solutions, who has just put on the market the new active Collguard. For Jean-Claude Le Joliff, consultant and founder of the consulting and market-intelligence firm, INN2C, ""the advance and constant renewal of tests of objectivation on glycation are the drivers of its renewal."" Chemically speaking, glycation is the reaction of a sugar, glucose on the amine groups of amino acids constituting proteins. The result is the formation of compounds that lead to by-products named AGEs (Advanced Glycation End products). This reaction is non-enzymatic that is to say, it occurs spontaneously [1]. At the skin level, sugar-based molecules are found in the dermis where are also located collagen and elastin, two proteins that together form the ideal reagents for glycation. Furthermore, glucose in contact with metal ions and oxygen will form aldehydes who also will lead to the formation of AGEs. As a result of these two actions, glycation and oxidation, several types of AGEs are formed. Some, like pentosidine contribute to tissue stiffness by bridging the span between collagen fibres, others are toxins, like glycotoxines, that disrupt the metabolic activity of cells promoting the inflammatory processes, cell death but also an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the famous free radicals [2]. The result is an aging of the skin with the appearance of wrinkles, age spots and a loss in skin elasticity. Several approaches are proposed by active ingredient suppliers to combat these signs and recently some novelties have emerged. The solution proposed by Exsymol with the range of Silanols (Algisium C®, Argisil C®, Silysin C4®) consists in adding some molecules that will react on protein sites more quickly than glucose. Products that in addition, do not form covalent bonds with proteins and offer a very good bioavailability. Ichimaru Pharcos distributed by Laserson proposes Absorbage, an extract of Plantago asiatica rich in alcanoïdes and Marronnier Liquid b, an extract of Aesculus hippocastanum, which also enters into competition with glucose to limit the glycation reaction. Indena is present in this field with Centevita™ derived from the triterpene rich Centella asiatica. In a different way and to avoid the formation of toxic aldehydes, Lipotec with Dglyage™, a tetrapeptide conveyed in liposomes, targets metal ions by trapping them and thus making them unavailable for the oxidative reaction of glucose. Studies also show a protection of cells DNA. Mibelle with Ameliox a compound of carnosine, silymarin and natural vitamin E inhibits the formation of malondialdehyde thus reducing the glycation process. Another strategy developed by active ingredient suppliers is to focus on proteins and in particular collagen that stiffens after glycation leading to the loss of skin elasticity and the appearance of wrinkles. Silab with Antiglyskin®, an active derived from sunflower seeds, rich in phenolic acids and glucopeptides limits the bridging responsible for the stiffening of collagen fibres while also having an anti glycooxydation effect. Lipotec with Vilastène™, protects the lysine fragments of collagen and therefore limits the glycation reaction. BASF with Collguard™, an extract of Davilla Rugosa, a plant found in the Chinese pharmacopoeia preserves collagen through its anti-glycation, anti-radical and anti collagenase properties but also by supporting the synthesis of functional collagen. While, Greentech with Setiline®, an active derived from fenugreek using biotechnology preserves the skin structures by modifying the expression of specific genes involved in glycation phenomena. In parallel the active reduces the keratinocyte differentiation in the epidermis and thus improves the skin barriers. For the approach of glycation to be total, some suppliers have complemented the offer by proposing for Exsymol an active, Alistin® that acts as a protector of glucose and proteins but goes also further in the concept by ""de-glycating"" molecules helping them to regain their original form. The mechanism is based on a transglycation reaction from glycosylamine, which is the first step in AGEs. This year Exsymol has launched the paraben-free Alistin® P5 and completed its tests of objectivation by demonstrating that the active could also act as a detoxifier of glycotoxines. Ichimaru Pharcos, is also focusing on ""de-glycation"" with Shakuyaku, an extract from a Chinese plant, Paeonia Albiflora. Sederma with Prodizia™ addresses protein structures damaged by glycation. The active an extract of Albizia or silk tree, supports the cells detoxification systems at the proteasome and glyoxalase level. Since the first objectivation tests conducted on cell cultures, models have evolved with the addition of additional parameters and the possibility of performing them on skin explants. BIO-EC in partnership with MMP published in 2011 a study on this topic highlighting, on skin explants, the anti glycation activity of substances of plant origin, among which the raw materials offered by the company MMP, with Puerarin 80MM, an extract of Pueraria iobata titrated to 80% of Puérarine and Eucommia Ulmoides leaf extract 80MM, an extract of Eucommia titrated to 80% in chlorogenic acid [3]. ""The advantage of the model based on skin explants is to reproduce the skin reactions, we are the closest as possible to an in vivo situation"" emphasises Elian Lati, President of BIO-EC. Furthermore, this laboratory is pursuing is investigations in this field by studying the glycation of other proteins and not only of collagen or elastin. One may therefore come to the conclusion that the new developments around glycation are far from over..."
SEPPIC translates trends into cosmetic formulas,"SEPPIC wanted to enhance its range of ingredients and formulation expertise to its customers by providing a palette of inspiration and complete. The French producer of speciality ingredients thus partnered with the Carlin International style agency to identify next season's trends and transpose them into the cosmetics world. Four major consumer trends were initially analysed by Carlin and SEPPIC: – ""Interlude"" depicts and extends the ""vacation"" effect, – ""Hibernature"" reflects glacial beauty and extreme cold, – ""Manufacture"" modernizes the classicsgiving them a second life with a touch that is both vintage and modern, – ""Heroic"" embodies the heroes of ancient legends and fantastic tales, who dare to brave the unknown. SEPPIC adopted the ""Manufacture"" and ""Heroic"" concepts and translated them for personal care, renaming them ""Apothi'Care"" and ""Fantasy Paradox"". To transpose these concepts into cosmetics formulas, SEPPIC hosted creative workshops to bring together its international teams (Brazil, Japan, India) to create a lookbook of formulas adapted to the specificities of each geographical area thus serving as an international source of inspiration for creating new products. In order to adapt the Apothi'Care trend, which consists of revisiting the best elements of the past and modernizing them, SEPPIC created a customizable universal chassis formulation - which is the fruit of a clever combination of two flagship products from SEPPIC, Sepimax ZEN and Montanov L - and imagined seven example cocktails inspired by beauty traditions from around the world. With just one ingredient base, it is possible to create highly diversified formulas (moisturizers, after-shaves, capillary treatments, etc.). Through its exceptional stability, the chassis enables formulators to design solutions that are easy to scale-up, transpose and reproduce regardless of the active ingredients selected for the formulation. For instance, the addition of an active ingredient may impact the formula's viscosity, but not its stability. As far as the ""Fantasy Paradox"" trend is concerned, which is all about products that intrigue and project the consumer into a magical dream world, SEPPIC created three example formulas: Beauty Armor Blush (fluorescent, transparent, or rose hued upon application depending on skin pH), Ritual Primer (Bordeaux elixir, transparent upon application), and Black and Gold shower gel (black shower gel with gold particules). ""Through our new marketing approach of anticipating trends and our related formulas, we hope to assist formulators and marketers in their creative process and to be a veritable source of inspiration to them,"" explains Corinne Stolz, Marketing Director. Actually, with this in depth work, SEPPIC is addressing a demand from the market that is emerging with an increasing strength: the need for advanced consultations. While they are urged to multiply new developments, brands are increasingly in demand from advices from ingredients suppliers."
Impact Colors: staying ahead of the competition!,"Premium Beauty News - Impact Colors, is first and foremost a team! H. Douglas Thornley - You are right! It was to start with a highly motivated team and who had at that time no other choice but to embark on the adventure of starting a new business. We were not that young but could rely on a wealth of solid experience. Our network too. We decided that our mission would be to provide pigments and high quality ingredients to the skincare and cosmetic market worldwide. From the outset, the challenge was for us to propose technically advanced products that would have maximum impact on our customer base and the consumer market. Of course, we also wanted to focus on offering eco-friendly products and services with the use of ethical practices with regards to our customers, suppliers, staff, and, In general, to all of our professional community. But we also had to establish strong partnerships worldwide to secure a reliable distribution, have sufficient stocks so that shipments could be performed quickly. Premium Beauty News - Four years later, you have succeeded! But you have gone one step further in your business approach of the market. You understood that it was also necessary to anticipate the needs of your customers and become an expert of its own in future market trends! H. Douglas Thornley - This is indeed one of the main original features of Impact Colors. We take trends very seriously. Our business is all about the latest and most original application of color in personal care cosmetics and skin and hair care. The best way for our customers and the industry to imagine the possibilities of our glamorous pigments and eye-catching special effects colors is to see our lines used in adventuresome ways in products for lips, eyes, skin, and nails. Premium Beauty News - You propose every year a real Color trend book! And for 2013, the theme will be ""contradiction""! H. Douglas Thornley - contradiction in the influencers of trends and contradictions in the way color will be used to enhance beauty and individuality. It used to be that trends originated almost exclusively from famous people, entertainers, celebrities, or fashion icons. While these are still very strong influences, today's fashionable trends also originate with individuals on the street and work their way up to the runways and stage. In our presentation, we cite the example of a clever black and white jacket worn by Rianna in her video What's My Name. The jacket has the distinct boldness we would expect from a Prada piece, yet it is from the mass retailer H&M. Similarly, the classic colors are being applied in contradictory ways. Take red and black—the mainstays of lips and eyes. Five years ago, we were predicting that black would become a new standard for nails. It was hard to believe then, but here we are. Now we are anticipating seeing red shadow and liner for the eyes, and a move away from black to very dark blue, as that older standard emerges again. Color Trends 2013 delivers a comprehensive picture of the future color landscape through photography, voice, and video and then suggests how a portfolio of twenty-five of Impact Colors' advanced colors and effects can be applied to create cosmetics that express visionary trends. Color Trends 2013 is designed expressly to serve formulators, product developers, and marketing teams in the personal care industry by identifying bubbling trends and predicting future directions in fashion and color. It's fun and exciting to watch future trends unfold, but at the end of the day, the most important thing to our customers is developing new lines and products that their customers like and want. In Color Trends 2013, we offer specific ideas of how our color and special effects products can be combined to capture the vision of where color in cosmetics and personal care is going next. Color Trends 2013 pops with fresh ideas. Intense small-particle gold from the synthetic mica-based Fiesta Colors line produce a rich yellow that is wonderful for darker skin. A larger particle violet with shine and glitter blends into an eye shadow that is fitting for women of all ages, from cool to classical. Muted naturals with lots of white suggest powders in large compacts suitable for cheeks and eyes. The influence of metal shows itself in silver flecks and copper, a rich, warm highlighter. With Color Trends 2013, we bring a vision of the future to our customers' marketing and formulating teams. We then help them move that vision into reality with specific suggestions from our technically advanced lines of unique specialty color pigments. Premium Beauty News - And for 2014? H. Douglas Thornley - We are working on it. This will be the subject of a forthcoming interview."
Multifunctionality and genocosmetics emerge from the green wave at In-Cosmetics 2012,"The 2012 edition of In-Cosmetics, which was held from 17 to 19 April at Barcelona's Gran Via Exhibition Centre, recorded a total of 7,152 unique visitors in attendance, a 5% rise compared to the previous year. ""As ever, the international contingent was strong, with 70% visitors hailing from outside of Spain,"" the organizers announced. With 590 exhibitors, this edition was also the biggest ever, 10% larger than last year's record-breaking Milan show. Once again, In-Cosmetics proved to be the industry's annual launch pad for new personal care ingredients. This commitment to creativity was echoed at the Innovation Zone Best Ingredient Award, which saw Lucas Meyer Cosmetics scoop Gold for its new ingredients Progeline and Adipofill. This year again, green products were highlighted, with a host of new botanical alternatives to traditional synthetic substances, or through the use of green chemistry methods or supercritical carbon dioxide extractions. At Akzo-Nobel, for instance, the emphasis was put on the patented Zeta Fraction technology, a unique process developed by IBT, and recently acquired by the chemicals giant, that makes it possible to harvest and separate constituent parts of a living cell from any plant or marine source without requiring any solvents. ""The technology allows for the isolation of intracellular components in a manner that is reproducible, sustainable,"" said the company. Symrise in turn chose to highlight the efforts to offer the purest active ingredients possible. ""When there is no technical problem, we eliminate solvents and avoid diluting our products, it is a move towards more sustainability, allowing to decrease the transportation footprint by lowering the effective dose of the active,"" said Marielle Le Maire, Global Product Director, Life Essentials. However, the more common and mainstream naturalness and eco-friendly become the less differentiating they are. ""Green remains an underlying trend, but what we are increasingly asked is a more holistic offer, in particular with commitments for traceability or ethics. We guarantee that our products are from European and not from Asian origin,"" we were said at Quimica Masso, a leading Spanish distributor of specialty chemicals. There are plentiful and sometimes unexpected consequences. For instance, alternatives to palm oil become increasingly popular. Furthermore, techniques to obtain botanical actives without massively cropping plants, are growing rapidly, especially via the stem cell cultures. In the wake of the green trend, but also as an effort to reduce costs, formulators strive to simplify their products and reduce the number of ingredients. The supply-side response apparently consists in offering a growing number of multifunctional ingredients. For example, Alban Muller International, has launched a natural salicylic acid, extracted from wintergreen through distillation followed by hydrolysis in order to obtain a pure molecule. The particularity of this innovation: it comes out in two ingredients. On the one hand, Amipreserve, a completely natural, ecofriendly cosmetic preservative, ""the only on the market to be fully regulatory compliant"". On the other hand, Amiperfect, a cosmetic active dedicated to achieving a perfect, radiant complexion, thanks to its keratolytic, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory action. In-Cosmeticsdedicated an entire education session to cosmetogenomics, thus echoing numerous launches by exhibitors, such as Evonik with Tego Arjuna and Laboratoires Expanscience with Effipulp, among many others. The next In-Cosmetics event takes place in Paris, Hall 1, Paris Porte de Versailles, on 16-18 April 2013."
Stressful cosmetics that do you good,"""That which does not kill us makes us stronger. "" This reflection from Nietzsche could almost be applied to the hormesis concept. The term was first introduced in 1943 [1] to describe a dynamic property of the living ""high concentrations of toxic substances inhibit whereas low concentrations stimulate."" Everything is a question of dosage and regularity. It is important to know the limit beyond which stress whether physical, biological or chemical applied to a body no longer exerts a stimulating effect but a deleterious one. In practice and in everyday life, where the phenomenon of hormesis is evident is during physical activities [2]. As part of a regular and moderate practice of sport, substances produced by the body (free radicals, acids, aldehydes) will generate beneficial reactions, while these same substances can be harmful in high concentrations. This principle can also be found in calorie restriction or with the application of low ionizing radiations. It has been demonstrated [3] that the frequencies of chromosome breaks induced by waves were lower when cells were treated before with very low doses and even more so when a few hours separated the two irradiations. The regular repetition of low stresses allows the cell or even the whole organism to better resist a stronger stimulation. In the field of cellular aging, Prof. Suresh Rattan [4] is one of the pioneers in the development and use of the hormesis concept. He highlighted the hormétines, a class of natural and synthetic compounds that ensure a slowdown in the ageing process. Studies (5) were conducted on cell cultures to measure the impact of micro stresses regularly applied like as a temperature of 41°C during 1 hour two times a week or 50µM of rosmarinic acid or 0.25µM of curcumin. Responses show a strengthening of cell functions and a global anti-aging effect. All the explanatory mechanisms are not elucidated yet, but these micro solicitations could, result in the increased expression of some repair enzymes, enable the production of resistance proteins such as the HSPs, stimulate the proteasome activity, improve the sodium/potassium pump rate, and play a role in the expression of certain genes related to aging. It is on the basis of the work of Suresh Rattan that Givenchy launched in 2010 VAX'IN for youth, the first cosmetic product enriched with a complex of active ingredients made from Sanchi and hypotaurine, two hormétines which are likely to reproduce the hormesis phenomenon. By generating micro stimuli, skin cells produce in doses in proportion to their need, their own resistance protein to aging, the HSP70. In vitro tests show a 24% increase in its synthesis. Cells defence and repair mechanisms are reinforced, the skin resistance to the signs of aging is increased. An instrumental test performed on several women whose skin was subjected to aggressive washes showed a 30% improvement of the skin protection. This year, Givenchy has made another addition to the range VAX'IN for youth with a version specifically dedicated to the sensitive area around the eye. On the ingredient marketplace, it is Sederma who paved the way for a broader use of hormesis in cosmetics, with Resistem™, an anti-aging active derived from plant cell cultures. This year, Silab followed suit with Vitagenyl® These compounds reproduce the hormesis phenomenon leading to an increase in the cells defence capabilities. Resistem™ helps in particular fight against noci-products. Tested in vitro on keratinocytes stressed with hydrogen peroxide, a strong inhibition of intracellular peroxides was observed (-88% compared to control). The proteasome activity on the hydrogen peroxide stressed fibroblasts is also stimulated (+57% compared to control). Moreover, cellular longevity is increased with a 74% increase of the sirtuin-1 synthesis and tissue regeneration is boosted. It is the ""bodyguard"" of the skin, helping, through a virtuous circle to regain its natural beauty. ""To develop this product, we inspired ourselves with the work of Prof. Rattan who published a hormetic response profile corresponding to several characteristics of cellular survival and repair, Resistem™ demonstrates very good results on all criteria,"" confirmed Olga Gracioso in charge of marketing and communication for Sederma. For its part, Vitageny®, with a rich content in purified alpha-glucans obtained from peach leaves, stimulates the expression of Vitagènes involved in cellular homeostasis and coding such stress resistant proteins as the HSPs, the thorédoxine and sirtuin-1. Tested in-vitro at 1%, Vitagenyl® stimulates the viability of fibroblasts in nutrient deficient medium and their proliferative capacity. Vitagenyl® through its hormetic action helps cells be better prepared and equipped to combat against external aggressions. Vitagenyl® improves the regenerating potential and vitality of the skin. Both active are positioned as anti-aging and offer, in the wake of VAX'IN for youth, promising prospects for the use of the hormesis concept in cosmetics."
Increased consumer awareness impacts cosmetic actives development,"Savvy consumers influence savvy formulators. That is the conclusion of a recent report, titled ""Activism: Does the Consumer Drive Actives Development?"" by market research firm Kline & Company. According to Kline, consumers are becoming more informed and engaged and are raising expectations regarding personal care products. They ""invest in themselves"" and are ready to pay more, provided products offer specific benefits and visible results. ""Savvy personal care formulators understand this and are marketing their products by emphasizing their active ingredients to informed consumers,"" explains Nikola Matic, the author of the report. ""Label reading is no longer the exception and, coupled with easy access to information, consumers are making more educated choices. Clever marketing can certainly draw consumer's attention, but ultimately a product has to deliver,"" he adds. ""With a growing number of personal care products stressing the inclusion of active ingredients in their formulations, consumers are learning to differentiate between various actives and in turn seek higher-end solutions,"" writes Matic. As a consequence, no longer are specialty actives the preserve of women's prestige skin-care applications, their usage is growing in lower-end products. Increased awareness of the efficacy of actives among consumers also afforded specialty actives marketers excellent opportunities to diversify. Actives can now be found in products as diverse as hair-care, male grooming products, slimming, sun-protection and active make-up systems. According to Kline, hair care is the second largest market for actives, after anti-aging products with sales accounting for 15.7% of the US market and 9.1% of the European market. Not all ingredients benefit from the raise in consumer awareness. As a result of possible health hazards exposed in the media, some personal care ingredients have become undesirable. Examples include otherwise commonly used additives such as silicones or parabens. Conversely, positively endorsed ingredients such as vitamins, collagen, co-enzyme Q10 and, more recently, hyaluronic acid, are well perceived by consumers and marketers avail themselves of this fact by emphasizing these ingredients in their product communications. Green actives are those that have gained the greater advantage from the consumer Zeitgeist. Actually, the green trend has been driving the active ingredients market for over a decade. ""Specialty actives suppliers have accommodated this growth by developing natural sourced actives, and eco-certifying some of their products for the needs of fully natural brands. This has also resulted in the rapid growth of the botanical actives segment with an estimated CAGR of 4% expected in the United States by 2015, and 5% in Europe during the same period."" However, plant-based ingredients also are impacted by the consumer's quest for efficacy, and formulators are increasingly seeking to use botanicals as substantiated functional ingredients. This trend also benefits to natural-sourced biotechnology products. In maturing markets such as Western Europe and the United States, the combination of specialty actives and naturals thus appear as the ultimate growth driver."
"Which airless for which formula? Paris, 26 January 2012","If one refers to the definition given by a group of manufacturers, an airless is ""a device that will perfectly dispense a liquid, cream, or paste product from a rigid bottle avoiding any possible contamination from an external source (direct contact with fingers, air, etc.)."" Obviously, this technology is very interesting for protecting the sensitive actives of botanical formulations or for limiting the risks of contamination in the case of formulations with few or no preservatives. Its other main asset is to enable an optimum use of the product. Two main models of airless dispenser currently exist on the market; those with pistons or pouches. However, the interest of developers and consumers for these systems stimulates innovation. Suppliers have made important research and development efforts to reduce the cost of these packaging as well as their environmental impact. Others have worked at adapting the codes and materials of the luxury sector. Today, airless dispensers can even be found in hotels where they contribute to address cost containment and environmental impact issues, while protecting product formulations from contamination. However, the success of the packaging may mask real implementation problems: technical difficulties when it comes to ensuring truly sterile formulas, marketing difficulties when it comes to combining environmental concerns with dreams and desires of consumers, practical difficulties when the introduction of regulations such as REACH or consumer concerns make it necessary to replace certain substances. For an update on current issues of airless packaging and in order to explore the opportunities for future developments, Premium Beauty News will gather some of the best experts in this matter, on January 26 in Paris. Innovation, marketing and regulatory issues will be put in perspective and in discussions. Click on the image here below to download the list of speakers and the full programme of the conference:"
Managing the container/content interactions in cosmetics,"Premium Beauty News - Why are container/content interactions so important in cosmetics today? It is not something which has been discovered yesterday! Benoît Persin - Quite true, these phenomena have been widely studied in various sectors such as the food industry (where it is referred to as food contact) and the pharmaceutical industry. As I explained at the breakfast organized last September by the BeautyFull Club, the new EC Cosmetics Regulation 1223/2009 has introduced new concepts in this regard. [1] These interaction phenomena between the packaging material and the formula, can manifest themselves in different ways (Figure 1) either during the manufacturing, conditioning process, or during storage. They may have several consequences, visual or not, even under normal conditions of use: organoleptic modification of the formula or of the primary packaging, chemical modification of the formulation, etc. Modifications in connection with container/content interactions therefore potentially have an impact on the quality, efficacy and safety of a cosmetic product. The characterization of the packaging (including its stability and impurities and traces technically unavoidable) and the assessment of the potential interactions are key parameters to demonstrate that the packaging used is safe and does not interfere negatively on the formula. It is precisely in this context that the Regulation 1223/2009 asks to take into account this information! Premium Beauty News - How can this assessment be undertaken? Are there any official standards available? Benoît Persin - No, currently standards or study protocols are not (yet) available for the cosmetic sector. In fact the entire difficulty stands here in view of both increasingly complex and innovative cosmetic formulas and in attractive and efficient packaging articles. It is a real challenge for manufacturers. But not insurmountable, the critical parameters that come into play in this phenomenon of chemical interactions are well known: the composition of the material, the composition of the formula and its properties, the physico-chemical characteristics of the packaging components, the manufacturing and filling conditions the conditions of use and of storage, etc. Premium Beauty News - What is the consequence of this absence of standards or guidelines in cosmetics? Benoît Persin - The studies on the container/content interactions must be carried out under relevant and specific conditions. The ones Intertek undertakes for the industry are foremost based on a long-term collaboration where information exchanges are essential to perfectly understand the context (components, formula) and to correctly define its perimeter. [2] If the knowledge of the raw materials used for the packaging (origin of the substance, production process, etc..) is not sufficient, a comprehensive analytical testing will help provide a good basis to reach the final goal of assessing the potential toxicological impact of the material on the formula. Technical solutions tailored to the needs of the cosmetic industry can be proposed today to identify the nature of packaging (e.g. recycled copolymer...), its purity, its stability and the presence of possible components such as additives, dyes, plasticizers , solvents, antioxidants, etc.. Once the data is collected, the safety assessor will be able to quantify the potential risk. But again, as in cosmetics, guidelines do not (yet) exist, these interaction studies should be undertaken on a case by case basis."
Silab's innovation strategy rewarded,"Silab, a supplier of natural ingredients for the cosmetics industry, has just received the innovation award of the INPI (French National Institute of Industrial Property, Institut National de la Propriété́ Industrielle). This is a recognition for Jean Paufique, CEO and founder of Silab, whose watchword is, precisely, ""innovation, innovation, innovation."" The award, which celebrates its 20th anniversary in conjunction with the 60th anniversary of the INPI, aims to highlight SMEs that place innovation at the heart of their strategy for growth and value their R&D through Industrial property. This year, five SMEs and a laboratory were honoured for the exemplarity of their innovation strategy. Along with Silab, and also in the health and beauty sector, Cousin Biotech, a company specializing in medical prosthesis and implants, was also awared, as well as Nuxe, the natural cosmetics brand. Since its inception in 1986, Silab has been focusing on research and now invests 20% of its sales and one third of its workforce in research. The company has a portfolio of 163 patents and its research teams market two to three new products per year. The latest of its kind is Menofit, an active that is rich in purified peptides from artichoke leaves. Silab claims an original action regarding aging through a focus on menopausal skin. According to Silab, the Menofit helps compensating cells deficiencies in the dermis and epidermis, maintaining the thickness of the skin, increasing hydration and reducing wrinkles thus approaching the qualities of premenopausal skin. In vivo and in vitro objectivation tests support these results. With Menofit, Silab offers a new active addressing the problems of mature skins linked to the decline in female hormones. A product in sync with changing demographics."
AgiLab wants to take advantage of the boom in laboratories computing needs,"Premium Beauty News - AgiLab is a young company operating in a booming sector. Mohamed Ndiaye - It is true that we are witnessing a real explosion in the needs for IT solutions to serve the activity of cosmetic laboratories, mainly because of the strengthening of the regulatory framework. Many companies started business in the sector, often implementing solutions originally designed for the pharmaceutical industry. This is logical since this sector has long been tightly controlled. But solutions offered are more comparable to labyrinthine systems, not easily adaptable to varying needs. Renaud Acker - And this was precisely our goal when we created in 2009 AgiLab: to propose adaptable and customizable solutions, capable of addressing the specific needs of each company, particularly the needs of SMEs. We have set ourselves a goal to fill a significant gap in the operating mode of laboratories by providing them with an application to support both their business processes and decision-making at a truly affordable cost. It is because of the originality and relevance of the AgiLab project that we were handed the Award 'Paris Innovation', a business incubator supported by OSEO. Premium Beauty News - And to achieve this you rely both on a computing and scientific expertise. Renaud Acker - Both of us have a dual academic background. In my case, I hold a Graduate Diploma of Information Systems, but my basic training is in biology. I have long worked as a functional expert, then as an independent consultant and, as such, I participated in many projects in lab computerization, specially in the installation of IT solutions in major French and European pharmaceutical companies for biologists, chemists and pharmacists. Mohamed Ndiaye - My basic training is also in biology. I hold a Master of Science in Bioinformatics and of a second Master in management of innovative projects from IAE Montpellier. I was a LIMS project leader (Laboratory Information Management System) for several years. As such, I led several applications Integration projects of LIMS in forensics, in the pharmaceutical industry, fine chemicals and environment. Premium Beauty News - What does your offer consist of for cosmetics? Mohamed Ndiaye - We have developed two new products, tailored to the needs of companies in the cosmetics industry. First AgiLab Compliance, to manage the regulation pertaining to chemicals which are constituents of cosmetics or of chemical formulas. We will deploy a specific version of this module for the L'Oréal group. But it is also perfectly suited to the needs of SMEs. Then AgiLab Formulation, which helps manage ingredients, the composition of formulas, the formulation processes with the associated documents, with the help of formulation plans and to implement the traceability of ingredients required by the new European Regulation on Cosmetics. These are two complementary modules of AgiLims, our global solution for quality control and R&D laboratories. Our philosophy is to offer a hard core of functionalities that we adapt and customize according to the needs of each company. Renaud Acker - This hard core is relatively simple. Using the set of modules available we can easily meet the needs of both large groups and SMEs, and this in a very cost effective manner. With increasing regulatory constraints, and in particular the implementation of the European Regulation on cosmetics, to which companies must comply by July 2013, the needs of the cosmetic industry are considerable."
Lessonia: strengthening abroad,"Lessonia, the French specialist of ingredients and natural formulas, is strengthening its international presence by opening an office in Hong Kong. ""The purpose is obviously to be able to discuss more easily and directly with clients in the area, China, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Thailand,"" explains Christophe Wincler, the CEO of the company. Sébastien Guillotin will be in charge of the Hong Kong office which opened early October. The new branch complements the system already implemented in Mexico City and which is in charge of the entire American market including the United States, Mexico and, of course, Brazil, which is a priority for Lessonia. Also present at the Cosmoprof Asia, which was held in Hong Kong from 9 to 11 November 2011, the company based in Brittany, near Brest, also presented Luminous Rice, its new line, specifically designed for Asian markets. The range comprises 17 products, for the face and the body perfectly in line with the big current trend in Asian markets: the search for a flawless and uniform complexion. Also showcased on the stand of the company: a BB Cream and a range of peel-off masks for the face and the body. ""To facilitate the creation of their ranges, we also offer our customers to use pre-defined protocols, they can then complete according to the desired positioning,"" emphasised Wincler. An approach that has already proven its worth and helped Lessonia conquer significant market share in the spa segment. Finally, Lessonia plans to continue diversifying its offering in the field of natural make-up. ""We have a real legitimacy in this area, with an original and unique offer of natural pigments and quality textures."""
"Simulgreen 18-2, Seppic's new oil-in-water emulsifier","Well known for its emulsifiers originating from sugar chemistry, Seppic, a subsidiary of the Air Liquide Group, continues to innovate in this area with the launch of Simulgreen 18-2. ""The original fatty alcohol-based structure obtained from castor beans and grafted onto sugar imparts it with both technical and sensory performance,"" emphasises Alicia Roso, Emulsifying Product Agents Manager at Seppic. Effective from 2% in a wide pH range, Simulgreen 18-2 has the ability to emulsify a wide variety of oils including vegetable oils. The formulas obtained are consistent creams with a sophisticated texture without even needing to resort to acrylic type polymers. Upon product application and well after its total penetration the feeling of softness is omnipresent according to the sensory profile set up by a trained panel of volunteers. But in addition Simulgreen 18-2 has more to offer. It is particularly resistant to electrolytes, which is rare enough in the category of natural emulsifiers to be mentioned, and prevents the soaping phenomena every formulator dreads. Last but not the least, its capacity to promote lamellar phases facilitating long-term hydration of the upper layers of the skin. In the end, Simulgreen 18-2, of 100% vegetable origin, which is manufactured without any solvents or dangerous reactives, being biodegradable and preservative free is in perfect harmony with green chemistry principles."
Alpol : strengthening in dermo-cosmetics,"Alpol has recently obtained a conformity certification to ISO 22716 on good manufacturing practices in cosmetics. The French company who is specialized in the development of formulas, the manufacturing and packaging of cosmetics, has also completely renovated its production site, with in particular the creation of airlocks and the installation of an overpressure air filtering system. ""We have raised our standards of production to a level much higher than what is required and usually practiced in cosmetics,"" explains Philippe Faure, Director of Operations. Alpol, which is currently achieving 70% of its turnover in ""aesthetic"" cosmetics and 30% in dermo-cosmetics, also intends to significantly expand its business in this second segment. The objective being to manage to balance evenly the two poles within the group. In parallel to its pink brand, Alpol Cosmétique, the company has also developed a blue brand, Alpol Dermo-Cosmétique, and launched a range of five technical products, with a high concentration in objectified actives. Main asset of the French company in the dermo-cosmetic segment: an expertise in pleasure textures inherent to cosmetics. ""There are a lot of sub-contractors from the pharmacy sector in this market. They most often focus on actives but don't always offer textures suiting the expectations of brand's marketing services,"" emphasised Faure. ""Given the strong competition in this market, brands can no longer afford to be weak on either point. Consumers expect products that are safe and efficient but they also want to see formulas with some galenic innovation in them to increase their comfort in use."" A segment that follows very specific patterns, where the inclination for natural things is not as strong as in other cosmetics markets, even if eco-design remains a major concern, and where practices can be sometimes very close the pharmaceutical sector, in particular for the development of medical devices. Alpol, which employs 80 people, posted a turnover of 10.5 million euros in 2011 (fiscal year ending in September), up 21% over the previous year and exports its formulas in ten European countries and to the Middle East. The company who took part to the latest edition of Cosmoprof Asia also wants to continue its development in Asia."
"""The good, the beautiful, the authentic"" according to Yves Rocher","Premium Beauty News - In your speech at the Centifolia congress, you presented the first steps of a collaboration with Native American people - ""Men who care for the forest"" - and a exchange model that could be called a ""win-win"" model"". Despite this very worthy cause, don't you feel you could get involved ""more locally""? Xavier Ormancey - Yves Rocher has always encouraged local sourcing and especially Breton sourcing. 50 years ago, M. Rocher created in Britain an economy in connection with his business with the setting up of plants, with the organic farming on 55 hectares of more than 20 species of plants (chamomile, arnica, cornflower, matricaria, etc.) generating in the end more than 10,000 jobs in the region. The anchor point of the business is certainly Britain where our ""roots"" definitely are, but we also have ""wings"" that lead us to work in other countries worldwide. In a necessary approach of continuous improvement, Yves Rocher wants to use its plant sectors as levers to participate in biodiversity conservation and local development. We actually want to replicate the development model locally applied on our Breton site in La Gacilly to the other sourcing spots in Mali and Madagascar, for example. Yves Rocher has always been strongly determined in supporting the people and the local economy both in Britain and around the world. Premium Beauty News - The Centifolia congress highlighted the principles of collective intelligence, do you work with these concepts of co-creation? Xavier Ormancey - Within the company, a really close proximity exists since the research, communication and marketing teams are in the same building and share in particular the same coffee machine. In addition to formal interactions, meetings can therefore also occur in other places. Contacts are direct and permanent which also fosters co-creation. It is clear that scientists need to think about women who buy the product and they also must be able to feed marketing teems as a co-creation partner. Jobs must be decompartmentalised. Premium Beauty News - How does the customer realize that in buying a Yves Rocher product she is buying an ""authentic"" product that also makes sense? Xavier Ormancey - The customer is buying performance, efficiency, and pleasure through the sensory aspects of the product. But above all, the ethical dimension has been deeply rooted in the brand's DNA for 50 years. The Foundation Yves Rocher - Institut de France has existed for 20 years and supports a number of actions. For the brand's 50th anniversary, as part of the program ""Plantons pour la Planète"" (Let's Plant for the Planet), the Foundation has committed itself to plant 50 million trees across the world within 5 years. Behind the product the price of which also enables a broad accessibility, there is a sense that each customer can see. And we have 30 million customers worldwide."
"Centifolia 2011 - Beautiful, good and authentic: the perfect product","If you were used to attending congresses organized under a series of lectures punctuated by the usual set of questions and answers, surely this 8th edition of the Centifolia congress organized by the Club des entrepreneurs du Pays de Grasse would have surprised you. 150 delegates gathered for three days at the city's Convention Centre to build together ""the perfect product"". Everything was organized to foster exchanges and co-creation with World Café sessions (or ""Café découverte"") enriched beforehand by the informed testimonials of players operating in the cosmetic industry, but not only. Among speakers, some representatives of the profession like Xavier Ormancey (Yves Rocher), Marie-Laure Simonin Braun (Dessange), Claudie Ravel (Guayapi), Georges Ferrando (Albert Vieille) as well as visionaries like Arnaud Poissonnier (Babyloan), Gildas Bonnel (Si#), gathered around Jean-François Noubel (Collective Intelligence Research Institute), one of the pioneers in collective intelligence and the conductor of this atypical congress. To create the perfect product - and isn't it everyone's goal? - integrating notions of beauty, good and authentic, at all stages of creation is the challenge that Centifolia wanted to take up. For Guillaume Flavigny, perfumer at Givaudan, ""the first ingredient to create something beautiful is the love one has for his raw materials."" Beauty adds Ngub Nding President of Ephyla must be made of consistency, ""it is necessary to bridge the gap between ideas that are thought beautiful and good and the materials used which are often low-end"". Beauty coming from within, always shines out. As for good, it is the image that is echoed back to us by the product, ""if it does good to everyone"", emphasises Jean-François Noubel (CIRI). Values in connection with sustainable development, fair trade, respect of ecosystems all have their place here. ""Let's be close to Nature's knowledge, let's tap into it without exhausting it"", Claudie Ravel, CEO of Guayapi, strongly believes it is the motto to remember. Authenticity refers to a product that holds no lie, as emphasised Gildas Bonnel, President of the agency Si#. ""The necessity of authenticity is more than ever a topicality, we all have become much listened, followed, and credible media, much more than the discourse of companies."" Authenticity does not mean perfect, but it is just a product that assumes its strengths and weaknesses and who dares claim them in full transparency. ""Imagine the consequences if your brand became fully transparent and authentic"" was actually a theme worked on in a World Café. From ""all truths are not good to say"" to ""a tremendous energy will be released by being authentic"", delegates reflected on this issue and some of them even lifted barriers. Interactivity, co-creation, the awakening of consciousness were at the heart of this 8th edition of Centifolia, a different convention where everyone was there to learn but also to enrich the experience of others, be it colleagues or competitors. ""A beautiful spirit of trust and sharing prevailed during these three days"", according to Xavier Ormancey, R&D director of Yves Rocher and co-organizer of the event. For some participants, a downside however: the absence of decision-makers and marketers, which limits partly the musical setting of the notes selected for this congress. ""Companies, who used to consider the product as the key concern, have transformed in recent years by considering the customer at the key concern and will transform again in the future by focusing mainly on human beings"", concluded a congressman. And for most of the participants, the congress did not end on the evening of October 21st, each participant in his way wanting to lay, as soon as possible in his daily life a few stones in the foundation of beautiful, good and authentic. It is also possible to follow these constructions on the Facebook page of the congress."
Colombia to invest in the cosmetics industry,"The increasing trend in organic and natural ingredients in cosmetics may make of Colombia a key player in this sector. In any case, this is what believes the country's authorities, which are determined to sustain an industry currently in a structuring phase. The cosmetic and hygiene products industry is indeed one of the twelve sectors targeted by the national development program ""Transformación Productiva"", launched last August by the President of the Colombian Republic, Juan Manuel Santos. The development plan for this sector does not hesitate to look (very) far ahead! As of 2012, priority will be given to Colombia's customary markets, namely its regular customers and its major trading partners. Then as of 2019, to the creation of more demanding products for new markets. Finally, in 2032, a special emphasis will be put on a continued international development and on the establishment of the recognition of Colombian natural cosmetics. According to Colombia's Chamber of Industry of cosmetics and toiletries (Cámara de la Industria Cosmética y de Aseo de Colombia), the country's exports for this sector were multiplied by ten in ten years. With US$683 million in 2010 [1], Colombia is one of Latin America's leading exporters. The reasons for this success are many: a skilled workforce [2], a climate offering the possibility to produce throughout the year and provide the European markets outside their production season, a unique biodiversity since Columbia is the world's second richest country in terms of variety of flowers species (51 2203) after Brazil. Finally, the country can take advantage of a huge market potential, with the second best growth in the area in 2010. As a matter of fact, Columbia attracts cosmetic multinational companies that represent 75% of the total market, and generate alone 81% of industry sales. For example, Reckitt Benckiser has been established in Colombia for more than 60 years. ""Whether for the opening of factories, of distribution or R&D centres, hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested by a number of international firms since almost five years,"" observes Proexport Colombia, the body in charge of supporting Colombian companies on foreign markets. Unilever chose Colombia for the creation of three production plants (Bogota, Cali and Palmira Valle) and a regional distribution centre for an investment of $31.5 million. Procter & Gamble invested $25 million to open its new 150,000m² distribution centre in Rionegro. Avon invested between 50 and 60 million dollars for its 28,000m² ""green"" distribution centre. Are also present groups like Yanbal, Belcorp, Henkel, Beiersdorf. The Cámara de la Industria Cosmética y de Aseo de Colombia has signed in July an agreement with the Cosmetic Valley, the French competitiveness cluster comprising companies and universities. This agreement provides for the exchange of industry information, the mobility of researchers on an international scale, the setting up of business alliances and partnerships both for research and training. Camilo Martinez, director of Proexport Colombia, believes that ""the signing of this agreement is a significant step due to the fact that the French market is the first global player in the cosmetic industry, not only is the market an international benchmark, but it is also a springboard to the European market"". Moreover, height Colombian companies (Neyber, Waliwa, Kahai, Lail Cosmeticos, Laboratorios Francol, TropicOil, Cooparmayo and Biocate) participated to the latest edition of Beyond Beauty Paris where they showcased their natural ingredients: essential oils, aloe vera, avocado, passion fruit, basil or oregano."
Research finds certification is key for trusting cosmetic brands on natural claims,"With the help of a chartered chemist, Organic Monitor assessed the composition of over 50 international brands of natural cosmetic products. The market research firm then ranked the brands in terms of their ""naturalness"". The study found that, apart from certified products, the formulations of most brands are not meeting marketing claims. Organic Monitor says that many companies claiming to have 'chemically-clean' cosmetics actually are falling foul of having contentious synthetic ingredients, even when they contain some certified organic substances. For consumers, certification is the most reliable means to estimate the credibility of natural and organic claims made by cosmetic brands the research highlights. Brands with high levels of certified products received the highest naturalness scores. Indeed, standards - such as Ecocert, Cosmébio, Soil Association, BDIH, NPA and NaTrue - provide clear definitions of what they consider as natural or organic cosmetics, as well as lists of ingredients and processes they approve. The research also points out that naturalness and certification are no longer a specificity of small niche brands. Epitomising the evolution of the market, certified mass products launched by large multinationals also scored high in terms of their natural and organic formulations: Garnier Bio Active (L'Oréal), Diadermine Bio Expertise (Henkel) and Johnson's Natural (Johnson & Johnson). In contrast, the research questions fair trade certification as possibly confusing. Actually, most fair trade cosmetics assessed by Organic Monitor received low naturalness ratings because of high level of synthetic substances. Indeed, most fair trade standards only focus on fair trade ingredients and do not address formulation issues, with no list of approved or prohibited synthetic ingredients. According to Organic Monitor fair trade seals can be deceptive when brands focus their claims on their fair trade natural ingredients. Organic Monitor also found important variations between geographic regions, partly correlated with the adoption rates of natural and organic standards. European brands achieved the highest scores, North American brands ranked second while brands in other regions generally receive lower ratings. ""Although a growing number of Asian and Latin American brands are emphasising their natural – and in many cases, indigenous – ingredients, the formulations are usually high in synthetic preservatives, emulsifiers and other ingredients,"" said the firm in a release. According to Organic Monitor, Latin American and Asian brands are lacking of experience with green ingredients. ""Many Asian companies are not accustomed to using the new palette of green ingredients, preferring to use familiar synthetics in their formulations,"" commented Judi Beerling, head of Technical Research. To address the formulation issues associated with natural and organic cosmetics, Organic Monitor is dedicating a workshop and seminar programme to this subject at the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, taking place in Hong Kong on 7-8th November, 2011."
Formulating without parabens? Alternatives to handle with care,"The second part of the information day on the ways to develop paraben-free formulas, organized by Premium Beauty News, with the participation of Mulon Conseil (a overview of the first part is available here), reviewed the alternative ingredients to parabens while also highlighting the difficulties associated to their implementation. As emphasised Stéphane Sellam, Regulatory Affairs and Technical Service Manager for Thor, ""70% of the protection for cosmetic products, these last 20 years, has been provided by parabens."" Their very good resistance to high temperatures, their antimicrobial efficacy, their relative safety, their ease of formulation, turned them into unavoidable preservatives, until recently. But successive controversies have arisen consumers awareness. A trend which, as stated Ev Süss, Regional Business Manager for Symrise, has spread throughout Europe. ""Originating from an issue raised in Denmark six months ago, now most European countries are asking us to find alternatives to parabens."" Alternative solutions require a lot of know-how and creativity from manufacturers. Some are self-sufficient, but others must be combined to traditional systems of preservation or to the appropriate packaging. ""Unfortunately, there aren't any universal solutions and work must be carried out on a case by case basis with regard to the type of formula to protect, its nature, its pH, its method of use"", pointed out Jean-Pierre Arnaud, CEO of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Each supplier has its own ""home-made"" recipe based on its know-how. Dr Straetmans like Symrise offer customized glycol- and alcohol-based mixtures with a therefore broaden spectrum of activity. As for Inolex, it relies on the ""Hurdle"" technology to develop the range of caprylhydroxamic acid-based Spectrastat. ""Our product has been formulated to create a hostile environment against microorganisms, we act at such levels as, water activity, pH, concentration of metal ions and on the membrane of microorganisms"", explained Lydia Heldermann, Sales & Marketing Manager Europe. The Thor company, meanwhile, recommends using the non-listed molecules only in addition to conventional preservatives. This is how it has developed the range of Microcare MTD family made from methylisothiazolinone. These alternatives to parabens with an initially diverted functionality - because they consists either of emollients, co-emulsifiers, solvents, or aromatic molecules - should have a proven safety. Yet, a number of molecules have low toxicity records, representing an additional challenge with significant financial consequences. To date, only in-vivo tests are available to assess the sensitizing potential of a product. By 2013, with the announced end of these tests, alternatives will need to emerge. As Jean-Luc Garrigue, BIOAGRI Europe Director explained, ""alternative isolated tests will never be able to take account of all the events involved in biological processes"". From raw materials, to new formulation concepts, including appropriate packagings, such as Aptar's Irresistible distribution system, and the available support, for this approach, of Intertek, a company that can provide a whole range of tests to qualify preservative-free products, ""everyone is seeking help from its cortical brain to rethink its universe,"" concluded Laurence Mulon."
Formulating without parabens? Hurray for creative chemistry!,"An information day organized by Premium Beauty News, with the participation of Mulon Conseil, gathered on 6 July more than 50 formulation specialists, brands and suppliers, all concerned with the uncertainties surrounding some ingredients in use in cosmetic products. And in particular, the famous parabens, regarded in 2004 in a suspicious light by some scientists, banned in products for children under 3 years in Denmark in 2010, under sustained criticism in France and threatened of being banned by a bill of law in May this year, but also weakened by this gigantic green wave for organic and natural products. To cope with the increasing level of consumer awareness, brands are striving to find new solutions and the appropriate alternative to these widely used ingredients in cosmetics due to their antimicrobial efficacy andtheir safety in use. After an overview of the regulatory status of concerned substances,Laurence Mulon listed the solutions already in use: products authorized by some standards on natural and organic products (some preservatives included on a positive list) but also new approaches and alternatives, such as sterilization, airless or single-dose packagings, self-protection of the formula (with ingredients imparted with microbiological properties, without being however considered preservatives), regulation of the pH in emulsions, reduction of the water activity, addition of alcohol, etc. André Jean Brin (AJ Brin Consulting), with its expertise in this area, shared some thoughts on the pitfalls and options. Be very knowledgeable in raw materials, in their composition, in their microbial properties but also in water properties, ""because the risks are increased when there is a important water content in a formula."" Prefer the use of raw material with bacteriostatic or bactericidal properties, such as ylang-ylang, or of ""preservative-like"" actives such as sorbic acid, while validating their total safety and approval for use in some markets. Prefer prevention to emergency, think about side risks, study the stability over time, ""try to maybe find the right combination, but will it feature the appropriate cosmetic properties? The consumer will provide the answers!"" A consumer that urgently needs to be educated on its own role regarding the contamination of cosmetics products! Régine Frick, an engineer in formulation chemistry and an expert in innovation, has plunged us into the science of language with its constraints and evolution. A profession that requires expertise, process, and some responsiveness to budgetary and regulatory contingencies but also to market trends. Hence, the minimalistic approach, bordering quintessence in today's formulas, to only retain the essential and the safest. Not to speak of Formulation Raisonnée, an exciting experimental approach developed in the 1920s, which consists in ""deconstructing the formula's skeleton taking into account the ingredients physical and chemical properties and performances, to better combine them together, focusing on the more functional ones and avoiding redundancies."" A revolution that requires, thorough reflection, to observe raw materials differently, and to use a program like Nimrod to streamline the testing phases and assess the maximum impact of an ingredient versus a desired result. A tool that helps solve problems, simplify formulas, reduce deadlines and costs, but also open new avenues for innovation and creativity, and why not, anticipate a future trend"". ""A strategy where maximum data is collected with the help of minimum tests."" Confronted to this methodological opportunity Ngub Nding (Ephyla) has rightly addressed the human side of the issue. ""Let's take this opportunity of having to formulate differently to develop our ability for change, formulate like if it was the first time, but more importantly, get started right now."" And never forget the creative dimension of chemistry, which enables to enhance some ingredients with new biological properties. As Ephyla recently did with clay, by increasing and enriching its inter layers. Think outside the box too, by imagining that alginates, clay, lipophilic solvents, but also dry steam, abrasives, probiotics and enzymes can replace surfactants in a washing product. But avoid alcohol, and a hygienist approach... All this requires to totally change one's beliefs so to give free rein to imagination and rationality, investigate galenic innovation, take an interest in biomimetic strategies."
Brenntag: New guide formulations,"The Application Laboratory of Brenntag Spécialités, dedicated to cosmetic products, proposes two new guide formulations: a concrete with a fruity and delicious fragrance, and a light and non-sticky emulsion. The perfume concrete [1] has been formulated in a soft and non-sticky texture. The fragrance, which is distributed by Brenntag Specialités, is fruity, floral and delicious, with fresh head notes of licorice. The oil in water emulsion is a light, easy to spread and not sticky formula [2]. The goal is to provide users with a smoothly sensation, thanks in particular to its rapid penetration into the epidermis. ""The Sympatens O/2500G, a nonionic emulsifier natural, makes a great addition to this formula,"" said Marion Mouchonnet, head of Brenntag's laboratory for cosmetic applications. ""Indeed, the addition of a co-emulsifier is not necessary for its use. It can be added either in the oily phase or in the aqueous phase. The icing on the cake is that it is certified by ECOCERT."" Brenntag Spécialités opened the doors of its Application Laboratory for cosmetics in early 2011. The facility is located in Amiens, North of France. The lab has already formulated and proposed a series of products (an exfoliating gel based on cork powder, a sweet oil for the bath, an organic [3] emulsion, etc…) from the various ingredients distributed by the group in France. ""Our goal is to suggest ideas and propositions for almost all the categories of cosmetics,"" added Marion Mouchonnet."
How to formulate without parabens?,"The vote by French deputies of a bill of law that would prohibit, the use in consumer products, of certain families of substances classified as endocrine disrupters really stunned the cosmetics industry. Indeed, after a quick inventory of their formulas, many brands have realized, with serious concerns, that the cost of possible ban of phthalates, parabens and alkylphenols would be astronomical. For most companies, parabens are obviously the core of the problem: actually this family of preservatives is widely used in many products. But ""the reformulation of products currently preserved with parabens and the use of new solutions imply to recreate entirely new formulas that to be re-assessed both in terms of stability and safety,"" highlighted COSMED, the association of French SMEs in the cosmetics industry. ""The financial and human resources to devote to this mutation are considerable,"" added COSMED. However, in the minds of consumers, this ""penalizing media burst"", as COSMED called it, almost completely destroyed, to the deep regret of the French Federation of beauty companies (FEBEA), ""the presumption of innocence"" of which these substances continue yet to benefit from a large number of scientists. Actually, scientific studies indicating possible health effects of parabens, as well as the vote of French deputies, benefitted from a huge media response that is strongly orienting the market. The rationality of consumers is not the as scientists. Indeed, it is virtually impossible for consumers to quantify the actual risk without relying upon experts whose credibility has been badly affected by the succession of health scandals. So, as soon as a risk exists, however small it seems, and as soon as there is an alternative offer, purchases are ""naturally"" reoriented ... the only limit being the substitutability of products. Eventually, manufacturers are trapped by a demand that is growing faster than alternative technical solutions. Certainly, many ingredient suppliers have marketed new substances, or cocktails of substances, in order to replace parabens. But the price of these ingredients is often much higher than that of parabens and, most importantly, they cannot just replace parabens. Indeed, the entire balance of the formulation needs to be reviewed and, sometimes, its is necessary to consider packaging change or even to modify the manufacturing process, for example by opening clean rooms. In order to clarify all these issues, Premium Beauty News has proposed to key players iof the cosmetics industry (expert formulators, ingredient suppliers, toxicologists, consultants and brand owners) to share their solutions and exchange on their experiences during a conference day that will be held on the 6th of July in Paris. Among the topics that will be discussed by the panel of experts gathered on this occasion: formulation challenges, protection from the packaging, new available ingredients, new safety issues, etc. The full program and registration details are available here below:"
ID bio launches a new organic range of titrated extracts,"Presented for the first time during the 2011 edition of the In-Cosmetics tradeshow in Milan, the TitrExtract range launched by ID bio aims wants to address new needs of natural-ingredients based formulations. Titrated extracts, also named standardized extracts, are botanical extracts with a bibliographic claim and in which a molecule or a molecule family, usually the one thought to be the active compound, is identified and titrated. The extract is processed so that that the supplier can ensure it contains a specified amount of the said molecule. According to ID bio, this enables to ensure the reproducibility of the effect claimed. Actually, said ID bio, titrated extracts are ""at the crossroad of standard extracts and actives."" They help to comply with the provisions of the new European regulation on cosmetics which, starting from 2013, will require suppliers of botanical extracts to provide safety and efficacy assessments for their products. ""Titrated -standardized- extract perfectly answers the current regulatory issues faced by the formulators,"" explained the company in a release. The TitrExtract range is composed of four extracts that are 100% certified organic by Ecocert: – A red vine extract titrated in flavonoids, that claims a vascular remodelling effect, – A ginseng extract titrated in saponosides expressed as ginsenosides, claiming revitalizing and tonifying actions, – A marshmallow extract titrated in pectic substance expressed as neutral carbohydrates and uronic acids, claiming bio-adhesive and remoisturizing actions, – A spearmint extract titrated in carvone, for an antioxidant action and a cellular detoxifying effect. Created in 1993, ID bio has a renowned expertise in custom-made botanical extraction. The company will enlarge this range over the months thanks to product developments notably coming from internal innovation."
Naturex launches Amazonian active for rejuvenation,"Naturex latest development for the personal care industry is derived from a variety of Dragon's Blood obtained from the Croton lechleri tree, which is the primary topical aid for skin care in the Amazon rainforest. Injuries of all kinds can benefit from the application of the healing red latex derived from this tree. Dragon's blood is a substance known from the Antiquity that can be obtained from various tropical and Mediterranean plants. ""It helps to protect the skin, due to its high content of proanthocyanidins, providing a powerful antioxidant activity. Dragon's Blood extract, standardized to taspine, stimulates the early phase of the wound healing, by stimulation of the fibroblasts. Dragon's Blood sap helps to protect the cells of the skin and regenerate the whole tissue,"" explains the company in a release. According to the French supplier of natural ingredients, in vitro and ex vivo studies, demonstrate that its Dragon's Blood extract improves the stratification and quality of the new epidermis and contributes to a complete reparation and regeneration of the tissues, for skin rejuvenation. Furthermore, Dragon's Blood sap is rich in antioxidant phenols and can protect cells from oxidative stress. Naturex Dragon's Blood extract can therefore be used to rejuvenate the skin, to prevent or treat the signs of aging, to protect the skin against environmental aggressions like wind, cold, dry air and pollution, or to normalize stretch marks. ""Tropical environment yield many plants that offer benefits to health. The Amazon rainforest provides a wealth of traditional botanicals that demonstrate significant benefits to the skin when topically applied,"" told the company. Naturex has applied its expertise to identify the best sources of certified raw materials that are effective in application whilst also being respectful to the environment. They obtain their Dragon's blood by cutting the bark in diagonal manner and bleeding the latex. This method is employed by the locals to help preserve the trees, allowing Naturex to supply a renewable resource."
Clariant wants to lead the way to paraben-free preservation,"At the end of 2010, the decision of Danish authorities to ban propyl and butyl parabens in products for children under the age of three, and the recommendation by the EU's Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) to restrict their concentration to 0.19% in all cosmetic formulations have confirmed the urgent need to find efficient alternatives to the use of paraben-based preservatives. In order to help cosmetics manufacturers to respond to these restrictions as well as to address increasing consumers' demands towards lower preservative levels, Clariant has developed alternatives that can be used in a wide variety of formulations. Presented on the occasion of the latest edition of the In Cosmetics trade show in Milan, the Velsan SC preservative booster is based on natural raw materials. Falling within Clariant's EcoTain range focusing on naturally-derived and sustainable products, and also approved by Ecocert, one of the main certification body for natural and organic cosmetics, Velsan SC is a new 100% based natural hydrotrope and emulsifying agent for cosmetic formulations. According to Clariant, the Velsan SC acts as a synergistic aid to boost the performance of standard preservatives, like aromatic alcohols and organic acids. ""As a result, it decreases the overall amount needed for safe preservation, thereby reducing the odour issue known from some preservatives."" When used in combination with non-listed actives, it may also help manufacturers to formulate ""preservative-free"" cosmetic and personal care products. In the segment of paraben-free preservative blends, Clariant proposes the Nipaguard PO 5 and Nipaguard POB, based on Piroctone Olamine and Phenoxyethanol. The chemical company claims these alternatives have a comparable and even better performance than classical paraben blends with excellent long-term antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria, yeasts and moulds from pH 4-10. ""These PO blends are especially suitable for the preservation of creams, lotions, sun screens, deodorant formulations, cream rinses, shampoos, shower gels, and liquid soaps,"" explained Clariant in a release."
Alban Muller brings the benefits of plants into make-up,"According to Alban Muller, today's make-up products not only colour and make consumers more attractive but they also have expanded their role by offering cosmetic properties (moisturising, anti-ageing, antioxidant, etc.) and, of course, they increasingly bet « on natural values. » « To match these two key-trends of make-up market, plant extracts are perfect and become the true must-have active ingredients, » says the French supplier. Thanks to a unique technique of adsorption on microporous silica, Alban Muller propose its customers to adapt its liquid cosmetic ingredients to the specific formulation of make-up powders. ""They can thus create their own Ami-caps from one of our numerous Phytamis (more than 160 eco-designed plant extracts) and high-tech actives. The principle is easy: they select an active and our laboratory experts adapt it to create their Ami-caps,"" says the company. When applied on the skin with the powder, the extract is naturally released on contact with the skin through a phenomenon of slow adsorption-desadsorption between molecules with different polarities: water and the extract. The Ami-caps can be incorporated into any powder formulation, pressed or loose (blush, eye shadow, face powder, bronzer, etc.) and thus make-up powders can claim to have cosmetic activities!"
In-Cosmetics turns into green,"For those who visited the In-Cosmetics trade show, which was held from March 29 to 31 in Milan, Italy, there is little doubt that sustainability is riding high on the cosmetics industry agenda at the moment. Actually, visitors to this year's In-Cosmetics were being offered the opportunity to find out focuses and showcases on sustainable cosmetic ingredients and the sustainable sourcing of raw materials. A ""Sustainability Gallery"" sponsored by Beraca, was promoting some of the industry's most sustainable initiatives and was featuring a selection of companies with a green story to tell. Explaining how the companies participating in this gallery were selected, Cathy Laporte, In-Cosmetics group marketing manager, said ""there are companies who have a sustainability policy just because they think they should. Then there are companies for whom green practices are the cornerstone of their business."" Among them were: – Active Organics, a company focused on environmentally compatible harvesting, manufacturing and distribution of innovative natural products. – Arizona Chemicals, the world's largest bio-refiner of pine tree extracts. The line of 97% bio-renewable polymers - Sylvaclear and Uniclear - offer broad functionality as film formers, water-repellency agents, polymeric emulsion stabilisers, structuring agents, rheology modifiers, pigment stabilisers and actives delivery systems in the personal care industry. – Dr Straetmans Chemische Produkte, which was presenting its Dermofeel GSC palm oil fre, an economic emulsifier that protects biodiversity by using locally sourced rapeseed oil, thereby reducing unnecessary transportation. Also taking part in the Sustainability Gallery were: AzkoNobel, Arch Personal Care, Gattefossé, GreenPalm, Honeywell International,Laboratoires Expanscience, Lipotec, Biointec, and Oleon. Beraca, the Brazilian-based supplier of organic and natural active ingredients, was the official sponsor of the In-Focus feature at In-Cosmetics 2011. On this occasion, the company, which recently became a member of the Union for Ethical Bio Trade, partnered with L'Oréal-owned brand Kiehl's to present a tunnel-shaped stand named ""Beraca Experience"". The company was featuring the ethical and sustainable sourcing of acai, one of its most famous ingredients, which is used by Kiehl's as a super-antioxidant and skin damage repair in a skincare collection. ""Each stage of the açai supply chain is traceable and sustainable,"" said Filipe Sabará, Business Director at Beraca. ""Environmental preservation, corporate social responsibility, and sustainable sourcing of ingredients are the philosophies that have guided Beraca's practices since its inception,"" he added. Among the multiple green ingredients showcased at In-Cosmetics, alternative preservatives were particularly highlighted. These substances are useful to replace ingredients with bad press, such as parabens and are also adapted to would-be ""preservative-free"" or ""self-preserving"" formulas. While not being listed as a preservative in the European regulation, they may have a secondary function that helps to extend the longevity of a cosmetic product and prohibit the growth of harmful bacteria. The US-headquartered Inolex Chemical Company, for instance, presented six paraben-free substances based on a mix of caprylhydroxamic acid (CHA) and a secondary ingredients. Each of the substances was designed to address the specific requirements of various formulations types."
Symrise focuses on parabens alternative and natural ingredients,"Symrise claims that its new ingredient Hydrolite 6 boosts the preservative efficacy of mild organic acids such as potassium sorbate and dehydroacetate, thus making the use of parabens and other controversial preservatives unnecessary. The Hydrolite 6 therefore offers an interesting alternative to manufacturers of skin care products for children, in a context where Danish authorities have banned propyl and butyl paraben in cosmetic products for children under the age of three, and where consumers increasingly favour natural and preservative-free products. According to Symrise, Hydrolite 6 would also be efficient to increase skin's moisture content. Nearly odourless and colourless, it is suitable for most cosmetic systems and complies with US, European Union (including Danish), Japanese and Chinese regulations. ""The initiative started by the Danish government on paraben-free skin care products for children confirms that we pursue the right path with our high quality ingredients that support health and well-being. In particular, we thereby include consumers' desire for both skin-friendly as well as highly active ingredients,"" explains Ravikumar Pillai, Global Product Director Actives Symrise's Life Essentials division. To respond to the growing demand for natural ingredients, Symrise Life Essentials business unit is focusing on innovative botanical active ingredients with anti-aging properties as well as on its new vegetable and grain extracts. These products are Symrise's response. Symrise wants to place nature at the centre of its participation in the upcoming In-Cosmetics tradeshow (Milan March 29-31, 2011) and showcase its new natural extracts of echinacea, quinoa, pumpkin and many other plants. Among the main botanical ingredients the company will showcase: – SymFinity 1298, a 100% natural active anti-aging substance that comes from Echinacea and is claimed to strengthen the skin cells' resilience to stress, protecting it against environmental damage responsible for wrinkles. – Actipone Superveggies, which gathers the beneficial antioxidative properties of seven vegetables -artichoke, asparagus, beet, broccoli, pumpkin, spinach and zucchini. – Extrapone Healthy Grains, botanical extracts of traditional grains such as amaranth, quinoa and khorasan wheat that are used for their care-giving properties."
CoValence fights ageing with fruit and flower extracts,"US contract manufacturer of private label and custom formulations CoValence has developed a new serum claimed to preserve the youthfulness of eyelashes and eyebrows. The ""Lavish Lash and Brow Peptide Serum"" combines three main actives: – Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, for enhancing eye lash growth through the stimulation of keratin production. According to CoValence, this novel peptide increases eyelash thickness and length by 25% within two weeks during clinical trials. – Phospholipids from apple stem cells [1] that stimulate and protect hair stem cells, for promoting growth and preventing greying, – And Tricholastyl®, an anti- hair loss botanical active produced by Cognis, Laboratoires Sérobiologiques.

Soliance launches a renewable squalane,"Soliance presented its renewable squalane for the first time in Europe at the Cosmetagora, which was held on the 19th and 20th of January 2011 in Paris. Because of its stability and hydrating properties, squalane is known to be one of the most effective emollients of the market. However, it has progressively been neglected by formulators because of supply difficulties. Historically, squalane was sourced from shark liver. This very controversial source was abandoned in favour of plant-derived materials, mostly from the processing of olive oil. Unfortunately, the disadvantage of olive as a source is its price variability due to its interdependence with food oil. Avoiding these issues, Soliance's renewable squalane is sourced from sucrose derived from sugarcane thereby benefiting from high productivity rates (2 tons of squalane per hectare of sugarcane). ""The production of a single farm is almost enough to meet the World's annual needs,"" said Soliance. According to the French supplier of cosmetic ingredients derived from natural resources, other advantages are: the full traceability of the ingredient, from the farmer to the market, and sustainability, thanks to sugarcane's production cycle. Regarding the sensory qualities of this renewable squalane, tests performed by Soliance show they are quite similar to those of olive squalane. For the development of this alternative source, Soliance partnered with Amyris, an American specialist of biotechnology."
Lessonia to debut in make-up,"Lessonia, a French specialist of natural ingredients and formulas, is rapidly developing its full-service business, which already represents 50% of its turnover. For the time being, this activity concerns mostly products for beauty parlours, with references as prestigious as Sothys and Decléor, but the company also wants to develop the retail market and has recently produced a glitter oil for a large perfume chain store which will be be marketed on the occasion of the end of year festivities. No question, however, for the French company, based in the Brittany region, to dilute its know-how. ""We don't want to be another of these contract manufacturer. We have specialized in atypical formulas and products, "" explains Christophe Wincler, CEO of Lessonia. ""It is precisely for this reason that for most of our developments, we also provide the ingredients. We are in a particularly remarkable spiral development where our activity as ingredient suppliers pulls our full service activity upwards and vice versa. "" To cope with its ongoing development, the company which already employs 40 people, must continue its industrial investments and has just put into service a new filling line. Lessonia, who attended In-Cosmetics Asia in Bangkok, Thailand, and Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong also announced its intention to enter the raw material market for make-up applications. ""We are going to introduce new ranges of ingredients and formulas at the next In-Cosmetics in Milan. Especially with the Microzest 25 [1] an ingredient featuring sufficient fineness to allow its use quite appropriately as a make-up pigmen, "" added Christophe Wincler. So let's meet next spring, on 29, 30 and 31 March, more precisely, for the 2011 edition of in-Cosmetics."
BASF uses papaya extract to bring luminosity to the skin,"BASF Beauty Care Solutions new anti-ageing substance does not focus on diminishing the appearance of wrinkles, but on skin luminosity and brightness, another key element of the consumer's satisfaction. ""Simply acting on wrinkles alone may make you look good, but not great,"" BASF argues in a release. Actually, BASF has developed a glow-enhancing technology based on papaya extract. The company developed on a patent pending process to optimize and stabilize the papain enzyme, which is claimed to be more effective than salicylic acid to exfoliate the skin, and as efficient as glycolic acid to improve the appearance of the skin brightness. BASF selected a papain of the highest grade of purity and tested it for toxicity. A natural stabilizer has been used to optimize the performances of the papain, and the preservative system was also carefully chosen to retain maximum efficacy. According to BASF, consumer tests show visible improvement of the skin quality, at 21 days X-pressin brings a new luminosity to the skin. The effectiveness of X-the substance was assessed with a series of clinical and consumer tests. ""After an overnight application, a large percentage of consumers found their skin was softer and smoother,"" the company says."
Green innovation to drive growth of the European personal care ingredients market,"The European personal care ingredients market experienced continued growth in the last few years despite the negative effects of the slow economy, reveals a recently published study by consulting and research firmKline & Company [1]. According to Kline, during the economic downturn, the personal care ingredients market outperformed most other end-use industries in which specialty chemicals suppliers are active. ""Fueled by a relatively stable consumption of cosmetics and toiletries during the crisis, the market is expected to recover quickly, as indicated by a sharp rebound in sales in the first half of 2010, and is anticipated to continue to increase at an annual volume growth rate of 2.6% until 2014,"" says the company. While price was the key purchasing criteria during the latest years, innovation is now returning as a key buying factor for formulators. This should ""create an opportunity for suppliers to develop more added values and take market shares from established products,"" comments Anna Ibbotson, industry manager at Kline's Chemicals & Materials. Traditional ingredients will take advantage of this upturn, but the largest growth expected is in the ""green"" product area. Furthermore, boosted by increased consumer awareness about sun exposure side effects, the use of UV absorbers has extended to an increasing number of skin care products, and they now rank among the most rapidly growing markets. As far as the industrial structure is concerned, Kline notes that the personal care ingredients supplier basis is continuously concentrating, the recent acquisition of Cognis by BASF confirming this trend. ""Key suppliers are trying to be present in most market segments to represent a one-stop-shop for cosmetics and toiletries formulators."" However, while most of the personal care ingredient segments are dominated by a few large companies, such as in the case of hair fixative polymers, where the top three competitors hold 87% of the total market volume, segments which cover a broader range of applications, such as skin and hair care, remain more fragmented as the ingredients are widely varied."
Beraca: new hair care active from pracaxi oil,"Although its name is not as widespread as other species of the Brazilian biodiversity, the pracaxi [1] is a very well known tree in the Amazon region. Its antibacterial and anti-hemorrhagic properties have made the plant traditional among local populations in the treatment of snake bites, healing of ulcers and surgical sanitation. According to Beraca, a Brazil-based supplier of organic and natural active ingredients, the oil extracted from pracaxi seeds has several applications in the cosmetic industry. ""As a powerful dermatological moisturizing, it helps cell renewal and treats stretch marks, skin discoloration, and depigmentation. When applied to hair care products, it provides an excellent conditioning effect, eases combing, and enhances hair smoothness and shine,"" the company claims. Beraca has used pracaxi to develop a hair conditioning ingredient with Ecocert and USDA organic certifications. Due to its high concentration of behenic acid (C22), BBA (BioBehenic Active System) is a natural alternative to surfactants and cationic agents in conditioners. It provides viscosity and helps in stabilizing emulsions. The BBA also creates a hydrophobic layer around hair fibre, which shields it from humidity and controls the volume. To produce BBA, Beraca works in partnership with 500 members of Amazonian communities involved with a biodiversity enhancement program. They are responsible for collecting pracaxi seeds, which are then sent to the Beraca's plant, located in the metropolitan region of Belém, in the north of Brazil, where oil extraction and processing take place. ""Besides making profit from the trade of seeds, local communities also benefit from investments in infrastructure, training, handling, and certification,"" Beraca says. Beraca's pracaxi oil is already exported to several countries, including the U.S., France, Germany, England, and Italy. Among the ingredient's major clients are L'Oréal, with the Kérastase brand, and The Body Shop."
Biopiracy: what are the risks for the cosmetics industry?,"In October 2009, the Greentech company specialized in green active ingredients, abandons the patent it had filed in 2006 [1] for the use of Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia Volubilis), a plant of the Andean foothills of Amazonia which grows between 100 and 1000 meters of altitude. Already, Cognis France had given up (early 2009) a patent application concerning the cosmetic and dermatological use of the oil and proteins extracted from the nut of the plant. In both cases the same reason, the accusation of biopiracy made against these companies by NGOs but also by the very official National Peruvian Anti-Biopiracy Commission (Comisión Nacional para la lucha contra la biopiratería). ""Sacha Inchi was probably already cultivated by pre-Inca civilizations, 3000 or perhaps 5000 years ago, specimens of the plant were actually discovered in tombs. But the farming of the plant was nearing extinction in the 1980s"", explains Daniel Joutard, creator of the brand Aïny, which built its reputation on the utilization of plants and knowledge of indigenous-people. ""The seed of Sacha Inchi which has the shape of a star contains almonds rich in omega 3"". The vast majority of cases handled by the National Peruvian Anti-Biopiracy Commission concern pharmaceutical uses of plant extracts. But the Sacha Inchi case, one of the recent cases having received strong media coverage, shows that the cosmetic industry is not spared from such problems. Especially as the concept of biopiracy doesn't limit itself to cases of patent registration on traditional knowledge. According to Daniel Joutard it must be understood in its broadest sense as ""an access to resources and collective knowledge, with no prior information on intentions and researches, with no explicit approval of local communities and states concerned, with no compensation mechanism, and possibly, by filing a patent of limited innovative significance"". For companies, danger comes first from the media. Because being accused of robbing indigenous peoples of their ancestral know-how is unlikely to benefit to their brand image. The chances are even higher because the attitude of the biopirate is then perceived as being at odds with the ethical, responsible and sustainable attitude often thought to be at the origin of the research and of the use of herbal ingredients. ""Biopiracy not only affects the interests of states and indigenous people, keepers of genetic resources and traditional knowledge, but also those of consumers of 'natural' products, who surely care about the fact that these products respect the anteriority of customs and knowledge coming from indigenous people"" argue the members of the Collectif Biopiraterie. [2] But the risks is also legal. It occurs mainly with the risk of forfeiture of intellectual property rights sometimes hard-won. Indigenous peoples often lack the legal resources and financial means, which need to be mobilized in order to hope gaining an intellectual property right internationally acknowledged. Their traditional know-how benefits however, from the partial protection of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which attempts to regulate access to living resources, and entered in international law the recognition of traditional knowledge. The Convention establishes the principle of prior consent of affected populations and that of the sharing of biodiversity benefits. But again, procedures are cumbersome and often costly. The people alone don't have the means to defend themselves. Especially since it is not always easy to demonstrate the anteriority of traditional use. ""The power struggle may seem disproportionate, but the benefit of obtaining a patent becomes increasingly limited compared with the chances of ill-publicity the company has a chance to face with a problem of this type,"" notes Daniel Joutard. As for cosmetic brands, general awareness seems to be very slow to emerge. This issue is far from their everyday concerns. As far as sustainable development is concerned, there are often many more priorities to be solved before this one really emerges. Yet, brands are far more vulnerable than ingredient suppliers whose names are rarely known to the general public. If a major media campaign is triggered by NGOs, it will necessarily be the brand's products using the incriminated ingredients that will be put forward. Hence the importance there is to question oneself about the precautions to take before using a novel plant ingredient, and the contents of specifications to be provided to suppliers."
Bluestar Silicones wants to become a global player of the cosmetics industry,"Bluestar Silicones, a subsidiary of the Chinese Bluestar group, will participate in the 2010 edition of the In-Cosmetics show in France [1]. Bluestar Silicones will showcase its full range of silicones for use in a number of cosmetics and healthcare segment application fields. Founded in 2007, in particular from Rhodia's silicone business, Bluestar Silicones generates a turnover of EUR 600 million and operates manufacturing sites in all regions of the world. Bluestar Silicones offers a comprehensive range of speciality silicones (high molecular mass gums in volatile silicones, amodimethicones and their emulsions, silicone polyethers, performance systems, etc.), in particular the Mirasil range, which is devoted to hair and skin care products. Bluestar Silicones, which claims to be a one of the leading manufacturers of completely integrated silicones, is demonstrating its determination to become a key worldwide supplier of performance systems to the cosmetics industry. ""This positioning fits in with Bluestar Silicones' global strategy and that of its new production facility in China that has joined ranks with its silicone product manufacturing and research sites at Saint Fons (France), Lübeck (Germany), Santa Perpétua (Spain) and Caronno (Italy) that work for the cosmetics industry,"" explains the company."
The promising future of aloe vera,"Within living memory aloe vera (including the best known specie aloe vera barbadensis miller) is the most applied medicinal plant worldwide. The first written records about the use of aloe vera were found on over 6,000 years old clay tablets found in Mesopotamia. Today, aloe vera is one of the most studied plants worldwide. Actually, there is hardly any plant that can display such a great variety of scientifically-proven active pharmaceutical ingredients (about 200) whose unique combinations and concentrations generate a broad spectrum of activity. So, it's not surprising that aloe vera has been playing a major role in the cosmetics, food and many other industries for years. Aloe vera is commonly used in many cosmetic products and the rise of natural and organic beauty may constitute a new opportunity for this plant. In order to shine a light on various aspects of this still very promising ingredient, the Federal Association of German Industrial and Commercial Companies (Bundesverband deutscher Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen - BDIH), in collaboration with LR Health & Beauty Systems GmbH and supported by the International Aloe Vera Science Council (IASC), has organized a one-day symposium dedicated to aloe vera. The Aloe Vera Symposium took place on the 16th February 2010, on the occasion of the Nuremberg fair (Congress Centre Nuremberg). Speakers covered a broad spectrum of issues, from the perspective of medical and natural sciences, quality assurance, legal affairs, marketing, analytics, natural cosmetics and food chemistry without forgetting the ethnopharmacological, ethnomedicinal and ritual use of aloe vera. In an overview of the aloe vera market, Devon Powell (Executive Director, The International Aloe Science Council, Inc. - IASC) demonstrated the potential for growth of the plant. Considering trends and prospects he questioned the audience about a possible golden age of aloe vera. Several speakers detailed the properties of aloe vera, including its ability to enhance the bioavailability of Vitamin C, E and B12. Michael Peuser (author of the aloe vera bestseller Kapillaren bestimmen unser Schicksal / Capillaries determine our fate) even spoke about empirical experiences: from healing cancer to moisturizing. Dr. Christian Rätsch (ethnopharmacologist) highlighted myths, legends and lore surrounding aloe vera, and RA Harald Dittmar (Managing Director, BDIH) proposed a review of possible and impossible health claims. The event has made clear that there is no equivalent option to aloe vera currently available on the market. Up to now the wide-ranging and scientifically-proven application sprectrum of aloe vera remains unmatched! Aloe vera is used in the health, food and cosmetic industries and also present the advantage to be well known. Launching a credible alternative in the current legal and regulatory context would be a hard challenge. After six millennia aloe vera is still a modern-age plant."
Rousselot launches new anti-ageing collagen peptides,"Rousselot, a French supplier of hydrolyzed collagen specializing in the health and nutricosmetic industries, recently extended its actives range to cover cosmetic applications. Supported by recent studies, Rousselot is launching Peptan SR marine (Skin Regeneration) and Peptan MR marine (Moisture Retention), topical versions of its Rousselot nutricosmetic active. ""The results of in-vitro studies which we have conducted using specific grades of hydrolyzed collagen have been particularly positive,"" explained Caroline Nègre, RHC Marketing Manager. According to Rousselot, the new Peptan SR marine peptide, which is an active ingredient of marine origin, would boost fibroblasts proliferation and promote the synthesis of collagen. The new peptide was tested on a culture of fibroblasts. During the first 24 hours, utilized in a dosage of 0.1mg/ml it induced a significant increase of 18% in the proliferation of fibroblasts by comparison with an untreated control, and by 22.5% over 2 days. According to Rousselot, the Peptan SR marine, used at a concentration of 1% in cosmetics formulations, would be capable of restoring the three-dimensional structure of the dermis, giving it cohesion and tonicity, and would also have an antioxidant effect. The Peptan MR marine is a natural marine biopolymer with film-forming properties. According to Rousselot, it helps maintaining the moisture balance of the skin and provides it with NMF [1]-specific amino acids. Rousselot's new range of peptides of collagen is available in powder form, and is preservative free an odourless. Eventually, Rousselot highlights the potential synergies between the nutricosmetic and topical ranges and their complementary capacity to improve the health and beauty of the skin."
Industry responds to launch of i-Phone application on cosmetic ingredients,"The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) says the launch of Cosmetifique 1.0, a new application for iPhone and iPod Touch ""could leave consumers feeling anxious about the safety of the products they enjoy every day"". Actually, Cosmetifique claims to be able to instantly inform consumers about ""the quality"" of the ingredients in the cosmetic products they might purchase and if they are ""dangerous for the health or for the environment!"" The application is available to purchase from Apple's App Store at a price of US$1.99. ""The launch of this new i-Phone application is concerning for a number of reasons. Firstly, because it suggests that consumers might find 'dangerous' substances in their cosmetics. In Europe, all products sold are subject to strict safety legislation so would never pose a safety threat to consumers. Secondly, because the way it is being promoted, it seems to perpetuate the myth that natural ingredients are not chemicals and are in some way safer than man-made ingredients. In reality, everything is chemical, whether natural or synthetic, and it's not simply the presence of an ingredient that determines how safe a product is. Qualified safety assessors have to consider a whole range of factors, including the quantity of the ingredient contained in the product, how it reacts with other ingredients and how often the product is used,"" commented Dr Chris Flower, CTPA's Director General."
Symrise launches superfruits for cosmetic products,"Over the past few years, superfruits (açai, blueberry, cranberry, grape, guarana, mango, pomegranate, etc.) have enjoyed an immense success, in the food and beverage industry. They can be found everywhere in the supermarket - in tea, juices, cereals and many more products. ""Even though superfruits were almost unknown to the public a few years ago, today they are part of the modern lifestyle of many consumers,"" Symrise says in a release. Capitalizing on this success, Symrise is currently expanding its Actipone line of botanical ingredients by adding superfruits which can be used in all kinds of cosmetic products. The Actipone Superfruit range includes, among others, goji berries, chokeberries (aronia) pomegranate, blueberries, black currants, camu camu, and cranberries. ""Superfruits' excellent characteristics and their stunning success in the food and beverage sector are convincing arguments for integrating them into skin and hair care products. Consumers know about superfruits' positive effects and will also appreciate them in cosmetic products,"" says Dr. Joachim Röding, Senior Vice President of Life Essentials and Global Head of Cosmetic Ingredients at Symrise. Superfruits are reputed to be extremely rich in nutrients and to possess excellent antioxidant effects. They bind free radicals, which helps to prevent premature skin aging."
Plant complexes designed for oily phase Products,"Alban Muller International has developed a range of oil-soluble plant complexes, designed for products with an oily phase (such as emulsions, emulsion serums, care oils, etc.), the Lipidamix. The complexes are made by macerating several plants in sunflower seed oil. Each of the seven complexes in the range features a blend of plant extracts selected for the their effect on the skin or the hair: – Lipidamix Softening, a combination of pot marigold, Roman chamomile, carrot, myrrh and elder flower – Lipidamix Slimming (bladderwrack, ivy and meadowsweet) – Lipidamix Antiaging (wheat, sunflower, horsetail and myrrh while) – Lipidamix Radiance (mallow, red vine and scotch pine) – Lipidamix Moisturising (ivy, mallow, pellitory of the wall and elder flower) – Lipidamix Purifying (myrrh, great burdock, great plantain, thyme and mallow) – Lipidamix Firming (fenugreek, hops, horsetail and frankincense) The Lipidamix range is free of preservatives, 100% natural and manufactured according to low-energy processes, pursuant to the company's eco-responsible policy. According to Alban Muller, the combination of several plant extracts in a single active, also allows to reduce the number of control tests and regulatory filings."
Beraca wins UN award for sustainable development initiative,"Beraca was one of the winners of the 2009 SEED Awards for Entrepreneurship in Sustainable Development. The prize created by the United Nations recognizes innovative projects that are environmentally responsible and promote sustainable practices in the areas where they operate. Beraca was selected for ""The sustainable use of Amazonian seeds"", an initiative developed in the Marajo Island, in the north of Brazil, where Beraca saw an opportunity to transform the collection of andiroba seeds, a traditional practice in the region, into an alternative source of income for the island's communities. By providing training to residents and transference of technology, the company encouraged the creation of a cooperative called Coopemaflima. It enabled the extraction of oil from the seeds, which has an important use for the cosmetic industry, to be conducted within the community. According to Beraca, the result was an increase in the environmental awareness and in the profit of local populations, reducing their vulnerability to possible reductions in economic activity. Nowadays, Beraca buys 500 tons of seeds from the cooperative every year, benefiting around 1,000 islanders. Beraca also helped the community to obtain organic and environmental certifications for the raw materials collected, cooperating to an increment in the products' added value. ""One of Beraca's main commitments is to invest in projects that promote regional development. We are proud to represent Brazil in this major prize with a project that contributes directly to the preservation of the world's largest tropical forest"", said André Sabará, Coordinator of Corporate Responsibility at Beraca."
Naturex and Natraceutical to form botanicals giant,"Naturex, a French supplier of natural speciality ingredients to food, flavour, food supplements, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, has reached an agreement with Natraceutical, a Spanish biotechnology corporation for the merger of their ingredient activities, which is expected to be effective before the year end. The two companies have a complementary product portfolio that includes nutraceutical ingredients, flavouring, preservative and innovative extracts on Naturex's side, and natural colours, fruit and vegetable powders, pectins, functional ingredients, yeasts and caffeine by Natraceutical's ingredients division. Furthermore, while Naturex is strongly positioned in the USA, Natraceutical holds strong market shares in Europe. This merger aims to create the World's number one independent company of natural specialty ingredients. The resulting company will have production sites in Europe (France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom), the USA, Morocco, Australia and Brazil and own sales offices in the USA, Europe and Asia. After this operation, Naturex will double its turnover (proforma sales will reach in 2009 around EUR 200 million against EUR 93 in 2008). Natraceutical will focus its efforts in the development of their nutritional supplements division in Europe, which the company markets exclusively in pharmacies under the brand name Forté Pharma. In the future, Natraceutical should hold between 38% and 40% of Naturex shares. Natraceutical will become a relevant minority shareholder and a board member of Naturex, chaired by Jacques Dikansky, Chairman and CEO."
Arylessence expands its offering of organic and natural fragrances,"In order to meet the ongoing demand by consumers for pure, natural, non-artificial products, Arylessence has developed new fragrances designed to meet the strictest 100% organic requirements and the ""natural ingredient"" certification as defined by U.S. legislation [1]. Arylessence uses only certified and authorized ingredients, explains Lori Miller Burns, the company's Director of Marketing. The ingredients can therefore be used without additional certification procedures ""Companies making natural and organic products now have the freedom to choose exactly the right fragrance for their brands,"" commented Arylessence's President Steve Tanner."

Cremer Care replaces petrolatum with vegetable alternative,"German producer of natural raw materials for the cosmetics industry, Cremer Care,said it has found a natural and purely vegetable alternative to petrolatum. Named Cremerlin, the product has been developed by Bernd Brinkmann of the Walter Rau Neusser Öl und Fett AG, a subsidiary of the Cremer Gruppe. Petroleum jelly (petrolatum or soft paraffin) is a semi-solid mixture of hydrocarbons, which has been used widely in the cosmetics industry since its discovery in 1859. ""We are glad that after exactly 150 years of using this oil gel, we have found a vegetable alternative,"" said Bernd Brinkmann. This new ingredient broadens the palette of formulators that are eager to overcome the use of oil derivatives. ""The need for purely vegetable cosmetic ingredients is constantly growing and this very much ties in with the people's awareness for sustainability. With this vegetable product we fully meet all those expectations"", Business Unit Manager Patrick Knüppel added. Cremerlin will be presented at the next In-Cosmetics tradeshow, which will be held in Munich (Germany) from April 21st to 23rd 2009."
CPL Aromas and Symrise seek revenue growth into organic fragrances business,"British independent fragrance house, CPL Aromas, has developed a range of 100% organic fragrances fully accredited by the Soil Association, UK's leading organic certification body, thus contributing to the expansion of available materials for brands looking to propose naturally fragranced produced. ""The current globally available palette of organic raw materials is growing but is very much more restricted than a standard perfumer's palette,"" explains CPL Aromas CEO Chris Pickthall. ""But the collective expertise of our UK and global perfumers has meant we have some great organic fragrances available on our library as well as an ever growing palette of raw materials to be able to create to customer briefs."" CPL Aromas says the Soil Association stringent standard is ""recognised by other global bodies such as USDA and EcoCert,"" thus allowing the company to offer its products to overseas markets. Germany-based global supplier of fragrances and flavourings, Symrise, simultaneously announced the production of its first three organic fragrances would start in March 2009 as the company's production sites in Teterboro and Branchburg (both in New Jersey) obtained USDA Organic Certification. Last year, Symrise acquired U.S.-based Manheimer Fragrances, a manufacturer whose specialties included certified natural, organic and fair-trade fragrances. ""We see tremendous opportunities for growth here,"" said Roberto Ascoli, Senior Vice President Scent & Care Division Creation & Innovation at Symrise, speaking about potentialities of the US organic market. According to Achim Daub, Global President Scent & Care at Symrise, the demand for natural and organic ingredients will continue to grow in the future: ""Today's consumers make conscious, responsible purchases and are buying more and more products made from natural, sustainable raw materials."""
Symrise launches a new protection against long-term skin damage,"Symrise says that SymHelios 1031 acts by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transmitter protein, in a non-toxic way thereof preventing harmful substances from adhering to the AhR and penetrating deep into the cells to accelerate the ageing process. ""SymHelios 1031 acts exactly where the process of skin damage begins. It prevents toxins from being transported, which in turn reduces long-term skin damage due to UVB rays,"" explains Dr. William Johncock, Senior Vice President, Scent &Care, head of the Symrise's UV Protection unit. However the compound does not shield the skin against sunburn or UVA damage. When it comes to counteracting the impact of sun exposure in general, the protective effects of SymHelios 1031 therefore have to be combined with other substances. ""To optimally protect the skin, you should always use a sun care product with special UV filters,"" says Johncock. Symrise claims that in a clinical trial, test subjects treated with SymHelios 1031 had the best results in terms of protecting against metabolic reactions, skin aging, dermal irritation and oxidative stress after UVB exposure."

"Fast growth for botanical ingredients, study says","""The increased use of botanicals is one of the major changes in the cosmetics and toiletries industry in recent history,"" says market research firm Kline & Company commenting results of its latest study: Specialty Actives and Active Delivery Systems for Personal Care 2008: U.S. and Europe. The study reveals the overall botanicals consumption is growing at 8.0%, outstripping growth of other specialty actives with average growth of 5.4%. Furthermore, ""labelled"" actives are showing extremely quick growth, at up to 20% a year. ""Today's consumer wants not only natural products, but also performance,"" notes Nikola Matic, senior analyst, Chemicals and Material Industry at Kline. ""These two requirements were regarded as contradictory a few years ago, but highly substantiated botanical products developed recently brought new solutions to formulators."" According to Kline, the move from synthetic to more ""natural"" ingredients should now be regarded as an established growth driver, which has benefited botanicals above all. Alleged harmful effects of some synthetic chemicals, the natural trend and the growing demand for more sustainable products are strengthening the shift. ""Changing demographics, with an ageing population in the United States and Europe, will also promote growth in botanical consumption in the anti-ageing segment. Botanical suppliers in order to compete with existing formulations are promoting their products as more effective at lower levels, when compared to for example vitamins, making the botanical actives comparable in price on a cost-performance basis,"" Kline adds. Kline & Company evaluates the market for specialty actives and active delivery systems in North America and Europe at approximately USD 840 million (EUR 667,56 million)."
Shiseido's new lipstick pigment makes lips shining and hides wrinkles,"When asked to tell ""what they want out of lipstick"", about 500 women in their 20s to 50s surveyed by Shiseido in April 2008, indicated a high awareness regarding such matters as ""lips that look full and plump"" and ""less noticeable lip wrinkles and lines "" in addition to matters related to ""texture and colour."" However, according to Shiseido, existing lipstick pigments cannot address brightness and wrinkle concealing simultaneously. Indeed, existing pearlizing agents that are widely used in lipstick have a plate-like shape, which gives them a vivid colour tone, excellent brilliance and lustre, but tend to emphasize the difference in brightness of uneven areas, thereby making wrinkles and lines more easily noticeable. Shiseido therefore changed the pigment's shape and developed a new spherical substance. Spherical pigments are not unknown in cosmetology. They are formulated in foundations for such purposes as correcting skin unevenness, but are not effective enough in oil based lipsticks and other cosmetic products. The Japanese cosmetics giant had to develop en entire new ingredient, using innovative technologies to coat high-refractive-index powder with high light-diffusing properties as a pearlizing. Shiseido says the new spherical pigment makes light reflect evenly, giving lips a radiant shine and making lip wrinkles and lines less noticeable. The company should apply this technology to future lipstick products very soon."
Symrise launches new multifunctional ingredient,"Symrise's newest cosmetic ingredient, SymTriol, is a synergistic, patent-pending blend of 1,2-octanediol, 1,2-hexanediol and methylbenzyl alcohol. According to Symrise, the innovative blend gives the substance multifunctional properties. On the one hand, 1,2-octanediol and 1,2-hexanediol, are moisturizers with broad spectrum anti-microbial activity. On the other hand, methylbenzyl alcohol is a nature-identical compound that is used in perfumes. It also has antifungal effects, which enhance the anti-microbial properties of the 1,2-alkanediol blend. SymTriol is a clear, nearly colourless liquid which is soluble in cosmetic esters, glycols and ethanol, and it is compatible with most raw materials. SymTriol is stable at a pH-value of 3-8 and has excellent temperature stability. If desired, its faint odour can easily be masked by other fragrances. SymTriol can therefore be used in a broad range of cosmetic products such as gels, creams and lotions. Thanks to its antimicrobial and antifungal properties, SymTriol also allows manufacturers to reduce the amount of preservatives such as parabens and formaldehyde donors, ""both of which remain controversial in public opinion,"" Symrise comments in a release. According to the company, the recommended dosage of SymTriol is 0.5-1.0%. The INCI name of the substance is to be written: Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Methylbenzyl Alcohol."
Naturex gets organic certifications,"Naturex French manufacturing unit located in Avignon, southern France, complies with requirements of the USDA National Organic Program (N.O.P.) [1] and the European directive 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural goods. The supplier of botanical flavours, colours, antioxidants and other natural ingredients has achieved the whole certification procedures and can now address the growing worldwide demand for organic food, dietary supplements and cosmetics. The N.O.P. compliance is required before labeling any product ""organic"" in the US and provides in particular specific production, handling, and labeling standards for these products. The Naturex plant in Avignon was inspected and passed by the Institute for Market Ecology (IMO), a certification and quality assurance agency based in Switzerland and specialized in eco-friendly products. IMO is accredited by the USDA for organic certification according to the National Organic Program. As far as European organic production standards are concerned, Naturex was audited by a subsidiary of Bureau Veritas. ""These organic certifications are part of our growing business initiatives, by extending and enhancing our current products and services portfolio. It contributes to better serve our existing clients,"" commented Jacques Dikansky, President and C.E.O. of Naturex. Indeed, these certifications enable Naturex to produce organic ingredients and to distribute them worldwide through its global sales network. Naturex also plans to progressively obtain similar certifications for its other plants in Morocco, the USA and Italy."
Cremer Care launches a range of organic fatty acids and emulsifiers,"As the cosmetics industry is massively shifting towards green and organic products, the availability and quality of organic raw materials do play an increasing role in the development and success of new cosmetic lines. Suppliers of raw materials and ingredients are addressing this trend by diversifying the organic offer. Cremer Care and its sister company Prignitzer Chemie, are making another step forward with the launch of a range of organic fatty acids and emulsifiers from certified organic oils. A World's premiere, Cremer Care claims. ""Our company's focus on natural cosmetics and organic raw materials has thus been reflected to the full extent. We are very glad to have become the producer and provider for a resource that has – up to now – not been available,"" Cremer Business Unit Manager Patrick Knüppel emphasises. Actually, Prignitzer Chemie succeeded in processing certified oils into organic derivatives and consequently also organic emulsifiers. For the first time raw materials on a purely organic basis can be used for (liquid) soaps and a variety of other cosmetics and toiletries where it was not possible so far, do to the lack organic fatty acids and emulsifiers. ""With this worldwide unique organic product we fully meet all expectations"", Patrick Knüppel adds."
EU packaging waste generation sees biggest increase in 10 years,"From parcels for online purchases to coffee-to-go cups, packaging is almost everywhere, and the recent figures published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, unveil the scale of packaging waste in the EU. According to these figures, the generation of packaging waste per inhabitant rose by 10.8 kg between 2020 and 2021, the biggest increase seen in the last 10 years. Since these figures compare the start of the Covid-19 pandemic with the year that followed, the end of lockdowns and other restrictions, as well as the return to offices, could be seen as potential driving forces. Except that this mass of waste has soared by almost 32 kg compared to 2011. All in all, a European generates a total of 188.7 kg of packaging waste per year. As a result, the EU generated a total of 84 million tonnes of packaging waste in 2021, of which 40.3% were paper and cardboard. The rest was composed of plastic (19%), glass (18.5%), wood (17.1%) and metal (4.9%). The good news is that plastics are being recycled better than ever before. Over the last decade, between 2011 and 2021, the quantity of this type of waste has risen by 26.7%, while the recycling rate has also risen to 38.1%. Today, the average European generates 35.9 kg of plastic packaging waste, of which 14.2 kg is recycled. However, the situation varies from one EU member state to another. Some, such as Slovenia (50%), Belgium (49.2%) and the Netherlands (48.9%), manage to give a second life to almost half of all plastic, whereas this is the case for less than a quarter of such waste in Malta (20.5%), France (23.1%) and Sweden (23.8%). As far as the rest of the world is concerned, few countries provide with statistics as detailed as the European Union regarding the production and recycling of packaging waste, but the OECD figures show a constant and very rapid increase in the quantity of packaging produced every year."
Acai berry craze: boon or threat for the Amazon rainforest in Brazil?,"Consumed without further processing, in juice or sorbet, or incorporated into the formula of certain cosmetic products such as moisturizing lotions or shampoos, açaí berries have become the darling of superfood enthusiasts around the world. Brazil is the world's leading producer of acai berries. Para, the source of 90 percent of the country's crop, produced almost 1.4 million tonnes of it in 2021, worth more than USD 1 billion for the state's economy, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). From there, acai went on to win fans worldwide, from the United States to Europe, Australia and Japan. Brazilian exports of acai and its derivatives surged from 60 kilograms in 1999 to more than 15,000 tonnes in 2021. However, the global success of the black berries is reshaping the world's biggest rainforest — for better and worse. In the Amazonian state of Para during the harvest season, farmers can fill up to 25 large baskets of about 14kg each, bringing home between 300 and 625 reais (USD 60 to USD128). Middlemen buy the berries and bring them by boat to Belem, the state capital, where they are sold as quickly as possible, before the fragile fruit goes bad. Acai production has long been presented as a model of ""bio-economy"", a source of income for local populations in the Amazon without cutting into the rainforest. But studies show the expansion of acai palms (also called açaizeiros) in is causing a loss of biodiversity in some regions by replacing other species. ""Leave nature to its own devices, and you get 50 or maybe 100 acai plants per hectare,"" says biologist Madson Freitas of the Museu Goeldi research institute in Belem. ""When you go beyond 200, you lose 60 percent of the diversity of other native species."" He has published a study on the phenomenon, which he calls ""acai-ification."" According to Freitas, the loss of other plant species in turn has a negative effect on acai, which becomes less productive because of a loss of pollinators such as bees, ants and wasps. Longer dry periods in the Amazon, which may be exacerbated by climate change, are also hurting acai, which tends to grow on land that floods during the rainy season. Freitas says that sustainable acai production is possible but that stronger conservation laws and policing — as well as incentives for farmers — are needed to combat single-crop farming and preserve the rainforest. Salomão Santos, a local leader in Igarape São João, admits acai's dominance could become a problem. ""Those of us who live in the Amazon know we can't live on one single species,"" he says. He recalls the commodity booms and busts of the past, such as sugar cane and rubber. He wants compensation for local communities who preserve the Amazon, whose hundreds of billions of carbon-absorbing trees are a vital resource against climate change."
"Voluntary deforestation carbon credits failing, study finds","As climate change accelerates and pressure mounts on corporations and countries to slash emissions, the market for carbon credits has exploded. The principle is quite simple: to offset the carbon emissions linked to their activities, companies buy carbon credits, which will be used to invest in forest protection or tree planting projects. In carbon markets, a single credit represents one tonne of CO2 that is either removed from the atmosphere by growing trees, or prevented from entering it through avoided deforestation. Such schemes, however, have long been dogged by charges of poor transparency, dodgy accounting practices, and in-built conflicts of interest. To accurately assess the effectiveness of projects financed by carbon credits, an international team of researchers explored the effects of several projects to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) launched in six countries across the world. [1] The results of the study, which were published Thursday, August 24 in the journal Science, provide a clear conclusion: ""Most projects have not significantly reduced deforestation."" Only 5.4 million out of 89 million credits — about six percent — actually resulted in carbon reduction through forest preservation, the study found. Although some projects were successful, the reductions were significantly lower than what had been announced. According to the study: ""Methodologies used to construct deforestation baselines for carbon offset interventions need urgent revisions to correctly attribute reduced deforestation to the projects, thus maintaining both incentives for forest conservation and the integrity of global carbon accounting."" ""Carbon credits provide major polluters with some semblance of climate credentials,"" said senior author Andreas Kontoleon, a professor in the University of Cambridge's department of land economy. ""Yet we can see that claims of saving vast swathes of forest from the chainsaw to balance emissions are overblown."" ""These carbon credits are essentially predicting whether someone will chop down a tree and selling that prediction,"" he added in a statement. ""If you exaggerate or get it wrong — intentionally or not — you are selling hot air."" The new study is among the first peer-reviewed assessments across a number of representative projects. To assess the performance of 18 forest protection schemes in different countries, the researchers identified parallel sites within each region with similar conditions but without forest protection schemes. Of the 18 projects, 16 claimed to have avoided far more deforestation than took place at the comparison sites. There are several possible reasons that protection schemes have fallen so far short of their carbon sequestration claims. One is that they are calculated on the basis of historical trends that can be inaccurate or deliberately inflated. The operation must also project deforestation or afforestation rates over an extended period of time, which is difficult. In addition, projects may be located in areas where substantial conservation would have occurred in any case. The entire methodology serving as the basis for these carbon credits must therefore be reconsidered!"
"Protecting corals requires a multifactorial approach, study finds","The study published the journal Nature, which is based on 20 years of data from the US island of Hawaii, says that combining local efforts to limit the impact of humans on both the land and sea give coral reefs a greater chance at bouncing back. [1] ""We found that both land-based (for example wastewater pollution) and sea-based human impacts (for example fishing) must be reduced together to ensure coral reef persistence,"" the study's co-lead author Gareth Williams, a marine ecologist at the UK's Bangor University, told AFP. The release came just days after it was revealed that the temperature of the world's oceans rose to their hottest level ever recorded on July 30. Using high-resolution data and thousands of hours of underwater surveys, the researchers looked at connections between human impacts and the recovery of the reef. They found that not all coral reefs suffer equally during heatwaves. In 18 percent of the reefs surveyed during an unprecedented marine heatwave in Hawaii in 2015, coral cover remained unchanged — and in some cases, increased — despite the heat. Their ability to recover was dependent on how strained they were by various human pollutants and how many algae-eating fish were around to pave the way for regrowth, the study said. The more negative impacts that were remedied, the better the reefs recovered, offering a potential path ahead for conservation efforts. The researchers carried out modelling which indicated that simultaneously reducing these problems on land and sea gave reefs an up to six times higher chance of regrowing after a heatwave than if the efforts were carried out separately. ""Resource managers have aspired to manage land and sea together, but because governance tends to be centralised, most terrestrial- and ocean-management efforts remain siloed,"" said the study's co-lead author Jamison Grove of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But the researchers warned that the frequency and severity of coral bleaching as ocean temperatures rise due to human-caused climate change could ""simply overwhelm the positive effects of local management actions"". According to the IPCC, since 1982, marine heat waves have been twice as frequent as befor. And by 2100, they could be 10 times more intense if greenhouse gas emissions are not drastically reduced."
"Plastic litter in oceans overestimated but still a concern, study suggests","Scientists based in the Netherlands and Germany carried out 3D computer modelling using extensive observational data and measurements taken from surface water, beaches and the deep ocean from 1980 to 2020. The modelling study estimated that pieces of plastic bigger than 25 millimetres (one inch) make up over 95 percent of plastic floating on the ocean. While most plastic particles in the ocean are very small, the total mass of these microplastics — defined as less than five millimetres (0.2 inches) — is relatively low. ""The majority of plastic mass is contained in the large plastic items (>25 mm),"" which float more easily, said the authors of the study. Commenting the results, recently published in Nature Geoscience [1], the researchers said the preponderance of larger floating pieces suggests that the total amount of plastic in the ocean is ""much lower"" than previously thought. But the study also showed that the total amount of plastic on the ocean surface — about 3.2 million tons — is much higher that initially estimated. However, the model also found that less new plastic finds its way to the ocean every year than previously thought — about half a million tonnes instead of four to 12 million tonnes — stemming largely from coastlines and fishing activity. The fact that the plastic is floating around in large pieces could with help clean-up efforts. ""Large, floating pieces on the surface are easier to clean up than microplastics,"" the study's co-author Erik van Sebille of Utrecht University in the Netherlands said in a statement. However, the combination of more surface plastic and less new plastic suggests that ""it will take longer until the effects of measures to combat plastic waste will be visible,"" the study's lead Mikael Kaandorp said. ""If we don't take action now, the effects will be felt for much longer,"" he added. And the amount of plastic pollution in the world's oceans is still growing. Without further mitigation and clean-up, the lingering plastic litter could double within two decades, according to the study's authors. Concern over the impact of plastics on the environment and human well-being has surged in recent years. Plastic debris is estimated to kill more than a million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals each year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. The new study comes as the world awaits the first draft of a highly anticipated international UN treaty to combat plastic pollution, expected in November."
Consumers in Asia and Europe think sustainable goods are too pricey,"Doing more for the planet as an individual and embracing more environmentally-friendly practices can be a complicated matter, with progress being made but significant obstacles in the way. As heatwaves affect large swathes of the planet — and researchers suggesting that these episodes have been made more likely by human-caused climate change — we're reminded of how urgent it is to find solutions to better preserve the environment. However, consumers in Europe and Asia seem willing to do their part of the job, albeit with reservations… A report commissioned by Chinese group Alibaba from UK-based consultancy firm Yonder Consulting indicates that consumers have a deep-seated desire to take action for the preservation of the planet [1]. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of a sample of over 14,000 consumers surveyed in Europe, the Middle East and Asia say they want to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. In emerging Asian markets this proportion rises to 87%. However the obstacles preventing consumers from purchasing more sustainable products are the same in Europe and Asia. Greenwashing, for example, is a major issue. Some 38% of consumers worldwide question the trustworthiness of brands marketing products as sustainable, with 56% of Thais, 48% of French and 47% of Singaporeans expressing doubts about the real motivation of such companies. These are the three countries in the world where consumers are most likely to believe that a company's environmental claims are another way for it to justify selling more expensive products. And pricing is the other area where Asia and Europe find common ground. For 45% of consumers worldwide, sustainable products are too expensive. And it's hard to be a more responsible consumer when everyday products are so expensive — a view shared the world over. Thirty-three percent of this large sample indicate that if sustainable products were more accessibly priced, it would be easier to make choices that are more in line with protecting the planet. For 84% of Thais, sustainable purchasing is prohibitively expensive, which was the case for 41% of the United Arab Emirates respondents and 37% of Spaniards. Among the regions surveyed, Asians show the greatest motivation and interest in finding information in order to make their patterns of consuming more sustainable. Consumers in the Philippines (93%) and Indonesia (91%) are the most likely to welcome getting more information about becoming sustainable. More than anywhere else, people in emerging Asian markets are keen to know how to make more sustainable online purchases (88% vs. 66% in Europe)."
Global decarbonation: Carbon 'capture' technologies are booming,"CCS syphons off CO2 from the exhaust, or flue gas, of fossil fuel-fired power plants as well as heavy industry. The exhaust from a coal-fired power plant is about 12 percent CO2, while in steel and cement production it is typically double that. Unlike CCS, which by itself only prevents additional carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, DAC extracts CO2 molecules already there. Crucially, this makes DAC a ""negative emissions"" technology. It can therefore generate credits for companies seeking to offset their greenhouse gas output — but only if the captured CO2 is permanently stored underground, such as in depleted oil and gas reservoirs or in saline aquifers. The concentration of carbon dioxide in ambient air is only 420 parts per million (about 0.04 percent), so corralling CO2 using DAC is far more energy intensive and the cost is much higher. Once isolated using either CCS or DAC, CO2 can be used to make products such as building materials or ""green"" aviation fuel, plastic bottles, fragrance ingredients or fragrance alcohol. Although some of that CO2 will seep back into the air, these practices are believed to result in a significant reduction in new carbon emissions. The fossil fuel industry has been using CCS since the 1970s but not to prevent CO2 from leaching into the atmosphere. Rather, oil and gas companies inject CO2 into oil fields to extract more crude more quickly. Historically, bolting CCS facilities onto coal- and gas-fired power plants and then storing the CO2 to reduce emissions has proven technically feasible but uneconomical. The world's largest CCS plant, the Petra Nova facility in Texas, was mothballed three years after opening in 2017. But the looming climate crisis and government subsidies have revived interest in CCS for the power sector and beyond. At the end of 2022, there were 35 commercial-scale facilities worldwide applying carbon capture technology to industry, fuel transformation or power generation, isolating a total of 45 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). DAC, by contrast, is very new. A total of 18 DAC plants globally only captured about as much CO2 last year (10,000 tonnes) as the world emits in 10 seconds. Both CCS and DAC must be massively scaled up if they are to play a significant role in decarbonising the global economy. To keep the mid-century net-zero target in play, CCS will need to divert 1.3 billion tonnes a year from power and industry — 30 times more than last year — by 2030, according to the IEA. And DAC will have to remove 60 million tonnes of CO2 per year by that date, several thousand-fold more than today. But the nascent industry is burgeoning with new actors, and the first million-tonne-per-year plant is scheduled to come on line in the United States next year, with others following. ""It's a huge challenge but it's not unprecedented,"" University of Wisconsin–Madison professor Gregory Nemet told AFP, citing other technologies, including solar panels, that have scaled up dramatically in a matter of decades. Preparing a site to stock CO2 can take up to 10 years, so storage could become a serious bottleneck for both CCS and DAC development. CCS costs USD 15 to USD 20 per tonne for industrial processes with highly concentrated streams of CO2, and USD 40 to USD 120 per tonne for more diluted gas streams, such as in power generation. And DAC — still in its infancy — has much higher costs, ranging today from USD 600 to USD 1,000 per tonne of CO2 captured. Those costs are projected to drop sharply to USD 100-USD 300 per tonne by 2050, according to the inaugural ""State of Carbon Dioxide Removal"" report, published earlier this year. As countries and companies feel the pinch from decarbonisation timetables and net-zero commitments, more money — public and private — is flowing toward both CCS and DAC. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) earmarks billions of dollars in tax credits for CCS. The earlier Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides about USD 12 billion over five years. Canada's 2022 budget also extends an investment tax credit that cuts the cost of CCS projects in half. South Korea and China are also investing heavily in the sector, with China opening a 500,000-tonne plant last month in Jiangsu Province. In Europe, support comes at the national level and is oriented toward industry and storage, especially in the North Sea. For DAC, a range of companies — Alphabet, Shopify, Meta, Stripe, Microsoft and H&M Group — have paid into a fund with a promise to collectively buy at least USD 1 billion of ""permanent carbon removal"" between 2022 and 200. Last month, JP Morgan struck a $20 million, nine-year carbon removal deal with DAC pioneer Climeworks, based in Switzerland."
Why is Israel's city of Eilat promoting sunscreens that nourish corals?,"Tourists use between 16,000 and 25,000 tonnes of sunscreen each year in tropical regions, potentially releasing between 4,000 and 6,000 tonnes of sunscreen into reef areas, according to the findings of a study published in the scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives. While it's impossible, and even totally inadvisable, to stop protecting ourselves from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays, many brands are now working to offer sun protection products claiming a lower impact on the marine environment. This includes eliminating some UV filters, such as oxybenzone and octinoxate. In order to go even further, Eilat, a seaside town in southern Israel which is home to the Coral Beach underwater reserve, featuring around a hundred species of coral and several hundred species of fish, has solicited scientists to create products that could actually reverse — as far as possible — the mechanism that contributes to coral bleaching. Marine scientists and skincare experts have worked hand in hand to develop a new formulation based on a non-nano, titanium-dioxide-based, mineral sunscreen. The base formula is Ecocert compliant and has undergone extensive aquatic safety testing. The added reef nourishing formula is a bespoke blend of FDA-compliant trace minerals used by coral farmers to feed and support healthy growth in coral. ""The development of a sunscreen that not only doesn't harm coral, but has the potential to feed and nourish our reefs, is an important step towards protecting and preserving our oceans,"" said Giovanni Giallongo, Marine Biologist at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Eilat. From a technical point of view, there's nothing revolutionary! Actually, the goal is to clarify claims related to the protection of the marine environment through the introduction of a new industry-wide standard dubbed RPF (for Reef Protection Factor) that would help consumers make informed choices. ""An increasing number of products claim to be 'reef-friendly' or 'reef-safe', but there is a lack of regulation in this area which means that consumers are easily being misled. It's hoped that the new RPF marque will become an industry standard and spread beyond Israel, worldwide, helping consumers make responsible choices,"" the experts behind the initiative explain in a statement. ""This is a way of identifying sunscreen that truly cares for coral,"" added Giovanni Giallongo. Last year, a class action lawsuit was launched in the United States against Australian brand Bondi Sands over alleged false claims in relation to reef protection. Other actions have been launched on a similar basis against several other manufacturers."
"""We abuse plastic, it's so cheap,"" says UN Environment chief","What are the main obstacles to an ambitious treaty? Inger Andersen - Today, virgin raw polymer is cheaper than recycled polymer. So here's the question: What will allow us move from that linear 'we take it, we make it, we waste it' reality to a circular approach? Right now, it's so inexpensive you can just throw plastic away. But the cost to the environment and human health is huge, and it is not taxed anywhere. I'm a big believer in product redesign. Today, we want many products to be in liquid form: our shampoo, our toothpaste or even our washing powder. But there are a lot of things that we can 'de-liquefy' and transport solid in boxes."" Is recycling today a credible solution? Inger Andersen - We can't recycle our way out of this mess. But recycling is one of the many keys that we will need to make this work. Today, we simply throw plastic away because it has no value. When I was a little girl growing up in Denmark with very limited pocket money, my brothers and I collected plastic bottles every Saturday because we could get two krone. It wasn't much, but it made it worthwhile. Now imagine the day that this stuff has value — we would think about and treat that garbage very differently! What changes in attitude or mentality do you think we need to see? Inger Andersen - Awareness is step one. Which is not to say the burden falls entirely on consumers — at the end of the day, it's business and governments that have to take that responsibility. But every consumer has a choice. Let's say we have a party. Do we need single-use cups and plastic bags? If that bag I use to carry home five tomatoes is a heavy polymer, it will sit in a landfill for hundreds of years, maybe a thousand. Why are supermarket bananas in a plastic bag? Nature already delivered them with their own packaging. So there are choices we can make. Children get it, and are already holding their parents to account. But the bigger system shifts will come from agreements such as the one we are negotiating. Plastic pollution has not been a priority on the international agenda until quite recently. What changed? Inger Andersen - The popular demand for solutions has become powerful, and it's coming across the board from left to right in most countries. I put it down to activism across a broad spectrum, and I am very, very grateful. I ask all those activists to keep the heat on to ensure that the treaty had ambitious and binding elements. Many green groups are worried that the plastics industry will have an undue influence in the talks. Inger Andersen - For this second round of negotiations we have 2,800 participants — 908 from government and 1,712 from non-government organisations (NGOs). There are ten industry associations represented. They have a role to play. Take ozone, which is probably our most successful treaty. We couldn't find a solution to the manufactured gases depleting the ozone layer without having industry at the table. Here's what I say to business: this is coming to a movie theatre near you soon. You might as well lean into it and be part of the change, because we will get a treaty and it will be ambitious. Once we make the enabling legislation, business will follow. Can the world do without plastics at all? Inger Andersen - Plastic is everywhere. We're still going to need light switches, steering wheels, metro seats, whatever. But we need to think about the single-use dimension. We are abusing plastic because it's so cheap. But this has consequences in the environment, in the oceans, to our health. The interview has been edited for concision and clarity."
Fight against pollution: New plastic-eating fungi may help for recycling,"""A total of 184 fungal and 55 bacterial strains capable of breaking down,"" various plastics were found in the Jiangsu province of eastern China, the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew said in a statement. Researchers from China and the UK in May 2021 sampled microorganisms from China's Dafeng, a UNESCO-protected site near the coast of the Yellow Sea. Researchers said they found a distinct ""terrestrial plastisphere"", described as a ""man-made ecological niche"", which is an ecosystem that has evolved to live with the presence of coastal plastic debris. Because of their longevity and hydrophobic surface, plastics in aquatic ecosystems have the potential to create a sort of 'microbial reef' for fungi and bacteria to attach to. And certain plastics can provide microbes with a source of carbon to metabolize – a food source. At Dafeng, the researchers collected 50 samples of plastic waste from seven different types of petroleum-based polymers: polyethylene terephthalate (PET), expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyethylene (PE), polyurethane (PU), polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Among the samples, the researchers identified 14 genera of fungi, including the plant pathogens Fusarium and Neocosmospora. The study's findings indicate these fungi may be better at degrading polycaprolactone (PCL) plastics and other synthetic polymers than saprotrophic fungi. ""Scientists are increasingly looking at microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, to help tackle some of the most pressing challenges of the modern age, including the rising tide of plastic pollution,"" Kew Gardens said. In the wild, fungi play a key role in breaking down organic matter. Over millions of years, their ability to break down many complex and naturally occurring polymers, such as cellulose, has made them able to produce enzymes that are extremely efficient at breaking down complex organic compounds. The new findings contribute to existing studies on plastic-degrading microorganisms with some 436 species of fungi and bacteria found capable of breaking down plastic to date. RGB Kew scientists believe their latest findings could lead to the development of efficient enzymes designed to biologically degrade plastic waste. French start-up Carbios has pioneered the enzymatic recycling of plastic, more specifically PET. Thanks to their demonstration unit in Clermont-Ferrand, they have demonstrated the technical feasibility of using enzymes in an energy-efficient recycling process, paving the way for the construction of a first commercial plant whose commissioning is scheduled for 2025. In 2021, Carbios and L'Oréal unveiled the first plastic bottles made using enzymatic recycling technology. Carbios recently accelerated its micro-organism screening process with a microfluidic technology developed in partnership with the Paul Pascal Research Centre (a joint research unit of the CNRS and the University of Bordeaux, France) in order to reduce the time required to develop and produce new enzymes capable of breaking down different types of plastic polymers. The discovery of new plastic-eating strains should contribute to feed this research!"
Circular economy: How paperboard production improves Finland's farm fields,"Metsä Board has partnered with Finnish circular economy company Soilfood for the upcycling of side stream fibre fractions created during paperboard production. In practical terms, Soilfood produces wood-based soil improvement fibres from fractions produced as side streams at Metsä Board's cardboard mills. These fibres increase the fertility of the soil and improve its water retention capacity. The use of wood fibre is also an effective method of water conservation as it can reduce the run-off of phosphorus from fields by up to 50%. Thus, what was once considered waste, is now re-utilised into soil improvement fibres. ""The result is a product that not only recycles the nutrients of wood fibre back into soil, but also stores the carbon of the wood into soil,"" explains Metsä Board in a statement. Each weekday, Soilfood currently collects at least two truckloads worth of side streams from Metsä Board's mills in Kemi and Äänekoski, Finland. In addition to Soilfood's soil improvement fibres, the side streams from Metsä Board's mills are being utilised for energy production and landscaping purposes. ""Together with farmers and our industrial partners, we are replacing virgin raw materials with recycled ones and using natural resources wisely. The demand for recycled nutrients and soil improvement fibres has been growing strongly in recent years. The growth is currently limited mainly by the availability of raw materials,"" says Sampo Järnefelt, Chief Commercial Officer at Soilfood. Metsä Board's cooperation with Soilfood started with a research project initiated in 2015 by the Natural Resources Institute Finland to study the ability of wood based fibre sludge to stabilise the structure of field soil and thus reduce erosion and nutrient leaching from fields to water bodies. The field experiments of this study have found soil improvement fibres to reduce the risk of nutrient leaching by up to 50%. [1] Side streams can be burned to create energy, but using them as soil improvement fibres is more valuable from a circular economy perspective. The nutrients in the wood-based material are returned to the soil and part of the carbon is stored for the long term. In one treatment cycle, the farmer adds up to 5 tonnes of carbon to the field, some of which is broken down by biological processes to feed the microbiota of the soil and some of which is sequestered in the soil forming a carbon storage for more than 20 years. The utilisation of side streams is also included in Metsä Board's 2030 sustainability targets. ""Currently, more than 99 per cent of our production side streams are used either as materials or energy. We aim to make 100% use of all production side streams to ensure our processes do not generate any landfill waste after 2030,"" says Markku Leskelä, Development Director at Metsä Board. ""Our cooperation with Soilfood is a good example of a circular economy that benefits all parties involved,"" he concludes."
G7 members commit to zero plastic pollution ahead of international treaty,"G7 members (United States, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and Canada) committed to zero plastic pollution by 2040 — an attainable goal thanks to the rise of the circular economy and the reduction or banning of single-use plastics and non-recyclables, according to the final statement. The announcement has come just before the UN has its next meeting on the plastics treaty, late May in Paris, when the details will be discussed. The declaration states that G7 members will cooperate constructively on the UN convention ""including mandatory measures"" and ""covering the entire life cycle of plastics"". A year ago in Nairobi, 175 countries convened to put an end to plastic pollution worldwide by developing a legally-binding United Nations treaty by the end of 2024. The next session to negotiate the treaty is scheduled for May in Paris. Among the anticipated measures is a global ban on single-use plastics, the establishment of a ""polluter-pays"" system and a tax on the production of new plastic. Indeed, the current situation is considered of very high concern. Global plastic production almost doubled between 2000 and 2019, from 234 million tonnes to 460 million tonnes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Plastic waste more than doubled in that time, reaching 353 million tonnes in 2019. But global production fell slightly in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic for only the third time in the history of modern industry, according to trade association Plastics Europe. The OECD said 22 million tonnes of plastic were discarded in the environment in 2019 alone, with six million tonnes ending up in waterways, lakes and oceans. Plastic makes up at least 85 percent of total marine waste, according to the UN Environment Assembly. More than half of the plastic came from Asia in 2020, with China representing almost one-third of the global total. Plastic production in the world's second-largest economy jumped by 82 percent between 2010 and 2020, well above the global growth average of 30 percent, according to a Plastics Europe report. Europe's production in 2020 was 55 million tonnes, a five-percent fall on 2019 levels. The growth mostly came from the United States and the Middle East as primary materials there are much cheaper, and from China because its demand is growing more strongly, said Jean-Yves Daclin, Plastics Europe's director general for France. A 2021 report by the World Wildlife Fund estimated that global plastic production would double by 2040. Recycling is the main solution to halt the relentless march of plastic pollution. Although Europe recycles more than one-third of its plastic waste, globally only around nine percent of plastic waste was recycled in 2019, according to the OECD. However, promising recycling technologies, such as enzymatic recycling developed by French-based Carbios are emerging. Other solutions include developing packaging-free products, returnable items and eco-friendly designs with long lifespans. Plastic made from agricultural resources — such as sugar, starch, corn and wheat — represents less than one percent of global production. The use of agricultural land and water resources limits their development as a way of reducing oil consumption in plastic production. Even worse, these plastics are rarely completely biodegradable or compostable and ""in reality only dodge the issue"", according to the Heinrich Boell Foundation, an environmental think tank in Germany. The problem has spurred the development of second- and third-generation plastics sourced from vegetable waste or algae. Another – ambitious – technique is making plastic from the carbon dioxide belched out into the atmosphere by industry. Tests have been conducted by L'Oréal, LanzaTech and Total with the creation of the first cosmetic plastic bottle made from industrial carbon emissions."
Coty launches new Gucci fragrance with 100% carbon-captured alcohol,"Available in stores since April 1, 2023, Where My Heart Beats Eau de Parfum – the latest addition in Gucci's The Alchemist's Garden collection – is the world's first globally distributed fragrance manufactured using 100% carbon-captured alcohol. The fragrance uses CarbonSmart alcohol produced by biotech company LanzaTech. This novel technology process captures carbon from industrial emissions and, after a clean-up step, transforms it through fermentation into ethanol for use in fine fragrances. Previously, Coty introduced CarbonSmart ethanol into its fragrance portfolio (which includes brands such as Calvin Klein, Burberry, Boss, Gucci, Chloé, Marc Jacobs Perfume, etc.) by blending it with traditional alcohol. For the launch of Where My Heart Beats Eau de Parfum, Coty has segregated the supply of carbon-captured alcohol to ensure the product is made only from recycled carbon. ""Coty is the first company to introduce carbon-captured alcohol into fine fragrances for global distribution. This is an inspiring example for sustainability being the ultimate driver of innovation. Beyond the science, there is something magical in upcycling industrial emissions into alcohol pure enough for use in fine fragrances,"" said Coty Chief Scientific & Sustainability Officer, Dr. Shimei Fan. Coty announced its partnership with LanzaTech in March 2021 and started production of the world's first globally distributed fragrances made using this technology in January 2022. To produce this new generation ethanol, LanzaTech captures carbon from different emission sources (industry, solid organic waste) or even in ambient air, through an electrolysis process. The collected CO2 is then cleaned-up before being transformed into ethanol through fermentation. Ethanol is a core ingredient in fine fragrance products, enabling the efficient dispersion of the scent. As most other fragrance producers, Coty uses ethanol sourced from a range of natural raw materials - including sugar cane and sugar beet, which require farm land, water and fertilizers. By employing a new source of alcohol transformed from carbon emissions through LanzaTech's technology, Coty intends to reduce the beauty industry's environmental impact. A life cycle assessment by independent sustainability consultancy Quantis has shown a significantly reduced overall environment impact. ""Through this novel carbon capture approach, carbon emissions, which would typically be released into the atmosphere, are recycled into alcohol pure enough for use in fine fragrances. Furthermore, this process uses less water and reduces the need for agricultural land compared to traditional methods of alcohol production,"" Coty explains. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) in the chemical industry could lead to a dramatical reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to a recent exploratory study by the Renewable Carbon Initiative (RCI), CO2 Value Europe (CVE) and nova-Institute."
How plastic waste could be used to produce hydrogen and glycolic acid,"Plastic recycling is a key environmental issue. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), more than 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year in the world, 85% of which ends up in landfills or dumped in nature where it takes hundreds of years to decompose. But what if, in the future, this plastic waste could be used to produce hydrogen and glycolic acid? Today, plastic can be transformed into a multitude of products, including paints and solvents. It is even possible to recycle plastic into gasoline by incorporating certain additives. However, turning it into hydrogen could represent a cleaner alternative for the environment. A team of researchers at the UK's University of Cambridge [1] is working on a process that can convert not only plastic, but also CO2, into two chemical products: syngas, a source of hydrogen, and glycolic acid, which is widely used in the cosmetics industry. This technique consists of integrating catalysts that accelerate a chemical reaction into a system powered by solar energy. In fact, the chemical reaction is produced thanks to this exposure. Ultimately, this technology could reduce plastic waste and CO2 emissions, while producing two valuable chemical products. The next step is to move from a laboratory experiment to full-scale production by exploring ways to commercialize this process. The researchers' findings are published in the journal, Nature."
"Rise in ocean plastic pollution 'unprecedented' since 2005, study found","Research published on Wednesday found that there are an estimated 170 trillion pieces of plastic, mainly microplastics, on the surface of the world's oceans today, much of it discarded since 2005. ""Plastic pollution in the world's oceans during the past 15 years has reached unprecedented levels,"" said the study, published in open-access journal PLOS One [1] The amounts were higher than previous estimates, and the study found that the rate of plastic entering the oceans could accelerate several-fold in the coming decades if left unchecked. Researchers took plastic samples from over 11,000 stations around the world focusing on a 40-year period between 1979 and 2019. They found no trends until 1990, then a fluctuation in trends between 1990 and 2005. After that, the samples skyrocket. ""We see a really rapid increase since 2005 because there is a rapid increase in production and also a limited number of policies that are controlling the release of plastic into the ocean,"" contributing author Lisa Erdle told AFP. The sources of plastic pollution in the ocean are numerous. Fishing gear like nets and buoys often end up in the middle of the ocean, dumped or dropped by accident, while things like clothing, car tyres and single-use plastics often pollute nearer to the coast. They eventually break down into microplastics, which Erdle said can look like ""confetti on the surface of the ocean"". On current trends, plastic use will nearly double from 2019 across G20 countries by 2050, reaching 451 million tonnes each year, according to the report, jointly produced by Economist Impact and The Nippon Foundation. In 1950, only two million tonnes of plastic were produced worldwide. Recycling, even in countries with advanced waste management systems, has done little to help the pollution problem since just a small percentage of plastics are properly recycled and much often ending up in landfills instead. If landfills are not properly managed, plastic waste can leech into the environment, eventually making its way to oceans. ""We really we see a lack of recycling, a flood of toxic products and packaging,"" Erdle said. The rates of plastic waste were seen to recede at some points between 1990 and 2005, in part because there were some effective policies in place to control pollution. That includes the 1988 MARPOL treaty, a legally binding agreement among 154 countries to end the discharge of plastics from naval, fishing and shipping fleets. But with so much more plastic being produced today, the study's authors said a new, wide-ranging treaty is needed to not only reduce plastic production and use but also better manage its disposal. ""Environmental recovery of plastic has limited merit, so solution strategies must address those systems that restrict emissions of plastic pollution in the first place,"" the study] said. Last year, 175 nations agreed to end plastic pollution under a legally binding United Nations agreement that could be finalised as soon as next year. Among the key actions under negotiation are a global ban on single-use plastics, a ""polluter pays"" scheme, and a tax on new plastic production. The total weight of the plastic pollution detected in the ocean today is estimated at 2.3 million tonnes, the PLOS study] said."
Carbon credits: a contested tool to fight deforestation,"Walt Disney, J.P. Morgan Bank and other major corporations have been accused of purchasing carbon credits from forest protection projects in areas that were not actually at risk of deforestation. Separately, a company responsible for managing 600,000 hectares of land in the United States has reportedly earned USD 53 million over the past two years from carbon credits that did not significantly alter its forest management practices. None of these projects sequestered carbon beyond that which would have been absorbed by trees through photosynthesis in a business-as-usual scenario. Still, companies counted the resulting carbon credits towards their own reduction targets, allowing them to offset emissions in the carbon accounting of their operations. Leaders and experts from around the world will gather in the Gabonese capital Libreville on March 1 and 2 for the One Forest Summit. Co-presided by France and Gabon, the meeting will focus on improving financial instruments aimed at protecting the world's forests. Carbon credits are already widely used. According to various estimates, the number of tons of CO2 they represent (with one credit equivalent to one ton) could increase tenfold by 2030, to around two billion tons. ""The risky aspect of the carbon credit market is that it is not self-regulating,"" said Cesar Dugast from French environmental consultancy Carbone 4, in an interview with AFP. ""Everyone has an interest in maximizing the quantity of carbon credits. It enables the project developers to spread the total cost over a maximum number of credits, offering a lower cost to buyers. Even the certifiers have an interest in the proliferation of projects,"" he added. In mid-January, The Guardian, Die Zeit and an NGO revealed that more than 90 percent of projects certified by leading verifier Verra for forest conservation under the UN programme to reduce deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) were likely ""ghost credits"" that did not represent ""real emissions reductions"". Verra's CEO, David Antonioli, rejected these findings, arguing that ""REDD projects are not some abstract concept on a piece of paper; they represent real projects on the ground that deliver life-affirming benefits."" After the story came out, the price of nature-related carbon credits has dropped, according to Paula VanLaningham, global head of carbon at S&P Global. The revelations about REDD+ projects have sparked a wider debate about the entire carbon credit system. ""Are the projects themselves a good vehicle for carbon finance in a way that actually leads to a just transition? Probably both yes and no,"" she told AFP. Several independent rating agencies have since defended their methodologies, stressing the crucial need for financing projects protecting nature. ""The first issue we look at is additionality: would the project have happened in absence of the carbon markets?"", Donna Lee, co-founder of Calyx Global, an independent rating agency for carbon projects, told AFP. ""We then look at how the baseline was set and what would have happened in the absence of the project."" The core issue with initiatives aimed at halting deforestation is the challenge of proving that deforestation would have occurred without the funding. ""We look at patterns of deforestation in the region... a lot of scientific studies show that there are certain things like roads, population, distance to the forest edge, that are often associated with deforestation,"" Lee said, while admitting that improvements are needed. Above all, the companies that buy these credits should be ""more transparent"" by clearly indicating where credits are sourced and how they reduce their own emissions, she added. ""We need to move from a mentality of compensating to a mindset of contributing,"" said Dugast from Carbone 4. In other words, companies financing forests to offset carbon emissions is acceptable, but not as a loophole to avoid reducing their own emissions."
"'Home compostable' plastic packaging is largely greenwashing, study says","It's not that easy to home compost plastic packaging! Actually, this solution might not be as environmentally friendly as it would appear at first sight. Such is the conclusion of a survey conducted by researchers at University College London, published in the journal Frontiers in Sustainability [1]. ""Compostable and biodegradable plastics are growing in popularity, but their environmental credentials need to be more fully assessed to determine how they can be a part of the solution to the plastic waste crisis,"" write the researchers, who set out to investigate such claims. Using a citizen science approach, the research sought to survey consumers to find out more about their purchasing habits for so-called ""biodegradable"" and ""home compostable"" plastic products, their knowledge of how to recycle them properly, and the actual performance of such packaging. The survey was conducted over a two-year period among 9,700 people across the UK. When asked if they were more likely to buy products with packaging marked ""compostable"" or ""biodegradable,"" 85% answered ""yes."" Of the participants, 1,648 actively engaged in a home-composting experiment (but only 902 completed it). The experiment involved examining the contents of the compost after depositing packaging (cups, jars, cutlery, newspaper wrappers) for traces of plastic. If 90% of the carbon in the test materials was gone within six months, they were considered compostable. The results show that, on the whole, deciphering labels featuring terms like ""compostable"" and ""biodegradable"" remains difficult for consumers. ""Despite our best efforts to guide the participants only to compost items marked clearly as 'home compostable,' many items that are marked as industrially compostable or just as biodegradable have been entered into the experiment,"" note the researchers. The study also suggests that laboratory testing for these materials is not working, which is a broader problem for the plastics industry, and calls into question whether these product standards actually protect the environment. ""The diversity of microbial communities, the catalytic pathways of nutrient transformation, the material chemical differences cannot be fully controlled and reproduced in vitro and hence home compostability standards are likely to be unreliable,"" note the study authors. They conclude: ""home composting is not an effective or environmentally beneficial waste processing method for biodegradable or compostable packaging in the UK."" Indeed, the only real solution is to use less plastic."
Blue whales eat 10 million pieces of microplastic a day: study,"The tiny fragments of plastic have been found everywhere from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, and even inside human organs and blood. Now a modelling study published in the journal Nature Communications [1] has estimated how much is being ingested by whales. A US-led research team put tags on 191 blue, fin and humpback whales that live off the coast of California to observe their movements. ""It's basically like an Apple Watch, just on the back of a whale,"" said Shirel Kahane-Rapport, a researcher at California State University, Fullerton and the study's first author. The whales mostly fed at depths of between 50 to 250 metres (165-820 feet), which is home to the ""greatest concentration of microplastics in the water column,"" Kahane-Rapport told AFP. The researchers then estimated the size and number of mouthfuls the whales had daily and what was filtered out, modelling three different scenarios. Under the most likely scenario, the blue whales ate up to 10 million microplastic pieces a day. Over the 90-120 day annual feeding season, that represents more than a billion pieces a year. The largest animal to live on Earth is also likely the biggest microplastic consumer, eating up to 43.6 kilogrammes a day, the study said. ""Imagine carrying around an extra 45 kilogrammes — yes, you're a very big whale, but that will take up space,"" Kahane-Rapport said. Humpback whales were estimated to eat around four million pieces a day. While it is easy to imagine whales sucking in vast amounts of microplastics as they gulp their way through the ocean, the researchers found that was not the case. Instead, 99 percent of the microplastics entered the whales because they were already inside their prey. ""That's concerning for us,"" Kahane-Rapport said, because humans eat that prey. ""We also eat anchovies and sardines,"" she said, adding that ""krill is the basis of the food web"". Previous research has shown that if krill are in a tank with microplastic, ""they will eat it,"" Kahane-Rapport said. Now that the researchers know how much microplastic is being consumed by whales, next they aim to determine how much harm it could be doing. ""The dose defines the poison,"" Kahane-Rapport said."
UK takes aim at company 'greenwashing',"The Financial Conduct Authority said it was proposing regulations, including investment product sustainability labels and restrictions on terms such as ""green"", ""sustainable"" and ""ESG"" (environmental, social, and governance). According to the FCA, there has been growth in the number of investment products marketed as 'green' or making wider sustainability claims. However, the agency considers exaggerated, misleading or unsubstantiated claims about ESG credentials damage confidence in these products. ""Greenwashing misleads consumers and erodes trust in all ESG products,"" said Sacha Sadan, FCA's Director of Environment Social and Governance. ""Consumers must be confident when products claim to be sustainable that they actually are. Our proposed rules will help consumers and firms build trust in this sector."" The FCA is proposing to introduce: sustainable investment product labels, restrictions on how certain sustainability-related terms – such as 'ESG', 'green' or 'sustainable' – can be used in product names and marketing for products which don't qualify for the sustainable investment labels, consumer-facing disclosures, more detailed disclosures, suitable for institutional investors or retail investors that want to know more, requirements for distributors of products, such as investment platforms, to ensure that the labels and consumer-facing disclosures are accessible and clear to consumers. The FCA is running a consultation on its proposals until January 25, ahead of publishing final rules by the end of June. Last week, a British watchdog hit out at HSBC for adverts promoting its green initiatives that failed to highlight the bank's contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. The Advertising Standards Authority banned further use of HSBC posters that appeared a year ago ahead of the COP26 climate summit hosted by Britain. HSBC insisted that the financial sector had ""a responsibility to communicate its role in the low carbon transition to raise public awareness and engage its customers"". But it also acknowledged the need to ""consider how best to do this"" as it delivers on the bank's ""ambitious net zero commitments"". UK multinationals seeking to meet a British government target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 are frequently accused of ""greenwashing"" by environmentalists."
"Plastic recycling remains a 'myth' in the USA, finds Greenpeace study","Titled ""Circular Claims Fall Flat Again,"" the study found that of 51 million tons of plastic waste generated by US households in 2021, only 2.4 million tons were recycled, or around five percent. After peaking in 2014 at 10 percent, the trend has been decreasing, especially since China stopped accepting the West's plastic waste in 2018. Virgin production — of non-recycled plastic, that is — meanwhile is rapidly rising as the petrochemical industry expands, lowering costs. ""Industry groups and big corporations have been pushing for recycling as a solution,"" Greenpeace USA campaigner Lisa Ramsden told AFP. ""By doing that, they have shirked all responsibility"" for ensuring that recycling actually works, she added. She named Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever and Nestle as prime offenders. According to Greenpeace USA's survey, only two types of plastic are widely accepted at the nation's 375 material recovery facilities. The first is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is commonly used in water and soda bottles; and the second is high density polyethylene (HDPE), seen in milk jugs, shampoo bottles and cleaning product containers. These are numbered ""1"" and ""2"" according to a standardized system in which there are seven plastic types. But being recyclable in theory doesn't mean products are being recycled in practice. The report found that PET and HDPE products had actual reprocessing rates of 20.9 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively — both down slightly from Greenpeace USA's last survey in 2020. Plastic types ""3"" through ""7"" — including children's toys, plastic bags, produce wrappings, yogurt and margarine tubs, coffee cups and to-go food containers — were reprocessed at rates of less than five percent. Despite often carrying the recycling symbol on their labels, products that use plastic types ""3"" through ""7"" fail to meet the Federal Trade Commission classification of recyclable. This is because recycling facilities for these types aren't available to a ""substantial majority"" of the population, defined as 60 percent, and because the collected products are not being used in the manufacturing or assembly of new items. According to the report, there were five main reasons why plastic recycling is a ""failed concept."" First, plastic waste is generated in vast quantities and is extremely difficult to collect — as becomes clear during what the report called ineffective ""volunteer cleanup stunts"" funded by nonprofits such as ""Keep America Beautiful."" Second, even if it were all collected, mixed plastic waste cannot be recycled together, and it would be ""functionally impossible to sort the trillions of pieces of consumer plastic waste produced each year,"" the report said. Third, the recycling process itself is environmentally harmful, exposing workers to toxic chemicals and itself generating microplastics. Fourth, recycled plastic carries toxicity risks through contamination with other plastic types in collection bins, preventing it from becoming food-grade material again. Fifth and finally, the process of recycling is prohibitively expensive. ""New plastic directly competes with recycled plastic, and it's far cheaper to produce and of higher quality,"" said the report. Ramsden called on corporations to support a Global Plastics Treaty, which United Nations members agreed to create in February, and move toward refill and reuse strategies. ""This isn't actually a new concept — it's how the milkman used to be, it's how Coca-Cola used to get its beverages to people. They would drink their beverage, give the glass bottle back, and it would be sanitized and reused,"" she said. Some countries are leading the way, including India, which recently banned 19 single-use plastic items. Austria has set reuse targets of 25 percent by 2025 and at least 30 percent by 2030 for beverage packaging, while Portugal has also set the 30 percent by 2030 goal. Chile is moving to phase out single-use cutlery and mandating refillable bottles."
"Waterless, refillable, upcycled: Circular cosmetic products are mushrooming","Among recent launches, there is an increasing number of waterless products, highlights Ecovia Intelligence. Brands are launching shampoo bars, sheet masks and related products. By not containing water, such products have lower environmental impact as they require less packaging, have lower transportation and distribution costs, and can be self-preserving. Garnier, Aveda, and Klorane are some of the established brands launching waterless products in the last couple of years. In June, P&G joined the bandwagon and announced that it will launch solid shampoos and conditioners under its Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences and Aussie brands. Waterless innovations are now spreading to colour cosmetics, although powders and sticks have long been common in this category. Newcomers like SBTRCT are making a step further with plastic-free and zero waste products. Skin care appears to be the very next frontier for waterless products. Emerging brands such as Yodi, Mono Skincare and Maison Dakōta are pioneering the category, with suppliers such as Aircos or Superga Beauty, among others, multiplying innovations. To close their packaging loops, brands are also moving away from single-use plastics and refillable packaging is becoming prominent. In addition, Terracycle has expanded its Loop platform for refillable packaging to various countries. Labelled the circular reuse platform, Loop works with cosmetic companies and retailers so consumers can return product packaging for re-use. In the deodorants sector, innovations are involving refillable packaging. Fussy and Wild Cosmetics, for instance, are UK brands that have launched sustainable deodorants in refillable deodorants. Fussy deodorants have clean formulations and are housed in plastic-free compostable packaging; the products are marketed as the 'next generation' deodorant. As far as ingredients are concerned, upcycling is becoming increasingly popular as the cosmetic industry looks to valorise waste streams. Leading ingredient firms, such as Dow Chemical and Laboratories Expanscience, are using food byproducts to create new natural ingredients. Fruit kernels, vegetable peels, and coffee grounds are some of the waste materials used. The Finnish start-up Innomost is making cosmetic ingredients from birch bark side streams. Dr. Craft, O'right, UpCircle and Kadalys are some of the brands developing dedicated product ranges with 'repurposed ingredients'. The move towards circularity is also encouraging collaborations. Clariant, Beiersdorf, Borealis and Siegwerk have teamed up to create circular packaging innovations. The Design4Circularity initiative has created a colourless polyolefin bottle made from 100% post-consumer recycled material. The packaging materials can be recovered and fully recyclable for the same application. As the circular beauty trend is gaining impetus in the cosmetics industry, Ecovia Intelligence believes its success will hinge on customer behaviour. Shoppers will buy novel products if they are aware of their sustainability merits. Consumers also need to be educated on how to use waterless products, what packaging to recycle, where and how to refill. ""The cosmetics industry is making sustainable products, however are consumers being prepared for them,"" asks Ecovia Intelligence. Sustainable Cosmetics Summit - European Edition Waterless cosmetics, upcycled ingredients, refillable packaging, new packaging materials, and customer behaviour will be featured in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit. Lush, Terracycle, SBTRCT, Clariant, Dow Chemical, L'Oreal (Garnier), Fussy and Kadalys will be sharing their experiences at the event. Since 2009, the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit has been covering sustainability issues in the cosmetic & personal care industry. The European edition will be hosted at the Paris Marriott Champs-Élysées hotel on 7-9th November 2022. More information is available from www.sustainablecosmeticssummit.com/Europe/"
"Despite very low collection rates, Nigeria tries to recycle wastes","In Africa's biggest economy and most populous country, collecting, sorting and recycling trash is despairingly rare. But there is also good news. Some entrepreneurs are working hard to tackle the rubbish mountain, despite the many challenges. Romco Metals started recycling aluminium at its factory outside Lagos in 2015, drawn by global demand for the light, strong and flexible metal. Buoyed by good results, it built a second facility outside Ghana's capital Accra and now plans to open at least three new plants across Africa and triple production by 2025. Aluminium is the world's second most-used metal after steel and used widely in construction, medicine, car-making and packaging. ""Electric vehicles require more durable lighter material such as aluminium, and that's where our materials end up,"" said the company's youthful founder, 32-year-old Raymond Onovwigun. A British-registered company, Romco melts down and recycles around 1,500 tonnes of discarded aluminium per month, out of a capacity of 3,000 tonnes. It says it has created 450 direct jobs — 5,000 in total, in this labour-intensive sector — and plans to double that number within a year. Among those who have most benefited from Romco's business are material suppliers like Mohammed Ashiru Madugu, who delivers several truckloads of metal scrap each week. Madugu has a warehouse in northwestern Katsina, where suppliers from across the state and even neighbouring states bring him discarded metal. He loads the goods onto trucks and sends them all the way to Lagos, more than a thousand kilometres (600 miles) away. For one truck, he can get paid up to 26 million naira (about $60,000 dollars) although the price fluctuates. The scrap supplier said those trips required escorts because of the risk of ambushes by criminal gangs on the road [1]. However, only a tiny fraction of waste is recycled in Nigeria, a country of some 210 million consumers. Plastic, metal and glass are mostly tossed out. Each year, Nigeria disgorges 200,000 tonnes of plastic into the Atlantic, the UN Industrial Development Organisation reported last year. In Lagos alone, a city of more than 20 million people, less than 10 percent total recyclables are currently collected, Ibrahim Adejuwon Odumboni, managing director of the Lagos State Management Agency told AFP. By comparison, in the UK, more than 41 percent of waste picked up by local authorities was recycled last year, according to local statistics. For Odumboni, recycling initiatives are to be commended but more should be done by the companies making aluminium beverage cans and other products. ""We need the manufacturers to invest in the collection system. In many parts of the world, a portion of what producers sell is going into the recovery of products. We currently don't have that in Nigeria,"" he said. If companies selling aluminium products ""are not held responsible (for collecting waste) then it doesn't make any sense — we're just going round and round in circle."" He blames poor legislation but says an improved law on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is currently being discussed in the state house of assembly. EPR is an environmental policy in place in many countries that gives producers incentives to take responsibility for their products after they are used. Another challenge for recyclers is carbon emissions from the energy they use to crush, shred or melt old materials. Romco, for instance, uses compressed natural gas to turn the aluminium into ingots. ""(It) is still a fossil fuel but the best, most efficient fossil fuel. It doesn't contain lead or sulphur,"" said Onovwigun. The company says, however, that it wants to be independent of fossil fuels and is ""exploring the potential of using solar, green hydrogen, and biofuels."""
L'Oréal North Asia Zone achieves carbon neutrality across all sites,"Mainland China was the first market worldwide to achieve carbon neutrality for all L'Oréal sites in 2019. Now with Japan achieving carbon neutrality for its sites in July 2022, L'Oréal North Asia became the first zone of the L'Oréal Group to achieve carbon neutrality for all the sites the beauty giant operates. The North Asia Zone spans five geographic markets, including: Mainland China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. ""With the United Nations warning that every country, city, organisation should adopt plans for net zero – the call to act has seen L'Oréal North Asia Zone rise to the challenge and show true leadership. As a company, we recognized the gravity of the global environmental crisis more than 20 years ago and began reducing our environmental footprint in our manufacturing plants and distribution centers back in 2009. With the launch of our ambitious sustainability commitment in 2020 - L'Oréal for the Future - which states that all L'Oréal sites worldwide must reach carbon neutrality by 2025, the North Asia Zone accelerated its efforts to achieve its goals, which we are immensely proud of,"" said Mr. Fabrice Megarbane, President of L'Oréal North Asia and CEO of L'Oréal China. Mr. Megarbane announced the news at 2022 L'Oréal North Asia & China Indirect Sourcing Supplier Day in Shanghai, where the company brought together around 100 strategic suppliers and key stakeholders to discuss collective efforts and solutions on CO2 emissions reduction. In North Asia, L'Oréal have implemented dynamic measures and a variety of strategic approaches across the different sites that have contributed to the goal of reaching carbon neutrality for each of them. – Generating renewable energy onsite. In both Mainland China and South Korea, CO2 emissions reduction through installing onsite renewable energy generating facilities has been an important contribution to the overall effort. At L'Oréal's BeautyCos plant in Suzhou, onsite solar panels have been generating 1.2M kWh of electricity every year since 2015. Similarly, the rooftop solar panels installed at L'Oréal's distribution centre in Suzhou provided 100% of its 4.4M kWh electricity needs since 2019. – Onsite facilities adopting diverse renewable energy solutions. L'Oréal's BeautyCos plant is a showcase of how diverse sustainable energy solutions work together to achieve CO2emissions reduction goals. In addition to its solar power generating system, a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system was built onsite to use biogas to produce steam, electricity and heat with high efficiency. The biogas is generated by a biomass energy project at Suzhou Industrial Park, which uses kitchen and landscaping waste as raw materials for energy generation. Combining solar power generation, CHP system installation and sourcing renewable electricity nearby, BeautyCos achieved carbon neutrality in 2019. – Sourcing local renewable energy in five markets. In addition to having onsite facilities generating renewable energy, L'Oréal sites in North Asia aimed to source local renewable energy. In Mainland China, L'Oréal's Yichang Tianmei Plant achieved carbon neutrality with 100% use of hydropower in 2018. Other L'Oréal China offices and campuses adopted solutions to reduce drastically their CO2 emissions through partnerships with a renewable energy project in Jiangsu Province. L'Oréal Korea started participating in Korea's RE100-system (a global initiative on renewable power) in 2021 and received renewable energy certification from Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) for the energy used across all its offices and distribution centres. In its Japanese plant in Gotemba, L'Oréal has installed new electrical boilers using renewable electricity. L'Oréal Japan met its carbon neutrality goals by participating in the Green Power and Heat Certificates initiative for its research & innovation centre, offices and plant. The initiative sponsors renewable energy generation facilities that are validated by the local authorities that encompass areas such as wind, biomass, hydro, and solar power stations. L'Oréal Taiwan is the first company in the market to channel its renewable energy efforts through Power Purchasing Agreements with local authorities and the landlord of the commercial building where it operates. This enabled the organization to achieve its carbon neutrality status in late 2021. Similarly, L'Oréal Hong Kong site achieved carbon neutrality in 2020 with the implementation of energy efficiency measures the installation of LED lighting to reduce energy consumption and sourcing local renewable electricity for its office. ""From today, in North Asia, each L'Oréal product is produced and stored in plants and warehouses that are carbon neutral. Going forward, we will further collaborate with our stakeholders to reduce CO2 emissions along the entire industry value chain through product innovation and consumer empowerment programs, transportation upgrading and collaboration with strategic suppliers,"" Mr. Pankaj Gupta, SVP of L'Oréal North Asia and China Operations. The L'Oréal Group has set long-term goals to reduce all its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 in absolute terms compared to 2016, and aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050. These goals were set in accordance with the Science Based Targets, which aim to limit global warming to 1.5°C, according to climate scientist recommendations, as set by the Paris Agreement."
How to make perfumes enter the Symbiocene age? A study,"According to the two specialists, ""perfume is one the most packed products in the world, with a most unfavourable container/content ratio"". In this exclusive study structured in four chapters, Pascale Brousse, founder of the Trend Sourcing Agency, and Gérald Martines, founder of the packaging innovation consulting company In•Signes, provide a multitude of areas of focus and food for thought to reverse the current trend and make this product category enter a new sustainable luxury world. ""The study is aimed to offer operational tools that help understand what we can do to improve perfumes' environmental impact by relying on sociology and drawing inspiration from experiences in related fields,"" explains Gérald Martines. As an introduction, Pascale Brousse makes an update on the mindset of this industry, whose players have definitely started to think green. ""Today, it is almost suspicious to launch a perfume that does not offer at least one 'sustainable' feature. Even the most conventional brands and composition companies have reviewed their offerings accordingly,"" she says. However, to her, it is essential to go even further towards a new age called ""the Symbiocene"" [1], an era of symbiosis with nature, as opposed to the current period sometimes called ""Anthropocene"". ""The Anthropocene is the geological age when Man acquired the monumental power to modify the very structure of the Earth System, the biosphere, the oceans, the climate… It is a state that cannot be sustained and generates irreversible damage. As a consequence, we should give up on our lifestyle, as predators of natural resources, and enter the Symbiocene age, an era to be invented and where Man would live in symbiosis with Nature,"" says Gérald Martines. He also reminds that the most pragmatic eco-design tool is to implement the 3Rs, in the right order: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. ""There is actually a fourth R, which stands for Refuse. Consumers are the deciders: if they are not convinced, they will refuse the product,"" warns Gérald Martines. To proceed, the study invites companies to broaden their vision beyond the standard model consisting of an alcohol-based juice, a glass bottle and a spray, and imagine new gestures, new galenic forms, and draw inspiration from related fields. ""We have already observed many experiments with unconventional galenic forms, packaging, and gestures. Solid perfumes are being reinvented, gels and pencils have emerged… But we need to go further. Right now, there are many new solutions in the skincare category consisting of concentrated formulas to be diluted. Why could it not be considered for perfumes? Perfumes that could be diluted at home? Or In&Out perfumes? The most widely known format still has bright days ahead, but young consumers are very fond of new experiences,"" explains Pascale Brousse. ""If we mention these different galenic forms, it is because this choice is far from environmentally neutral. Each galenic form goes with a pack and a gesture. These dimensions have a significant influence on the environmental impact,"" adds Gérald Martines. Then, the study explores four major themes: lightening, circularity, regeneration, and the Symbiocene. The concept of lightening is related to the sociology of lightness. ""This approach should be applied to everything. The bottle, but also the cap, pump, decoration… Some brands no longer use caps, like Escentric Molecules. Floratropia does not use bottles, but pouches…,"" explain the experts. The notion of circularity includes reuse and recycling. ""Even the notion of 'flaw' will change: it will be a differentiating point. The idea is that nothing will be thrown away, everything will have a value. Glassmaking typically generates high waste levels up to over 40%: four bottles out of 10 are thrown away! Sometimes for a tiny visual imperfection without any effect on functionality. This notion of imperfection can be questioned: why could we not consider flaws as singularities that shape the personality and unicity of each bottle?"" ask the two specialists. The issue of regeneration is closely related to that of carbon emissions. ""In the years to come, we are going to have to focus on restoration and repair. Some makeup brands are already emerging with concepts based on regenerative agroforestry, which consists in working on soils to bring them back to life. It can definitely be an option in the perfume industry,"" explains Pascale Brousse. ""We also deal with initiatives like Coty's and L'Oréal's. They use ethanol or plastic based on captured CO2. It is a step in the right direction. There is a new eco-design strategy which will consist in systematically checking whether resources can be drawn from the waste available, and it even works with CO2,"" adds Gérald Martines. Lastly, the study closes with a hoped-for entrance in the Symbiocene age and what a perfume industry in symbiosis with nature would look like…"
Polystyrene-munching superworms could hold key to plastic upcycling,"Scientists at Australia's University of Queensland have now discovered that superworms — the larvae of Zophobas morio darkling beetles — are able to dine on polystyrene, and their gut enzymes could hold the key to higher recycling rates. Chris Rinke, who led a study that was published last week in the journal Microbial Genomics [1], told AFP previous reports had shown that tiny waxworms and mealworms (which are also beetle larvae) had a good track record when it came to eating plastic, ""so we hypothesized that the much larger superworms can eat even more."" Superworms can grow up to two inches (five centimeters) and are bred as a food source for reptiles and birds, or even for humans in countries such as Thailand and Mexico. Rinke and his team fed superworms different diets over a three week period, with some given polystyrene foam, commonly known as styrofoam, some bran, and others not fed at all. ""We confirmed that superworms can survive on a sole polystyrene diet, and even gain a small amount of weight — compared to a starvation control group — which suggests that the worms can gain energy from eating polystyrene,"" he said. Although the polystyrene-reared superworms completed their life cycle, becoming pupae and then fully developed adult beetles, tests revealed a loss of microbial diversity in their guts and potential pathogens. These findings suggested that while the bugs can survive on polystyrene, it is not a nutritious diet and impacts their health. Next, the team used a technique called metagenomics to analyze the microbial gut community and find which gene-encoded enzymes were involved in degrading the plastic. One way to put the findings to use would be to provide superworms with food waste or agricultural bioproducts to consume alongside polystyrene. ""This could be a way to improve the health of the worms and to deal with the large amount of food waste in Western countries,"" said Rinke. But while breeding more worms for this purpose is possible, he envisages another route: creating recycling plants that mimic what the larvae do, which is to first shred the plastic in their mouths then digest it through bacterial enzymes. ""Ultimately, we want to take the superworms out of the equation,"" he said, and he now plans more research aimed at finding the most efficient enzymes, then enhancing them further through enzyme engineering. The breakdown products by these new generation enzymes could then be fed to other microbes to create high-value compounds, such as bioplastics, in what he hopes would become an economically viable ""upcycling"" approach."
"Global plastic waste on track to triple by 2060, but recycling could help","In the absence of bold new policies, the annual production of fossil-fuel-based plastics is set to top 1.2 billion tonnes by 2060 and waste to exceed one billion tonnes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Plastic production is expected to grow faster than the one of most raw materials. The growth will be fastest in developing and emerging countries in Africa and Asia, although the 38 OECD members will still produce much more plastic waste per person (238 kg per year on average) in 2060 than non-OECD countries (77 kg). Even with aggressive action to cut demand and improve efficiencies, plastic production would almost double in less than 40 years, the international organisation projects. However, such globally coordinated policies could hugely boost the share of future plastic waste that is recycled, from 12 to 40 percent. ""If we want a world that is free of plastic pollution, in line with the ambitions of the United Nations Environment Assembly, we will need to take much more stringent and globally co-ordinated action,"" OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said. There is increasing international alarm over volume and omnipresence of plastics pollution, and its impact. Infiltrating the most remote and otherwise pristine regions of the planet, microplastics have been discovered inside fish in the deepest recesses of the ocean and locked inside Arctic ice. The debris is estimated to cause the deaths of more than a million seabirds and over 100,000 marine mammals each year. ""Plastic pollution is one of the great environmental challenges of the 21st century, causing wide-ranging damage to ecosystems and human health,"" Mathias Cormann added. Since the 1950s, roughly 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic have been produced with more than 60 percent of that tossed into landfills, burned or dumped directly into rivers and oceans. Some 460 million tonnes of plastics were used in 2019, twice as much as 20 years earlier. The amount of plastic waste has also nearly doubled, exceeding 350 million tonnes, with less than 10 percent of it recycled. The report contrasts a business-as-usual trajectory with the benefits of more ambitious global policies of reduced plastic use and pollution. Driven by economic growth and an expanding population, plastics production is set to increase under either scenario, the OECD warns. Where policies can make a huge difference is in the handling of waste. The report looks at the impact of two potential scenarios. The first, a regional action scenario comprising a mix of fiscal and regulatory policies primarily in OECD countries could decrease plastic waste by almost a fifth and more than halve plastic leakage into the environment without a substantial impact on global GDP, which would be lower by 0.3% by 2060. The second, a global action scenario comprising more stringent policies implemented worldwide, could decrease plastic waste by a third and almost completely eliminate plastic leakage to the environment while lowering global GDP by an estimated 0.8%. Currently, nearly 100 million tonnes of plastic waste is either mismanaged or allowed to leak into the environment. ""Co-ordinated and ambitious global efforts can almost eliminate plastic pollution by 2060,"" the report concludes. According to the OECD, policies to reduce the environmental impacts of plastics and encourage a more circular use of them should include: taxes on plastics, including on plastic packaging; incentives to reuse and repair plastic items; targets for recycled content in new plastic products; extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes; improved waste management infrastructure; increased litter collection rates. Earlier this year, the United Nations set in motion a process to develop an internationally binding treaty to limit plastic pollution."
Decarbonization: Pochet prepares the future of glass at its Guimerville plant,"A highly energy-consuming process, glass bottle manufacturing has a big environmental footprint, in particular in terms of CO2 emissions. The production of a single 100-ml bottle typically composed of 200 grams of glass in a standard gas furnace (they are the most widely used) would result in 180 grams of CO2 emitted [1]. Committed to reducing its environmental impact, Groupe Pochet has announced the building of a 100% electric furnace in their Guimerville plant. Scheduled for July 2024, the work should be completed by the end of 2024. This new electric furnace is part of the Groupe Pochet's global decarbonization plan, which aims to reduce its CO2 emissions and fight global warming. Since 2014, the Groupe Pochet has reduced its CO2 emissions by 32% by ton of fired glass vs 2011, in particular thanks to the renovation or reconstruction of several furnaces. The group aims to reach a 50% reduction by 2033. To achieve these goal, Pochet will power the furnace with carbon-free electricity. ""This electric furnace will be the very first French furnace dedicated to luxury bottles. It will enable us to drastically reduce our CO2 emissions by producing a largely carbon-free glass that will guarantee the beauty of tomorrow,"" emphasizes Benoit Marszalek, Pochet du Courval's Chief Operating Officer. Decarbonization is one of the major challenges for the glass industry. Earlier this year, Verescence also announced the construction of an electric furnace in 2025 in its Mers-les-Bains plant. Another way to reduce the energy consumption of glass production, the use of recycled cullet in the process is also one of the options preferred by Pochet. Using one tonne of cullet saves 1.2 tonnes of raw materials and reduces energy consumption, as cullet is easier to melt than sand. Like all other glassmakers, Pochet already uses its own production scrap in its manufacturing process. Actually, the main challenge is to increase the quantity of post-consumer recycled glass (PCR) without altering the legendary transparency of the glass signed by the company, which will celebrate its 400th anniversary in 2023. To achieve a 15% rate of PCR cullet, Pochet created a sorting loop dedicated to extra-flint glass, in partnership with Sibelco. The reconstruction plan of this furnace comes at a time of boom in demand for Pochet, which also plans new investments to continue the automation and ergonomic improvement of workstations for 2025. More than 400 additional staffs have been recruited at the Guimerville plant over the past year to respond to the increase in activity."
Industrial use of captured carbon could dramatically reduce GHG emissions,"Today, the production of chemicals and derived materials heavily relies on the use of fossil carbon. Industrial processes need hydrocarbons to provide process energy (electricity and heat) and to provide embedded carbon (i.e. the carbon bound in molecular structures) of diverse substances. Beyond fossil hydrocarbons, CO2 capture can also provide a useful source of embedded carbon. Fragrance giant Coty, for instance, recently started manufacturing fragrances using ethanol made from recycled carbon. The company aims to integrate sustainable ethanol into the majority of its fragrance portfolio by 2023 through its partnership with LanzaTech. A pioneer in carbon capture LanzaTech has also joined forces with France's beauty L'Oréal group and energy giant Total to develop a plastic bottle made with polyethylene derived from captured and recycled carbon emissions. After a successful test, L'Oréal, Total and Lanzatech expect the industrialization phase to be completed by 2024. In an exploratory scenario, the study ""CO2 reduction potential of the chemical industry through CCU"" [1] investigates the greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that can be achieved in the global chemical and derived material industries if the entire demand for embedded carbon is met solely and exclusively via CO2 instead of from fossil sources. Major simplifications are used in the study. For instance, methanol (CH3OH) is considered to cover the needs for hydrocarbons for chemicals and derived materials among the various chemical intermediates as a representative pathway for renewable carbon. The examined production route includes CO2 capture as a mix of direct air capture (DAC) and capture from different point sources, hydrogen supply and the hydrogenation reaction for methanol synthesis. The GHG emissions related to CCU-based methanol synthesis depend on the emissions of the renewable energy production. According to the study, emissions of CCU-based methanol could be 67 to 77% lower compared to emissions from releasing embedded carbon of fossil fuels, when using current energy supply based on photovoltaics. With improvements in renewable energy production, the reduction could increase to levels between 96 and 100%. Meeting the annual global demand for carbon embedded in chemicals and derived materials (450 million tonnes of carbon today and maybe 1,000 million tonnes by 2050) with CCU-based methanol would cause an immense demand of renewable energy. Enormous efforts would have to be made to deploy sufficient renewable energy, but the results are worth it. Indeed, with fully decarbonised energy supply, an amount of 3.7 Gt CO2 per year can be saved. ""These GHG emission savings are significant - even in comparison to today's global emissions of 55.6 Gt CO2 eq/year. The result shows that CCU is a promising technology to reduce GHG emissions related to embedded carbon supply - if sufficient renewable energy is available,"" said the authors of the study. As a conclusion, while CCU-based carbon could be an important pillar of a future build on renewable carbon, complementing carbon from recycling and from biomass, the production of renewable energies must be rapidly expanded to enable the full deployment of the technology."
Beiersdorf to launch the world's first skincare product with recycled CO2,"In the wake of Coty, which announced earlier this year they have started producing fragrances using ethanol made from recycled carbon, it is up to the owner of the Nivea, Eucerin, Labello, La Prairie or Chantecaille brands to opt for the carbon capture and utilization (CCU) process. Indeed, the new Nivea Men ""Climate Care Moisturizer"", which is scheduled to be launched as a limited edition in Germany in early June 2022, will be the first skin-care product to use an ingredient (ethanol) obtained from recycled carbon dioxide. Exactly as Coty, Beiersdorf uses a carbon dioxide recycling technology that collects industrial emissions. First, the carbon dioxide is collected at specific locations such as industrial chimneys and diverted to a bioreactor, where it is then fermented and processed into a cosmetic ethanol. The Nivea Men ""Climate Care Moisturizer""contains a total of 14 percent ethanol that has been obtained through alternative methods. Moreover, the formula is 100 percent free of microplastics, silicones, mineral oils, and PEG/PEG derivatives. This men's skin care product is manufactured using electricity from 100 percent renewable sources and is climate-neutralized. Indeed, the remaining CO2 emissions linked to the production have been compensated through certified climate projects. Furthermore, the formula is 99 percent biodegradable, with fully recyclable packaging. ""This new men's skin care product with the innovative CO2-recycling technology represents an important milestone for us,"" says Jean-Francois Pascal, Vice President Sustainability at Beiersdorf. The group has set itself ambitious carbon-reduction targets, aiming to achieve an absolute decrease of 30 percent of its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and 10 percent of its scope 3 emissions group-wide by 2025 (using 2018 as a basis)."
The cosmetics industry joins forces to create a global environmental scoring,"The initiative, which was launched last September by Henkel, L'Oréal, LVMH, Natura &Co, and Unilever, is now taking the form of a new coalition to develop an industry-wide environmental impact assessment and scoring system for cosmetics products. So far, the EcoBeautyScore Consortium gathers 36 small and large companies and associations from four continents [1]. It remains open for other potential members to join. According to its founding members, the purpose of the EcoBeautyScore Consortium is to help consumers to make sustainable choices regarding cosmetic and personal care products. They have therefore started building up an industry-wide scoring system, based on a common science-based methodology, in order to provide consumers with ""clear, transparent, and comparable"" information on the environmental impact of products. The new assessment and scoring system will encompass the formula, packaging and usage of each product. To ensure a robust and scientific approach to co-build an assessment methodology and scoring system, the consortium is working with sustainability consultancy Quantis, who founded the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for CosmEtics (SPICE) together with L'Oréal four years ago. The measurement of environmental impacts throughout the lifecycle of products will be backed by the principles of the ""Product Environmental Footprint"" (the European Union's PEF scientific method based on life cycle assessment of products). Common databases on the environmental impact of formula ingredients and packaging materials will also be implemented. The 36 members of the EcoBeautyScore Consortium have aleady started to work together organized in thematic working groups. A footprinting and scoring prototype is targeted for end of 2022, providing the environmental scoring for a selection of product categories at first. It will then be verified by independent parties. The Consortium said it will also consult external experts, including scientists, academics, and NGOs ""to make sure the process is as inclusive as possible."""
"Only 9% of plastic recycled worldwide: OECD calling for ""global solutions""","A new report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report [1] found that 460 million tonnes of plastics were used in 2019, the number nearly doubling since 2000. The amount of plastic waste had more than doubled during that time to 353 million tonnes, the Paris-based OECD said. ""After taking into account losses during recycling, only nine percent of plastic waste was ultimately recycled, while 19 percent was incinerated and almost 50 percent went to sanitary landfills,"" it said in its Global Plastics Outlook. ""The remaining 22 percent was disposed of in uncontrolled dumpsites, burned in open pits or leaked into the environment."" Plastic waste generated annually per person varies from 221 kg in the United States and 114 kg in European OECD countries to 69 kg, on average, for Japan and Korea. The Covid-19 pandemic saw the use of plastics drop by 2.2 percent in 2020 compared to the previous year. However single-use plastics rose and overall use is ""projected to pick up again"" as the economy rebounds. Plastics contributed 3.4 percent of global greenhouse emissions in 2019, 90 percent of it from ""production and conversion from fossil fuels"", the report also said. In the face of rampant global warming and pollution, it is ""crucial that countries respond to the challenge with coordinated and global solutions"", OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in the report. The OECD proposed a series of ""levers"" to address the issue, including developing the market for recycled plastics, which only represent six percent of the total - largely because they are more expensive. Among other actions, the organisation suggests increasing the number of ""extended producer responsibility"" regulations for waste management, or imposing minimum thresholds for the use of recycled plastic. It added that new technologies related to decreasing the environmental footprint of plastic represented only 1.2 percent of all innovation concerning the product. While calling for ""a more circular plastics lifecycle"", the OECD said that policies must also restrain overall consumption. It also called for ""major investments in basic waste management infrastructure"", including 25 billion euros ($28 billion) a year to go towards efforts in low and middle-income countries. The report comes less than a week before the UN Environment Assembly begins on February 28 in Nairobi, where formal talks are expected to begin on a future international plastics treaty, the scope of which will be discussed. Shardul Agrawala, the head of the OECD's environment and economy integration division, said Tuesday's report ""further accentuates the need for countries to come together to start looking towards a global agreement to address this very important problem"". Asked about the priorities of the treaty to be discussed in Nairobi, he said that ""there is an urgent waste management problem which is responsible for the bulk of the leakage to the environment"". ""But we should not limit our focus just to the end of pipe solutions, there is a greater need in the long term to forge international cooperation and agreement towards alignment of standards,"" he told an online press briefing Monday. In a survey published Tuesday by polling firm Ipsos for the World Wildlife Fund, 88 percent of respondents stressed the importance of an international treaty to combat plastic pollution. In the 28 countries surveyed, 23 percent of the respondents said such a treaty was ""fairly important"", 31 percent said it was ""very important"" and 34 percent found it ""essential"". Awareness level ranges from 96% in Mexico or 95% in China, to 78% in the United States and 70% in Japan."
"Plastic, chemical pollution beyond planet's safe limit: study","There are an estimated 350,000 different manufactured chemicals on the market and large volumes of them end up in the environment. ""The impacts that we're starting to see today are large enough to be impacting crucial functions of planet Earth and its systems"", Bethanie Carney Almroth, co-author of a new study told AFP in an interview. The study, by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, comes ahead of a UN meeting in Nairobi at the end of the month on tackling plastic pollution ""from source to sea"", UN Environment Programme head Inger Andersen said on Monday. Chemicals and plastics are affecting biodiversity, piling additional stress on already stressed ecosystems. Pesticides kill living organisms indiscriminately and plastics are ingested by living things. ""Some chemicals are interfering with hormone systems, disrupting growth, metabolism and reproduction in wildlife,"" Carney Almroth said. While greater efforts are needed to prevent these substances being released into the environment, scientists are now pushing for more drastic solutions, such as production caps. In particular as recycling has so far yielded only mediocre results. Less than 10 percent of the world's plastic is currently recycled, even as production has doubled to 367 million tonnes since 2000. Today, the total weight of plastic on Earth is now four times the biomass of all living animals, according to recent studies. ""What we're trying to say is that maybe we have to say, 'Enough is enough'. Maybe we can't tolerate more,"" the Sweden-based researcher said. ""Maybe we have to put a cap on production. Maybe we need to say, 'We can't produce more than this'."" For several years, the Stockholm Resilience Centre has been conducting studies on ""planetary boundaries"" in nine areas that influence Earth's stability, such as greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater usage and the ozone layer. The aim is to determine if mankind is in a ""safe operating space"" or if the limits are being exceeded and threaten the future of the planet. The impact of so-called ""novel entities"" - or man-made chemical products such as plastics, antibiotics, pesticides, and non-natural metals - has until now been a big question. And the answer is complex. ""We are only beginning to understand the large-scale, long-term effects of these exposures,"" Carney Almroth said. Not only are there thousands of these products but the data on the risks they pose is often non-existent or classified as corporate secrets. Additionally, the chemicals are relatively recent, most of them developed in the past 70 years. ""And we're talking about 350,000 different substances,"" Carney Almroth said. ""We don't have knowledge on the vast majority of those, in terms of how much are produced or their stability. Or their fate in the environment or their toxicity. We know what some of them are. For most of them, we have no clue,"" she added. Even the most comprehensive databases, such as the European Union's REACH inventory, only cover 150,000 products, and only a third of those have been the subject of detailed toxicity studies. As a result, the team of researchers focused on what is known, and this partial information was enough to draw an alarming conclusion. ""Looking at changes over time and trends in production volumes lost in the environment ... and connecting that to the little bit we do know about impacts, we could say that every arrow is pointing in the wrong direction"", Carney Almroth said. There is still ""time to revert this situation"" but it will take ""urgent and ambitious actions ... at an international level"", she added. Furthermore, there's no 'silver bullet'. ""No one answer is going to solve all of this, because a lot of these chemicals and materials are things that we use and that are necessary for our lives as of right now,"" Carney Almroth explained. Regardless of how much effort is made during the production or waste management phase, production volumes need to come down, she stressed. ""This seems very obvious to say but it's only recently accepted as truth: The more you produce, the more you release""."
Decarbonization: Verescence launches the electrification of its glass furnaces,"Verescence has unveiled the first steps of its decarbonization roadmap, which should enable the group to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 40% by 2034 for scopes 1 (direct emissions) and 2 (emissions related to energies). The glassmaker has announced the electrification of its furnaces around the world, starting with the Furnace 1 at the Mers-les-Bains plant in France. This initiative is part of Verescence's commitment in 2020 to setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2022 aligned with the trajectory of the so-called ""well-below 2° Celsius"" scenario proposed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Its aim is to set targets that are consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. ""I'm pleased to announce this major development which will allow us to decrease by half our CO2 emissions in less than 10 years in France and bring us even closer to our zero-carbon ambition by 2050. Our new electric furnace 1 on which we have been working for more than a year will be the Group's pilot furnace,"" said Hélène Marchand, General Manager France. Verescence had already committed in 2020 to the R&D project VERCANE (carbon-neutral glass), supported by the French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME), aimed at identifying the different energy sources capable of powering glass production in a sustainable way, including electricity. At the time of its reconstruction in 2025, an operation that is required every 15 to 20 years, Furnace 1 at the Mers-les-Bains plant in France will be fully electrified and will be the group's first furnace to use this technology. Verescence should then carry out the gradual electrification of its other melting furnaces in France, Spain, the United States and South Korea, a key step towards achieving the group's objective of reducing its emissions by 40% by 2034. Praised for being indefinitely recyclable, it still requires high energy consumption during the manufacturing phase. The environmental footprint is considerable, in particular in terms of CO2 emissions. Various eco-design techniques already contribute to reducing the energetic content of glass bottles. A pioneer in premium recycled glass for luxury bottles (with the launch of the iconic Verre Infini, in 2008), Verescence announced in November that Infini 20, which contains 20% recycled cullet, would now be its standard glass composition produced by all the group's pants around the world. Since its melting temperature is lower than that of raw materials, it is estimated that using recycled glass during the manufacturing phase allows to reduce emissions by 2.5% for every 10%. For brands wishing to go further in eco-design, Verescence therefore offers Infini 40, a second version of its Verre Infini that contains 40% recycled glass. Verescence has been ranked among the best performing companies in the EcoVadis assessment for three years now and announced last December that it had obtained an A score from CDP for tackling water security and an A- for leading effort against climate change. Note that between 2016 and 2019 Verescence had reduced its emissions by 10%."
Coty starts production of fragrances made using carbon-captured ethanol,"Mid-January, Coty has begun production of fragrances made using LanzaTech carbon-captured ethanol in its Granollers manufacturing facility in Spain. The first Coty fragrances made using this new ethanol will reach stores in the coming months. Coty said to be ahead of schedule on its goal to integrate sustainable ethanol into a majority of its fragrance portfolio by 2023, including Calvin Klein, Burberry, Boss, Gucci, Chloé, Marc Jacobs Perfume, etc. The beauty group is making these fragrances using CarbonSmart, an ethanol produced by LanzaTech by capturing carbon emitted by industrial activity before it is released to the atmosphere. Collected through an electrolysis process, carbon dioxide is then cleaned-up before being transformed into ethanol through fermentation. Ethyl alcohol is a key ingredient in most fragrances where it is used - in concentrations up to 96% - as a support to the perfuming concentrate. Logically, ethanol is Coty's top fragrance ingredient by volume. By transforming carbon into a new source of ethanol, Coty and LanzaTech aim to move forward towards reducing the beauty industry's environmental impact. Indeed, carbon-captured ethanol involves nearly zero water consumption and reduces the need for agricultural land. An independent analysis conducted by sustainability consultancy Quantis has shown a significantly reduced overall environmental footprint. In particular, LanzaTech's CarbonSmart helps Coty to reduce its carbon emissions related to fragrance production. ""Fragrances made using carbon-captured ethanol represents the ground-breaking sustainability progress that I joined Coty to lead,"" said Dr. Shimei Fan, who was appointed as the group's Chief Scientific Officer on January. Coty says the ethanol produced by LanzaTech meets the group's strict specifications for use in perfumery and is very much in line with other high quality ethyl alcohols found in the market. ""LanzaTech is proud to have made our first delivery of carbon-captured ethanol to Coty ahead of schedule,"" said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaTech. ""After two years of working side by side with Coty scientists to develop a high-purity ethanol suitable for use in fine fragrances, we are excited to see Coty bring the first globally distributed fragrances made from CarbonSmart ethanol to market, so consumers can choose products made from recycled carbon."" Beyond this captured-carbon ethanol project, LanzaTech has also joined forces with France's beauty L'Oréal group and energy giant Total to develop a plastic bottle made with polyethylene derived from captured and recycled carbon emissions. After a successful test, L'Oréal, Total and Lanzatech expect the industrialization phase to be completed by 2024."
Plastics recycling: Eastman and Loop to invest in new facilities in France,"Major investments are under way to bring the consumer goods industry into the circular economy era. Eastman and Loop Industries have just announced new investments that are expected to significantly increase plastic packaging recycling capacity in Europe. Global specialty materials producer Eastman plans to invest up to USD 1 billion in a material-to-material molecular recycling facility in France. This facility would use Eastman's polyester renewal technology to recycle up to 160,000 metric tons annually of hard-to-recycle plastic waste that is currently being incinerated. According to Eastman, the investment would recycle enough plastic waste annually to fill Stade de France national football stadium 2.5 times, while also creating virgin-quality material with a significantly lower carbon footprint. Eastman also plans to establish an innovation center for molecular recycling that would enable France to sustain a leadership role in the circular economy. This innovation center would advance alternative recycling methods and applications to curb plastic waste incineration and leave fossil feedstock in the ground. The plant and innovation center - whose location has yet to be decided - are expected to be operational by 2025, creating employment for approximately 350 people and leading to an additional 1,500 indirect jobs in recycling, energy and infrastructure. Eastman's project has also garnered support from numerous brands, including: LVMH Beauty, The Estée Lauder Companies, Clarins, Procter & Gamble, L'Oréal and Danone are leading the way by signing letters of intent for multiyear supply agreements from this facility. For its part, the Canadian group Loop Industries, which specializes in the production of 100% recycled PET [1] plastic, is investing in its first European Infinite Loop manufacturing facility, in partnership with French environmental services group Suez. The two companies have selected a 130,000 m² parcel of land in the region of Normandy in Northern France. The capital investment required for the project is expected to be EUR 250 million. Construction of the facility is expected to begin in 2023, with commissioning approximately 18 months later. The new facility is designed to produce 70,000 tons of PET resin made from 100% recycled content per year. It will provide an opportunity for global CPG brands based in France to gain access to locally produced virgin-quality PET plastic and polyester fiber made entirely from waste material. At full capacity, the facility is projected to save over 255,000 tons of CO2 annually, when compared to virgin PET resin made from fossil fuels. ""The majority of the incoming waste plastic feedstock for the facility is currently not recycled and contributes to the waste plastic pollution problem,"" said Loop Industries in a statement. ""We are very pleased to know that Loop technology will soon be available in France to supply recycled PET plastic for our products,"" said Jacques Playe, Head of Packaging & Development at L'Oréal. Loop client and international cosmetics brand L'Occitane en Provence also voiced its support of the project. ""This new Loop Industries plant in France will enable us access to locally sourced, 100% recycled PET plastic. The innovative technology they provide is a game-changer that can help us fundamentally contribute to solving the growing global concern about plastic pollution,"" stated David Bayard, R&D Packaging Director at L'Occitane."
"United States is world's biggest plastic polluter, report finds","Overall, the US contributed around 42 million metric tons (MMT) in plastic waste in 2016 — more than twice as much as China and more than the countries of the European Union combined, unveiled a recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. [1] On average, every American generates 130 kilograms (286 pounds) of plastic waste per year, with Britain next on the list at 99 kilos per person per year, followed by South Korea at 88 kilos per year. According to Margaret Spring, chief science officer of Monterey Bay Aquarium, who chaired the committee of experts that compiled the report, the success of plastics in the 20th century has produced ""a global scale deluge of plastic waste."" She added global plastic waste was an ""environmental and social crisis"" that impacted inland and coastal communities, polluted rivers, lakes and beaches, and placed economic burdens on communities, endangered wildlife and contaminated waters that humans depend on for food. Global plastic production rose from 20 million metric tons in 1966 to 381 million metric tons in 2015, a 20-fold increase over half a century, the report said. It is now known that almost any plastic on land has the potential to reach the oceans via rivers and streams, the report added. An estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enters the world annually, ""the equivalent of dumping a garbage truck of plastic waste into the ocean every minute."" At the current rate, the amount of plastics discharged into the ocean could reach up to 53 million metric tons per year by 2030, roughly half of the total weight of fish caught from the ocean annually, it said. The report says today's recycling processes and infrastructure are grossly insufficient to manage the complexity and quantity of plastic waste produced, and that a large portion of plastic waste is disposed of in landfills. Part of the reason is that while the generation of plastic waste has exploded, particularly since 1980, the scale of recycling capabilities has not kept up. The report recommends the U.S. establish a coherent and comprehensive federal policy and research strategy by the end of 2022, to reduce its contribution of plastic waste to the environment and ocean. The suggested actions to address the crisis include reducing virgin plastic production, for example by establishing a national cap, using materials that degrade more quickly and are more easily recycled, the reduction of certain single-use plastics, and improved waste management."
CTPA urges the beauty industry to move forward to end packaging waste,"""While the cosmetics industry is working towards reducing or removing unnecessary packaging, and the adoption of reuse and refill models where appropriate, the challenge of certain types of cosmetic packaging not being recycled must be addressed,"" said CTPA [1] in a call to action about packaging waste. The organisation considers that, as far as cosmetic packaging is concerned, the ultimate goal of the industry should be that none ends up as waste. To discuss the issue, CTPA held a stakeholder roundtable on Monday 15 November 2021. The meeting was attended by industry representatives, Resources and Waste Minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Jo Churchill, Defra officials, representatives from WRAP UK, a charity which works with governments, businesses and individuals to promote sustainability, OPRL, an NGO that aims to encourage packaging reuse and material recycling, the Flexible Plastic Fund and Terracycle. Take-back schemes, refill and reuse systems and dedicated collection points emerged as key topics during the discussion. The CTPA recognised that these models should exist on a larger, industry-wide scale to increase awareness and recover more packaging. ""As an industry we have to recognise that a lot of our packaging is not recycled, so the onus is on us to be responsible and develop solutions to reduce the amount of waste. Take-back schemes could be a major step in helping to achieve this and there was huge appetite at the roundtable to drive this forward,"" said Dr Emma Meredith, Director-General of CTPA. In light of the conclusions made at the roundtable, the CTPA joined forces with the Recycle Now team at WRAP to add information on how to recycle cosmetics packaging to its Recycling Locator tool. The digital platform helps consumers to locate nearby recycling stations in order to dispose of their beauty items in the most effective way. The aim is to increase the number of cosmetic brands that are highlighting this opportunity to their consumers. ""For citizens any recycling scheme needs to be easy to use, they need to be motivated to use it and they need to know where to recycle. We are very pleased to be supporting citizens to do this through our Recycling Locator and working with the CTPA to increase awareness of the take back schemes currently available,"" said Sarah Clayton, Head of Citizen Behaviour Change at WRAP UK. The Recycling Locator Tool is already up and running with brands adding the locations for their schemes. However, Clayton highlighted that instore take back schemes can only go so far in helping to avoid packaging going to landfill. ""Reuse and refill options, eliminating packaging where it is not necessary as well as more packaging that uses widely recyclable materials are all key steps that need further future investigation in order to move towards a sustainable circular economy,"" she added. Resources and Waste Minister at Defra, Jo Churchill, meanwhile, said that: ""All sectors of the economy are now changing how they design their products and I am looking forward to the cosmetics industry leading the way and driving further innovation in their ambition to cut waste."""
'Carbon negative' plastic AirCarbon sparks the interest of luxury brands,"Last year, L'Oréal has teamed up with carbon recycling company biotech LanzaTech and fuel company Total to produce the first cosmetic plastic bottle made from industrial carbon emissions. Today, the scope of possibilities continues to widen for applications intended to reduce the carbon footprint of consumer goods. Designing carbon-neutral clothing and accessories no longer belongs simply to the realm of science fiction. In fact, now, with just a few clicks on the web, it is possible to buy glasses, bags, and sleeves for smartphones and laptops that are made from greenhouse gases! AirCarbon: that's the name given to this carbon-negative biomaterial that California start-up Newlight Technologies developed over more than a decade. It is produced by naturally occurring microorganisms in the ocean — now also found in large tanks filled with salt water mixed with methane in the company's factory — that feed primarily on air and greenhouse gases, converted in their cells into polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). It is this biodegradable polymer, ""a material made by life that bonds us to the natural world,"" that is now being used to make luxury accessories under the name AirCarbon. The start-up specifies that the biomaterial can be melted and then cooled, opening the door to infinite possibilities for making fibres, sheet, or even solid parts. AirCarbon could replace synthetic plastic and animal leather, and be recycled endlessly. Fashion giants are paying attention to this innovation; Nike concluded a partnership with Newlight Technologies at the end of August to explore ""the use of AirCarbon in a variety of applications"" in order to reduce its carbon footprint while continuing to offer technical products to consumers. A collaboration that could quickly give rise to carbon-neutral accessories, even sneakers, neutral, made from this new biomaterial, and stamped with the famous swoosh. But Newlight Technologies does not simply sell their biodegradable polymer to fashion brands or manufacturers. The company's strength also lies in its ability to offer its own accessories made from AirCarbon. Through its Covalent brand, Newlight Technologies retails carbon-neutral sunglasses, tote bags, purses, small leather goods, and smartphone and laptop pouches. The brand makes all the information related to the carbon footprint of the products and their manufacture available to the public. For example, the Poppy tote bag, handmade in California, was designed from 51% AirCarbon, 14% bio-derived materials and 35% synthetic ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). A product with a negative carbon footprint, the bag would have diverted 16.7 kilograms of CO2 equivalent from the air through its manufacture. However, being kind to our planet will require spending 480 dollars (approximately 413 euros). This new material adds to an already rich list of innovative and environmentally friendly materials intended to replace oil-based plastics. However, it provides an additional benefit as it could allow several industries to significantly reduce their environmental footprint."
Five cosmetics giants team up to create environmental scoring system,"The five multinationals say their aim is to meet growing consumer demand for greater transparency about the environmental impact of cosmetics products (formula, packaging and usage), thus helping consumers to make more sustainable consumption choices. The harmonized scoring system could, for example, use a score ranging from A to E. The new consortium will be open to all cosmetics companies wishing to join and contribute to designing a system that allows consumers to compare cosmetics products within the same category. The ambition is for the overall score to inform consumers of the environmental impact of products, taking into account their whole product life cycle. Sustainability consultancy Quantis, which launched the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for CosmEtics (SPICE) in 2018, should lead the project to ensure a robust and scientific approach. The assessment of environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of products, will be backed by the principles of the ""Product Environmental Footprint"" (the European Union's PEF scientific method for quantifying the environmental footprint of products). Furthermore, a common database of environmental impacts of standard ingredients and raw materials used in formulas and packaging, as well as during product usage, will need to be created. This global initiative is intended to be open to all cosmetics companies, regardless of their size or resources. The convening five companies will pool their experience and knowledge in developing environmental impact assessment methodologies (as is the case for Henkel, LVMH, Natura &Co, and Unilever) and an environmental and social labelling system (as developed by L'Oréal). ""All companies will benefit from this pre-existing work and are invited to contribute their own experience,"" said the five groups in a statement. The work developed by the consortium will be published and made accessible on a strictly voluntary basis by both consortium participants and all other interested parties. Cosmetics Europe has been actively following the process. For several years, companies or NGOs have tried to launch environmental scoring systems for cosmetic products, but these initiatives are based on various methodologies making comparisons difficult. The approach of the giants of the sector could thus impose itself rather quickly."
ReBubble: new life for used soap and jobs for disabled workers,"In Aachen, Germany, students collect hotel soaps and recycle them with the help of workers with disabilities to produce new, sustainable and solidarity-based soaps. Each second, 300 soaps from hotels are thrown away in the world, which equals about 950 million soaps going to the incinerator each year, whereas they are barely used. In order to fight against this waste, the Rebubble project proposes a second life to these soaps. Thanks to a partnership between four big hospitality groups, the voluntary students who created RBbubble organize the collection of used soaps. They are then sent to a working center who partners the project, where people with disabilities recycle the soaps: they are chipped, cooked and cast to create new ones. The soap production is then sold locally. This soap recycling process is made up of simple gestures, designed to be inclusive and accessible to everyone. Recycling hotel soaps has an ecological dimension, allowing big hotels to reduce their carbon footprint and it also has a social utility, allowing people with disabilities to access a fairly paid work."
Long-term ingestion of microplastic harms growth and reproduction in fish,"The world's fish are increasingly threatened by microplastics that pollute seas, lakes and oceans. Published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials [1], this new research was conducted by scientists from France's INRAE, IFREMER, and the universities of Bordeaux (France) and Orebrö (Sweden). The study focused on two specific fish species: the so-called zebrafish (Danio rerio), which lives in freshwater, and the marine medaka (Oryzias latipes), which, as its name suggests, lives in saltwater. The health of these two species of fish was studied over a four-month period. The objective was to determine the adverse effects of chronic ingestion of plastic microparticles by these fish. The researchers focused on polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics, which are among the most common materials used to make plastic packaging and objects. The researchers found a 20-35% reduction in size and weight in both fish species, regardless of the type of plastic ingested. ""These effects were considerably greater after four months than after two, which highlights how essential it is to conduct long-term studies when assessing the toxicity of microplastics,"" note the scientists, who also note a more marked reduction in growth in females, ""probably due to their greater energy needs during reproduction compared with those of males."" In the long term, the ingestion of plastic particles could also decrease the reproduction rates of these fish by up to 50%. This risk was found to vary significantly depending on the duration of exposure, the type of plastic ingested, the presence of associated organic pollutants and the fish species studied. In zebrafish, combined exposure to PVC-BaP and PVC-BP3, for example, leads to a delay in the onset of spawning, while exposure to PE-BP3 (as well as to all PVCs) - whether untreated or carrying pollutants - leads to a decrease in the number of eggs laid. In marine medaka, exposure to almost all microplastics induces a delay in the onset of spawning and a decrease in the number of eggs produced by females. Exposure to PVC-BP3 also causes behavioural problems in the larval offspring, the study says. ""These results provide stark evidence of problems in both growth and reproduction for fish exposed to microplastics over extended periods, potentially leading to serious failures in the functioning of ecosystems,"" explain the study authors. ""This understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the biological disturbances caused by microplastics will enable us to assess the extent to which these effects can be extrapolated to all microplastic types, making it possible, for example, to prioritize the regulation of emissions,"" the scientists conclude."
Thailand's marine national parks ban sunscreens suspected to damage corals,"Thailand's sandy beaches have long been popular destinations for millions of tourists but concerns are growing that the lotions they use as protection from the tropical sun are harming delicate, slow-growing corals. An order came into force on August 4th banning sun lotions containing substances that could have a harmful effect on coral reefs from the kingdom's marine national parks. The banned sunscreens are those containing oxybenzone, octinoxate, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, which are usually used as UV filters, and butylparaben, that is used as a preservative or as a fragrance. These substances are suspected to be endocrine disruptors and to affect the development of corals, even in small quantities. Thai authorities said available scientific data showed these chemicals ""deteriorate coral reefs, destroy coral larvae, obstruct their reproductive system and cause coral reef bleaching."" While officials have not said how they plan to enforce the new rule, violators would face a fine of up to 100,000 Thai baht (about USD 3,000 or EUR 2,530). Thailand is not the first country to introduce such a ban. On January 1, 2020, the Pacific island of Palau banned the sale and import of sun products containing 11 components deemed toxic to the environment. In 2018, the State of Hawaii also announced its intention to ban oxybenzone and octinoxate from sun lotions marketed on the islands. This measure has been applied since January 1st, 2021. Since an initial alert in 2008, several studies have highlighted that certain substances contained in sunscreens could have a negative impact on marine species. For instance, a research published in 2015 showed that oxybenzone could be harmful to coral reefs by accelerating the bleaching of corals and threatening their resilience in front of climate change. [1] In France, as part of the ""Mission Océans"" launched in 2018, the Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) was charged to carry out an inventory of the chemical substances that are particularly toxic for marine ecosystems and coral reefs while being present in consumer products such as cosmetics, sunscreens or detergents. However, the impact of sunscreens on coral reefs is denied by a part of the industry which considers that global warming is the main cause of the poor health of corals. However, products claiming to protect the skin from the sun while preserving the oceans are increasingly available on the market. And to help consumers that do not want to harm oceans, US-based Haereticus Environmental Laboratory publishes a list of eco-responsible sunscreens every year."
"Hair today, green tomorrow: UK stylists join eco-drive","At an east London salon, Fry Taylor, one of the founders of the Green Salon Collective, demonstrates spare hair being used in depolluting filters. He shows how a cotton net stuffed with hair, swept across the surface of a tank of water contaminated with motor oil, instantly cleans up the pollutant. ""The hair just naturally will absorb the oil and hold on to the oil, that's the important factor,"" Taylor, a former hairdresser, told AFP. A kilo of hair can absorb up to eight litres (two gallons) of oil, according to experts. The idea of using hair filters originated in the United States and has already been tested in real disasters, such as when a Japanese tanker sank off the coast of Mauritius a year ago. Britain was lagging behind in recycling unwanted hair when the collective formed last summer, according to Taylor. ""There are, in other countries around the world, recycling systems for hairdressing salons,"" he said. ""In the UK and Ireland, they just don't have the infrastructure. We're not going to wait another five or 10 years for governments and councils to have these systems in place, let's just do it ourselves,"" he added. The waste produced by the hairdressing industry in the UK each year could fill 50 football stadiums, the collective said. Most rubbish, including aluminium foil, coloured tubes and 99 percent of cut hair, is sent to a landfill site, it added. Another big problem is chemical waste such as dyes and bleaches. ""There are currently approximately 30,000 salons and another 100,000 freelancers,"" who are pouring hydrogen peroxide and ammonia into water systems, Taylor said. The collective is encouraging salons to save these products in a small bin, which it then collects and sends to a facility to produce electricity. Hair stylist Adam Reed, who owns a salon in London's trendy Spitalfields neighbourhood, is a recent convert to the recycling mission and proudly explains his system to customers. Saying he was ""blown away"" by what the Green Salon Collective had taught him, the internationally-renowned hairdresser added he ""didn't quite realise the enormity of it"" beforehand. ""It made me realise that sustainability in salons is something that had been missing and it's really easy to bring into the salon,"" he said. ""We have our bins, all labelled, so it's easy to navigate."" Hair, protective equipment, metals, papers and plastics each have their own bin. The salon, which pays a £120-fee ($192, 140 euros) to be a member of the collective, also recycles leftover dye product. Reed charges clients a ""green tax"" of one or two pounds, and has so far received a ""very positive response"". Composting is another green use of hair, whose rich nitrogen content makes it an ideal fertiliser supplement. Collective member Ryan Crawford, owner of a salon in the town of Milton Keynes, northwest of London, has experimented with hair on his vegetables in the garden. On a sunny July day, he showed AFP two young cabbage shoots: one, surrounded by hair, is intact; the other, planted without hair, is skeletal and gnawed. ""It's like a protective barrier around the base of the new seedlings,"" he said. ""It's definitely worked keeping things like slugs or snails off,"" he added, saying that putting hair directly into the soil also helps retain moisture and acts as ""a super-food for the earth,"" replenishing nitrogen levels. Over the last year, around 600 salons in the UK and Ireland have joined the collective, which has amassed around 500 kilos of hair. It has been used to clean up waterways, an oil spill in Northern Ireland in May and for composting. The collective has also gathered 3.5 tonnes of metal, which is being recycled. It now hopes to export the model on a large scale across Europe."
L'Oréal unveils cosmetic bottles made from Carbios' enzymatic recycling process,"This new-generation cosmetic bottle is the first one designed in plastic entirely recycled thanks to Carbios' enzymatic technology, which is suitable for all types of PET - clear, coloured, opaque and multilayer - and makes these plastics infinitely recyclable. Until now, existing mechanical recycling processes have not been able to recover all polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste, which is one of the most common plastics in consumer goods. Carbios explains that ""only clear plastic [could] be recycled in closed loops, with a loss of quality in each cycle, making it difficult to obtain new products from 100% recycled PET."" A problem the French company's enzymatic technology is now able to solve. ""Our innovation allows infinite recycling of all types of PET waste as well as the production of 100% recycled and 100% recyclable PET products, without loss of quality."" Furthermore, this can be achieved at high speed: breaking down 97% of plastic in just 16 hours, that is to say10,000 times more efficient than any biological plastic recycling trial to date. After four years of close collaboration with L'Oréal to develop this technology — as well as with Nestlé Waters, PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe - capacities of the new recycling process are being scaled up. Biotherm could be the first brand of the French group to launch a product in this bottle, with the production launch currently scheduled for 2025. ""We have been working with Carbios since 2017 to develop this first bottle made from PET derived from enzymatic recycling technology, an alternative to mechanical recycling. We are pleased to announce today the feasibility of these bottles in a pilot phase and are delighted to be in a position to create the packaging of the future with our partners. This is a promising innovation for the years to come that demonstrates our commitment to bring to market more environmentally friendly packaging and which is part of a circularity initiative begun more than 15 years ago,"" said Jacques Playe, L'Oréal's Global Head of Packaging and Product Development. Note that this technology has been used to create other sample bottles for everyday products. Perrier, Pepsi Max and Orangina may also soon offer new packaging for some of their iconic products. This innovation should help L'Oréal achieve its objectives set out in its ""L'Oréal for the Future"" sustainability program. These include achieving 100% refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025, and 100% recycled or biobased plastic packaging by 2030. To achieve these objectives, L'Oréal is working with a number of strategic partners, giving it access to the best technologies. As well as Carbios, L'Oréal is collaborating with Albéa, the global leader in beauty packaging, with whom the Group developed the first cosmetic tube including FSC-certified carton in 2019, Purecycle, for the production of solvolysis-recycled polypropylene (PP), and LanzaTech and Total, with whom, in October 2020, L'Oréal announced a world first: the production of a polyethylene (PE) cosmetic bottle made from recycled industrial carbon emissions."
Unilever to launch its first paper-based detergent bottle,"A prototype of the first-ever paper-based laundry detergent bottle has been made for Unilever's OMO brand (also known as Persil, Skip and Breeze) and is supposed and is set to debut in Brazil by early 2022, with an ambition for roll-out in Europe and other countries soon after. Unilever says they are also piloting the same technology to create paper-based hair care bottles. The bottle is made of sustainably sourced cellulosic pulp and designed to be recycled in the paper waste stream. It is sprayed inside with a proprietary coating that repels water, enabling the paper-based packaging material to hold liquid products like laundry detergent, shampoo and conditioners, which contain surfactants, fragrances and other active ingredients. Creating recyclable, paper-based packaging without additional plastic layers is a huge challenge. According to Unilever, Pulpex's patented packaging provides a promising solution to radically reduce the use of plastic. ""To tackle plastic waste, we need to completely rethink how we design and package products. This requires a drastic change that can only be achieved through industry-wide collaboration,"" said Richard Slater, Unilever Chief R&D Officer. As consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the impact of products on the planet, Unilever relies on the Pulpex paper-based bottle technology to achieve their goal to halve their use of virgin plastic materials by 2025. A few paper-based packaging solutions are already on the market: the bottles made by Ecologic Brands for Seed Phytonutrients, or the tubes made by Albéa for La Roche Posay and Garnier. However, these solutions contain significant parts of plastics and are not always easy to recycle. The solution developed by Pulpex therefore represents a significant step forward. Large-scale production of paper bottles is in preparation, with Finnish papermaker Stora Enso having started to supply Pulpex with the necessary materials. This should help Diageo to keep its commitment to launch a paper bottle for its Johnnie Walker brand this year, and Unilever to apply this technology to its detergents by 2022, before moving on to shampoos. Recently, the Paboco consortium, which gathers companies such as BillerudKorsnäs, Alpla, Carlsberg, The Absolut Company (Pernod-Ricard), L'Oréal and Coca-Cola Europe, also presented its prototype of a paper bottle with a bio-based inner coating. A project to keep on the radar!"
Pierre Fabre Group looks to boost transparency with environmental rating,"To meet the demand for transparency with regard to cosmetic products, the French-based group has chosen a very simple tool based on grades from A to D. This 'Green Impact Index' was designed to easily inform consumers about the environmental and societal impact of the group's various cosmetic brands. Pierre Fabre's Green Impact Index has been used internally for already two years to guarantee the ""eco-socio-design"" (grade A or B) of the group's new cosmetics. Precisely, in addition to informing consumers, the Green Impact Index should also enable Pierre Fabre to improve the eco-societal profile of its products, in line with the aim of ensuring that half of its portfolio is eco-socio-designed by 2023. The new tool was built using the 3,000 Life-Cycle Analyses (LCAs) that the Group has conducted for over 10 years. It is based on the evaluation of 20 criteria: 14 environmental impact criteria (including the eco-design of the packaging, the eco-design of the formula, the impact of the manufacturing of the product and the transportation of raw materials, etc.), representing two thirds of the final score, and 6 societal impact criteria (including Made in France, Bio, Fair Trade, France Guaranteed Origin and Vegan certifications or labeling, as well as the brand's corporate social responsibility programs. These 6 criteria represent one third of the final score. To ensure the reliability and validity of their rating system, Pierre Fabre has entrusted AFNOR Certification, an independent third-party organization, ""to conduct an annual audit to verify and guarantee the reliability of the ratings carried out by Pierre Fabre on its products."" For the time being, the scores of certain products are available online, spanning the Pierre Fabre brands Avène, A-Derma, Ducray, Klorane, René Furterer, Naturactive, Elgydium and Arthrodont, and products ranging from face and body creams to shampoos, shower gels and toothpaste, not to mention essential oils and nutritional supplements. The aim now is to regularly add scores for new products, adding them directly to brand websites in the coming months. ""The Green Impact Index is a response to the growing distrust on the part of consumers and patients when it comes to brands and their ability to respect the environment, demonstrate corporate social responsibility and communicate information on these subjects in a transparent and verifiable manner.... For the first time, consumers will be able to choose a cosmetic or family health product with full knowledge of its eco-societal impact and with the assurance of reliable and detailed information, in a simple and straightforward manner,"" said Éric Ducournau, CEO of the Pierre Fabre Group in a statement."
Toward a zero-waste beauty routine?,"The transition is undoubtedly underway, the figures show that consumers have already started to remove all unnecessary products from their bathrooms to embrace a cleaner beauty routine with natural fibres, solid cosmetics, and washable, reusable accessories. While its far from being a magical solution, reducing waste production first requires to recycle, or upcycle, packaging or to degrade them biologically. It is on these issues that cosmetic brands are now focusing their research, and some have already begun to provide innovative solutions. Juni Cosmetics is one of the brands that have gone big on recycling. Founded by makeup artist Madeleine White, the brand worked with designers to eliminate plastic from its beauty products. The result is a capsule collection of high-end lipsticks (""Luxury Hydrating Lipstick"") with strong moisturizing power, formulated with organic oils, vitamin E and plant hyaluronic acid, whose tubes are made entirely of aluminum, therefore fully recyclable. Note that the entire lipstick tube is made of aluminum, including the mechanism's cogs, giving consumers the option to recycle the product without having to disassemble it. Certified vegan, the lipstick contains only organic and sustainably sourced ingredients. In the same vein, the brand Izzy Zero Waste Beauty has introduced the world's first reusable and recyclable mascara, which therefore generates no waste. Made of a stainless steel tube, ""Zero Waste Mascara"" is delivered without any packaging in reusable envelopes made from recycled materials. A subscription service allows consumers the possibility to receive a new sterilized and filled mascara every three months, accompanied by a prepaid envelope to return the previous mascara which will be completely cleaned and refilled for a second life. Initially specializing in sustainable writing tools, Danish company Sprout World has also taken a step towards a circular beauty routine. It recently released a plantable eyeliner. Its ""Sprout eyeliner,"" totally free of microplastics, is used like any other eyeliner with one exception. At the end of its life, it can be planted in a pot, then watered, to turn into flowers. This is made possible thanks to the capsule nestled at the end of the product, which contains seeds. These may seem like small innovations but they prove that brands have already started to work on sustainable alternatives to traditional cosmetics to make bathrooms greener and less polluting."
Beiersdorf partners with SABIC to launch climate-neutralized Nivea products,"Starting from June, the face care products of the Nivea Naturally Good product range will be released in 30 countries featuring a jar made from certified renewable polypropylene (PP). The range will thus be switched from fossil-based virgin plastic to renewable plastic. For this, Beiersdorf will use the certified polypropylene (PP) from SABIC's Trucicle portfolio, derived from tall oil, a by-product of the forestry and paper industries. While aiming to increase the sustainability of its products' packaging, Beiersdorf wanted to avoid any ay compromise on the quality. The company therefore started with a comprehensive analysis of the market for alternative plastics. The packaging had to fulfil many requirements, beginning with the "" visual and tactile features that our Nivea consumers are acquainted to,"" explains Michael Becker, Head of Global Packaging Development at Beiersdorf. The other important criteria were the packaging recyclability and the raw material from which the final packaging would be derived. Indeed, Beiersdorf chose to reject any material derived from sugar cane or corn or any other source of food. ""The certified renewable plastic we source from SABIC has no visual effects or other adverse properties. Accordingly, the jar made of renewable PP is neither visually nor haptically distinguishable from the previous packaging. In addition, SABIC pursues a holistic sustainability approach with its feedstock concept. That convinced us,"" explains Hannah Rasel, Senior Packaging Specialist at Beiersdorf. To accelerate the transformation of their packaging towards more sustainability, Beiersdorf has brought SABIC to work directly with Berry Global, a long-time partner of the group for the production of face care jars. This collaboration allowed a rapid market introduction, where between the first idea to the implementation, it took just nine months. ""We are now getting involved much earlier and deeper in the supply chain,"" says Isabel Hochgesand, Beiersdorf's Chief Procurement Officer. Converting the packaging to renewable plastic has the benefit of conserving fossil resources, but also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. According to Beiersdorf, 76g of CO2 are saved per jar, with a reduction of around 60% compared to the fossil-based jar. This project contributes to the company's climate target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% absolutely across the entire value chain by 2025. It completes Beiersdorf's initiative to produce with 100% energy from renewable sources since 2019. Any remaining emissions that cannot be avoided or further reduced during the manufacturing of the product are - for the first time - climate-neutralized via carbon offsetting, through afforestation projects. This step is new for Beiersdorf and its largest skin care brand. The Nivea Naturally Good face care range comprised of eight products will be clearly recognizable as 'climate-neutralized' on pack and on shelf."
RT-Twist by Techniplast widens the range of perfume refill options,"The RT-Twist system was developed in 2014 by French company Techniplast, who had already developed the RT-Plug and RT-Lift technologies featured in perfume sources at points of sale, and which Mugler, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Cartier, Idole de Lancôme, and others had already adopted. ""We aimed to offer an alternative to in-store refills, because we thought brands would be increasingly interested in reusing the original bottles, but that not all of them would be able to offer this service in their stores: their staff would not be available for it or they would lack space for their fountains,"" explains Loïc Bouet, Sales Director of Techniplast. The system is easy-to-use. The RT-Twist cap is interdependent with the refill delivered. The latter is screwed on the bottle to be refilled, so the neck needs to be a screw-top. The connexion opens the refill bottle and releases the perfume. The RT-Twist technology regulates the liquid flow and automatically stops it when the bottle is full. ""This way, overflows and funnel handling issues are prevented, even with opaque bottles,"" says Loïc Bouet. The single-material, polypropylene-based RT-Twist is delivered screwed on a glass refill bottle or an aluminium-based container. Then, it can be separated to recycle the different components. The original bottle becomes an object to keep with you, with a strong valorization potential. The RT-Twist technology revives the notion of luxury regarding perfume bottles, while minimizing their environmental impact. ""2020 was an opportunity for us to plan significant launches, like My Way by Armani and Sauvage by Dior, but our solution has convinced many other brands which will take the plunge this year. The cap is reliable, clean, and it meets the demand for better-controlled environmental impact. Customers can buy 200 ml of juice and refill their 50-ml bottles four times – the impact is much more limited,"" says Loïc Bouet. Techniplast is working on several new projects. Some brands chose to invest and get a cap with a customized design, while others ordered a standard RT-Twist cap. Indeed, the company offers a generic model available with different necks that meet glassmaking standards, and with different capacities. ""This marks the comeback of crimp necks on most bottles, so recycling is possible,"" adds the Sales Director."
Coty partners with LanzaTech to use carbon-captured ethanol in fragrances,"Coty's scientists have worked alongside LanzaTech and production partners over the past two years to develop a high-purity sustainable ethanol that is suitable for use in fragrances. Based on this efforts, Coty intends to incorporate carbon-captured ethanol into its fragrance manufacturing process, with the goal of having the majority of its fragrance portfolio using ethanol sourced from carbon-capture by 2023. Ethanol is a core ingredient in fragrance products, enabling the efficient dispersion of the scent. As most other fragrance producers, Coty uses ethanol sourced from a range of natural raw materials - including sugar cane and sugar beet, which require farm land, water and fertilizers. The use of a new generation of sustainable ethanol produced from carbon-capture needs near-zero water consumption and reduces the requirement for agricultural land. Working with the independent sustainability consultancy Quantis, Coty has conducted a screening life cycle assessment which shows a significantly reduced overall environment impact. To produce this new generation sustainable ethanol, LanzaTech captures carbon from different emission sources (industry, solid organic waste) or even in ambient air, through an electrolysis process. The collected CO2 is then cleaned-up before being transformed into ethanol through fermentation. ""Single use carbon must be a thing of the past and this project exemplifies our vision of a CarbonSmart future where consumers are able to choose products made from recycled carbon,"" said Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaTech. The partnership with LanzaTech is an important step for Coty as it continues its journey to becoming a more circular business. The company's 'Beauty That Lasts' strategy sets out a range of time-bound targets, including a 30% reduction in absolute CO2 emissions by 2030. ""Ethanol is the number one ingredient purchased for the fragrance category and over time this partnership with LanzaTech will significantly reduce the environmental impact of our products. It's not only the right thing to do, but it makes commercial sense too - with today's consumer rightly demanding that their favourite brands share their commitment to sustainability,"" commented Sue Y. Nabi, Chief Executive Officer of Coty. Carbon recycling is making significant progress and is emerging as an environmentally attractive alternative to carbon from agricultural sources. Late last year, LanzaTech, Total and L'Oréal announced the production of the first plastic cosmetic bottle produced with industrial carbon emissions."
L'Oréal expands the use of paper bottles across its portfolio,"As early as 2018, for the launch of Seed Phytonutrients in the United States, the L'Oréal group partnered with sustainable packaging supplier Ecologic Brands - recently acquired by Jabil Inc. - to create the first paper bottle for the bathroom able to resist to the bathroom humidity. Ecologic Brands' paper bottle technology offers the advantage of an unmatched level of commercial maturity. It has been used for several years by laundry brand Seventh Generation. The technology consists of a cardboard shell in which is inserted a thin bag made of recycled food-grade plastic. ""Ecologic and L'Oréal broke new ground when we incubated the world's first shower-safe paper bottle for the Seed Phytonutrients project. We're taking things a step further by bringing this innovative packaging solution to our market-leading Matrix and Redken brands,"" said Shane Wolf, president worldwide, American Professional Brands, L'Oréal Professional Products Division. L'Oréal has also announced its brands La Roche Posay and Khiel's would soon use cardboard bottles developed by the start-up Paboco, founded by Billerudkorsnäs and Alpla, of which L'Oréal has been a partner since its inception. The technology developed by Paboco is designed to create 100% recyclable bottles made of wood cellulose with a bio-material based barrier capable of resisting liquids, CO2 and oxygen, and suitable for liquid goods such as carbonated and still drinks, beauty products and more. The high barrier properties (the ability to withstand gas permeability) required for the bottle are provided by a thin layer of PEF (polyethylene furanoate) by Dutch company Avantium. PEF is a 100% plant-based and recyclable polymer. Thus, it is possible to fully recycle the Paper Bottle by separating the paper and PEF. While it has the advantage of recyclability, the Paboco bottle has not yet been tested on the market, unlike the one developed by Ecologic Brands. Last year, La Roche Posay launched the first cosmetic tubes incorporating a part of cardboard. Developed in partnership with Albéa, they allow to reduce by 45% the quantity of plastic required for its manufacture compared to a conventional tube. Garnier, another flagship brand of the group, is also committed to using these tubes as part of their environmental targets."
Perfumes: Towards ecoresponsible exploitation of guaiac wood with Nelixia,"With its very dry subtropical climate, the forest of the Paraguayan Chaco region, a real haven for biodiversity, is the only area that shelters Bulnesia sarmientoi. But since Paraguay allowed virgin forest land to be turned into pasture for cattle, this tall tree with very dense wood has been massively cut. ""Unfortunately, the roots are also cut, which prevents the trees from regenerating, whereas one should wait for 30 years before extracting them,"" explains Elisa Aragon, co-founder of Nelixia, with Jean-Marie Maizener. ""As a matter of fact, it is very tricky to replant cuttings, because guaiac wood grows in clusters on veins of salt. It is actually impossible to determine beforehand whether the soil conditions will be adapted to its growth or not,"" she adds. So, to encourage local players to implement sustainable exploitation methods, CITES took action in 2011, classifying guaiacwood as a ""species whose exploitation must be regulated in order to keep it out of danger"". To foster concrete action, CITES has blocked the import of guaiac wood several times since 2015, including last March. As a matter of fact, for the past two years, Nelixia has worked on new management plans for the forest of Chaco in order to set up an ecoresponsible production chain. ""We can evolve and act differently, for example by focusing on new exploitation methods that better preserve the forest's ecosystem"", says Elisa Aragon. With two production sites in Guatemala and Honduras, Nelixia has acquired genuine expertise in developing sustainable raw material chains. As part of this project, the company has just opened a production site in Paraguay. This inauguration completes the implementation of management plans for the forest of Chaco approved by INFONA (national forestry office). Nelixia first convinced land owners that a non-exploited forest could actually be profitable. Then, they had to make an accurate inventory of the forest to divide it into parcels and determine a quantity of exploitable guaiac wood: annual cutting units from which wood would be extracted over a minimum period of 20 years. This method prevents the roots from being cut, so that the resource is never exhausted. Since machines are banned, tree extraction is mainly carried out by hand, from cutting to loading timber in vehicles, which are also prohibited around the forest. Ultimately, these plans are aimed to take only a small number of trees per hectare using responsible methods. Today, Nelixia manages almost 5,000 hectares and intends to ""reach 20,000 by 2025 to make sure the ingredient remains out of danger in the long run,"" says Jean-Marie Maizener. Thanks to this new exploitation method, in 2021, Nelixia will be able to distribute a ""responsible"", soon-to-be-certified guaiac essential oil on the market, provided the CITES import ban is lifted in the following weeks. Right now, Nelixia has 1,800 tonnes of cut wood ready to be distilled, which makes about 70 tonnes of essential oil. Since the guaiac essence is widely used, because it is cheap, this sustainable production chain would prevent thousands of perfumes from being reformulated. Nelixia's expertise is based on several assets, including experienced partners, like the Paraguaya Foundation, a pioneer NGO in this field, since they have taken action since 1985. For example, they created the very efficient ""stoplight"" programme aimed to stop poverty, in particular by setting up farming schools to train rural entrepreneurs, whose education is financed by their own business. That is why Nelixia established their distillery near a farming school: the idea was to create new jobs thanks to guaiac oil production. Although they are fully involved in developing a responsible, sustainable guaiac production chain, Nelixia does not aim to hold a monopoly. ""It is likely these two exploitation methods will coexist for some time, but we do hope to encourage and democratize these management plans to create a sustainable guaiac wood sourcing chain,"" explains Elisa Aragon."
L'Oréal starts capturing carbon to create sustainable shampoo bottles,"Claimed to be a ""worldwide premiere"", the production of this bottle is based on a three-step process in which each of the three companies has a specific role: LanzaTech captures industrial carbon emissions and converts them into ethanol using a unique biological process, Total transforms ethanol into ethylene before polymerizing it into polyethylene, and finally L'Oréal uses this polyethylene to produce the plastic packaging. While the conversion process has been successfully tested it still has to be industrialized. This second phase could be completed by 2024. The source of this innovation is the carbon monoxide capture process developed by LanzaTech. Basically, the idea is to convert industrial gazes typically produced by steel manufacturing plants, oil refineries or the chemical industry. These gases are sent to a bioreactor where LanzaTech proprietary bacteria transform the carbon monoxide into ethanol and various co-products during a fermentation process. Once separated, the ethanol can be used as fuel or as a chemical raw material. Thus, the gases recycled from steel mill emissions in China, where LanzaTech has installed a recycling unit, were used to produce ethanol for the Podtz and Migos Plus lines of household products marketed since this summer by Mibelle Group in Switzerland. Considering the environmental footprint of the process, recycling carbon emissions is an interesting alternative to the production of ethanol from sugar, since it does not need to use agricultural land and helps reducing greenhouse gases emissions that would otherwise warm the climate further. The process is tolerant to different levels of hydrogen and to the presence of various contaminants typically found in industrial gases. To transform ethanol into ethylene, Total uses a dehydration process jointly developed with IFP Axens. Like the sugar ethanol transformation process implemented by Braskem in Brazil, this technology makes it possible to obtain ethylene, then polyethylene, with exactly the same characteristics than polyethylene obtained from fossil oil. Now that the possibility to produce plastic packaging from industrial carbon emissions has been demonstrated, the three partners now intend to continue working together on scaling the production of these sustainable plastics. This will involve the construction of a LanzaTech gas recovery unit, currently underway near an Arcelor Mittal steel plant in Belgium, as well as the development of ethanol processing facilities. ""We have the ambition to use this sustainable material in our bottle of shampoo and conditioner by 2024 and we hope other companies will join us in using this breakthrough innovation,"" said Jacques Playe L'Oréal Packaging & Development Director, L'Oréal."
A new ecodesign tool to help cosmetics makers develop sustainable packaging,"Dubbed SPICE Tool, the solution aims to solve one of the key sustainability challenges facing the beauty industry: embedding ecodesign into the packaging development process. After having developed a methodology for measuring the environmental footprint of cosmetic packaging, SPICE has translated it into an online tool, open to all the companies in the sector, thus allowing them to measure and reduce the environmental footprint of any cosmetic packaging throughout its entire life cycle. The platform features a free Demo version and a Pro version, available by licence. The solution calculates a holistic environmental footprint of packaging, covering 16 environmental indicators that assess impacts on climate change as well as resource depletion, water use, biodiversity and more, across the full lifecycle of a product's packaging (from production to end-of-life). The tool thus facilitates the choice between the different material options, the amount of recycled material, the different types of refills ... ""The previously existing multi-criteria Life Cycle Analysis tools made it possible to measure the environmental impact of a packaging, but a choice had to be made, for example, between lowering CO2 emissions or water consumption. SPICE makes it possible, for the first time, to determine the most favourable solution by weighing all of the environmental criteria,"" explains the French Beauty Federation (FEBEA), which participated in the development of the tool as a member of SPICE. SPICE Tool is science-based and illustrated by empirical case studies. It is consistent with major international standards, including the European PEF method, ISO quality standards and the recommendations of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Along with the Tool, SPICE also released a set of best practice materials, including environmental claims guidelines that establish minimum requirements and strong recommendations for providing credible packaging sustainability information to consumers and other audiences. ""The cost of developing a robust environmental footprinting tool has been a barrier for many small and medium-sized cosmetics companies that want to implement ecodesign in packaging development. By making the SPICE Tool publicly available, the SPICE Initiative helps the whole industry move forward, getting everyone on board to design the future of sustainable packaging,"" noted Patrick O'Quin, President of FEBEA. Co-founded in 2018 by L'Oréal and sustainability consulting firm Quantis, SPICE is an industry-led organisation now includes 25 members working together to develop solutions that will accelerate progress toward sustainable packaging for cosmetics."
L'Oréal wants all their plastic packaging to be recycled or bio-based by 2030,"Following similar announcements from other consumer goods giants, such as Unilever, the world's leading cosmetics maker, which owns a portfolio of 36 brands, has set new quantified targets for 2030 to fight climate change. ""L'Oréal is accelerating its transformation towards a model respecting planetary boundaries,"" said the company in a statement. In recent report, sustainability consulting firm Quatis estimated the contribution of the cosmetics industry to global CO2 emissions anywhere between 0.5% to 5%. By 2025, all of the sites operated by L'Oréal will be carbon neutral thanks to the improvement of their energy efficiency and the use of 100% renewable energy. Furthermore, by 2030, 100% of the plastics used to pack L'Oréal's products will be either from recycled or bio-based sources, announced the company. Earlier this year, the group launched under La Roche Posay brand the first tube incorporating cardboard, thus reducing by 45% the quantity of plastic required for its manufacture compared to a conventional tube. L'Oréal is also committed to reduce by 25% per finished product, compared to 2016, its entire greenhouse gas emissions (and by 50% the emissions linked to their transport). In addition, the group will launch a ""Product Environmental & Social Impact Labelling"" mechanism. The labelling will include a score on a scale from A to E, with an ""A"" product considered as ""best in class"" in terms of environmental impacts. The method was endorsed by independent scientific experts and data have been verified by Bureau Veritas Certification, an independent auditor. The labels and scores will be accessible on products' web pages. The first brand to implement the new methodology as of 2020 is Garnier for its hair care products, third beauty brand worldwide and leader of the market in France. This labelling will progressively be extended to other countries, L'Oréal's brands and product categories. ""It is a real transformation of the way in which L'Oréal creates formulas, sources raw materials, makes packaging, and manufactures products in its factories"", said the group's CEO Jean-Paul Agon to AFP. In addition to these quantified targets, L'Oréal will also support actions carried out by NGOs to address urgent social and environmental issues with two priorities: climate and women in vulnerable situations. Therefore, L'Oréal is engaging EUR 50 million to finance damaged natural marine and forest ecosystems restoration projects through a fund called the L'Oréal Fund for Nature Regeneration. Another EUR 50 million will be directed to financing projects linked to the circular economy. Eventually, to help vulnerable women, L'Oréal is also creating a EUR 50 million charitable endowment fund. It will support field organizations and local charities in their efforts to fight poverty, help women achieve social and professional integration, provide emergency assistance to refugee and disabled women, prevent violence against women, and support victims. ""Over the past decade, we have profoundly transformed our company, putting sustainability at the very core of our business model. With our new commitments, we are entering a new phase of acceleration of that transformation: going beyond our direct environmental impact, helping consumers to make more sustainable choices, as well as generating positive social and environmental contribution"", concluded Alexandra Palt, L'Oréal Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer. In 2019, L'Oréal generated sales of almost 30 billion euros. At the end of the year, the group already had 35 carbon neutral sites (meaning they use 100% renewable energy), including 14 factories. Furthermore, 85% of the products created or renovated in 2019 had an improved environmental and social profile."
Unilever wants all their products to be net zero emissions by 2039,"As far as climate change is concerned, Unilever has already committed to have no carbon emissions from their own operations, and to halve the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of their products across the value chain, by 2030. In response to the scale and urgency of the climate crisis, the group is now additionally committing to net zero emissions from all their products by 2039 - from the sourcing of the materials, up to the point of sale of their products in the store. To achieve this goal, Unilever said they will prioritise building partnerships with suppliers who have set and committed to their own science-based targets. The group will set up a system for their suppliers to declare, on each invoice, the carbon footprint of the goods and services provided and will create partnerships with other businesses and organisations to standardise data collection, sharing and communication. Unilever wants also to go further in the fight against deforestation and achieve a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023. The group therefore wants to have visibility on exact sourcing locations, and no longer rely on the mass balance system, which does not allow for accurate verification. In order to increase traceability and transparency, the group will use emerging digital technologies - such as satellite monitoring, geolocation tracking and blockchain. Other commitments include: – To empower a new generation of farmers and smallholders who are committed to protecting and regenerating their farm environment. – To introduce a pioneering Regenerative Agriculture Code for all their suppliers. – To implement water stewardship programmes for local communities in 100 locations by 2030. – To join the 2030 Water Resources Group, a multi-stakeholder platform hosted by the World Bank, to contribute to transformative change and building resilience in water management in key water-stressed markets. – To make all product formulations biodegradable by 2030, to minimise their impact on water and the aquatic ecosystems. To accelerate action, Unilever's brands will collectively invest EUR 1 billion in a new dedicated Climate & Nature Fund. ""This will be used over the next ten years to take meaningful and decisive action, with projects likely to include landscape restoration, reforestation, carbon sequestration, wildlife protection and water preservation,"" said the group in a statement."
"Beauty brands need to take critical actions to get sustainable, finds new study","Quantis latest report, Make Up the Future: Levers of change for a sustainable cosmetics business, is a call to action for beauty players to join forces to fill critical data gaps to enhance understanding of the industry's environmental impacts. It points out the top issues the global cosmetics industry faces today and delivers a palette of science-based solutions. Drawing on Quantis' scientific expertise as well as concrete examples from industry sustainability leaders, including BeautyCounter, Chanel, Coty, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., French Federation for Beauty Companies (Fédération des Entreprises de la Beauté - FEBEA), Groupe Rocher, L'Oréal, the Personal Care and Cosmetics Council (PCPC), among others, the report encourages sustainability managers, corporate decision-makers and their teams to: – Prioritize efforts and resources on the topics that will make a meaningful difference; – Identify opportunities for collaboration and innovation within companies and across the industry; – Collect high-quality, consistent and representative data to understand environmental impacts across the value chain; – Set bold environmental goals that will lay the foundation for resilience in a resource-constrained world; and – Accelerate industry-wide action to make up a sustainable future for cosmetics. The report also takes a critical look at cosmetics' environmental data gaps. ""Data can be a major catalyst for meaningful change. For the cosmetics industry to catch up to FMCG categories more advanced on sustainability, it will need more, high-quality, comprehensive data to understand the full scale and scope of its environmental impacts,"" says Quantis in a statement. Based on currently available data, Quantis puts the contribution of the cosmetics industry to global CO2 emissions anywhere between 0.5% to 5%, highlighting the need for additional data to calculate a more complete picture of the industry's impacts. ""What the estimated footprint data can identify, however, is that the raw materials, packaging, transportation and use phase stages are the main areas where innovative and science-backed solutions can lead to significant impact reduction,"" emphasizes the consulting firm. Quantis, L'Oréal and other sustainability leaders in beauty will share their experiences in a webinar on June 10, 2020."
Superga Beauty implements an exclusive eco-design tool for promotions and gifts,"Dubbed GOGREEN, this new eco-design tool was created for Superga Beauty by sustainability consulting group Quantis. It makes it possible to assess the environmental impact of the products manufactured by the company (bags, cases accessories) from the design stage and throughout their life cycle. ""Environmentally-friendly initiatives are firmly rooted in our company's ethos. We developed GOGREEN in response to questions asked by our clients and to offer support in their CSR strategies in a pragmatic and objective manner,"" outlines Leslie Bréau Meniger, Director General - Superga Beauty. In concrete terms, Superga Beauty has made the tool available to their clients since March with the aim to better address their expectations related to sustainable development and CSR issues, from the very beginning of a project. The tool's core is based on the Ecoinvent database - the global benchmark for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), used in over 40 countries, which provides the basics of the GOGREEN analysis. It includes data from all stages of the lifecycle, including end of life. In addition, over 200 materials are listed, as well as 40 transformation processes and 20 decorative processes. GOGREEN thus makes it possible to quantify the carbon footprint and water consumption of each manufacturing campaign, taking account of the entire product lifecycle. ""We can simulate design and material options to best assess their carbon footprint. To improve a product profile, we can activate five different levers: material, closure, decoration, packaging, shipping,"" explains Leslie Bréau Meniger. By facilitating responses to very concrete questions (How to understand the effect of changing a material? Is it best to use cotton or hessian? What about PU?), GOGREEN allows brand fine tuning the different parameters of a project and thus reducing the carbon footprint of their gift campaigns. Example of the improved environmental impact of a toilet bag for a campaign of 100,000 units. – 10 litres of water saved per toilet bag, by changing the material, equating to 250 Olympic swimming pools – Carbon footprint reduction of 20%, through removal of the metal eyelet which is the equivalent of 70 return trips from Paris to New York – More responsible sourcing through use of RPET which uses recycled plastics ""Not only does the tool guide us in our developments, but also in our innovation. Our aim is not to replace our clients, but to offer clarification in their choices, and allow them to measure progress and communicate with consumers,"" concludes the company's DG. A subsidiary of Superga Invest, founded and directed by Alain Bréau since 2001, Superga Beauty is organised around three distinct divisions: Sub-Contracting (manufacture of care products & perfumes, filling, packaging, copacking), Promotion & Retail (design and manufacture of packaging, luggage, brushes and dispensers), Full Service (manufacturing, brand-free products, Full Buy). Superga Beauty owns five industrial sites based in France and has a team of some 350 employees spanning three continents."
Clean beauty : Coty achieves Cradle to Cradle certification for CK Everyone,"CK One, Calvin Klein's iconic fragrance is once again adapting to the taste of the day with an eco-designed version. The CK Everyone Eau de toilette offers a genderless fragrance based on 77% of naturally derived and vegan ingredients. The formula is also designed to be clean, that is to say free from any ingredient considered as toxic to health or the environment. As far as the packaging is concerned, the CK Everyone bottle and external pack were created from recycled materials. The transparent glass bottle contains 10% of post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials and is recyclable with the removal of the pump and the elastic while the folding carton contains 30% of post-consumer recycled materials. In support of these eco-design efforts, the Coty group, which owns the Calvin Klein perfumery license, announced that it has achieved a Material Health Certificate at the Silver level from the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute for CK Everyone Eau de toilette. According to Coty, the certification indicates that 100% of the chemical substances in CK Everyone Eau de toilette have been assessed and are compliant with the Cradle to Cradle Certified Product Standard material health requirements at the Silver level. ""These achievements also serve as the foundation of a material health optimization strategy for further improving the environmental safety of the fragrance over time,"" added the group in a statement. The Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Material Health Certificate is based on the rigorous, globally recognized material health assessment methodology of the Cradle to Cradle Certified Product Standard, one of the world's leading standards for designing and making products for the circular economy. It provides manufacturers with a means of assessing, optimizing and verifying their product chemistries for safety and the environment. The evaluation was executed by MBDC, a third-party Cradle to Cradle accredited assessor. ""Achieving a Cradle to Cradle Material Health certificate for CK Everyone Eau de toilette is another positive step in moving the beauty industry towards the universal use of materials that are safe, circular and responsible,"" said Dr. Christina Raab, Vice President of Strategy and Development for the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. CK Everyone Eau de toilette is a citrus fragrance, uplifted with zesty organic orange oil, a blue tea accord, and a cedarwood base. The fragrance, which exudes freshness was crafted by master perfumer and creator of the original CK One fragrance, Alberto Morillas. CK Everyone is available globally in a 50ml, 100ml, and 200ml, Eau de toilette spray."
TNT Manufacturing promotes the responsible choice of Zamak,"Zamak, an alloy composed of 95% zinc, 4% aluminium, and 1% copper, is a material that is still hardly used in the perfume industry - it is mainly part of decoration accessories and caps. The industries that use it more often include the building, furniture, automotive, electricity, and electronics industries. This highly-resistant alloy is 100% infinitely reusable in its end-of-life, without losing any properties during the recycling process. Indeed, controlled recycling preserves chemical, physical and mechanical properties, however many remelting operations are needed. As a result, it is a first-rate material for brands willing to make their packaging more responsible. ""Customers know very little about this alloy. They think it is recyclable, but not recycled,"" explains Thomas Diezinger, President of TNT Global Manufacturing France. ""We studied how it could actually be recycled, and we aim to provide the whole value chain with a comprehensive solution."" Therefore, the manufacturer contacted one of the main European zinc alloy leaders: the REAZN Group. A huge part of the zinc alloy volume produced on the group's Belgian production site is derived from recycled secondary zinc units from industrial by-products. The metal part derived from post-consumer recycling is still low, since collection and sorting chains do not work very well yet. ""For our industry to meet recycling companies' demand for PCR, we offer to use what already exists, i.e. the network that retrieves empty packs set up by a major French perfume and cosmetics retail brand in partnership with waste management company CEDRE. The company retrieves 15 tonnes of empty cosmetic products per week,"" explains Thomas Diezinger. This incentive consists in inviting consumers to bring back their own empty perfume bottles to stores and get a 20% discount on the next perfume purchased. ""The main material retrieved and recycled is glass; the other components undergo thermal recycling by incineration. So, we offered CEDRE to retrieve Zamak and resell it to REAZN,"" says TNT's Director. Operators organize the manual sorting of Zamak parts that can be valorized, depending on their quality, and then resold to the foundry owner who needs them. To promote and authenticate this initiative aimed to set up a recyclability chain, TNT Manufacturing created a logo which might pave the way for a future label guaranteeing the material's traceability. ""I strongly encourage brands to use Zamak, because it is perfectly adapted to the circular economy concept,"" adds Thomas Diezinger."
Eco-refill solutions now extend to leave-on cosmetics,"When they created CoZie (Cosmétique Objectif Zéro Environmental Impact), 3 years ago, the three young entrepreneurs - Arnaud Lancelot, Émeric Baracat and Louise Salvati - wanted to fully exploit the clean beauty concept, well beyond formulas. ""This required to also work on the pack and, in our opinion, the most effective solution was the waste that we don't generate, and therefore to have the possibility of refilling empty packagings. An idea put forward by Louise who is a zero-waste influencer,"" explains Arnaud Lancelot. But to be achieved, this indeed virtuous idea, had to overcome a set of major challenges: an unprecedented initiative in the personal care segment, a non-existent distribution technology at the time, the necessary consideration of the microbial development risk criteria, regulatory compliance, adequacy with POS, packaging management… ""For this type of product, a complete mastery of safety and traceability issues was needed. So we decided to create everything ourselves from scratch. Our idea was to recreate a mini lab at the POS, respecting good cosmetic manufacturing practices, in the same way as in an industrial site,"" describes the co-founder. Two years were necessary for the development phase, led by Émeric, an engineer by training and with a 10-year career in a large cosmetic group, supported by different engineering offices. But down the road, the challenge was successfully met: this patented equipment, like non other worldwide, encompasses a number of technical solutions to protect the formula from air, light and dust. ""There is no contact between the product and the outside: it goes directly from the machine to the bottle,"" confirms Arnaud Lancelot, thereby guaranteeing a product protection, against any risks of bacterial contamination. This ""Dosing"" device not only brings together a set of dedicated fountains to deliver the 9 product references of CoZie, but once the refill is completed, it also prints a specific label with the batch number, the best before date and the volume chosen by the customer. ""Our machine is also connected, which allows us to collect and centralize all the data on a server, to ensure traceability in the event of a problem. We know where and when a given batch number was sold,"" added the entrepreneur. Another issue to solve, was the cleanliness of glass bottles before refill. A responsibility which, in the opinion of the founders, lied with the brand. The solution found to rule out all risks: the bottle deposit. Each bottle is brought back by the customer who is given a new empty and clean bottle, which is filled with the desired quantity, with a reduction of 1.5 euros in the product price. ""Across the country, we have set up an industrial washing loop. All the used bottles recovered are sent to one of our washing centres where all cosmetic hygiene conditions are met: the bottles are washed, dried and re-labelled."" While multi-material pumps are directed to a specific and dedicated recycling channel. ""It is impossible to wash these pumps on an industrial scale. We have sought for solutions from suppliers, without success to date,"" notes Arnaud Lancelot. From the retailer's point of view, the operation is almost neutral. The machine, which uses little space, only needs to be installed, connected and refilled. No maintenance is required and the machine is operated by the consumer. The brand already owns 49 machines mainly installed in organic stores and zero waste stores, with the aim of accelerating the supply to new pharmacies and beauty networks in the coming months. Today, the three founders intend to share their concept with other players in the industry. A first experiment was successfully carried out; it consisted in assisting the Beauty Kitchen brand in the U.K. ""At first we provided advice. This refill system raises many technical and legal issues among other, which we went through. This allows saving a lot of time. Then, we supplied the machine, custom designed for the brand, on a Private Label mode,"" describes Arnaud Lancelot. Building on this success, the team will assist two other major French brands next March, for new launches of cosmetic refills. Still relatively confidential, in the sphere of beauty, the solution of refillable cosmetic products in POS is nonetheless slowly but surely winning over new consumers. Among the pioneering players, the brand of natural products, Panier des Sens, has been testing the system since 2016 in its 3 stores, for its flagship reference, its liquid Marseille soap. ""It is a fairly complex project to set up. We developed it more out of conviction than out of interest, but today demand is increasing,"" admits Aurélie Muntaner, Marketing Director. More recently, L'Occitane has launched an experimental fountain device for three of its shower gel references in several of its retails stores. With CoZie, the approach is now reaching a new segment. ""We have a 40 to 60% rate of bottle returns, which is very high for a small brand like ours and shows that there is a real desire for re-purchase. This experiment encourages strong customer loyalty and things are actually going faster than we had thought,"" highlighted Arnaud Lancelot."
REN Clean Skincare and Aptar join forces to support a novel plastic recycling technology,"Due to the environmental emergency linked to plastic, manufacturers find themselves committed to developing post-consumer plastic recycling processes. In addition to traditional mechanical recycling, the SABIC Group has perfected the post-consumer plastic packs conversion into polyolefin. ""The plastic challenge has shed light on the need to provide additional solutions. It has made possible to unlock and deepen a whole series of technological innovations, in particular the novel application of pyrolysis for this new recycling technology proposed by SABIC,"" notes Frédéric Dreux. ""But beware, these techniques do not free yourself from improving eco-design, key to achieve mono-material packs, these efforts remain a priority and an absolute necessity. These new technologies are also not meant to replace mechanical recycling. It is a necessary addition to further increase recycling capacities,"" he adds. Besides reducing the carbon impact compared to virgin plastics of fossil origin, the advantage of this technology lies in the possibility to focus on the recycling of packs which are known to be more difficult to recycle using a mechanical process, and which are therefore commonly sent to incineration or landfill. ""These are often packagings that do not fit into the 'guidelines' of what recyclers are able to process, such as flexible pouches or complex multi-material products. High quality mechanical recycling requires huge sorting efforts upstream, because once re-melted into pellets, it will be impossible to separate the materials. Here, we are talking about molecular fragmentation, which means the technology is less sensitive to the mix of PP + PE materials in the same batch. Traces of PET, or even of metal in the event of metallization, are no longer an issue for this technology"" explains the specialist. A sore point for the luxury and cosmetic industry, which has to deal with complex materials to answer the need for barrier properties or complex assemblies for functionality. The technology reverts to the basic constituent of plastic with the same qualities, properties, clarity and purity than the virgin material. ""Going to the molecular level allows recreating all of the polyolefin grades and to serve applications in the finest and most optimum way. For the first time, we have a recycling technique, opening the possibility of indefinite plastic recycling without losing its quality and physical properties,"" specifies Frédéric Dreux. ""It is important to support new recycling technologies, and this is what we are doing with REN Clean Skincare, even if it now represents a cost for the brand, a cost, we decided consumers should not have to bear. Our support to this technology can help make it grow to an industrial scale, with an increase in new capacities and structures. This is not going to be achieved by a supplier alone, the good news is that there is a real consensus from the sector to increase resources for this new technology. It's a virtuous circle. This is a new step in the way to improve the sustainability of plastics, demonstrating that it is possible to develop and use new technologies to further contribute to plastic being recycled in a circular economy"" concludes Frédéric Dreux."
Australia: Beauty brands stand shoulder to shoulder after devastating bushfires tainted the country's image,"The devastation of Australia's bushfire crisis in January has tainted the country's reputation as an environmentally-conscious heaven. For sure, human-made environmental disasters are not new in Australia, but in recent years, the country had widely promoted its natural and organic brands and products - especially cosmetic and personal care goods - offered in environmental friendly packaging. A brand like Aesop, for instance, has built its global success on this concept. ""We've been selling Australia on clean air, clear skies, bright shiny beaches, hopping animals. Unfortunately, what people have been seeing (are) singed koalas and kangaroos,"" said University of Technology Sydney lecturer David Beirman. Actually, the fires have highlighted the contribution of the Australian mining industry in global warming as well as the government's indifference - and even denial - regarding this issue. ""I'm tired, sad and disappointed in our government. As a small Blue Mountains based business, I struggle to comprehend the destruction and loss this nation has suffered, whilst at the same time ensuring my business stays intact,"" said Bridget Carmady, founder and director of Clémence Organics, a luxury and organic skincare brand from New South Wales. While she hasn't lost property or lives close to her, Bridget has had to deal with situations such as burnt land and fencing, while moving offices to ensure stock and staff stayed safe. ""How can you feel sorry for yourself whilst so many suffer more? I want to give, donate, share but at the same time I need to look after my family and my business. Business-wise, it's been a quiet month,"" she added. To support businesses and towns affected by fire, Instagram page @spendwhithem was created by Turia Pitt, a young woman who suffered burns to 65% of her body after encountering an out of control grassfire while competing in a 100km ultra marathon in the Australian outback in 2011. In such a context, beauty heavyweights such as Estée Lauder, L'Oréal Australia, L'Occitane, Lush Cosmetics and Coty have pledged to donate important cash sums to help the relief. The L'Occitane Group has thus announced the launch of a fund dedicated to punctual responses to disasters affecting ecosystems. ""This fund will be financed by an internal donation campaign amongst the group's shareholders. An initial support fund of EUR 400,000 has been pledged to finance long-term projects, with EUR 200,000 set to be donated immediately to tree-planting and agroforestry schemes in Australia, in a bid to help restore its landscape over the next decade,"" said Pierre Emmanuel Joffre, CEO of L'Occitane Australia to Premium Beauty News. ""The L'Occitane Foundation will select these projects alongside the company's agricultural engineers and its operational teams in the country,"" he added. ""Last year we worked with PUR Project to fund tree plantation schemes in Australia. This year, we will be pre-selecting four potential partners in the coming weeks. Then, we will choose the one who best matches; and, can deliver on the objectives of the newly established L'Occitane Fund. Our goal is to start the project by the end of 2020."" For the French beauty multinational, it is important to stress this action is consistent with a long-term commitment towards sustainability. ""L'Occitane consistently works to reduce waste and improve our product lifespans. Our first eco-refills were launched in 2008. Today, L'Occitane offers 16 eco-refills for best-selling products. These eco-refills use up to 90% less plastic than a regular bottle, saving more than 214 tonnes of plastic world-wide each year. L'Occitane intends to offer 25 eco-refills by 2022, while also making the eco-refill packaging itself recyclable by 2025. As a brand, we have never used plastic bags in our stores and it's been over a year now since we have banned the use of all cellophane paper,"" highlighted Pierre Emmanuel Joffre. ""Additionally, we are committed to recycling, which we believe is important to working towards a circular economy. In 2009, L'Occitane launched its first 100% recycled bottle and we are determined to transition to 100% sustainable PET plastic to all of our product bottles by 2025."" Many smaller beauty brands have rallied together to support those affected by the bushfires that swept across Australia: Bondi Sands, Cannabella, Evo Hair, Ecoya, Frank Body, Go-To, Hop and Cotton, Jurlique, Kevin Murphy, Kora Organics, Mecca, Nude by Nature, Ozdare, Swisse, Trilogy, The Jojoba Company, Ultraceauticals and WelleCo, to name a few. However, at a moment when the contradictions of the Australian nation - emblematic of those of many developed countries - came to light, the brands' commitments are as much expected as scrutinized. In this field, any suspicion of greenwashing or insincerity could lead to a catastrophic boomerang effect for their authors."
Albéa and Colgate launch the first recyclable toothpaste tube,"According to a recent Colgate-Palmolive survey, almost two thirds of people in the UK are not aware that toothpaste tubes cannot be recyled [1]. Indeed, most of today's toothpaste tubes are made from sheets of plastic laminate - usually a combination of different plastics - sandwiched around a thin layer of aluminium. The mix of materials makes it impossible to recycle through conventional methods. Packed in a HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) tube, the Smile for Good toothpaste changes the game. HDPE is a polymer that is widely used for milk containers and other plastic bottles and is massively recycled. Made by Albéa, this tube is the first to be recognized as recyclable by the APR (Association of Plastic Recyclers) and RecyClass (an initiative that works on improving the recyclability of packaging), which sets recyclability standards for North America and Europe respectively. According to Colgate-Palmolive, toothpaste alone accounts for an estimated 20 billion tubes annually around the world. To limit the impact of the most widely used forms of plastic packaging that up until now could not be recycled., Colgate has decided to share the technology with competitors. ""Colgate wants to make tubes a part of the circular economy by keeping this plastic productive and eliminating waste. If we can standardise recyclable tubes among all companies, we all win. We want all toothpaste tubes - and eventually all kinds of tubes - to meet the same third-party recycling standards that we've achieved. We can align on these common standards for tubes and still compete with what's inside them,"" commented Noel Wallace, Chief Executive Officer and President of Colgate-Palmolive. The Colgate Smile for Good Toothpaste is available to purchase from the following retailers, from January: Sainsbury's, Boots, Superdrug, Wilko, Waitrose, Ocado and Amazon, and from February in Tesco and Morrisons. In the U.S., the tube will debut under the company's Tom's of Maine brand in 2020. Together with the recent launch of the Colgate Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush and TerraCycle partnership, Smile for Good is a way Colgate is improving the sustainability profile of its products to help achieve its aim of 100% recyclable packaging by 2025. For Albéa, this is a new step towards the development of more responsible packaging solutions in the beauty and personal care industry. Last November, the packaging supplier presented a paper tube project together with L'Oréal. ""Today we are accelerating the development of recyclable packaging and contributing to circularity. By partnering with our customers, suppliers and recognized associations such as the APR and RecyClass, we demonstrate our commitment to tomorrow,"" said Gilles Swyngedauw, Vice President Sustainability, Marketing and Innovation at Albéa."
L'Occitane is testing in-store refillable shower gels,"The concept of reusable pack is gaining ground in the beauty hygiene sector. Like some other brands in the category, L'Occitane already offers eco-refills in the form of a Doypack for certain references. But to be even more eco-friendly, the brand is considering eliminating the use of this refill pack and replacing it with a fountain solution. ""Eco-design is the essential motivation for this initiative. Refilling one's bottle is the best solution for reducing the plastic footprint,"" believed Corinne Fugier-Garrel, Packaging concept Development Director at L'Occitane en Provence. Hence, since June 2019, the brand has been experimenting the concept with three in-store refillable shower gels, in three of its L'Occitane POS in Provence, Germany and Spain. ""The idea emerged in November 2018. Because this was urgent matter, we decided to speed up things and developed the project in six months only, by daring to bank on a completely novel technique. We wanted to see how consumers would react,"" explained Corinne Fugier-Garrel. The experiment involves three successful brand references: Verveine Classique, Verveine Karité and Verveine Agrumes. ""We chose popular products, for which we know customers would come back in stores asking for more"". To develop a fountain specifically adapted to the shower gel, L'Occitane called on its partner, Marie Laure PLV, a company specialized in POS furniture. ""We had to take into account the fact that the shower gel does not flow naturally when you want to fill a bottle in a short time. This means that the liquid has to be both pushed and sucked to fill a bottle in less than a minute,"" explained the Project Manager, who also added that the work to improve the machines was continuing with the experiment. Reflecting the spirit of the brand, bottles are aluminium standard packs that come in 250- and 500-ml formats at the price of 3 and 5 euros when purchased the first time. The consumer can then choose his bulk shower gel at one of the fountain taps. A pump is also offered free of charge as an option, with the mention ""non-recyclable element."" ""We made sure that the price of the bottle with the gel was equal to the price of the classic product. The first time, the operation is therefore neutral for the consumer who then only pays for the refill operation, which is between 25 and 30% cheaper than a full new bottle. There is therefore also a financial incentive behind to motivate the refilling."" The bulk shower gel comes in 5 litre containers with a batch number. Each filled bottle is labelled by a store assistant, with the legal notices, the list of ingredients and the batch number marked on the bottle. The gel is transferred by the machine in a closed circuit, thus eliminating the risk of bacterial contamination. The cleanliness of the empty bottle to refill, remains nevertheless the consumer's responsibility. It is still too early, according to the project manager, to make a first assessment, but L'Occitane aims to soon extend the experimentation, as part of a second pilot test, involving some 30 to 50 POS internationally."
Stora Enso develops new wood-based sustainable solutions for cosmetic brands,"There is definitely a lot going on in northern Europe! Indeed, Finnish-based Sulapac is preparing a new generation of cosmetic packaging with Chanel, while Sweden's BillerudKorsnäs is discussing with L'Oréal and other partners the industrialization of the cardboard bottle, and Helsinki-headquartered Metsä Board is preparing the future for cardboard with a new innovation centre in Äänekoski. In the meantime, the Finnish-Swedish company Stora Enso has also begun to transform. At the Luxe Pack Monaco tradeshow, Stora Enso presented a renewable paperboard tube for cosmetics packaging as a climate-friendly alternative to plastic tubes. The body of the tube is made from a barrier-coated, grease-resistant paperboard by Stora Enso, which makes it suitable for the primary packaging of skin creams. According to the company, making the body of the tube from paperboard reduces the use of plastic by 70% compared with a plastic tube. ""We are seeing increasing demand in the cosmetics field for new innovative solutions made of renewable materials. This tube is a good example of how, together with our customers and their suppliers, we are driving innovations to create the packaging of the future. The paperboard tube will offer cosmetics brands who want to appeal to eco-conscious consumers a competitive new alternative,"" says Henna Paakkonen-Alvim, Vice President, Innovation, Stora Enso Consumer Board division. For manufacturing of the tubes, Stora Enso cooperates with Aisa, a world-leading tube machinery manufacturer. The industrial runnability of the board has been tested on Aisa's machinery to ensure flawless and efficient converting performance. To go further, Stora Enso is also developing biocomposite materials to replace the plastic cap and shoulder of the tube in the future. Last year, Stora Enso launched DuraSense, a blend of wood fibres (up to 50%) and polymers (usually polypropylene), which can be fossil, bio-based or recycled, depending on the brands' requirements, in order to offer an alternative to oil-based plastics. Indeed, thanks to the wood fibres they contain, DuraSense biocomposites allow to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of packaging materials. For instance, with a blend of wood fibres and bio-based polymers, it is possible to get up to 98% renewable content. In addition, the wood used for DuraSense comes from sustainably managed Nordic forests. Stora Enso has also developed a process for using microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), which is added to the pulp to lighten and strengthen paperboard, as a texture agent in cosmetic formulations. According to Stora Enso, MFC is a 100% biodegradable natural multifunctional ingredient that can act as a rheology modifier, emulsion stabiliser, moisturiser and sensorial agent while contributing to a more sustainable world. Stora Enso presented this new ingredient at Cosmetic 360 in Paris last month, where it was selected as a finalist for the Cosmetic 360 Awards. ""Our business is no longer limited to paperboard, we are developing new segments based on wood cellulose. We will soon introduce new moulded fibre applications. Much of what used to be done from fossil resources will soon be made from wood fibre,"" explains Hervé Vue, Sales Manager France at StoraEnso."
Samples: Arcade Beauty Europe commits to sustainability and recyclability,"""This issue is no longer a choice. Suppliers and brands should work hand in hand to fulfil their sustainability objectives,"" starts Carl Allain, General Manager of Arcade Beauty Europe. Early this year, the Arcade Beauty Group's subsidiary appointed former Quality Director Claudie Guérin Guilbaud as CSR Director Europe to formalize the actions already launched and take part in defining a new strategy. ""All perfume & cosmetics players have changed their vision. Our key accounts have all made significant CSR commitments. It will revolutionize our sector,"" adds Carl Allain. This issue is nothing new for the sample and mini-cosmetics manufacturer. But as drastic regulatory changes have been implemented and consumer preferences keep changing, it is time to speed up the process. ""Last year, Arcade Beauty Europe initiated a diagnosis for all its sites to make an update on the actions already launched, whether they focused on environmental protection, employee wellness, or our impact on communities,"" explains Claudie Guérin Guilbaud. Based on the results, the company set up a strategy focused on four pillars: product compliance and innovation, purchase and business ethics, operational excellence, staff involvement and community integration. The company aims to get the LUCIE label by 2025 for all its industrial sites. This label is related to standard ISO 26000 on Corporate Social Responsibility and is structured around the seven key points of the standard, turned into principles of action: respect for consumers' and clients' interests, environmental protection, fair operating practices and responsibility, human capital development, respect for human rights, balance between the company's and the general interest, transparent decision-making and control system. Currently assessed by Eco Vadis, the six Arcade Beauty Europe sites already count four gold and two silver medals. The company aims for gold for all sites. Likewise, Arcade Beauty Europe is being assessed by the CDP (Carbon Discolure Program) and intends to get an AAA in 2025. Also, Arcade Beauty will define CSR scores for all technologies and products. Based on life cycle assessments, these scores will be made available to the company's customers, together with alternative proposals to get better scores than with the existing products. Furthermore, the sample manufacturer has committed to improving CSR scores for every single new product: they have launched research on all technologies (bags, thermoformed products, etc.). For example, a recyclable bag is being designed and should be showcased at Luxe Pack Monaco. Similarly, the company has been launching APET PCR-based solutions and already claims being able to use 50% PCR in thermoformed products. Concrete examples will also be unveiled at Luxe Pack. As a result, Arcade Beauty undertakes to manufacture 80% products containing recycled materials and to only offer 100% recyclable products by 2025. ""It requires finding solutions based on a single material or easily separable materials,"" explains the General Manager. As regards purchases, the second pillar of the CSR policy, Arcade Beauty Europe has already launched many initiatives: FSC-certified cardboard, anti-corruption policy, CO2 emission reduction plan… The company also plans to set up a grid to assess its suppliers, as well as a system to ensure sourcing traceability. Plus, a production relocation process was launched. ""We have already brought back to France part of our manufacturing activity from the US, and we will keep making such transfers, so that we no longer have to import products from our North American sites. By relocating our production, we considerably reduce our products' CO2 impact. In 2018, 196 CO2-equivalent tonnes were saved, and we plan to exceed 250 tonnes in 2019,"" explains Carl Allain. Our Asian production should also be concerned. ""The idea is that every region (North America, Europe, Asia, and Brazil) should be able to serve local markets by itself."" As for operational excellence, the third pillar, new objectives were defined, in particular in terms of energy consumption reduction (GHG), VOC emissions, and waste quantity. ""For every site, we are going to measure the CO2 emission levels compared to the number of units produced in order to reduce them by 10% every year. We will do the same with waste quantities, which should decline by 10% per tonne of product,"" details Carl Allain. To this aim, Arcade Beauty has been investing in new technologies. For example, the silica-based filters that will be installed on the Socoplan-Socoprint site will help better treat the VOCs emitted during printing operations. The last pillar, staff involvement and community integration, has already led to a number of initiatives. ""We invested a lot to offer all our employees a training course on the Arcade Beauty values. In late 2018, we conducted an anonymous satisfaction and corporate culture survey to be able to maintain our actions for team involvement. On the Thouars site, in collaboration with the French Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, Socoplan helped develop a training course on bag filling machines,"" explains Carl Allain. Lastly, the ""security week"" organized every year will turn into a ""CSR week"". Internal training courses and external programmes will be offered to all employees working on the Arcade Beauty Europe sites. All the group's sites based in Europe will discuss these issues and harmonize their practices. Then, what is done in Europe will be reproduced on the global level. ""Obviously, pressure is stronger in Europe, but our customers are international. Our key American or Brazilian accounts have also implemented demanding strategies… Our work will also help other entities within the group save time,"" concludes Carl Allain."
"L'Oréal and Beiersdorf among the few companies tackling deforestation, according to CDP","""To encourage its suppliers to manage their forest footprint, L'Oréal has developed its Sustainable Palm Index, to assess suppliers' commitments and achievements in fighting deforestation,"" the CDP recently reported. However, the report - dubbed 'The Money Trees' - also found that several major corporations are avoiding transparency when it comes to deforestation. The CDP and other organizations asked 1,500 companies judged to have a significant impact on forests to provide data via CDP's reporting platform in 2018, but 70% neglected to do so. More than 350 major companies have not submitted data for the three years from 2016 through 2018, including apparel giants Next and Sports Direct. The corporations were asked to disclose data regarding timber, palm oil, cattle and soy, as well as detailing their actions taken to reduce deforestation in their supply chains. ""For too long corporations have ignored the impacts of their supply chains on the world's forests and have not taken seriously the risks this poses - both to their business and the world,"" said Morgan Gillespy, Global Director of Forests at CDP, in a statement. ""Environmental concern is at an all-time high, and companies are being demanded to be transparent and take decisive action to protect forests. Consumers increasingly want to know that their shopping basket isn't driving the destruction of the Amazon, extinction of the orangutans and the climate crisis."" A total of 306 companies reported data to CDP in 2018, with 24% showing no or limited action to reduce deforestation. The report concluded that the corporate transparency rate of 30% on forests remains significantly lower than that for issues such as climate change and water security — both of which have a transparency rate of 43%."
Olay joins the refillable trend in a move to reduce plastic packaging waste,"Beginning in October 2019 and running through the end of the year, Olay will offer its best-selling Olay Regenerist Whip moisturizer with a refill pod that fits right in the jar. From October to December, shoppers will thus have the option of purchasing a recyclable, refillable pod of the moisturizer, as opposed to its usual plastic jar. If this is successful and appealing enough to the consumer, that would save ""over 1,000,000 lbs of plastic"", stated the brand in a release. In practical terms, during the trial time period, consumers will be able to purchase the refillable Olay Regenerist Whip package that contains one full jar of Olay Regenerist Whip and one refill pod of moisturizer that can be placed inside the jar once it's emptied. The package will be sold and shipped in a container made of 100% recycled paper and will not contain an outer carton in order to reduce the use of paperboard. The pods themselves are made of polypropylene and are also recyclable, depending on local recycling guidelines. Plastic waste has become a major area of investment and concern for beauty brands over the past few years, with multiple companies testing out more sustainable packaging options and initiatives. Earlier this year, Procter & Gamble-owned hair care brand Herbal Essences joined forces with waste management giant TerraCycle to launch a series of bottles comprising 25% beach plastic, while Kiehl's Since 1851 unveiled a limited-edition version of its signature 'Rare Earth' mask in April alongside John Legend, presented in new, lower-plastic packaging. REN Clean Skincare has pledged to become completely ""zero waste"" by the year 2021, and personal care conglomerate Unilever recently unveiled a three-part plan to target plastic use in the US, including a pledge for 50% of its plastic packaging to be made from post-consumer recycled (PCR) content by the end of 2019. As demand for environmentally friendly products is increasingly growing, refillable solutions, which have already been tested for a long time by some luxury fragrance brands, are gradually conquering the skincare category. Ranges like Absolue by Lancôme and Or Rouge by Yves St Laurent recently opted for such solutions, confirming the alliance between luxury and the concept of product refillability. Suppliers are particularly aware of the trend and are developing different standard or tailor-made packaging options. ""A refill is not necessarily viewed as low-end. There are a lot of beautiful things to be done. Consumers should be able to find luxury in this refill, even if it is only seen once,"" explains Raul Cervantes, Personal Care Market Manager of Albéa. For Absolue by Lancôme, a refillable product developed in collaboration with Heinz-Glas, for the main jar, the bottom of the cup designed by Albéa is embossed with the Lancôme Rose to relay the brand's codes in the tiniest details. Most recently, the trend also hit the makeup segment with French colour cosmetics brand La Bouche Rouge Paris pioneering the move with a reusable and refillable luxury lipstick packaging, or with Lush's brand-new rechargeable and recyclable plastic-free lipstick. ""Beauty brands may find it beneficial to act proactively rather than letting consumers taking the initiative - with potential backlash for brands perceived as not going fast and far enough. The beauty industry is one of the most visible (it gathers one third of all interactions on social media), it comprises some of the best known and most powerful brands in the world, who might lead the way towards more virtuous and durable consumption models,"" said beauty packaging expert Gerald Martines. ""What is at stake is largely proportionate to the magnitude of the challenges: it is no less than inventing tomorrow's really durable beauty, while generating engagement and new levels of brand loyalty,"" he concluded."
Latest trends in sustainable cosmetics,"A symbol that is far from innocent: the tenth North American edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit was opened by influential writer and internet blogger Colin Beavan. Dubbed ""No Impact Man"", Colin was noted for recording the attempts of his family to live a ""zero impact"" lifestyle in New York City for one year. Colin is probably the epitome of these new generations of consumers who are increasingly aware of the impacts they create in their everyday lives and try not just to reduce, but also create positive impacts. Among the key trends highlighted at the summit are: Packaging innovations. With growing consumer awareness of plastic pollution, the beauty industry is facing pressure to reduce its packaging impacts. Examples of innovative packaging solutions were presented. Seed Phytonutrients gave details of its compostable bottle made from post-consumer paper, whilst the Korean company InnerBottle showed how its new packaging technology creates zero waste. The way forward appears to be innovation rather than incrementalism measures like light-weighting. Scrutiny of supply chains. Raw material supply chains are becoming increasingly scrutinized for environmental and social risks. Verisk Maplecroft Research showed that shea butter, silk, vanilla, and cocoa are cosmetic ingredients with some of the highest social risks; these include human trafficking, child labour, discrimination and land grabs. Using essential oils as an example, Dee-Ann Prather from Down Under Enterprises showed how ingredient suppliers can provide traceability in their supply chains. Since adulteration is a major issue, the Australian supplier is looking at blockchain technology. New sources of green ingredients are emerging. DuPont showed how it has created its Genencare OSMS BA material from food side streams. Genomatica is creating butylene glycol from plant sugars, whilst Aprinnova is making squalane from sugarcane. Details were also given on how plant cell technology is being utilized to produce active ingredients. Green packaging materials. Andrew Dent from Material ConneXion highlighted the issue with existing packaging materials: less than 5% of plastics are recycled in the US. He called for brands to look at green materials so they can prepare for a circular economy. Examples were given of recycled materials, compostable packaging, and recent innovations. Bio-engineered solutions on the horizon involve algae, fungi and bacteria. New business models. TerraCycle showed how brands can move away from single-use packaging via its new Loop shopping platform. Described as a 'circular shopping platform', Loop enables packaging to be returned to brands and re-used. Loop made its debut in the US last month; partners include P&G, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Walgreens and Kroger. Natural & organic cosmetics. According to The Benchmarking Company, 68% of American females purchase natural & organic beauty products, up from 49% in 2008. Health reasons are the primary factor, cited by 73% of buyers. The adoption rates are expected to continue to rise as consumer demographics change… Look beyond organic. Diana Martin from the Rodale Institute called for farmers to adopt regenerative agricultural systems. The new Regenerative Organic Certification adds soil health, fair trade, and animal welfare to existing organic farming practices. The new scheme currently has 21 pilots worldwide and is backed by leading operators, such as Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps and Patagonia. Create marketing experiences. The Millennials and Gen Z now represent half of American consumers. According to Sourabh Sharma from FIG Or Out, these growing influential consumers expect sustainability to be a core value of companies. He called for brands to create marketing experiences for these consumers. Winners in the digital age are likely to be brands which utilize social media, deliver clear communications, and create a brand / product story. Sustainability discussions will continue in the next edition: Sustainable Cosmetics Summit Europe 4-6 November 2019, Paris - France www.sustainablecosmeticssummit.com"
Sustainability: Asian consumers increasingly aware of biodiversity,"Asian consumers have a higher awareness of biodiversity than consumers in the UK, US or Germany. Actually, most Asian consumers have 'heard of biodiversity,' according to data published in the 2019 UEBT Biodiversity Barometer [1], an ongoing set of research that has spanned more than a decade and is updated annually. This year's edition focused on consumer insights from four countries in Asia: China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. One major takeaway from the research has been that Asian consumer awareness of biodiversity has increased over the last decade. In Asia, as in other countries, youth is the category with the highest level of awareness of biodiversity: 86% of young (16-24 year) Asian respondents are aware of biodiversity. Asian youth are also seeking concrete actions from companies, with most saying that they would like companies to inform them about ""the concrete actions they take to ensure they respect biodiversity and people when they source the natural ingredients use."" More generally speaking, a majority of Asian consumers surveyed also have strong expectations towards companies. In Asia, as in the Western countries, a large majority of respondents believes that companies should have a positive impact on society, people and biodiversity. Consumer confidence that companies are having such impact is high in Vietnam (76%, up 16 points from 2014 on total agree) and China (74%). With 45% confidence rates, respondents in Japan and South Korea are more sceptical, somewhat in line with the findings in Western countries. Actually, UEBT's research found a gap in consumer confidence related to a company's actions: in other words, consumers have higher awareness of biodiversity and think it's important, but they have lower confidence that companies are protecting biodiversity. Almost a quarter of Japanese respondents (24%) said they don't know if companies pay serious attention to biodiversity. Among different kinds of information available on product packaging, respondents in Asia attach most importance to the origin of product ingredients. Additionally, they would like information on the impact on biodiversity (e.g. no deforestation, support for bees, wild flowers, replanting). As in Western countries, this is given more importance than the social impact (working conditions, health and safety of local workers), or the fair compensation of supply chain actors. In Brazil, respondents mentioned the impact on biodiversity as the most important issue. ""We felt the time was right to dive deeper into consumers' insights from Asia. In 2020, China will host the UN Summit on Biodiversity, which will define the global plan on biodiversity for the next decade. Chinese leadership in this major global event underscores the role that Asia has in protecting the world's biodiversity. This also means there is an opportunity for business to take concrete action to position their brands in Asian markets as leaders in sourcing with respect for people and biodiversity,"" said Rik Kutsch Lojenga, UEBT's Executive Director."
Chemical recycling: a new solution for plastic packaging,"In light of the challenge of the century, i.e. reducing the world's plastic consumption and better managing packaging end-of-life, recycling solutions have gained popularity: the EU has actually set out ambitious objectives compelling manufacturers to offer packaging 50% made of recycled plastic by 2025. However, as they depend on more or less mature collecting installations, depending on the countries, and on hardly flexible thermo-mechanical recycling technologies, recycling players are struggling to meet demand for plastic in such quantities. ""We are aiming for waste flows that just do not exist. Today, 1 million tonnes of collected plastic per year are missing to reach this goal,"" says Martin Stephan, Deputy Managing Director of Carbios, a bioplastics-processing company and a pioneer in chemical recycling based in Clermont-Ferrand, France. ""The EU estimates that 4 billion euros need to be invested in Europe to fulfil the 2025 objectives."" The thermo-mechanical technology involves crushing and melting specific types of plastic, usually the most common types, but not coloured. Today, this process has the advantage of increasing the plastic shelf-life, but there is a huge constraint involving the limited quantity of resource available for a qualitative result that is less satisfactory than the virgin material. ""Mechanical recycling has its own limits, because you cannot recycle the same pack indefinitely: plastic gradually loses its mechanical properties. In addition, many contaminating products cannot be removed,"" explains Martin Stephan. Given the huge challenge rPET (recycled PET) sourcing represents, plastic processing startups and manufacturers have already started working on a new recycling generation based on a PET depolymerisation and repolymerization chemical process. Contrary to the mechanical process, this technology has the tremendous advantage of resulting in a completely virgin resin after the recycling process. ""Starting with 100% waste, this technology can generate a much more interesting volume with the same quality as the virgin material,"" explains Gilles Swyngedauw, Innovation and CSR Director of Albéa, who have just signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, thus committing to the circular economy principle. Brands are now taking action, ordering their own plastic from the future suppliers of this new green gold. Among others, L'Oréal and L'Occitane have signed partnership agreements with Loop Industries, a Canadian pioneer in the chemical recycling technology. In France, Carbios is currently industrializing a promising solution based on an enzymatic transformation process. ""Thanks to an enzyme specific to PET, we break down the molecule chain of plastic. Our process destructures the polymer to get the two original monomers back. Then, we just repolymerize them to obtain a material identical to virgin PET,"" explains Martin Stephan. This technology will help petrochemicals specialists produce ""virgin"" PET, not only based on petrol, but based on waste, including clothes made of polyester and coloured plastics, indefinitely. The first productions should be available in 2023/2024. ""It is not reuse, it is really recycling,"" he adds. For packaging manufacturers, the first to be confronted with sourcing constraints, the prospect of chemical recycling definitely represents the opportunity for an additional, more qualitative resource. Still, some of them have raised questions about this new model. In fact, by providing rPET suppliers in the R&D phase with financial support through volume preorders, brands impose a unique choice of supplier to their packaging manufacturer partners in the future. ""This model is quite surprising, because transformers are not part of the process. In the traditional value chain, you have the raw material supplier, who supplies the transformer, who supplies the final customer. Tomorrow, raw materials will be imposed by brands, which is likely to have a strong impact on the whole value chain. Manufacturers will no longer be able to decide what they purchase, and in the event of a manufacturing issue, several players will share responsibility. This type of approach can be dangerous,"" says Vincent Joffre, Sales Manager of PRP Création. For now, these partnership announcements offer brands an obvious media representation, while enhancing competition as regards this much-awaited technology."
"""Integrating sustainability enhances trust in brands,"" Frédéric Dreux, Unilever Prestige","Premium Beauty News - What are the improvement drivers in cosmetics packaging in 2019? Frédéric Dreux - The main driver that should keep enhancing innovation is related to the functionalities of packaging, i.e. delivering the product in a more luxurious, surprising, and safe way. The objective is also to improve the benefit provided by the formula by means of the delivery system. It is an important aspect, although it is not always salient in the current packs, but it is very well conveyed by the customization trend. Of course, real innovation is about achieving this delivery performance following a sustainable approach. That is the main challenge today – the improvement that is most needed. The cosmetics industry is aware of it, and everyone understands it should be done without changing the main functions of packaging. There has been a significant acceleration in this field in the cosmetics industry, as can be seen with the recent product launches and manufacturers' offering, increasingly based on recycled or recyclable materials. It is interesting to see how this shared environmental responsibility reinforces relationships between brands and manufacturers. We share this common goal no one can achieve without the others. Premium Beauty News - Can you think of any other challenges related to packaging innovation? Frédéric Dreux - There is a challenge related to customization, not only in terms of delivery, but also in terms of more individualized packs. A step has been made, in particular thanks to digital printing. As for connected packaging, it will become a real trend when there is a real benefit for consumers. I do not think that this point has been reached yet. Premium Beauty News - Let's go back to sustainable packaging. Is it possible to combine ecodesign with economic performance? Frédéric Dreux - It is a mistake to oppose them. In the short and medium term, a sustainable positioning actually results in stronger economic performance. Brands with an authentic purpose grow much faster. Economic performance is related to sustainability. I am even tempted to say that if a company cannot combine them, it really takes a risk in the short or medium term. At Unilever Prestige, we see this as an opportunity. If you manage to create a premium consumer experience integrating sustainability, you develop a long-lasting model which enhances trust in the brand and removes the guilt consumers may feel when they use a product that cannot be recycled. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how do you manage this aspect for all the different brands in the group? Frédéric Dreux - There are many different ways to offer consumers sustainable experiences. Every brand in our Prestige segment remains independent and keeps their own identity: the same principles are applied differently, whether in packaging or communication. It is the same common goal, but execution is adapted to each brand. They share common points, like plastics recyclability or the use of recycled materials, but what changes is how we convey this. We also consider offering an alternative to plastic by introducing other materials, like glass, wood, metal, or other new materials emerging on the market. We need to play on all levels: these possibilities represent different sources of inspiration, so we have to use them as an innovation driver. Premium Beauty News - Among the group's brands, REN Clean Skincare is seen as a spearhead, given their strong zero waste positioning. How is that conveyed in terms of packaging? Frédéric Dreux - In our portfolio, REN Clean Skincare is an activist brand, from formulas to packaging. This zero waste positioning is a real inspiration, a guidance that provides a framework to all the decisions made by the brand, in practice and on all levels. As regards packaging, it is conveyed by a recyclability and material reuse requirement. When a brand asserts this position, it strengthens its communication arguments and does not hesitate to show it uses an important percentage of recycled materials, in particular with Ocean Plastic, despite the aspect or colour. Rather than see it as a constraint, we integrate it in the packaging design. It is also important to stay connected to trends, in particular in chemical recycling, which is accelerating. In the future, we all hope to be able to use fully transparent recycled materials for example. What we are working on does not just involve what we have, but also what we will have tomorrow. Premium Beauty News - Is the LOOP platform dedicated to zero waste, reasoned purchases one of these promising solutions? REN Clean Skincare has committed to using it. Frédéric Dreux - It is an excellent opportunity to fulfil our objective. The main way to adopt a zero waste strategy is to no longer consider packaging as waste, but as something that can be reused, without getting out of the chain. That is what LOOP offers. It is the first time we have gone that far in packaging reuse. It is an innovative packaging model: the high-end packs are sustainable, delivered, resent and refilled for our consumers. This packaging collection or reconditioning approach is aimed to reoffer the product: it helps enhance the consumer refill experience and keep the premium quality of the packs through e-commerce and home delivery. Not only does it differ from the usual waste management models, but it provides packaging with a real functionality over time. It is no longer a linear, single-use model. Premium Beauty News - Do you consider adopting this solution for the other brands in the group? Frédéric Dreux - Starting from this summer, we are going to participate to the test in real life with REN Clean Skincare. Then, the model will be enhanced based on this first experience to become self-sustainable. The keys will be things such as consumers' reactions, compliance and logistic fluidity aspects for example. If you want to give a chance to this type of model, you should not give up when the first obstacles arise, and instead push for continuous improvement. It is the sort of initiatives that can fundamentally change things."
L'Oréal partners with Gjosa to unveil eco-friendly shower and shampoo combination,"The beauty giant and the tech company have unveiled a low-flow showerhead and an easy-rinse shampoo combination that means the amount of water needed to wash the hair is significantly reduced from 8 litres to 1.5 litres. The showerhead breaks up the flow of water but counterbalances that by accelerating the speed of the droplets, while the easier-to-rinse shampoo is applied directly through the showerhead, rather than being applied to the scalp. By infusing water and shampoo simultaneously, the showerhead could cut the volume of water and the energy used in places like professional hair salons. Prototypes are currently being tested in salons in South Africa and the US. ""Initial results offer great perspectives for an innovation that visibly reduces the water consumption in our daily hygiene practices,"" said said Laurent Attal, L'Oréal VP Research & Innovation, in a statement. ""This breakthrough technology is perfectly in line with our commitments to sustainable innovation."" The move comes as fashion and beauty brands ramp up their efforts to reduce water consumption, as a potential shortage of the essential resource becomes a growing global concern. Earlier this year, Gap Inc. laid out detailed plans to reduce water wastage along its supply chain, having recently pledged to save 10 billion liters of water by the end of 2020, while fashion and lifestyle conglomerate PVH Corp., which owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, has also entered into a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to conserve water resources in Africa and India."
The consumer goods industry moves to act on plastic pollution,"Over 290 member organizations of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) signed The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with UN Environment Program, on October 29, 2018. The document aims to reduce plastic waste through a variety of targets, such as eliminating single-use plastic from supply chains and ensuring that 100 percent of plastic packaging can be easily and safely reused, recycled, or composted by 2025. L'Oréal, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate Palm olive and Unilever are three of the beauty giants to have signed the commitment, while big-name signatories from the fashion world include H&M, Burberry and Stella McCartney. Packaging producers such as Albéa, the world's leading manufacturer of packaging for the beauty industry, are also among the signatories. Others range from Nestlé and Coca-Cola Femsa to Walmart and Target, with the total list of signatories representing 20 percent of all packaging produced globally. ""We know that cleaning up plastics from our beaches and oceans is vital, but this does not stop the tide of plastic entering the oceans each year,"" said Dame Ellen MacArthur, who announced the commitment at the 'Our Ocean Conference' in Bali on 29 and 30 October 2018. ""We need to move upstream to the source of the flow. The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment draws a line in the sand, with businesses, governments and others around the world uniting behind a clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic."" Brands that have signed the commitment will report their progress every year, as targets become more ambitious. ""We are embracing the issue of packaging reform as both a challenge to do better and an opportunity to do good,"" said Alison Lewis, Global Chief Marketing Officer at Johnson & Johnson Consumer. ""We believe this initiative can be a powerful catalyst for driving meaningful changes in our behavior as a company-as well as the behavior of consumers themselves."" ""The challenge of plastic waste is real and urgent. We're committed to doing our part to ensure the plastic we need is safely and economically, reused, recycled or composted,"" added Ian Cook, Chairman and CEO of Colgate-Palmolive. The CGF members that have signed the declaration are committed to working together in three areas: packaging design, consumer engagement and recycling systems. Plastic waste is becoming a big issue for the consumer goods industry, including the cosmetics and personal care sector. At the latest Luxe Pack Monaco trade show, several packaging suppliers have showcased alternative solutions using biosourced, recycled or upcycled materials, as well as refillable packaging solutions specially designed for high-end products."
"""We have reconciled environmental performance with economic performance,"" Alexandra Palt, L'Oréal","Premium Beauty News - Why did you create SPOT, a unique assessment tool in the cosmetics industry? Alexandra Palt - We wanted to reach our 2020 goal – improving the environmental or social profile of all our products. To this aim, we assessed the change levers, but we needed an operational tool which all our brands could use on a daily basis. SPOT was designed with international experts and submitted to several stakeholders. Every product we develop is now scrutinized by this assessment tool. If it is a renewal, the environmental and social performance of the new product is compared with that of the previous product. If it is an innovation, the reference will be the average of the category of the product under development. We estimate that in seven years, 90% to 100% of all L'Oréal products will be evaluated by SPOT. In any case, we need to increase all the marks obtained. Premium Beauty News - What are your improvement areas? Alexandra Palt - We study the water footprint of the formula, its biodegradability, the content of plant-derived and sustainably sourced ingredients, but also the size, weight, shape, and materials of the packaging. Premium Beauty News - Are the first results of the ""Sharing Beauty With All"" programme encouraging? Alexandra Palt - We should achieve most of our objectives by the deadlines set across the whole programme. Some of them have already been exceeded by far. For example, we have reduced our carbon emissions by 73% compared to 2005, while the objective set was 60%, and the production volume rose by 33% over the same period. That is already exceptional. What should be highlighted is that we have completely transformed our business approach. Sustainable development is taken into account in every single strategic decision made and every time we start developing a product. It is fully integrated to how we do our job. I think that is what makes us one of the companies with the most widely recognized sustainable development performance in the world. [NB: L'Oréal is one of only two companies in the world – the only French company – out of the over 3,000 evaluated to have been awarded three ""As"" in 2017, i.e. the best score, for the rankings established by CDP, an organization aimed to study the impact of companies on climate change]. Premium Beauty News - Are consumers following the same trend as regards environmental convictions? Alexandra Palt - Consumers quickly change. Changes can already be observed, but most studies demonstrate that although people have more and more convictions and expectations in terms of sustainable development, everyone does not express them in their buying behaviours."
Henkel announces ambitious targets for sustainable packaging,"Sustainability is not new to Henkel. The consumer goods company [1] claims that all of its packaging is ""designed to meet consumers' expectations while using the least possible amount of material - and the most sustainable materials."" However, the group now aims to adopt a more holistic approach through a new strategic framework reflecting the three key phases of a circular value chain. Henkel's new sustainable packaging strategy translates each of these phases into specific actions: – Materials from sustainable sources. Henkel commits itself to including an increasing share of sustainable materials into its product packaging - this relates both to its use of recycled materials, especially recycled plastic, and renewable materials such as paper and cardboard. – Smart packaging design. According to Henkel, smart design is key to facilitate the use of recycled or renewable packaging materials. Furthermore, the group will explore innovative solutions along the entire value chain, e.g. in the field of transport packaging and related logistics. In addition, Henkel aims at continuing its efforts to reduce the amount of packaging material it uses. – Closing the loop. Henkel commits to making sure its product packaging can be recycled after the product has been consumed, e.g. by entering into partnerships to promote appropriate systems for recycling. In addition, the company wants to further explore solutions like refill systems which allow consumers to reuse packaging. Henkel is also actively searching for materials that enable packaging to be returned into nature - such as biodegradable materials that meet international composting standards. ""It is more important than ever for companies, consumers, governments and other organizations to drive progress toward a circular economy. Only by reusing and recycling as much material as possible will we be able to live well within the resource limits of our planet. This concept is at the heart of our approach to sustainable packaging,"" says Kathrin Menges, Executive Vice President Human Resources at Henkel and Chair of Henkel's Sustainability Council. ""Together with our partners along the entire value chain, we want to include materials from sustainable sources into smart designs to close the loop – for the benefit of people and the planet."" In order to further drive innovation in sustainable packaging development and promote improved recycling infrastructure, Henkel is collaborating with a variety of partners, including the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that brings stakeholders together to rethink and redesign the future of plastics and build momentum toward a circular economy, and the Plastic Bank, a social enterprise aiming to stop ocean plastic and provide opportunities for people in poverty by giving them a chance to earn money or services by removing plastic waste from their local environment."
France will list substances suspected to be harmful to coral reefs,"French Deputy Minister for Environment Brune Poirson, announced Wednesday, 1st of August, the launch of an ""Ocean Mission"" in order to tackle chemical and plastic pollutions. The project will include an inventory of the chemical substances that are particularly toxic for marine ecosystems and coral reefs while being present in consumer products such as cosmetics, sunscreens or detergents. The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) will take over responsibility for identifying the substances of greatest concern and ""proposing appropriate regulatory measures."" Les coraux représentent 1% de la surface des océans mais abritent 25% des espèces marines.

Biodiversity: measuring actions & raising consumer awareness,"To talk about these projects, Laurent Boillot, CEO of Guerlain, and Sandrine Sommer, CSR & Sustainable Development Director, gathered Stéphane d'Halluin, Project Manager Sustainable Development and External Relations at Botanic, Karine Viel, Sustainable Development/CSR Director of Monoprix, and Cécile Joucan, Environmental Officer at LVMH. All speakers wanted to emphasize the voluntary nature of their commitment, born from a specific need within their own companies. ""For Guerlain, it is just obvious we should take care of biodiversity. Without bees, there are no flowers, and without flowers, there are no perfumes,"" Sandrine Sommer highlighted. As soon as he took office, Laurent Boillot implemented a business strategy based on four main aspects: climate, eco-design, biodiversity, and social and societal impacts. The brand uses measuring tools to assess the impact of its actions, like packaging reduction, by developing a refillable bottle or delivering products with a 100% electric truck aptly named ""Le Bourdon"" (""The Bumblebee""). In terms of sustainable development, measuring and traceability tools tend to get more and more widely used at LVMH. As part of eco-design approaches, it helps validate the relevance of the materials chosen, like organic cotton, or check the origin of raw materials. At Botanic, the fourth network of garden centres in France, this commitment is focused on traceability. To better control supplies, the company choses French suppliers whenever possible for their horticulture products. They got involved about ten years ago, following an NGO warning about the hazard of some pesticides in their range. From then on, thanks to the support of the company's family structure, Botanic turned to naturalness, despite a significant loss of turnover at the beginning. Again, Botanic uses measuring tools to assess the impact of their products. The brand also holds the Plante Bleue certificate (horticulture). Monoprix's commitment to biodiversity mainly concerns food: organic foodstuffs represent about 9% of sales, thanks to key decisions like choice editing, i.e. stop distributing ""dubious"" products. Just like eggs from hens kept in battery cages, which Monoprix has no longer referenced since 2016. The suppliers involved in the Cultiv'acteurs programme or holding the Bee Friendly label are also rewarded. As regards communication, Guerlain favours a didactic approach, by raising awareness of their environmental commitment among their consumers in store. ""We explain why we choose such or such ingredient for our products and how we cultivate them, like honey from Ouessant, for example,"" Sandrine Sommer explains. Botanic adopted the same strategy. ""When we reviewed our charter and range, we lost a few customers at first, because they did not like the fact that they could no longer find some of their usual products. So, we focused on our sales teams' training to better explain our strategy to our consumers,"" Stéphane d'Halluin recalls. At Monoprix, we believe this issue is not really relevant, because consumers are increasingly more concerned about what ends up in their dishes. Instead, we aim to raise consumer awareness of the technical aspect of production. Today, it is essential to strengthen bonds between scientific and social expertise, as well as companies' expertise, so as to preserve our biodiversity – just like it is fundamental to officially communicate on that issue. Bees are a strong symbol, because they are sort of our ecosystem's umbrella. If we protect them, we also protect ourselves."
Why are luxury brands so discreet about their sustainable commitments?,"Premium Beauty News - Why do the luxury brands that have long implemented a CSR strategy with tangible actions and results put so little emphasis on it for their consumers? Gildas Bonnel - That is what we, at the agency, call 'green hiding'. It should be understood that in a few sectors, and it is particularly true for luxury, companies would like to avoid the scourge of criticism. For communicators, the most widely shared feeling is that there are more attacks to be feared than benefits to be expected when you put forward this progressive approach. That being said, things are changing. A new offering is arriving, in particular on the beauty market. The new value proposal with simpler ranges and products and the strong commitment to social and environmental issues result in a few Maisons and major brands fearing they might look old hat and miss a powerful societal trend. That is why I give the following advice: when a company is ready, when there is actual evidence of the management, objectives, and roadmap to reduce social and environmental impacts, I am the first to recommend going for it. I have much encouraged Maison Guerlain to communicate on their sustainable development policy, because there is a real expectation among the different publics. In addition, communication puts companies in tension. When you communicate, you get involved. You cannot go back, you can only go forward and meet your own challenges. It is always risky to make changes or reforms. What was done by Guerlain for Orchidée Impériale – with a 40% packaging volume and weight reduction – was really brave. Innovation and communication paid off and customers were convinced by the proposal: they did not turn their backs on the product, quite the contrary. Communication is what helps lead the way and get everyone involved, both employees and customers. Premium Beauty News - How can you speak up on these issues when you are a prestigious historic brand? Gildas Bonnel - For us, these are issues we should discreetly talk about with customers and opinion leaders, rather than creating whole ad campaigns. It is a 'long term' strategy based on more influence, encounters, and interventions of the CEO. It corresponds to luxury companies perfectly well. They do not want to be ostentatious and preach doctrines: they prefer to work on these issues in depth with those that make the opinion. Premium Beauty News - Is it not dangerous to play this long-term card when it all goes so fast? Gildas Bonnel - Not if you work on the substance… if, meanwhile, the company is on a war footing and, like Guerlain, if it is building up a strategy and sincere and relevant communication elements. Premium Beauty News - Should these big luxury names not set the example? Gildas Bonnel - There is a great ambivalence on the market, which is why it can be so difficult for brands to work out these transitions. As can be seen in their declarations, consumers are ready for many changes, but at the same time, they do not want to be rushed, even the most involved. So, it is important to take it one step at a time and not get ahead of ourselves. However, these companies should think about more disruptive offerings, as Guerlain did by incubating with ethic brand Cha Ling. The thread is thin, it is all about balance and will."
Refillable perfumes: new luxury & responsible gesture?,"Mugler, and now Louis Vuitton, Guerlain, Viktor&Rolf, By Kilian… several big names of the luxury world have been taking over the concept of ""parfum ressourçable"" (refillable perfume) to provide the product with an additional value and revive the bottle aura. Loïc Bouet, Customer Service Manager of Techniplast, the French plastic part specialist that created several refill solutions, confirms this trend. ""We work a lot with many luxury brands, like those belonging to the LVMH and L'Oréal groups – they are very interested in our systems. All luxury brands can feel the growing demand for reducing the environmental impact on all levels. There is work done upstream on the manufacturing chain, but also downstream, on the level of the final user, by making it possible to no longer throw away their bottles,"" he says. Just like the food industry, the perfume and cosmetics market has been studying refill solutions from the eco-design standpoint. In addition, alcohol-based perfumes, which are hardly concerned by bacterial contamination issues, are actually suitable for several consecutive refills. However, ressourçage mainly involves refilling the bottle by unscrewing the pump, and the problem is that most products are packed with a pump fastened on the bottle neck. Once closed, you cannot reopen the bottle and refill it. That is why manufacturers have been working on new solutions. Distribution systems specialist Aptar Beauty+Home has noticed a return to more flexible solutions. ""Systematically or almost, major brands ask us to create a version of their range with pumps that can be disassembled. The idea is either to make the bottle refillable, or to be able to separate the pump from the bottle, so that the product can be appropriately recycled. We have been working on new topics,"" explains Patrick Bousquel, Director Market Development of Aptar Beauty+Home. Other than their RT Lift, RT Twist, and spout tip systems to refill perfume bottles fitted with screw necks, Techniplast also developed a unique, patented technology called RT Plug to deal with the problem of set pumps and make it possible to fill in all types of bottles, even those with a pump that cannot be unscrewed. The idea is to place the bottle to be refilled upside down on the source, so that the pump is in the open position. A small engine controlled by an electronic card increases the pressure in the refill bottle positioned below 0.5 bar. This pressure helps transfer the perfume through a tube network from the refill to the customer bottle. The concept seduced the Louis Vuitton development team, as they selected it for their fragrance line launched in 2016. ""It is part of the Vuitton high-end product philosophy. The product is not thrown away, it is kept because it is a Vuitton product. We have provided a solution to be able to keep this beautiful object, which can be personalized and carved to revive its importance,"" adds Loïc Bouet. Although it is still rare, the perfume source concept does have several advantages, including that of restoring the value of the bottle, which reflects the luxury of the product, and which most consumers are reluctant to throw away. ""We are definitely in line with the luxury codes. When you throw something away, you pollute, and there is nothing elegant about that, which is all the more true for perfumes. The ressourçable bottle is an opportunity to revive the object's magnitude. At Pochet, we deeply believe in this, so we have been working on the notion of a 'different luxury',"" confirms Isabelle Lallemant, International Marketing & Innovation Director of the glassmaking group. Gildas Bonnel, President of the Sidièse agency specialized in responsible communication and consulting for Guerlain, also emphasizes the importance of the customer relationship built up with this strategy. ""Luxury codes are much more interesting in the sales rituals than in the overabundance of the material. Guerlain offer their customers to appropriate and personalize this very beautiful Abeille bottle, which is part of the brand's history, and then refill it at the store perfume fountain. It is all about the customer's huge interest in living a new experience. There is something much more exclusive and personalized about it, which corresponds to luxury codes,"" he explains. Whatever the method, a fountain or a refill fitted with a spout tip, the solution consisting in refilling bottles in perfume stores also significantly impacts the niche perfumery market popular for its alternative market approach. ""Brands have an opportunity to invent a different luxury world, refresh its codes and communication, and find new concepts to differentiate themselves,"" concludes Patrick Bousquel."
Garnier partners with TerraCycle and DoSomething to promote recycling of beauty plastic wastes,"Mandy Moore and Garnier are on a mission to cut down the amount of beauty packaging that ends up in landfills. The ""This Is Us"" actress and singer-songwriter and the beauty giant have teamed up with the organizations DoSomething.org and TerraCycle on a campaign to encourage young beauty fans to recycle their bathroom empties. Dubbed ""Rinse, Recycle, Repeat,"" the campaign provides information about how to separate personal hygiene products so that they can be properly recycled. Garnier is offering participants special bathroom recycling bins that they can decorate in their own style, sharing photos of their efforts for the chance to win a US$5,000 scholarship. Once the bins have been filled, beauty buffs will be able to print off a free shipping label to send off the empties to be responsibly recycled by TerraCycle. According to Garnier, nearly half of Americans do not recycle their beauty and personal care products, which is why they account for a significant amount of waste found in landfills. ""Beauty and personal care products with a number #1 or #2 on the packaging can be recycled through curbside recycling programs, but many beauty products cannot. Items such as flexible tubes, caps, pumps for shampoo bottles, lipstick, eyeliner and many others cannot be recycled curbside and must be separated. This year's national campaign will focus on educating participants on the proper way to recycle by giving them recycling tips on what can and cannot be recycled. The campaign will also showcase best practices to identify recyclable items, such as checking the numbers on packaging before tossing it out,"" explains the brand in a release. On April 1st, a college competition will kick off on 50 college campuses nationwide to collect the most beauty empties. The college team that collects the most empties by April 30 will be rewarded with a garden for their community furnished by Garnier and TerraCycle. Last year, Union College won the 2017 Rinse, Recycle, Repeat College Competition. The team was awarded a Garnier Green Garden planted in their local community of Lincoln, Nebraska. Launched in 2011, the Garnier Beauty Recycling Program in partnership with TerraCycle - the world's leader in the collection and repurposing of hard-to-recycle post-consumer waste - has diverted more than 10 million empties from landfills. These empties have been turned into pelletized plastic lumber for raised garden beds, benches, trash receptacles and other elements for community parks, playgrounds and gardens in Nebraska, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio and New York."
Metsä Board innovates with an ever more sustainable gift box,"Initially unveiled at the last Luxe Pack show in Monaco, the new version of Metsä Board's Skincare Box was presented in detail in Paris during the PCD 2018 show. Created by Metsä Board's packaging design team, the new SkinCare 2.0 gift box demonstrates a more environmentally friendly packaging design through the use of lighter weight paperboard materials and the elimination of the plastic wrap. In addition, each box design offers a unique opening and reclosing experience combined with maximum runnability performance on automated packaging lines. ""The number of people in this planet is growing – by 2030 we will be 8.5 billion. Simultaneously, the number of products and packaging put on the market is growing too. As a consequence, plastic waste is becoming a major issue. According to a report published last year by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish measured by weight,"" explained Cyril Drouet, Metsä Board's Design & Innovation Director. As a pioneer in lightweight paperboard, Metsä Board intends to help its customer to address these new challenges. The first innovation of the SkinCare 2.0 gift box can be seen with the outer rigid box which is made with a new pulp moulding process - especially designed for Metsä Fibre's pure fresh fibre pulp. The inner fitment is made of a plastic-like polymer derived from wood and sugar cane fibres for a 100% recyclable packaging. This method offers an alternative to conventional thermoformed plastic providing a sustainable and fully biodegradable solution. The lid, base and inner inserts are extremely rigid, lightweight and smooth on both sides. This new method allows for good printing results; the lid and base are printed with water based ink, providing a natural and soft touch feel. The window cut-out on the lid partially shows the contents. For this new edition Metsä Board decided not to use a removable plastic window ensuring that this solution only uses one material. Beyond the rigid gift box, Mestä Board also investigated innovation avenues for secondary packaging and made three proposals: – The first inner box offers an innovative opening experience, without compromising the assembly on conventional fast packing lines. The pack opens when a small amount of pressure is applied at the front, breaking the perforations and allowing the lid to gently slide out. The inner linerboard base slowly unfolds giving a unique consumer experience typically seen on high-end rigid boxes. According to Metsä Board, these new features combined with light-weighted material result in a 25% packaging reduction compared with a traditional design. – The second packaging structure is completely sealed on the top and bottom eliminating the need for a security label or plastic wrap whilst it is displayed on a shop shelf. The box opens by a small press on the front that breaks the tamper evident perforations and slowly unfolds. The lid can also be reclosed to its original position. – The third box structure features a simplified half-cut opening mechanism. According to Metsä Board, these features and raw material light-weighting have resulted in a 30% reduction in packaging content compared with a traditional design. ""For more than 150 years, rigid boxes have been successfully employed in merchandising high-end products, including jewellery, cosmetics and spirits. As luxury brands are increasing their digital presence, more and more rigid boxes are travelling directly to consumer's doors. It is therefore more important than ever to offer innovative sustainable solutions,"" concludes Cyril Drouet."
"Guerlain, luxury cosmetics flag-bearer for sustainable development","Premium Beauty News - In 2007, luxury and sustainable development hardly worked hand in hand. How was this initiative born? Sandrine Sommer - It was born from a strong-willed man, Laurent Boillot, who had just taken over Maison Guerlain. Sustainable commitment was mainly a personal belief. But beyond that, sustainable development definitely had to be an integral part of the company's strategy to develop, pass on, and preserve Guerlain's heritage. Premium Beauty News - Protection of bees (they are the Maison's emblem), biodiversity, climate, eco-design, social responsibility… your commitment is global and you have already made very concrete achievements, like the new Orchidée Impériale pack lightened by 60%. After 10 years, what are your greatest satisfactions? Sandrine Sommer - Internal mobilization and involvement, first. From the very beginning, we implemented an efficient collaborative organization with a ""sustainable development"" steering committee composed of 18 people from every department in the company. For sustainable development to be a project on the level of the whole company, with a real will to change and the right structure to do it, and for our employees to be the best ambassadors, it was essential for me to have all trades involved and get one referent per department. In addition, I am very proud of having brought up to date the Abeille bottles, making them indefinitely refillable, thanks to our perfume fountains. To me, the perfumer Guerlain concept embodies sustainable luxury. And we have great ambitions to gradually deploy the concept. Premium Beauty News - What are your objectives for 2020? Sandrine Sommer - There are many of them, but they can be grouped into four main challenges: biodiversity preservation. We already work with sustainable sourcing players for Guerlain's iconic raw materials. Also, we have made a lot of efforts for bee protection, in particular on Brittany's Île d'Ouessant, and we are now developing our projects on the global level. The second challenge for us is ecodesign. It is probably one of the most complex. The idea is to make things as, or even more beautiful, while preserving the planet's resources. We aim for 100% of our new products to be ecodesigned by 2020. Then, as far as climate is concerned, we have committed to reduce our CO2 emissions by half compared to 2007, for example by choosing maritime transport. Lastly, as regards social responsibility, definitely one of our own priorities, we support a global association dedicated to self-esteem: Look Good Feel Better. They offer women receiving cancer treatment free beauty workshops in hospitals. By 2020, we would like to be able to support them in all countries where Guerlain has settled. Premium Beauty News - How did the transition go with your suppliers? Sandrine Sommer - We worked together with the LVMH Perfume & Cosmetics branch to develop a responsible purchasing charter and define a number of guidelines that would help us make progress. The charter was co-set up with steering suppliers and is used as a working basis to go forward together, that was most important. Premium Beauty News - How did you make the notions of environmental protection and luxury match? Sandrine Sommer - They are not incompatible, there are actually matching elements between luxury and sustainable development that are almost natural, even consubstantial, in particular the notions of long periods of time, of the selection of rare and precious raw materials that require protection, or of know-how that needs to be passed on… On the contrary, it can be difficult to communicate, because we are aware of the fact that we are not exemplary yet – no one is. It is an issue on which we have been innovating on a daily basis. Many luxury companies have been working for a long time on this, but they do not make it public that much. Guerlain has only just started, but we still want to keep humble and sincere in how we do it. It is a continuous improvement process, a long, step-by-step building process, without compromising on the quality and prestige perceived with luxury houses. The ""green"" vision of sustainable development is behind us now. It is time to highlight beautiful, sustainable innovations to reconcile both. That is what the challenge involves. Premium Beauty News - Is your public ready to hear these arguments? Sandrine Sommer - The luxury public is getting increasingly sensitive to this. To our customers, it is just obvious, as long as you are a luxury brand, you should do things well. It is up to us to go farther and anticipate their questions and aspirations. For example, we have communicated on our rare, natural materials for long. Today, we are going further, by putting an emphasis on our commitment to protect biodiversity in light of these rare ecosystems. We have a prescribing, training role: it is up to us to raise customer awareness. Premium Beauty News - How are you going to communicate on this issue? Sandrine Sommer - Every year, we organize two events at Guerlain Champs-Élysées to put forward committed men and women. These players work on Sustainable Development on a daily basis. They come to share their experiences with a concerned public, my counterparts from different companies and industries, associations, all our stakeholders… It is a different way to communicate, but we do believe in the pollination of ideas and the strength of committed networks."
Is wood the future of plastic?,"Thanks to their structure, very similar to a polymer, for several years, tree fibres have been the subject of several researches aiming at using them as a substitute to many oiled-sourced plastic polymers. Contrary to other bioplastics, polymers derived from wood fibres have the advantage of not competing - or hardly - with food productions. These researches are now finding their earliest applications. Neopac's PICEA Wood Tube, partially made from forest-derived materials was already known. At Luxe Pack Monaco 2017, the Switzerlan-based flexible tube specialist showcased an enhanced version where the quantity of renewable material content was increased both on the body and shoulders, without altering the packaging radiance. This new recyclable model is Ecocert-certified. Finland's Metsä Board showcased a new version of their Skincare Box with a plastic-looking fitment made with a polymer derived from wood and sugar cane fibres for a 100% recyclable packaging. Eventually, Stora Enso displayed on their stand the Sulapac plastic-like jars. Sulapac is a Finnish start-up they selected as part of their Accelerator Programme. Entirely made of wood and natural binders, wholly derived from Finnish forests' renewable resources, the packaging can be made using standard injection moulding, extrusion, and blow moulding techniques, with the same design possibilities as what plastic offers. If the barrier properties are different, they can be enhanced with adapted coating. The material is water and oil-resistant. Thanks to its small carbon footprint, it is an environmentally-friendly product that also offers reduced costs when compared to bioplastics. LuxePack Monaco 2017 - Show Report For an overview of the main innovations showcased at LuxePack Monaco 2017, PremiumBeautynews offers you a detailed report of the trade show.

"Sustainability: Three questions to Chris Sayner, Croda","Premium Beauty News - The range of green materials for cosmetic and personal care products is widening. What are the main challenges regarding sustainability and safety? Chris Sayner - The consensus from the Climate Change Conference in France (December 2015) was to reduce the Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG) by 50% by 2050 in order to keep Global warming to less than 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The chemical industry has a major part to play in meeting this objective including moving from petroleum based to renewable materials. In Croda we report GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) indicator EN1 measuring the percentage of renewable raw material used. We are in the 60-70% range whereas many companies are under 10%. The drive for sustainability in Personal Care Ingredients is essentially all things environmental: reducing carbon footprint, water, waste, increased renewable raw materials and use of non-fossil fuel energy, greater efficiency of products in use and sustainable raw material supply. Sustainable raw material supply really focusses on renewable vs petrochemical and of course the sustainability credentials of the renewable raw materials, palm being a current focus. Premium Beauty News - How can sustainability be assessed and compared? Chris Sayner - Most companies issue a sustainable summary report each year. Big cosmetic companies are interested in reduction of energy and waste, an increase of renewable ingredients and social accountability. We focus on the twelve Principles of Green Chemistry to assist in reducing our impact on the environment. We invested a lot in our plant in Delaware sourcing landfill gas from municipal waste to furnish us with 60% -70% renewable energy. Premium Beauty News - In your opinion, what are the main avenues for innovation in the green ingredients field? Chris Sayner - Increased use of Bio based, renewable and sustainable raw materials for ingredient manufacture, as well as bio fermentation, which is incremental to new development."
L'Oréal: Sustainability targets change the way products are designed,"The results published by L'Oréal in the 2016 Sharing Beauty With All Progress Report reveal an in-depth transformation brought about by the group's sustainability efforts. ""The Sharing Beauty With All programme has brought about substantial lasting changes in the way we design, produce, communicate and distribute our products,"" says Jean-Paul Agon, CEO of the L'Oréal Group. Launched in 2013, the Sharing Beauty With All programme summarises L'Oréal's commitments in terms of sustainable development from the conception of products to their distribution, including the production process or the sourcing of ingredients. Every year, L'Oréal communicates and provides figures with regard to its progress. By reducing the emissions of its plants and distribution centres by 67%, in absolute terms, from a 2005 baseline, L'Oréal has exceeded its target of a -60% reduction in CO2 emissions, four years ahead of schedule, while increasing its production by 29% during the same period. Furthermore, by the end of 2016, the Group counts 15 industrial sites that have achieved carbon neutrality. By 2020, L'Oréal is committed to improve the environmental or social profile of 100% of its new or renovated products. This commitment concerns all L'Oréal brands and 82% of the products launched in 2016 (vs 74% in 2015) already show such an improvement. Some of the new products launched in 2016 demonstrate levels of biodegradability exceeding 98%, such as, for example the shampoos and conditioners of the new Biolage R.A.W. range, or the Garnier Ultra Doux 5 Plants shampoo. ""At the halfway mark of our 2020 ambitions, we are going to redouble our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint and reach our targets, particularly in terms of sustainable production and innovation"", says Alexandra Palt, Chief Sustainability Officer."
"After France, the UK announces plans to ban plastic microbeads in cosmetics","UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) has confirmed plans to ban the sale and manufacture of cosmetics and personal care products containing tiny pieces of plastic, commonly known as 'microbeads'. ""Adding plastic to products like face washes and body scrubs is wholly unnecessary when harmless alternatives can be used. This is the next step in tackling microplastics in our seas (…) and I look forward to working with industry and environmental groups. This government is committed to its promise to be the first generation ever to leave the environment in a better state than it inherited, and together we can bring an end to these harmful plastics clogging up our oceans,"" said Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom. A consultation will launch later this year. This announcement follows the ban of plastic microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics by the French Law on Biodiversity adopted last July. The ban will enter into force on January 2018. [1] Both initiatives are part of an international movement to ban microplastic beads. For that reason, some companies started to move away from plastic microbeads in cosmetic products and in October last year the cosmetics industry across Europe took the collective decision to remove, as of 2020, plastic microbeads from products where they may reach the marine environment. In reality, the industry's removal of plastic microbeads is progressing quickly and is likely to be completed well ahead of the recommended deadline. L'Oréal, for instance, recently announced that 80% of its products have been reformulated and that 100% of their rinsed off products will be reformulated by the end of 2016, ahead of their forecasts. Eventually, it is not impossible that these national bans, will be useless as plastic microbeads will already have been phased out ahead of their entry into force. According to the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the UK cosmetics industry alone has already achieved a 70% reduction in the use of plastic microbeads in personal care products and their use will be virtually zero by the end of 2018."
Consumers expect more from companies regarding biodiversity,"More and more people are aware of biodiversity. If credible information and reputable brands are available, consumers are ready to purchase biodiversity-friendly products and contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. These are among the latest insights of the Biodiversity Barometer, an annual survey of the Union for Ethical Biotrade (UEBT) on biodiversity awareness among consumers and leading beauty, food and beverage companies around the world. [1] UEBT research shows that consumers would like to contribute to biodiversity conservation, but most don't yet know how to go about it. They expect companies to respect people and biodiversity, but are currently far from confident that appropriate measures are being taken. Consumers want to receive more information, and could be convinced by the reputation of a brand as well as authentic, externally verified stories. ""We see both a clear responsibility and opportunity for companies. Natural ingredient supply chains can be turned into positive agents of change, promoting actions that restore biodiversity and promote local development. This implies a significant challenge, of course, as it requires a paradigm shift and a true commitment to ethical sourcing, but it can be done. A few companies, including UEBT members, have already taken up the challenge and are leading the way"", says Rik Kutsch Lojenga, UEBT Executive Director. According to the UEBT, the beauty sector offers some inspiring examples of how companies can put their supply chains to work for people and biodiversity, and UEBT research shows consumers begin to recognize this. For instance, Natura Cosmetics, a Brazilian multinational that is widely recognized for their commitment to sustainability, has pioneered sourcing with respect of biodiversity for many years. Natura makes sustainable use of the Amazon's biodiversity and actively contributes to local development, something that is verified independently by UEBT. The natural cosmetics company Weleda is another good example. Just recently, Weleda was awarded the Swiss Ethics Award for their engagement with UEBT and their commitment to promoting ethical sourcing practices along all their natural ingredient supply chains. Also beyond UEBT, companies are acting. For instance, The Body Shop, which is also mentioned by consumers in the UEBT survey, recently launched a new global CSR Commitment, Enrich Not Exploit, with a pledge to enrich the planet, its biodiversity and resources."
"""The Amazon's biodiversity is a strategic area of research,"" Eder Leopoldo Ramos, Symrise","Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose the Amazon region to build Symrise's new plant in Brazil? Eder Leopoldo Ramos - As you certainly know, the Amazon region possesses one of the world's largest biodiversity reservoirs and thus offers a rich source of raw materials for companies within the fragrance and cosmetics industry. Symrise considers biodiversity as both a key area of concern for the future and a key factor of success in the cosmetics industry. Ecoparque, the industrial and ecological park where we built our new plant, is an initiative of Brazilian cosmetics giant Natura. We were their first partners in this project. They inspired us with their compelling vision that sourcing ingredients from the Amazon's rich biodiversity could allow us to offer great innovations to our customers while, at the same time, bringing economic and social development to the region. This is why we transferred our entire botanical production in Brazil to this new production unit. This is also a way to expand our research into new natural ingredients and to diversify our portfolio of fragrance ingredients. Premium Beauty News - How does the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) support Symrise in this project? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - When sourcing natural ingredients, sustainability, ethics and regulatory compliance are key challenges — in particular when sourcing from environmentally sensitive areas such as the Amazon region. Companies are interested in the world's biodiversity, which means carefully addressing issues such as environment preservation and the rights and livelihoods of local communities. The role of UEBT is to help them in these areas. In Brazil, we are also working with companies such as Beraca, Natura and Solabia. As far as Symrise is concerned, UEBT certified ingredients sourced from 14 supplier communities based in the Brazilian Amazon. We used the internationally recognised Ethical BioTrade standard, which addresses the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the sourcing area and recognizes the role of provider communities through equitable prices and local projects for sustainable development. Eder Leopoldo Ramos - Sourcing natural ingredients is a challenge. And each ingredient is different. In this context, UEBT is a good partner for us. The UEBT helps to independently secure our supply chain and to be sure that we comply with the rules on ABS (Access and Benefit-sharing) and the principles of the United Nation's Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources. The industry is moving towards sustainability; in particular as natural ingredients are becoming key growth drivers. A few months ago, for instance, we bought Pinova, a U.S. supplier of fragrance, oral care and food ingredients from natural and renewable sources such as roots and tree stumps, orange oils and paper production by-products. UEBT helps us to address all the challenges linked to this natural trend. Premium Beauty News - What are the main challenges you face on the way to ethical sourcing of biodiversity? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - It is not easy to change the way business practices. Policies and processes in place are always difficult to modify. There are technical challenges to overcome in ensuring ethical practices. More than anything, though, it is really a paradigm shift – or perhaps more clearly stated: a change in mindset. This may seem formidable, but it is an opportunity to build something new, something better. More and more companies are seeing the value and business case for ethical sourcing of biodiversity. And the great thing is, that once the mindset has changed and the notion of ethical sourcing of biodiversity is integrated into the company, it becomes logical to work in a more innovative, inclusive and positive manner."
German glass industry compares the environmental impact of glass and plastic cosmetic jars,"Cosmetic jars made of plastic are increasingly used by cosmetic brands in the low price segment, where they are appreciated for their low cost, but also in the high-end segment, as technology now allows producing heavy jars with thick walls and more luxury external features. In order to evaluate the respective environmental impacts of both materials, BV Glas, the Federal Association of the German Glass Industry, committed the Wuppertal Institute to analyse four standard cream jars available on the German market with a filling volume of 50 ml. ""There was actually no public studies available on the environmental impact of cosmetic jars,"" says Dr. Johann Overath, Director General of BV Glas. The project team thus performed a life cycle analysis (including the following phases: extraction and processing of raw materials, production of jars, transport and secondary packaging, end-of-life, recycling) of both heavy and lightweight jars (and their lids). The content of the jar - face cream - and the filling of the jar were not addressed in the study. The results show that the lightweight glass and plastic jars are similar in terms of the material footprint, while the glass jar has a slightly better carbon footprint. However, the carbon footprint of the heavy glass jar is almost a third lower than the carbon footprint of the heavy plastic jar. Both systems have a similar material footprint. Results are primarily influenced by the weight of the jar but the weight of the lid also plays a role. The main conclusion of such results is that while lightweight plastic and glass cosmetic jars have similar environmental impacts, it is highly ineffective - in terms of sustainability - to produce heavyweight plastic jars that imitate the aesthetic characteristics of glass. However, the Wuppertal Institute notes that several additional factors may impact the final results. For instance, decorated glass jars have higher material and carbon footprints than non-decorated glass jars, and the results for plastic jars are influenced by the type of plastic used, polypropylene (PP) has a much lower footprint than styrene acrylonitrile (SAN). In addition, the energy mix of the country of production impacts the results. ""The use of a German, European or company-specific energy mix in production makes a significant difference for both plastic and glass jars,"" explains Holger Rohn, who was in charge of the survey at the Wuppertal Institute. The institute based its analysis on glass jars produced by German glass-plants and plastic jars formed in Germany from basic materials produced in Europe."
Murumuru seeds: A cosmetic ingredient that helps preserve the Amazonian rain forest,"In the heart of the Amazon jungle, Alexandre Amaral da Silva stoops and picks handfuls of light brown seeds about an inch long from the tropical undergrowth. The murumuru seeds grow on palm trees up to 15 meters (50 feet) high. The seeds will put precious cash in the pockets of people like Alexandre, while providing a prized ingredient for cosmetics companies that used their byproducts in haircare and makeup products. The seed-gathering outpost of Providencia was founded 20 years ago in one of the remotest parts of Brazil. A few wooden huts in the middle of the jungle, it lies a three-hour boat ride up the Jurua river from the town of Carauari (25,000 inhabitants), some 700 kilometers (435 miles) from Manaus, the capital of Amazona (North). Crowds of children flock to the sandy shore to meet arriving boats. Alexandre waits until the seeds ripen and fall to the ground to harvest them. Then his wife Maria Terezinha gets to work, crushing them one by one with a hammer, removing the shells and keeping the hearts in a sack. The gatherers sell the seeds to a local cooperative. At a factory in the jungle, the cooperative processes them into the palm oil prized by beauty companies because it melts into damaged hair to repair it and make it silky. For fifteen years, the families who live on the banks of the Jurua river have improved their income with the sale of the murumuru seeds. A family like theirs can make the equivalent of up to US $460 a year to boost the income they gain from gathering other products. Official statistics show average per capita income is about BRL 2,200 US (about US $660 at the current exchange rate) a year in Carauari. Brazilian beauty giant Natura, one of the main users of murumuru seeds, currently works with some 400 families in the Medio Jurua reserve, where little more than half the people know how to read and write, according to research by Natura. The company provides training and investment for processing murumuru and other seed oil products such as andiroba and ucuuba. Without big businesses, ""there are many production chains in the Amazon that would disappear"", says Carlos Koury, director of the Amazon Conservation and Sustainable Development Institute, a non-government organization. The murumuru gatherers are part of ""a traditional production chain that would struggle to survive without a powerful ally such as Natura."" The region was once a major rubber producer but that industry declined and locals turned mostly to gathering cassava and fishing. The support that cosmetics companies provides to Amazonian communities helps them to get additional income sources from the rainforest products and contributes greatly to encourage forest preservation. A hot issue at present times."
Cosmetics Europe recommends cosmetics makers to cease using plastic micro particles,"""In adopting this Recommendation, Cosmetics Europe and its membership are addressing public concerns, and committing to work with regulators on a science based approach to the issue of plastic micro particles. We are also committed to building, with other international associations, global alignment of the cosmetics industry on this issue,"" said Loïc Armand, President of Cosmetics Europe. The occurrence and persistence of plastic debris in the marine environment and waterways is an issue of increasing public debate. In the US, Illinois, New Jersey and California [1] have already adopted regulations to ban the use of plastic microbeads in personal care products. Several other states are debating similar legislations and Canada has pledge to regulate the use of plastic micro-particules in cosmetics. In parallel, many companies, from SMEs to multinationals, including individual member companies of Cosmetics Europe such as Unilever or L'Oréal, have publicly stated that they would discontinue those uses in cosmetics that are most likely to end up in the aquatic environment and for which alternatives exist. Thus, Cosmetics Europe's recommendation to discontinue the use in wash-off cosmetic products placed on the market as of 2020 of synthetic, solid plastic particles used for exfoliating and cleansing that are non-biodegradable in the marine environment, is certainly no surprise for the trade community. With this recommendation, Cosmetics Europe aims to engage its membership and to facilitate sector wide best environmental practice. However, the personal care association considers that ""although often highlighted in the context of marine litter debate, the use of solid plastic micro particles in cosmetic and personal care products is considered to be a limited source of pollution compared to others."" According to the trade association, ""the vast majority of small plastic particles in the seas come from the breakdown of bigger plastic materials."" Cosmetics Europe therefore says it is committed to working in partnership with the European authorities to gather scientific data to allow a further assessment of the issue. ""This knowledge will facilitate scientific decision making and prioritise measures that will result in a true benefit for the environment by reducing the amount of plastic litter in the marine environment."""
"""Sustainable development is a long-term strategic challenge"", Cécile Tuil, Albéa","Premium Beauty News - When did the Albéa Group start formalizing its social and environmental commitment? Cécile Tuil - Our first sustainable development programme dates back to a bit more than 10 years, when major cosmetics brands started structuring around this issue. Albéa evolved with its customers. We define the framework, objectives, and priorities approximately every five years to try and make progress. Premium Beauty News - What are the main lines and objectives of this programme? Cécile Tuil - Our new road map comprises four pillars for the 2015-2020 period: our operations, our products, our employees and the communities, our suppliers and partners. We define ambitions and objectives for each pillar. As for the ""employee and communities"" pillar, our priorities are safety and well-being, commitment and integration, involvement within the communities. For the ""product"" pillar, it is eco-design, safety and regulatory compliance, and secondary packaging. For the ""operations"" pillar, it is ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification for all our sites, reduction of our energy and water consumption, and reduction of our CO2 emissions and volatile organic compounds. Lastly, our priorities for the ""suppliers and partners"" pillar focus on compliance with social and environmental legislation, green innovation, and solidarity sourcing. As we developed our commitment, we structured it in the form of concrete ambitions with well-identified priorities, and the will for all this to give us increasingly concrete results. However, this programme is not hierarchical in its implementation: we try to make all our employees get involved according to their specific needs on the local level. Each site defines their own priority actions as part of the road map. This is our version of the ""think global, act local"" vision. Premium Beauty News - What do your customers expect in this field? Cécile Tuil - Our commitment is not directly related to our customers' expectations, as their priorities and programmes are extremely different. Albéa's leaders, starting with François Luscan, our CEO, believe sustainable development is a long-term strategic challenge. A company that endeavours to reduce its environmental footprint and improve its social impact on a daily basis simply tries to support the challenges humanity is facing on its own level and, de facto, works on strengthening its competitiveness. As for our customers in the cosmetics industry, some have developed grids for measuring the performance of their suppliers. But each customer has its own criteria and priorities. For example, L'Oréal has strong expectations in terms of Solidarity Sourcing. Some customers are mainly interested in the eco-design of products and require eco-designed or lighter packaging. Others have started buying PCR tubes [1]. We have also found there are more and more social audits conducted on our sites. By contrast, right now, only a small number of our customers take into account their suppliers' carbon footprint, but we are getting ready for this, as some of its associated objectives will be included in our 2015-2020 road map."
Biodiversity: Only few companies really succeed in convincing consumers,"In 2015, an average of 69% respondents in nine countries say they have heard of biodiversity, according to IPSOS research conducted for the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) among 9,000 persons in Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, France, India, Mexico, Netherlands, UK and USA. Growth in awareness on biodiversity is rising in general, with Millennials showing a particularly high degree of awareness. Over 80% of consumers expect companies to respect biodiversity, would like to receive information on such efforts and would be more interested in buying a product if they knew it respected biodiversity. Deeper analysis shows that younger generations are particularly aware of biodiversity, as well as interested in contributing to its conservation. UEBT surveys show that same holds true for consumers in emerging markets such as Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and China. However, only 42% of consumers trust that companies are respecting biodiversity! ""As consumers grow more aware, opportunities exist for brands that respect biodiversity to position themselves around this issue. They can respond to demand for information, while offering them a way to contribute to biodiversity conservation when purchasing products,"" said Rik Kutsch Lojenga, UEBT Executive Director. For the 3rd year in a row the UEBT Biodiversity Barometer therefore asked respondents to list those brands that they think respect biodiversity most. An average of 60% was able to provide brand names, but often on grounds of general environmental reputation, rather than for respect for biodiversity. Consumers particularly associate beauty companies with respect for biodiversity, although this year more consumers mentioned food and household brands. These finding are in line with the UEBT's review of corporate reporting on biodiversity, which found limited attention is paid to the issue. Only 36% of the top 100 beauty companies and 60% of food companies mention biodiversity in their annual sustainability reports. In only four countries consumers strongly identified companies with biodiversity: Brazil (Natura Cosmetics), France (Yves Rocher), India (Dabur), and UK (Body Shop). Yet, few companies have gained international recognition around respect for biodiversity. In Latin America Natura Cosmetics leads the way, as consumers rank it among the top three of companies that respect biodiversity in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. ""To respond to consumer expectations, companies need to step up and improve their biodiversity reporting. In addition, more direct consumer communication on biodiversity is required to increase the trust of consumers,"" concludes Rik Kutsch Lojenga UEBT Executive Director."
Middle East: Towards more sustainable luxury products?,"In its latest white paper called ""Luxury in the Gulf: A Sustainable Future?"", the Chalhoub Group, one of the leading distributor of luxury products in the Middle East, highlights the rise of sustainability issues in the Gulf countries. Speaking about sustainable development may seem paradoxical in a region that built much of its prosperity on the exploitation of huge stocks of fossil fuels and where shoppers have once again taken the top spot in terms of highest international spenders! However, the notion is gaining ground in Gulf countries as local governments try to address the challenges of the future. In order to decrease their dependence on non-renewable resources, most of the region's states have launched plans to promote economic diversification and innovation. They are also increasingly adopting standards aiming at reducing the environmental footprint, in particular in the building sector. Another important effort is education, with the aim of reducing youth unemployment in societies that have experienced high population growth rates. Consumer research conducted by the Chalhoub Group on corporate social responsibility in the United Arab Emirates shows that residents are concerned about their community and environment. Actually, 64% of respondents claim to engage in environmentally friendly activities, ranging from recycling to saving electricity and water. However, the expectations towards corporate sustainability are much higher than towards personal sustainability. Indeed, 83% of respondents expect the shops they buy from to engage in environmentally friendly activities and 68% feel brands do not care enough about the environment and the community. However, while 73% expect stores to recycle products, 64% are not interested in the environmental impact of their purchased products. ""Overall, consumers expect corporate sustainability engagement in the areas of employee, community and environment,"" explains the Chalhoub Group. Business initiatives addressing these new concerns are emerging. FutureFashion.me, for instance, is a marketplace for sustainable clothes and accessories. Regional home and décor retail chain The One is another example. The company is strongly committed to corporate social responsibility and has been recognised in this area with many awards, notably winning 4 years in a row the 'Most Admired Responsible Retailer of the Year - Retail Middle East Award'. As part of its 'Do Good' initiative, The One is promoting ethical sourcing. Luxury in the region is still largely characterised by abundant consumption. Emirati teens are spending six times more on average than global teens, according to research by AMRB and TRU. Within the luxury sector, the Chalhoub Group research shows that the affluent GCC consumer spends on average US$ 2,400 per month on beauty, fashion and gifts. However, according to the Chalhoub Group, ""a new archetype is starting to emerge with a greater sense of pragmatism in their relations with luxury brands."" Still very much in its infancy, this new consumer is somewhat distancing itself from the materialistic world and is beginning to appreciate luxury for the experiences and the enjoyment it can bring. These persons typically have a passion they like to share and bond is their key driver. In the relationship they seek in–store, knowledge of the brand's history and heritage as well as deep understanding of how the product is made are paramount. The sales staff needs to become story–tellers, helping them immerse themselves in the very essence of the brand. In terms of products, they will be attracted to bespoke and 'made to measure' items. Ancient traditions have shaped the region's societies for centuries (solidarity, frugality, sustainable architectural traditions, generosity towards the community, hospitality, gifting, family), are supporting the drive and the mindset for sustainability. ""Luxury in the Gulf shows a promising future as it echoes these deeply rooted traditions and culture,"" concludes the Chalhoub Group."
UN Report recommends ban of microplastics in cosmetics,"The study, entitled Plastic in Cosmetics: Are We Polluting the Environment Through our Personal Care: Plastic ingredients (available here) that contribute to marine microplastic litter is a compilation of currently available knowledge on the linkages between cosmetics and plastic pollution in the oceans. According to the UNEP's report, more than 299 million tonnes of plastic was produced worldwide in 2013 some of which made its way to the oceans. For the last 50 years, microparticles of plastic, called microplastics, have been used in a large number of cosmetic and personal care formulations, ranging from toothpaste and shower gel to eye shadows and nail polish. A total amount of 4,360 tonnes of microplastic beads was used in 2012 across all European Union countries plus Norway and Switzerland according to a survey by Cosmetics Europe, focusing on the use of microplastic beads, with polyethylene beads representing 93% of the total amount equaling 4,037 tonnes. Washed down the drain, those particles cannot be collected for recycling, nor do they decompose in wastewater treatment facilities, inevitably ending up in the global ocean. Once in the ocean, plastic does not go away: it fragments, eventually breaking down into smaller pieces known as secondary microplastics. ""Knowledge is emerging about the effect such particles have on marine organisms, including mammals, but also on their potential for secondary health impacts via the food chain, including to humans who consume seafood,"" explains UNEP. The organisation evaluates the cost in environmental damage to marine ecosystems to approximately US$ 13 billion per year. Given the associated potential risks of microplastics, the report makes several recommendations for producers and consumers, as well as for researchers and policymakers. In particular, it calls for a voluntary phase-out of microplastics by the industry and their eventual ban in personal care and cosmetic products. Introduction of legislation banning or phasing-out microplastics in personal care and cosmetic products has already started and is expected to continue in the future. The state of Illinois is leading the way in the U.S. by banning all microplastics in personal care and cosmetic products by 2019. California and New York are among other U.S. states that are pursuing similar measures and the European Commission has highlighted marine microplastics pollution as a priority area of concern. Furthermore, The Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden have issued a joint call to ban the microplastics used in personal care products."
Brazil adopts new rules on biodiversity based R&D for cosmetics,"""Brazil holds one of the richest biodiversities in the world. It has long been a source of innovation and inspiration for natural ingredients used in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Yet much remains to be explored: many companies have R&D centres in Brazil that are actively looking to discover new ingredients and applications for its flora,"" says the Union for Ethical Bio Trade (UEBT), a non-profit association that promotes the ethical sourcing of ingredients that come from biodiversity. Moreover, Brazil is also quickly becoming a key market for natural products, with a population of over 200 million and a soaring awareness of biodiversity. The new law [1] establishes the procedures that companies and other organizations will need to follow to work with Brazilian biodiversity. The new law repeals a measure adopted in 2001 on access and benefit sharing, widely criticized as too complex and bureaucratic. For example, authorization to access biodiversity for research and development, until now granted by a national council [2], will not longer be required. Companies now only have to register on an online database. Benefit sharing, previously negotiated for each individual case, will now fall on the final product manufacturer, and take place primarily through a national trust fund. President Rousseff described the new law as balancing legal certainty with fair and equitable benefit sharing. It will guarantee, she said, that companies can ""without conflict, troubles or disputes"" use the genetic heritage and associated traditional knowledge in Brazil. ""Nevertheless,"" explains the UEBT, ""the law has also been criticized by indigenous peoples and local communities for not sufficiently protecting their rights and interests."" The new legal framework in Brazil will have significant implications for suppliers, laboratories, manufacturers and brands working with Brazilian biodiversity. These implications will be one of the topics addressed during the ""Beauty of Sourcing with Respect"" conference, which brings together companies, experts and government representatives to discuss biodiversity. The conference, organized by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), will take place in Paris on 25 June 2015."
SGD launches a new version of its Infinite Glass,"""Brighter and more transparent, but providing environmental benefits at each stage of the manufacturing process."" For SGD, the key issue related to the new version of the Infinite Glass was clearly to be able to meet the aesthetic requirements of perfume and cosmetic brands, while significantly reducing the environmental impact of the glass making process. While the first version of Infinite Glass, launched in 2008, was composed of 100% recycled household glass, the 2015 version is composed of 65% of factory cullet (crushed glass rejected form a previous manufacturing batch and reused by SGD), 25% recycled post consumer glass and 10% virgin mineral raw material (sand, sodium, limestone). The Infinite Glass Neo thus contains 90% recycled materials and no longer has the slight green tint of the initial version. ""We only use white post-consumer recycled glass that we buy from a recycling scheme sorting the different types of glass,"" explains Gaëlle Verjus, International Marketing Manager Perfumery & Cosmetics at SGD. The result is an extra-white glass that meets the demanding transparency and brilliance aesthetic requirements of beauty products makers. Furthermore, this high-end glass has a much better environmental profile than classical extra-white glass. For instance, for 1 million 200g glass bottles made from Infinite Glass, SGD estimates that carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by 13% approximately, power consumption is reduced by 13% approximately, a reduction of 34 tonnes of sand consumption and a reduction of 1.7 tonne of limestone consumption. The Infinite Glass Neo can be decorated in the same way as a conventional glass; it can therefore be adapted to the values and codes of each brand by using all finishing options offered by SGD. Furthermore, SGD also offers a range of eco-friendly finishing: – Water-based lacquers, using water as diluent and limiting the emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). – Glass etching with zero effluent discharge, based on a process available in the Verreries de l'Orne factory and allowing for a close-loop treatment of etching effluents. – Organic or UV silkscreen inks, requiring few energy during the polymerization process. – Organic inks for thermal drying (150°C). – UV curable inks (ultraviolet radiation). The French glassmaker also offers a new generation of inks with fewer solvents and only based on biodegradable solvents composed of 50% renewable non-oil based raw materials. The Infinite Glass Neo has already convinced a major beauty brand for a future product launch."
"Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and Sweden call for a ban on micro-plastics in cosmetics","In an information note transmitted to other EU Member States, Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and Sweden said micro-plastics (plastic particles with a diameter below 5 mm) pollution was an issue of increasing concern. They deemed the elimination of micro-plastics in products - in particular in cosmetics and detergents - was of utmost priority. ""Although it is evident that alternatives to micro-plastics in cosmetics and detergents are available, hundreds of tons of micro-plastics are still being released onto the EU market each year."" The four countries urged the Commission and member states to address the scientific gaps and to match them with the information available from different sources. In this respect the role and contribution of the European Environment Agency and the European Chemicals Agency should be assessed and defined. They called for a ban on micro-plastics in cosmetics and detergents in order to strengthen the EU's role as a frontrunner for innovative products and green growth whilst providing a level playing field for industry. In the United States, the state of Illinois has already adopted a legislation to ban micro plastic beads in personal care products. Other states are considering the adoption of similar legislations. However, the Governor of New Jersey recently vetoed a proposed ban. Several cosmetics manufacturers, such as Unilever and L'Oréal, have already committed to voluntarily withdraw these substances from their products. More recently, Accord, Australia's industry association for the hygiene, cosmetic and specialty products industry, also announced that the local operators are committed to working towards a phase-out of polyethylene microbeads by the end of 2017."
Summit points key areas of progress towards a greener cosmetics industry,"In his opening keynote, Dominique Conseil, President of Aveda, said the cosmetics industry needs ""to have a different relationship with the Earth"" if it is to face up to its harsh realities. Chris Kilham, Medicine Hunter and Sustainability Ambassador of Naturex, gave a similar message: ""We are entering a new era of conscious business where traditional models no longer exist."" Kilham proposes a ""Business To Heart (B2H)"" approach whereby cosmetic brands appeal to people's hearts; he encouraged brands to take a more personalised approach and consider their customers as people rather then consumers. Despite several divergences, participants pointed several key areas of progress. Lack of transparency in supply chains was cited as a major impediment to sustainable development. Thus, ingredient traceability has become a major concern for the cosmetics industry, with some participants giving examples of palm oil and sandalwood. The summit also highlighted the varying interpretations of sustainability in the cosmetics industry. Although some correlate green cosmetics and ethical sourcing with sustainability, other had differing views. ""Sustainability means good agricultural practices by its farmers,"" stated Mike Martinez, CEO of Natural Plant Products, while Naturex said sustainability means using less synthetics in cosmetic formulations and thus lower environmental pollution. Another ingredient firm Kemin believed cultivation of certified sustainable crops was the way forward. The role of metrics to reduce environmental impacts was also discussed. SGS showed how metrics can be used by cosmetic firms to reduce their packaging footprints. Croda stated it was addressing its environmental impact by using renewable energy, reducing water usage and sending less waste to landfill. It stated about a quarter of the company's energy was now from non-fossil sources. Eventually, Kurt Nuebling, CEO of the European natural cosmetics firm Primavera, encouraged brands to consider green buildings. By using eco-design, its manufacturing facility in southern Germany had gone beyond carbon neutral to become carbon positive. It is capturing up to five times as much carbon as it is emitting. The next editions of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will be held in São Paulo (10-12 September, 2014), Hong Kong (10-11 November, 2014) and Paris (24-26 November, 2014)."
"Consumers expect companies to respect biodiversity, report says","As the European Union is about to regulate the access to genetic resources, the latest edition of the UEBT annual barometer shows that while consumer expectations are high on this issue, many cosmetic brands are still struggling to provide accurate answers. Conducted in February 2014, some 7,000 consumers in Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, France, UK, USA and Vietnam participated in the survey. In 2014, 87% of consumers surveyed say they buy cosmetic products that use natural ingredients. In Brazil this number is 96%, in the UK 72%. Consumers are increasingly looking for transparency: 77% say they pay attention to where ingredients in cosmetics products come from. In Brazil, Colombia and Vietnam almost 90% of consumers say they pay attention to the origin. A large majority (87%) of the surveyed consumers expects companies to have sourcing policies in place that respect biodiversity. In Colombia and Brazil the large majority even think this is essential, in comparison to an average 34% in France, Germany and the UK. Further, the report suggests that more than 85% of surveyed consumers want companies to provide more information on the concrete actions they are taking to respect biodiversity in their sourcing policies. The 2014 Biodiversity Barometer also confirmed that biodiversity awareness is particularly high in emerging markets. More than 90% of respondents in Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam and China have heard about biodiversity, with 49% of respondents able to correctly define biodiversity, twice the number of that in developed countries. ""Consumers in emerging markets show a good understanding of biodiversity and a high interest in ethical sourcing. With market growth increasingly realized in these countries, these findings are of strategic importance for companies investing in emerging markets,"" says UEBT Executive Director Rik Kutsch Lojenga. However, while the 2014 UEBT Biodiversity Barometer finds that biodiversity awareness has increased since 2009, it also reveals growth in understanding of biodiversity has slowed down since 2012. ""84% of respondents say it is important to personally contribute to conserving biodiversity. This highlights the importance placed on biodiversity and provides us with a tremendous opportunity to work together to conserve and use biodiversity sustainably and in a fair and equitable way and address the biodiversity loss and its benefits to society,"" says Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias, CBD Executive Secretary."
L'Oréal supports its suppliers as part of its sustainable development programme,"Premium Beauty News - What are the foundations of this unprecedented CSR policy? Laurent Gilbert - The program is called ""Sharing beauty with all"", the objective is clearly to place the consumer at the heart of our commitment to sustainable development and enable him to make responsible choices. We intend to make this subject very tangible and easily accessible for him. We are committed to make available, information on the social and environmental characteristics of our products, and we are working with our brands to enable them to take up this subject and engage in a dialogue with their customers. The aim is also to work on the entire value chain, starting with our innovations, from production to distribution. The last, extremely important point, is that everything is done as part of an objective of the group, namely to conquer a billion consumers by 2020. It is essential that this development benefits to all our employees, our suppliers, but also to the most disadvantaged communities. Premium Beauty News - You anticipate that by 2020, 100% of your strategic suppliers will be taking part to the sustainable development program, what does that involve in terms of procurement? Laurent Gilbert - We work with several hundreds of suppliers worldwide, with whom we have privileged relationships. We selected them on their ability to innovate, to deliver service and a host of other criteria, including the criticality of ingredients they supply us. These commitments are the result of a work conducted internally with them for several years. Concerning for example the sourcing of renewably-sourced raw materials, L'Oréal is engaged since 2005 in developing its raw materials according to the principles from the Convention on Biological Diversity and to no longer reference products with an unfavourable environmental profile. Consequently, a number of actions were implemented to make sure that our partners fulfilled all these principles. We provided them with the type of information we wanted to have on the environmental profile of the purchased raw materials. The approach is the same with perfume or packaging suppliers with requirements also on the composition. Premium Beauty News - How will this be implemented? Laurent Gilbert - It is difficult to tackle everything at the same time, so we proceed along two main priorities. On the one hand volume, we started with the largest suppliers in terms of volume or turnover. And raw materials and issues on their sourcing, on the other. Premium Beauty News - Does this mean you will stop doing business with some suppliers? Laurent Gilbert - It is not our policy. We much prefer working with them to make them understand what we want and then have them adopt these practices. Of course, if after a great deal of efforts this turns out impossible, we might find ourselves in a position to make decisions but it really isn't the goal. Premium Beauty News - It really is more a matter of support? Laurent Gilbert - Yes, we really intend to share all our tools when the size of our suppliers does not allow them to develop their own tools. Particularly educational tools to really share the same notions. For example, semantics are very important, to ensure that behind words we put the same definitions. When we speak of renewably-sourced raw materials or of sustainable development issues, to make sure that we understand the same thing, and this, at the global level. And also regarding the working tools, the way we conduct audits or evaluate a channel. We are really in this kind of support. Premium Beauty News - The group has set itself a 'zero deforestation' goal, thus guaranteeing that none of its products would be associated with deforestation by 2020. End of 2012, the overall supply of L'Oréal in palm oil was already complying with the standards and procedures of the RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil), what remains to be done? Laurent Gilbert - This roundtable for the sustainable sourcing palm is based on different standards that will be used depending on the complexity of the supply chain. We are following the SG (Segregated) standard, one of the most demanding, which requires a full traceability, from the mill that produces the palm oil to our factories. This guarantees a supply which is managed according to the sustainable development principles of the RSPO. For derivatives, the supply chains are very complex, which makes complete traceability difficult. We want to ensure full traceability even for derivatives, to be consistent with our commitment, and we are going to work with the most innovative suppliers on these issues. This is the reason for the 2020 deadline, it demands time because there is still a lot to do with all the stakeholders in the chain. Premium Beauty News - Do you think consumers are aware of these issues and that they will appreciate your commitment? Laurent Gilbert - Our consumers feel quite concerned, there is a real expectation. Each year, we sponsor the Biodiversity Barometer delivered by the UEBT (Union for Ethical Bio Trade), which measures consumer expectations and their level of understanding on these issues. We can see, in China in particular, that about 94% of people are aware of biodiversity, 69% have a knowledge of biodiversity, and therefore Chinese people are very much aware of these issues. This is also true for Brazil. Our consumers are fully aware of these issues, what they lack in fact are the tools to make responsible choices. Our challenge is to make this information accessible. As the program rolls out, we will develop the means to communicate with them. Brands need to take up the subject and put it in tune with their products and their DNA to generate awareness among their customers. It is important to not scramble the message, everyone is involved and we are working on the implementation of future actions. By 2020, there will be things clearly visible to the consumer. Premium Beauty News - Will you be able to meet the 2020 deadline for the entire program? Laurent Gilbert - We set up a panel of Critical Friends whose will follow our progress with an outside view and with whom we will regularly take stock. We will also communicate through our sustainability reports and during other events enabling us to give an update on our progress. Will we meet the 2020 deadline? All the teams are mobilized for that and we have a very comprehensive agenda for the years to come."
"Plastic microbeads: L'Oréal to stop, New York and California to prohibit","New York State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and state Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney have unveiled a proposed law to prohibit the sale in the state of New York of cosmetic products that contain tiny plastic particles. Recent studies have found high levels of these plastic beads in the New York waters of Lake Erie, and revealed that most of the state's waters were polluted. When products containing microbeads are used in the home, the beads are rinsed down the drain and into sewer systems. Because of their small size and buoyancy, microbeads escape treatment by sewage plants and are discharged into rivers, lakes and oceans. ""From the Great Lakes to the Hudson River to Long Island Sound, our commitment to protecting and restoring New York's waters is among our most important responsibilities,"" Attorney General Schneiderman said. The Microbead-Free Waters Act would prohibit the production, manufacture, distribution and sale in New York of any beauty product, cosmetic or other personal care product containing plastic particles less than 5 millimetres in size. In California, Assemblymember Richard Bloom has introduced a bill on February 13, to ban the sale of personal care products that contain micro-plastic particles. According to the bill, cleaning or personal care products containing microplastics would be prohibited for sell on or after January 1, 2016. ""We have no choice but to eliminate this pollution at the source. Waiting will only compound the problem and the price of cleaning up,"" said Bloom. In this context, L'Oréal has announced on February 12 its decision to no longer use microbeads of polyethylene in its scrubs by 2017. The phasing out will be first achieved for Biotherm (2014) and The Body Shop (2015) before being extended to all the Group's portfolio in 2017. ""Since L'Oréal has been aware of possible concerns about the environmental impact of microbeads of polyetylene in its scrubs, the Group's Research examined the issue and decided to gradually phase them out,"" explains the French cosmetics manufacturer, which has a research laboratory dedicated to assessing the impact of its formulae on the marine environment since 1995. However, L'Oréal adds that the phasing out of an ingredient is always a complex process. ""It requires the analysis and identification of viable alternative(s) that can meet many criteria (including human and environmental safety, efficacy, sustainable sourcing of the raw material and overall costs)."" In that case, the group says to be looking for natural alternatives, such as mineral particles or fruit seeds, that could provide for the same efficacy and safety as before. Other cosmetic companies such as Unilever and Johnson & Johnson have already announced their intention to remove plastic microbeads from their products. Several non-government organizations are fighting against the microplastic beads through the ""Beat the Microbead"" campaign. Two Dutch environmental groups have launched an app in 2012 to help consumers identify products using the material. The United Nations Environment Program joined in last year to expand the app for international use beyond the Netherlands."
Positive outlooks for bioplastic products in Europe,"Among the highlights of the 8th European Bioplastics Conference, which was held on the 10 and 11 December in Berlin, was the annual market data update by European Bioplastics and the Institute for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (IfBB - University of Applied Arts Hannover, Germany). The data emphasised the success of bioplastics industry with production capacities multiplying from around 1.4 million tonnes in 2012 to more than 6 million tonnes in 2017. ""Our market data update once more affirms above average growth in the bioplastics industry around the world"", said François de Bie, Chairman of the Board of European Bioplastics. ""Continuous growth can be expected with regard to all bioplastic material types and in a range of very diverse market segments - from packaging to fibres to consumer electronics."" All material types are gaining ground with biobased, non-biodegradable solutions, such as biobased PE and biobased PET, leading the field. Biodegradable plastics, including e.g. PLA, biodegradable polyesters and starch-blends, are also demonstrating impressive growth rates. Production capacity will gain around 60 percent by 2017. European Bioplastics also highlighted that the packaging market will remain the leading segment for bioplastics applications. European Bioplastics' current data shows that Europe and North America remain interesting as locations for research and development and also important as sales markets. However, the association highlights that the establishment of new production capacities is favoured in South America and Asia. The environmental benefits of bioplastics were also underlined during the conference. ""Bioplastics made from bio-feedstock, and reintegrated into the biosphere as a nutrient, or recycled together with conventional plastic, clearly have a potential for being a truly sustainable material. And it could reduce fossil fuel consumption,"" stated EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potočnik in his opening speech. In a video message, he pointed to the crucial role bioplastics can play in Europe's transition towards a circular biobased economy. Even if considering the forecasted growth rates, the actual land used for sourcing renewable feedstock for bioplastics will amount only to approximately 0.02 percent of the global agricultural area, says European Bioplastics. Panel discussions and presentations during the conference highlighted that Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) remain the best available tool to assess the environmental performance of bioplastics as fact-based as possible. However, panellists also stressed the need to use state of the art and valid methodologies and to provide easy to use tools to consumers to understand these assessments."
L'Oreal defines its sustainable development goals for 2020,"How to achieve the group's ambition in terms of growth, namely to win 1 billion new consumers worldwide, while reducing its environmental impact? This is the aim of ""Sharing Beauty With All"", the roadmap that details the commitments and targets of L'Oréal's sustainable development policy. In order to produce more but with less impact, L'Oréal intends to offer products that are both sustainable and desirable. In order to achieve this, the group commits to improving every part of its value chain, from research to operations, while sharing its growth with the communities it touches through ""By accelerating sustainable innovation within our business, and harnessing the power of our brands to inform consumers, we will raise awareness about sustainability and encourage consumers to make more sustainable choices,"" Jean-Paul Agon, said. These commitments are the result of two years of exchange with various stakeholders throughout the world. Concretely speaking, the « Sharing Beauty With All » roadmap covers four types of commitments. First of all, L'Oréal aims at innovating sustainably. By 2020, 100% of the products developed by L'Oréal will have an environmental or social benefit. ""Every time we invent or update a product, we will improve its environmental or social,"" the group says. This means that the new product must meet at least one of the following criteria: – The new formula reduces the environmental footprint. – The new formula uses renewable raw materials that are sustainably sourced or raw materials derived from green chemistry. – The new packaging has an improved environmental profile. – The new product has a positive social impact. The group's second key goal is to produce sustainably. ""By 2020, we will reduce our environmental footprint by 60 % whilst bringing beauty to one billion new consumers,"" L'Oréal claims. In order to reach its goals, the group has set up ambitious targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions, water consumption and waste production. However, as demonstrated by some of its competitors, such targets may also lead to improved economic performance. L'Oréal also wants to participate in the change of consumption habits. In order to promote sustainable livings, L'Oréal will provide consumers with detailed information on the environmental impacts of its products. A product assessment tool will evaluate the environmental and social profile of 100% of new products. Eventually, L'Oréal commits to develop sustainably. Thus, by 2020, all the group's employees will have access to health care, social protection and training, wherever they are in the world. L'Oréal will also enrol its strategic suppliers in its sustainability program. All of them will be evaluated and selected on social and environmental performance. L'Oréal will help them to complete a self-assessment of their sustainability policy and will give them access to its training tools. Furthermore, by 2020, L'Oréal wants to enable more than 100,000 people from underprivileged communities, to access work. The group will achieve this goal through programmes dedicated to support disabled people and under-represented socio-ethnic groups. L'Oréal, which previously only presented segmented programs and targets, now proposes a comprehensive and ambitious scheme, as its main global competitors, Procter & Gamble and Unilever."
An application to detect plastics in cosmetics,"Do mobile applications become the most effective weapon of consumer-activists? When one's considers that most consumers are shopping with their mobile phone and that an increasing proportion of them uses it when it feels the need to be guided, these little devices could soon exert an increasing pressure on brands. The 'Beat the Microbead' App offers consumers information about the presence of plastic microbeads in personal care products. The aim is to make the eco-friendly minded consumer more aware of their purchasing behaviour. As usual, the principle is quite simple. The App can scan the barcode of a personal care product and tell the consumer whether or not the product contains plastic microbeads. Products are divided into the categories Red, Orange and Green. Red: the product contains microbeads; Orange: the product contains microbeads but the manufacturer has pledged to stop using them in the near future; Green, the product does not contain microbeads. The international and multiplatform version of the application - which was initially only available in Dutch for iOS - was developed with the financial support of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and UK based NGO Fauna & Flora International (FFI). The application is available for free and in five languages (English, Spanish, German, French, Dutch). However, the application can only be available to use where the lists of personal care products containing plastic microbeads were supplied and updated. NGOs from The United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Hong Kong and Canada are already doing this work. Recently, NGOs from Brazil, Sweden and New Zealand have joined up as well. The presence of micro plastic beads in consumer products, including cosmetics, is accused of impacting the marine environment but also indirectly the human health as they enter the food chain. ""Plastic only breaks down partially and leaves little pieces of plastic called microbeads. The worst part, water treatment plants are unable to filter these microbeads completely and thus directly influence the plastic soup that threatens the oceans,"" said Jeroen Dagevos of the North Sea Foundation. Obviously, the ultimate goal of NGOs is to push companies to stop using plastic microsbeads and to replace them by other materials more environmentally friendly, so as Unilever and Lush have done by announcing to stop using these products at the beginning of the year, or, more recently, The Body Shop."
The formulation of green cosmetics remains an obstacle course,"Formulation, preservation, and even the mere measurement of ingredients' sustainability, are among the main technical challenges that green cosmetic formulators and brands have to face according to Organic Monitor. "" Preservation remains the number one technical hurdle for formulators of natural and organic personal care products,"" explains the market research firm. ""Although many green materials have become available for preservation, no single material is popular because of variations in product composition. Stability is a major issue, with some green preservative systems leading to discolouration and / or odour changes."" Organic Monitor also points out the lack of agreement among certification agencies regarding green surfactants and the production processes that may be permissible. On the contrary, huge progress has been made in the area of green emulsifiers and rheology modifiers. Organic Monitor finds that many ingredients are now available to produce elegant skin care emulsions. Major developments have also been made in the field of sustainable extraction, with a wide variety of techniques and processes now in use and a number of ingredient companies investing in new sustainable technologies. For instance, the Zeta Fraction technology of AkzoNobel enables natural actives to be harvested from plant materials with a lower environment impact than traditional methods. Mibelle Biochemistry is using plant stem cell technology to extract actives from plants. Its PhytoCellTec technique allows active ingredients to be extracted from rare and exotic plant species in a sustainable manner. Another difficulty is that the environmental impact of green materials is not always easy to measure. ""Formulators may wish to replace synthetics with green materials, however the move can have unintended consequences on ecosystems. Palm oil, the most widely used vegetable oil in cosmetic applications, has been responsible for the destruction of tropical rainforests in South-East Asia. Questions also hang over the sustainable sourcing of many natural fragrances, as well as the growing use of food ingredients in cosmetic applications."" Organic Monitor believes the sustainability issues are likely to persist for many years yet. In conjunction with the next Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which will take place in Paris on 21-23rd October 2013, Organic Monitor will also organize the first Sustainable Beauty Awards ceremony. Three finalists (listed in alphabetical order) have been selected per award category: Sustainability Pioneer Finalists: – Apivita – L'Oreal USA - Garnier – Primavera Life The sustainability pioneer award is given to a cosmetic or ingredient firm that is a leader / pioneer in some aspect of sustainability. Sustainability Leadership Finalists: – Firmenich – Laboratoires Expanscience – Weleda This award is given to a cosmetics or ingredients firm that is leading in various aspects of sustainability. The company is displaying overall leadership in sustainability and not mastering a few areas. Sustainable Packaging Finalists: – Laboratoires Expanscience – Seventh Generation – You Organic Skincare This award is given to a cosmetics brand / packaging firm with a new packaging that has low environmental footprint in terms of design and / or materials. Sustainable Ingredient Finalists: – Alban Muller International – AkzoNobel Surface Chemistry – International Flavors & Fragrances This award is given to a cosmetic ingredient that makes a significant difference in sustainability, in terms of environmental and / or social impact. Green Formulations Finalists: – Alteya Organics – Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps – JasminSkincare This award is given to a cosmetic brand with a high level of green (natural / organic) ingredients in product formulations."
"""Tree-sourced polymers could replace many oiled-sourced polymers,"" Ohto Nuottamo, Stora Enso","Premium Beauty News - The paper industry in Europe has made tremendous progress on the way to sustainability, and is now viewed as one of the leading sectors in this field. Ohto Nuottamo - The main reason is that during the 1970s and 1980s, the paper industry in general, and the biggest companies in particular, have been attacked by NGOs for their impact on the environment. This coincided with the emergence of new analytical equipment that allowed measuring small amounts of dioxin in the products. As a consequence of these pressures, the paper industry evolved its practices and became very good in fields such as traceability and effluent control. We invested a lot of money to control or emissions in water or in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the reduction of CO2 emissions is now a key indicator of performance. As far as Stora Enso is concerned, 80% of the energy we currently use in our manufacturing process is bio-sourced and our aim is to reach 100%. Compared to other industries, such as the cement industry for instance, we have made tremendous progress in the way to sustainability. Nevertheless, the situation in the paper industry is not all perfect and bad land use practices remain in some countries such as Indonesia or Brazil. It is the common responsibility of the whole industry to promote environmentally friendly practices at a global scale, in particular regarding the impacts on the forest and on water and air quality. In Europe, the paper industry now has a positive impact on forests, we grow more trees than we use. Regarding the effluents in water and in the air, we have considerably decreased them. Our impact is not inexistent but very limited and local. Premium Beauty News - But today, NGOs have shifted their pressure on the plastic industry. Ohto Nuottamo - All the industries that have difficulties to properly manage the origin (the cradle) and the end of life (the grave) of their goods have and will have increasing difficulties with NGOs. Beyond NGOs, brand owners are increasingly sensitive to environmental issues because they know that everything is visible now and that in case of problem they will be in the front line of public pressure. Premium Beauty News - Packaging in general suffers from a bad perception. Ohto Nuottamo - Unfortunately, packaging waste is on top of the consumers' mind. The average impact of a product's packaging in carbon emissions is less than 10%, but the most visible problem with packaging is waste. Nobody feels good about the tremendous quantity of garbage that developed societies produce every year. Simultaneously, people are increasingly willing to cooperate in waste management schemes. They consider that waste has some value and that this value should not be discarded. This belief participates in the feeling that we need to create a circular economy instead of the linear economy we have been used to. The European packaging waste law that sets recycling and reuse targets for each material correspond to this new circular economy. In these fields, carton and paper can boast very high scores compared to fossil polymers. Premium Beauty News - Each industrial sector claims its materials to be more sustainable than the others. PET for instance is a plastic polymer with good recyclability scores. How to make sense out of all these claims? Ohto Nuottamo - I would add that plastics in general are very competitive in terms of weight reduction. Actually, conducting full life cycling analyses is the only way to have a clear view of the environmental impact of a product and to compare it with another. However, we can broadly review the benefits and costs of different materials used for packaging: – glass has a positive image, it is recyclable but it is a heavy product and it requires lot of energy to be recycled, – metals can be quite easily sorted, reused and recycled, – plastics have a bad image, not all of them can be recycled and they correspond to the typical linear economy, – bio-plastics on the contrary correspond to a circular economy, but only a small proportion of plastics are plant-based, experts say that 1.5% could be a reasonable target by 2020. And there is also the problem of the competition in land use with food production. – paper is both renewable and recyclable. Furthermore, trees can grow - and usually grow - in areas that are of low agricultural interest, and forests provide a large variety of environmental services. For instance growing the surface of forests has a big impact on CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The extra growth of all the trees we are no longer cutting in Europe can absorb a large part of our new CO2 emissions. I'm truly convinced that the use of carton and paper as packaging materials should and could be increased in many industries. The paper industry in Europe has achieved such tremendous environmental results that it is now intrinsically sustainable. Unfortunately, it does not always succeed in communicating on this aspect. Premium Beauty News - Everything in packaging cannot come from trees! Ohto Nuottamo - Not everything of course, but much more than currently does. Actually, tree fibres have a structure that is close from a polymer structure. Our vision is that, in the future, thanks to this structure, tree-sourced polymers could replace many oiled-sourced polymers. For instance, we think that in the future, 100% of food packaging can be tree-based. In order to stimulate research and development regarding a wider use of carton-based packaging we are launching a new edition of our Recreate Packaging competition this year. We are expecting more than 70 universities to participate. Our aim is to show what it is possible to do with carton and paper and to help converters in their way to innovation. We know that innovation requires cooperation between suppliers and customers, for instance to develop new methods and new machines. However, our core business is not to develop new packaging, our core business is to manage forests and to produce paper and carton. Premium Beauty News - According to you, what are the main prospects for carton-based packaging? Ohto Nuottamo - There are many possible avenues. One of them could be to produce packaging materials directly from cellulose, by skipping the paper step. What we are doing now is to cut trees into pieces, to add 99% water to these pieces and then to use huge machines to remove the water. The whole process requires tremendous amounts of water and a lot of energy. I'm convinced that partnerships between us and the chemical industry will be a key factor of success in the development of innovative sustainable processes and materials. Pulping will become a key industry in the future."
Sustainability of cosmetics packaging progresses slowly,"As far as packaging sustainability is concerned, most developments are occurring in ecodesign, reveals a recent research by Organic Monitor. Actually, many brands are focusing on the reduction of packaging materials by changing design structures. Sustainable design is epitomized by SOU, a mass-market brand recently launched by Natura Brasil. SOU toiletries and skin care products are housed in flexible packaging that have 70% less plastic than rigid plastic containers of the same volume. As a consequence, most changes in packaging design are only leading to an incremental decrease in packaging materials. This is not so bad since, according to the OECD, packaging comprises over half of all household waste in developed countries. In some cases, the reduction in packaging material may be impressive. Unilever, for instance, introduced a new 'compressed' can for a number of its deodorant brands earlier this year. The deodorant cans are about a third smaller, reducing packaging material costs as well as transportation costs. However, there are many cases where the ecological benefits from less packaging material are offset by higher unit sales. ""More radical solutions involving materials are necessary to make significant changes to the packaging impact of cosmetic products,"" underlines the market research firm. According to Organic Monitor, relatively few developments are occurring in packaging materials. Although some cosmetic brands are experimenting with sustainable materials like bamboo and wood, plastic packaging still prevails. Plant-based plastics, once hailed because of their biodegradable nature, have yet to make headway in cosmetic applications. Some companies like Procter & Gamble are using hybrid polymers to overcome the limitations of bioplastics. Its Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion packaging is mainly made from biopolymers sourced from sugar cane. However, Organic Monitor considers that few companies have managed to innovate with green packaging. ""A closed loop system whereby waste is used as raw materials is considered the way forward for many cosmetic brands taking the green road."" To further explore this issue, Organic Monitor has placed sustainable packaging at the core of the upcoming Latin American (18-20 September 2013, São Paulo) and European (21-23rd October 2013, Paris) editions of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit. Discussion topics include environmental impact of packaging, ecodesign innovations, novel packaging materials, bioplastics in cosmetics, and green packaging success stories; papers will be given by Natura Brasil, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Arkema, Selerant, Aptar, ABIHPEC, etc."
"Biodiversity offers branding opportunities, says UEBT","Seventy per cent of consumers surveyed worldwide are aware of biodiversity, while 48 per cent can give a correct definition of the term biodiversity, shows the 2013 Biodiversity Barometer report launched last week in Paris by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT). The survey also unveil that consumers in Brazil, China and France, show a particular awareness about biodiversity. ""The Biodiversity Barometer is an important source of information on global trends in biodiversity awareness. The results not only demonstrate a growing consciousness, they also show that respecting biodiversity provides tremendous opportunities for business around the world,"" says Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias, Executive Secretary for the Convention on Biological Diversity. This year's special focus on China reveals that apart from a very high biodiversity awareness (94 per cent), Chinese consumers surveyed also show high knowledge of biodiversity: 64% could define correctly what biodiversity means. UEBT also asked persons involved in the survey to mention ""the three brands that are making the most efforts to respect biodiversity."" At this level, answers were manifold and often country-specific. For instance, in Brazil, there is a clear leader with Natura (49%). In the USA, most mentioned food brands, including Kraft, Starbucks and Ben & Jerry's. UK has two leading companies: Bodyshop and CO-OP (23% and 20%). In France Yves Rocher, Nestle and Danone top the list, while in China the perceived leaders are Yili, Mengliu and Amway. ""There are clear opportunities for brands to position themselves around the issue of biodiversity, and anticipate increasing consumer interest on this issue"" concludes Rémy Oudghiri, Director of Trends and Insights at IPSOS. However, there is hardly any mention of biodiversity in corporate communication. ""Today 32 of the top 100 beauty companies in the world refer to biodiversity in their corporate communications such as sustainability reporting and websites. This is considerably higher than in 2009, but much lower than what we found in the top 100 food companies,"" says Rik Kutsch Lojenga, Executive Director of UEBT. Nevertheless, it is worth too note that, according to the 2013 UEBT Barometer, 87 per cent of consumers say they want to be better informed about how companies source their natural ingredients, and a large majority of consumers say they would to boycott brands that do not take good care of environmental or ethical trade practices in its sourcing and production processes."
Unilever's sustainability efforts help to drive growth,"Working for sustainable development would have a positive effect on sales. In any case, it is what Unilever claims, highlighting the group's brands that have made sustainability central to their proposition or product innovation have accelerated sales during 2012. For instance, says the company, Lifebuoy soap, which has increased its handwashing education programmes, has seen double digit growth in each of the last three years. Similarly, dry shampoos such as TRESemmé and Dove, which result in 90% less greenhouse gas emissions compared to washing hair in heated water, grew by nearly 20% in 2012. Unilever is also accelerating the integration of sustainability into the heart of many of its biggest brands. For example Dove, the group's largest personal care brand with sales of over 3 billion euros, redesigned its self esteem programme for young people in 2012 to further strengthen its engagement with consumers by helping them look and feel their best. At the same time, eco-efficiencies in Unilever factories from reducing energy, water and materials consumption, as well as waste production, would have enabled the group to take over 300 million euros out of the system since 2008. The company has also reduced risk at a time of volatility in food commodity prices by increasing its purchases of agricultural raw materials from sustainable sources from 14% in 2010 to 36% in 2012. ""Sustainability is contributing to our virtuous circle of growth. The more our products meet social needs and help people live sustainably, the more popular our brands become and the more we grow. And the more efficient we are at managing resources such as energy and raw materials, the more we lower our costs and reduce the risks to our business and the more we are able to invest in sustainable innovation and brands,"" says Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever. In 2010 Unilever has chosen to put sustainable and equitable growth at the heart of its operations and growth strategy, setting three big goals, all to be achieved by 2020: 1) Help more than a billion people take action to improve their health and well-being; 2) Source 100% of agricultural raw materials sustainably; 3) Halve the environmental footprint of its products across the value chain. Since the launch of the plan, the group has made significant progress on several of these issues. For instance, Unilever announced to have achieved a CO2 reduction of more than one million tonnes from its manufacturing and logistics operations compared to the 2008 levels. This is equivalent to taking 250,000 cars off the road. Although, to reach its goals Unilever will also have to face numerous challenges. To that end, helping consumers change their behaviour to live more sustainably is a key factor of success. In the absence of major framework changes by governments, the company is tackling this in a number of ways, from driving habit change through packaging solutions, such as single dose laundry detergent capsules which make it easier for consumers to dose accurately, to working with others such as retailers and civil society organisations to encourage shoppers to make sustainable choices at the supermarket and in the home. In addition, Unilever is leveraging its scale and reach to work with its many suppliers across the value chain to instil sustainable practices."
P&G achieves zero manufacturing waste at 45 sites worldwide,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) is about to achieve one of its four first environmental steps: having zero consumer and manufacturing waste go to landfills. P&G announced its first zero manufacturing waste to landfill site in Budapest in 2007. Since then, the company has shared a long-term environmental vision, pledging to work toward zero consumer and manufacturing waste worldwide. According to the consumer goods giant - well known for its global beauty and personal care brands such as Crest, Head & Shoulders, Gillette, Oral-B, Olay, Pantene, SK-II and Wella - less than 1% of all materials entering its sites globally leaves as waste. Through quality assurance, packaging reduction, compaction and recycling efforts, the company now ensures that 99% of all materials entering P&G plants leaves as finished product or is recycled, reused or converted to energy. To drive all sites toward zero, P&G has searched for innovative ways to find value in what was once seen as waste. For instance, in Mexico, paper sludge from a Charmin toilet tissue plant is turned into low-cost roof tiles used to build homes in the local community. At a U.S. Pampers site, scrap from the wipe manufacturing process is converted to upholstery filling. And, in the U.K., waste created in the production of Gillette shaving foam is composted then used to grow turf for commercial uses. ""There are well-defined systems for recycling materials like paper, plastic and glass, but our product portfolio is incredibly broad, resulting in a diverse set of waste streams to find sustainable solutions for,"" shared Dr. Forbes McDougall, who leads P&G's global zero manufacturing waste program. ""We focused on finding solutions for our toughest waste streams at our largest sites, and while initially we saw progress in our overall corporate recycling, the increase in zero landfill sites was slow. Today, we have found ways to divert most of our major waste streams away from landfill, so we're now seeing new sites achieve zero manufacturing waste to landfill nearly every month."" The three other steps within P&G's long-term environmental sustainability vision include: powering all P&G plants with 100% renewable energy, using 100% renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging produced by the company, and designing products while maximizing the conservation of resources. ""We have a vision for the future, where plants are powered by renewable energy, products are made from recycled and renewable materials and resources are conserved, with no waste going to landfill. Changing the way we see waste as a company has brought us one step closer to this goal at 45 sites worldwide, where all of our manufacturing waste is recycled, repurposed or converted into energy,"" said Bob McDonald, P&G President, CEO and Chairman of the Board. According to P&G, the work to find worth in waste has created over 1 billion US dollars in value for the company over the past 5 years."
Microplastics: Lush hot on Unilever's heels,"On Wednesday 30th January 2013, Lush Cosmetics pledged to remove all glitter and microplastics from its product range. According to Hilary Jones, Ethics Director at Lush Cosmetics, it is the outcome of a long process. ""Here at Lush we are known for our fizzing baths of fun and decoration. But some of the shine and sparkle in our bath products used to be from micro plastic glitters. For some years now, because of our concerns about the accumulation of plastics in the environment, we have been gradually replacing these plastic glitters with new alternatives as innovations have become available,"" she said. Eventually, over 50% of the plastic glitters still used by Lush were concentrated into three long-term best selling products. The challenge was therefore to find suitable replacements that would not upset loyal customers and make them disappointed with products they had long loved. The solution came from new agar based glitters and other biodegradable options recently launched onto the market. In order to keep fun and excitement in its baths, Lush has replaced glitter with edible lustres, rice paper confetti, popping candy, sugar decorations and even developed its own confetti made in house by dehydrating honeydew melons and mixing with its custom, palm free soap base. The decision of the British brand has been celebrated by several marine conservation organizations. ""Microplastics are a growing problem in our seas and oceans. This is a really forward thinking decision by Lush to phase out plastic glitter in their products,"" commented Dr Sue Kinsey Senior Pollution Policy Officer with the Marine Conservation Society. For its part, Andy Cummins, Campaigns Director with Surfers Against Sewage said he was ""stoked to see Lush once more promoting the sustainable achievable solutions."" Both organizations are urging other companies to do the same. In response to the controversy regarding the use of micro-plastics in cosmetic and personal care products, several suppliers have launched biodegradable alternatives or have seized this opportunity to put already existing ranges under the spotlights. For instance, Koster Keunen has recently stressed that the plant based waxes in bead form the company has been making for several years can be a good alternative to plastic beads. These waxes are derived from sunflower wax and rice bran wax and non-hydrogenated with melt points at 75-80°C. They are suitable for a wide range of exfoliation applications including cleansers, masks and scrubs and are available in custom sizes and colours. [1] ""Our company has pioneered natural waxes since 1852 and the expansion from beeswax to sunflower wax is only the most recent extension of our varied sustainable product offerings,"" said Koster Keunen President John Koster. For its part, Impact Colors offers two entirely natural and biodegradable solutions derived from rice and bamboo: Rice Exfoliator Vision Beads [2] and Bamboo Exfoliator Vision Beads [3]. ""They work at the cellular level to naturally restore skin's beauty through gently sloughing off skin's surface cells. These Vision Beads exfoliation spheres gently exfoliate and deeply clean the skin while protecting and moisturizing, unlike other facial scrubs which are abrasive and can cause skin damage,"" claims the company. ""Impact Colors is constantly looking for the best and most pure natural ingredients,"" said Doug Thornley, president."
Unilever to phase out the use of plastic micro beads in personal care products,"""The issue of plastics particles in the ocean is an important issue and we have reviewed the use of micro beads in our portfolio (both current products and those in the pipeline),"" explained Unilever in a statement. The group took its decision in the wake of a web campaign and a call to ban all cosmetics containing plastic micro beads launched by a group of NGOs headed by the Dutch Plastic Soup Foundation and Stichting De Noordzee (the North Sea Foundation). According to the Plastic Soup Foundation, many cosmetic products - such as body scrubs, toothpastes, face or hair cleaners - contain plastic micro beads that are washed down the drain after use thus contributing to the ""plastic soup"", the increased concentration of suspended plastic particulates in oceanic waters. ""This debris are about the same size range as plankton organisms and marine species are not able to distinguish food from this micro plastic. On top of that micro beads also concentrate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and are thus a transport medium for toxic chemicals in the marine environment. The fish you eat may be poisoned because of this,"" details the organisation. Actually, plastic particles are an increasing cause of water pollution. They originate from microbeads contained in cosmetic products as well as from the breakdown products of plastic litter. However, it is difficult to determine precisely the origin of these micro particles but it is unlikely that cosmetics be the main source of pollution, in particular compared to plastic packaging litter. In any case, marine life is severely threatened by these small pieces of plastic that have frequently been found in the digestive tracts of various marine creatures, where they can cause direct physiological damage or leach chemical pollutants such as dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). Plastic microspheres have numerous uses in cosmetics, skin care and personal care industries. According to Cospheric, one of the main producer of coloured microspheres, they can be used as exfoliating agents but also as carriers of beneficial ingredients and they effectively scatter light minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. ""They also create a ball-bearing effect in creams and lotions resulting in luxury feel and smooth silky texture."" The Plastic Soup Foundation and Stichting De Noordzee found micro beads in at least 23 Unilever products and published the list on Facebook and the internet. It is unclear whether microbeads contained in cosmetics can be filtered out by state of the art water purification processes. Few water treatment plants are well equipped and this is usually not the case in emerging countries such as China, Indonesia and Brazil where cosmetics companies are making a growing part of their revenue. ""Products containing micro beads would then almost certainly join the plastic soup,"" said Maria Westerbos of the Plastic Soup Foundation. The Unilever group said it will eliminate all micro beads in its personal care products sold in the Netherlands by mid 2013 and will do the same for the rest of the world by 2015. ""We congratulate Unilever for taking this important decision. The group, which is proud of its record on sustainability, has indeed matched its actions to its words. We understand very well that Unilever cannot stop using micro beads in its products from one day to the next,"" said Maria Westerbos."
The use of squalane in cosmetics criticized by an NGO,"Because of its stability, its hydrating properties and its non-oily texture squalane is known to be one of the most effective emollients of the market. However, it has been progressively neglected by formulators because of supply difficulties concerning both animal-derived squalane, sourced from shark livers and impacted by criticism against this supply-chain, and plant-derived squalane, mostly sourced from olive oil, and suffering from the price variability due to its interdependence with food oil. In order to solve these difficulties, U.S. company Amyris has launched in 2011 a renewable squalane derived from sugarcane. However, according to the Bloom's report, on a global scale, the squalane used in cosmetics would still largely come from sharks. ""Only in Europe does the market seem to have moved predominantly towards plant-based squalane,"" states the NGO. ""In Japan, the world's leading market for squalane (40% of global demand), plant squalane is almost non-existent."" According to the study, around 90% of the world shark liver oil production feeds the needs of the cosmetics industry, which corresponds to 2.7 million deep-sea sharks caught every year. Furthermore, these sharks would not be by catch animals simply ""being put to good use"", but the product of targeted fisheries. ""Although Western corporations have taken a sharp turn in favour of plant-based squalane, the cosmetics industry worldwide is still largely supplied by animal squalane,"" comments Romain Chabrol, author of the study. He emphasizes that blind tests run on the products of major cosmetics brands have shown that businesses were sometimes misled by their suppliers into being sold to them was plant‐based. Regulations restricting fisheries of deep‐sea sharks in the Northern Atlantic where 95% of some shark species have disappeared have prompted fleets to displace their fishing effort to the tropical and semi‐tropical waters. ""The move away from waters subject to EU regulations is ideal for unscrupulous fleets. The only way of putting an end to such destructive fishing practices is to tackle the root of the problem,"" warns Claire Nouvian, founder of Bloom. The organisation requests that consumers be informed about the animal or vegetable origin of the squalane contained in the products they buy."
Environmental impact of packaging: compare what is comparable,"From an ecological point of view, is it better to choose a glass or a plastic container? Is recycled glass better for the environment than recycled plastic? Are plant-based polymers really greener? Actually, the answers that the average consumer can get to these questions are sometimes far-fetched. ""Comparisons on packaging alone are too often based on a limited number of criteria (one or two),"" regrets the French Packaging Council. Under such conditions, claiming that some packaging types would be more virtuous than others does not make sense. For the French Packaging Council, only comparisons that take into account all environmental impacts are likely to provide true information. According to the Council only environmental impacts assessments conducted with complete life-cycle assessment (LCA) are likely to provide ""accurate, objective and thorough environmental information,"" as required by French law n°2009-967 of August 3rd 2009, called Grenelle I. These assessments are based on standardized tools (ISO 14040 and 14044) and must be: multi-step (i.e. concerning the entire lifecycle of the product, from extracting raw materials and generating resources to final elimination, without leaving out production stages and utilization) and multi-criteria (i.e. taking into consideration a sufficient number of environmental impacts). As far as packaging is concerned, the most generally investigated environmental impacts are are: climate change (greenhouse gases emissions, including CO2), water eutrophication, aquatic eco-toxicity, the exhaustion of non-renewable natural resources, non-renewable energy consumption, water consumption, air acidification, loss of biodiversity, production of non-recovered waste (ultimate waste). ""The most common tools for carrying out thorough LCAs use six criteria on average (with a minimum of four),"" the Council adds. However, the French Packaging Council reminds that, despite their interest, LCA calculations very often give results with 10-15% margins of error. ""That means that any differences that are smaller than this margin are by definition relatively insignificant."" Furthermore, packaging often account for a small fraction of the problem and their environmental impact cannot be assessed independently from its use by the final consumer. According to the Council, the relative share of packaging in the various environmental impacts is usually low (approximately 10% for food). ""So general conclusions on the packed product should be avoided when packaging has much less of an impact than its contents."" Thus, according to the French Packaging Council, the comparison between packs made from different materials, is fair, objective and complete information only where: – the two packaging deliver the same value in use to the consumer/user (same features and usage characteristics) for the packed product. – a full multi-criteria LCA was conducted, – all examined impacts vary significantly in the same way (beyond error margins). A clarification that was definitely needed in a context where consumers express high concerns towards environmental issues but low confidence towards industry claims."
Responsible sourcing and cosmetics: innovation is the key to cope with pressure,"Premium Beauty News - If we judge by the number of steps taken by the industrial sector, it seems that the issue on ethical sourcing has become particularly acute for cosmetic products. How do you explain this phenomenon? Valérie Robillard - Like many other sectors, but with probably a higher intensity , due to the fact that products are in intimate contact with the body and applied to the skin, the permeability of which is now recognized, cosmetic brands must respond to a number of requests from consumers: On the absence of controversial ingredients in formulas, for ""greener"" products and more traceability. It must always be kept in mind that a company, specially when its products benefit from an excellent reputation, is under close scrutiny from the part of the public and of grass-root organizations: There is a real risk of being caught red handed because of one's own behaviour or the one of a suppliers environmentally or socially speaking (child labour, human rights, etc.). And then there is market pressure, with a mushrooming of alternative offers. The French cosmetics market is currently worth about 350 million euros. And with the entry of private labels and of historical brands, it should continue to grow, albeit at a less sustained pace, to reach 500 million euros in 2015. Premium Beauty News - In fact, pressures are increasing? Valérie Robillard - Yes, specially when regulatory pressure must be also taken into account. I am refering in particular to REACH, or to the European directive on the ban of animal testing, but also to the Nagoya Protocol adopted in October 2011 on the access and sharing of benefit arising from the use of genetic resources. I also believe that the movement towards the labelling/certification of ingredients and finished products also contributes to increase the pressure by imposing a certain level of performance. Premium Beauty News - What are the solutions available to the industry in terms of responsible sourcing? Valérie Robillard - They involve the implementation of consistent, comprehensive and well controlled supply chains. The whole challenge stands in finding credible and satisfactory alternatives. Credible concerning the precautionary principle, and from this point of view there is always a risk of replacing a controversial product by one or several products that are equally problematic, this can be seen with parabens or the replacement of palm oil by soybean oil, which although it contributes to reducing deforestation, has transferred the problem from Indonesia to Latin America. We cannot be satisfied with simply displacing the problem. In addition to being credible, alternatives should also be satisfactory in terms of cost, availability and efficiency. This is indeed the problem with natural and organic products, which are often considered to be more expensive and less efficient by consumers who become used to textures, fragrances, a sensoriality and to galenics that natural products do not always manage to come to par with. Implement more responsible supply chains must also be an opportunity to sustain and secure supplies. In particular, for raw materials that enter in competition with foodstuff (vanilla, cocoa, avocado, quinoa), by offering more attractive volumes to suppliers, or by protecting oneself against bad harvests, reduced productivity, disease affecting plants. Secured and durable chains, based on sustainable approaches (for example by using part of the plant which cannot be used by the food industry) and partnerships also facilitates the implementation of procedures and controls to ensure a sufficient level of quality. We accompany and we help companies at this level. This implies a better understanding of the impacts of a purchasing strategy in particular on biodiversity, on resource availability, on local populations on the areas of production - it is possible to do a mapping of the company's exposure to social or environmental risk, according to its purchasing strategy (nature of raw materials purchased, geographic origin, direct purchasing or through intermediaries, etc.); then through an analysis of deviations from objectives set up by labels and external standards (Ecocert, Nature et Progrès, BSCI, etc...), the identification of product or process alternatives and their integration in the strategy. More positively, beyond risk minimizing, a purchasing strategy can also be an opportunity to develop positive impacts by proactively integrating to one's supply chain some social purpose enterprises - this is what L'Oréal does with its Solidarity Sourcing approach or BPCE with its PHARE approach on disabilities. Ready-made recipes do not exist, each case is different and this generally leads us – it is actually the goal – to co-create innovative solutions with stakeholders, this can take the form of dialogues or of partnerships with NGOs in the field, for example. However, we can rely on well structured existing tools, even if they are fairly generic, like the ISO 26000 standard on responsible purchasing."
"""Environmental issues must be natural reflexes in the development of projects,"" Frédéric Bonté, LVMH Recherche","Premium Beauty News - This is the first time that the LVMH annual symposium is dedicated to sustainable development! Frédéric Bonté - Previous symposia had addressed more fundamental research issues and this year's theme, as surprising as it may seem, is just as essential to the future of our profession. Indeed, the cosmetic industry is aware of the profound changes affecting main raw materials used and who will have an impact on all our products. This reality is a full part of our long term strategy and of a collective commitment that also involves researchers from R & D in their everyday thinking. Premium Beauty News - The program places particular emphasis on the supply of cosmetic raw materials. Do you believe this is the main issue? Frédéric Bonté - Our industrial approach is a responsible one and raw materials represent both a industrial and societal challenge. Take oil for example, due to its extreme abundance, ease of extraction, its fields of applications, is in fact an important resource for the development of our ""modern"" lifestyle. But this resource, like many others, is not inexhaustible and estimations are that 30% of the oil production will have disappeared within 10 years. Therefore, we must reflect right now on general issues concerning the main solutions offered to us in terms of new resources, different from those directly coming from petrochemicals, for example. Today a lot of research work has been done on diversifications and ways to approach various resources and it seemed essential to us to take stock. From new sources, especially plant based, tomorrow's materials will have different functionalities and qualities. We need to have natural raw materials the resource of which is controlled and a full traceability in respect of biodiversity. Premium Beauty News - A special emphasis will also be placed on the relationship between chemistry and responsible development. It is another way of addressing sustainability, less focused on natural products. Frédéric Bonté - Chemistry is behind the transformation of a resource in other resources with new functionalities. Chemistry has made considerable progress in its environmental approach. The concepts of molecular economy, recyclable catalysts, of ""solvent free"" have become the daily concern of a number of engineers and it also impacts the processing of natural resources. This should enable a significant reduction in the impacts of raw materials production and processing by integrating the concept of eco-design. That being said, natural products, today, take their full place in the production of materials. For example, oleochemistry can now use natural fats from plants (soy, sunflower, rapeseed...) to transform them with short, targeted reactions into detergents, emulsifiers, gelling agents, polymers, a number of product categories that we use and which are therefore more easily biodegradable. Premium Beauty News - This year the LVMH group held, internally, its own Green Week, echoing the European Conference held in Brussels in May. The shift towards sustainable development seems more complicated to organize for the luxury industry? Frédéric Bonté - Our commitment to progress and innovation is unwavering in the respect of the integration of the concept of sustainable development into all our activities. This includes the R & D activity upstream the development of our cosmetic products. The concept of sustainable development include the selection of raw materials, production chains and a more global notion of responsibility in the management of projects. Our will is also expressed through a research program on resource access and benefit sharing. During this symposium, the sharing of experience with other industries will help us collectively to enrich our thinking. Premium Beauty News - What is the role of a structure like LVMH Recherche in the implementation of responses to environmental issues within the group? Frédéric Bonté - Research and development work in line with the commitments of the group and brands which are part of the Perfumes and Cosmetics branch. Environmental issues must become natural reflexes in the development of projects, be it in skincare or make-up for example. Choosing a material over another, raising the awareness of our partners and suppliers and asking them for a complete traceability of the different steps or by-products of the materials that they propose us are part of our strategy of environmental preservation. We actively participate to grounds policies through the preservation and re-colonization of orchids or of ingredients in the Dior gardens. We also tackle our research and development issues by taking into account requirements in terms of consumption and biodegradability, solvents limitation, or risk management... It is through our every day pro-activity, that we can build trust and a sustainable future, in line with the commitments of our group."
Responsible sourcing: Expanscience's proactive approach,"Premium Beauty News - When a group like yours initiates this kind of approach, you face to two types of issues. Environmental issues, of course, but also issues which are specific to the industry in which your group is operating? Karen Lemasson - Absolutely! We must protect the environment and its biodiversity. We can say that today we are facing a real endangerment of services offered by Nature to the economy. Without being over-pessimistic, we must still bear in mind that, according to the IUCN [1], a quarter of mammals and every eighth bird are threatened with extinction and that 80% of the global primary forest has disappeared since 1998. Furthermore companies in our industry obviously need to secure their supplies by integrating in their ""inner workings"" a ""high level of acceptability on what they do vis-a-vis their stakeholders"" (Actors in chains, consumers, suppliers, authorities...). In a nutshell..., ""Companies will be evaluated according to the care they provide to others"" (ISO 26000). In the continuity of this last message, we must recall the main principles expressed in the ""Nagoya Protocol"", i.e. a control of the access to genetic resources (GR) and of the benefit sharing (ABS). Premium Beauty News - Your group has made very strong commitments for 2015. And this seems to be just around the corner! Karen Lemasson - Indeed, it's looming on the horizon but it needs to be prepared now! Our Group operates in both pharmacy, dermo-cosmetics (with the Mustela and Noviderm brands), and in the field of cosmetic actives. As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy we have made commitments for 2015 and in particular the one of having 100% of our new products in dermo-cosmetics eco-designed by 2015. In concrete terms, this means that for our packaging either we work under the ""3R"" approach (Reduce, Replace, Recycle) or we chose the right ingredients. This means we work on all the life stages of our dermo-cosmetic products (from sourcing to the product's end-of-life) to identify and reduce the most important environmental impacts. In line with these guidelines, we are also working on a more ""responsible"" and transparent communication (for example we are working on more ""responsible"" promotional items, on more eco friendly communication media, on our messages etc..). This commitment includes of course our purchases and requires both to secure our supply channels for raw materials but also to secure our purchases and all this, by reducing the legacy of our suppliers and providers societal impacts. In 2015, we will have deployed a CSR-oriented action plan on 100% of our vegetables sectors. To achieve this, we will need of course to have a legal and contractual access to vegetable sources, respect traditional skills, respect biodiversity and be aware of operating a fair return towards local populations, but not only: we must also cover the social aspects (health) of economic development, etc. What is at hand is a global reading of all these issues. In short, we must establish a true responsible purchasing policy. Premium Beauty News - How do you operate and according to which benchmark criteria? Karen Lemasson - Our CSR strategy on our vegetable supply chains is based on ISO 26000 (see figure below based on the seven central issues in terms of social responsibility). We are subject to an independent analysis concerning our ""fair return"" practices (ABS or APA in particular) and of biodiversity preservation (UEBT). Indeed, since December 2011, the Laboratoires Expanscience are members of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), thus reinforcing their commitment in their efforts to preserve biodiversity and of compliance with the rules of ethical trade all along their vegetables supply chains. To note that we are the first French pharmaceutical lab to have joined the UEBT. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us a concrete and recent example of the approach of Laboratories Expanscience? Lemasson Karen - Yes, the one on avocado for example. We had to find committed partners, establish identity cards and take actions to reduce the negative impacts and stimulate the positive ones. We went through open and constructive negotiations to validate a fair price, with the desire to have a policy of close support and direct exchanges with local partners. We chose to encourage the local manufacture of oils and cakes. For example, one of our partners very involved in terms of social responsibility undertook an extensive rebalancing work centred on the local access to the fruit by valorising old non-exploitable trees through the development of adapted grafting techniques enabling their near rejuvenation. Premium Beauty News - A responsible purchasing policy which goes, of course, far beyond ingredients? Karen Lemasson - We take everything into account (promotional items, materials etc..) At each of our products life stage and of course within an ongoing improvement process!"
"""Sustainability starts with the sourcing of our ingredients,"" Bas Schneiders , Weleda","Premium Beauty News - Weleda is well known for its natural medications and beauty products. How naturalness combines with sustainability? Bas Schneiders - Actually, the two of them are closely linked. Sustainability is in our DNA, it is the starting point of our corporate identity and it goes hand in hand with our strategy and values. Which means that the way we operate our business must be consistent with the message brought through our products and it must meet with our customer's expectations. Nevertheless, it is true that being natural does not automatically means being sustainable. We have therefore set-up a package of sustainability goals to guide our business: ecological sourcing & biodiversity, fair trade, climate neutrality, sustainable packaging, water management, and, communication. Premium Beauty News - It is also why you became a member of the Union for Ethical Bio Trade? Bas Schneiders - Since ecological sourcing & biodiversity is a major keystone of our sustainability strategy, becoming a UEBT member was merely logical. UEBT plays a key role in developing both the public's and business's awareness on issues such as sustainable and ethical sourcing. As we only use natural ingredients, biodiversity is the source of our business and we cannot afford to have a negative impact on it. This is why I say that preserving biodiversity is part of our business model. Premium Beauty News - And what about fair trade? Bas Schneiders - Fair trade is a way to share our values with our suppliers. The difficulty with fair trade is that there are a lot of different standards, a lot of different certifiers and labels. As a consequence, it is somewhat complex to provide clear information to consumers. In particular for a cosmetics company that uses hundreds of ingredients! From this point of view, the UEBT standard is very interesting and practical. It is a very good management tool for the verification of all our supply chains of natural ingredients. We currently run over 50 partnerships and projects with suppliers around the world. Working on a long-term basis and avoiding one-shot actions is beneficial to all parties. It is a guarantee for our suppliers and a way to secure our supply chain for us. In the context of rising prices for raw materials and speculating markets, these partnerships are also interesting from an economical point of view. Premium Beauty News - Why is the supply chain so important in your sustainability strategy? Bas Schneiders - Because everything starts with the quality of the ingredients and because it is a key factor in the transparency consumers expect from us. All the ingredients we use must be organic or comply with stringent ecological and social standards. We control and assess all our suppliers from the origin. For instance, when we buy sesame oil, we assess our suppliers but also the initial producers. Premium Beauty News - But your strategy is not limited to sourcing organic and fair trade ingredients? Bas Schneiders - As I mentioned, some of the other key areas are climate neutrality, sustainable packaging, and, water management. As far as climate change is concerned, we carefully look at the environmental impact of our supply chain and have a programme to reduce our carbon footprint. Our final goal is to become carbon neutral, for instance by using only green energy in our production plants and offices. Where becoming carbon neutral is not possible, we'll compensate what is left. Packaging is another important area with a heavy environmental impact. We are working in three different directions in order to reduce this impact: reduction of the volume and weight of packaging materials, increase the use of recyclable materials, and finally a redesign of our packaging (cradle to cradle). Eventually, we have identified the use of water and water management as another key issue regarding sustainability. While this topic does hardly emerge in current discussions about corporate sustainability, we believe it will top the agenda in the future. Water supplies are a real problem at a global scale. Our main goal is to reduce the water footprint of our supply chain, for example by implementing better water management schemes in our own premises and by helping our suppliers to improve their performance in this field. Premium Beauty News - Is a high sustainability performance a real competitive advantage? Bas Schneiders - For a company like Weleda there is no doubt about that. Our consumers have very high expectations in this field. In a context where many cosmetic companies intend to improve their environmental credentials by greening some parts of their activity, our consumers expect us to remain leaders in sustainability. Actually, there are in fact very few companies with ambitions similar to ours."
Sincoplas: reduce CO2 emissions to reduce costs,"Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieve cost savings at the same time. This is the challenge taken up by Sincoplas, this French converter specialized in plastic injected parts intended for perfume and cosmetic packagings which employs 100 people on its production site. ""The carbon footprint evaluation was undertaken for several reasons"", explains Patrice Lhomme, Sales Director, ""it was implemented first of course to offer our modest climate-friendly contribution, to act responsibly against global warming, but also to meet customer demand and, why not achieve savings."" Unlike companies with more than 500 employees [1], French SMEs do not have specific obligations regarding their carbon footprint. But for Sincoplas it was a strategic choice. ""Beyond environmental issues, we thought it could be a good opportunity to reduce costs, while anticipating financial risks in connection with rising energy prices and the implementation of a carbon tax."" To succeed in bringing together these different objectives,Sincoplas turned to the Discover company, a service provider specialized in cost reductions and value for money for which, in a competitive market, responsible commitment must be reconciled with the companies necessary development. ""Our approach was that, based on the carbon balance, we could identify sources of overconsumption and thus more easily achieve our goals of cost reduction. This fitted perfectly with the approach of Discover who earns a return through its energy saving recommendations,"" added Patrice Lhomme. Using the Carbon Balance method developed by the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency), Sincoplas was able to evaluate its GHG emissions to about 2,107 tons of CO2 equivalent with, as main processes responsible for GHG emissions, inputs (38% of total), followed by future packagings (26%) and energy consumption(15%). To reduce these emissions, four priority work areas were defined: – energy consumption (equipment upgrading, a better insulation of the production site, etc.), – packagings (finding alternatives to thermo-shrink films, a reduction in the use of thermoformed material), – travels (setting up of a training on eco-driving), – raw materials (a study on alternative materials leading to a lower emissions of GHG emissions while preserving the same mechanical and physical properties). Once implemented, all of these actions should generate a diminution in GHG emissions by 19% in the short and medium term. ""For several processes we will also save some resources by reducing some wastage. Even though we didn't find a considerable pool of cost reduction at the end of this carbon balance."" Sincoplas will be performing a new carbon balance in two years, in order to evaluate the impact of actions taken. But this experiment is already positive, according to Lhomme. ""In terms of motivation first. All the services were involved, results were presented to the whole staff and the action plan was prepared with all team leaders."" Above all, Sincoplas considers this type of action as an investment for the future. ""Our customers increasingly tend to integrate their supplier's environmental impact in their selection grid. The reduction in GHG emissions, along with eco-design, will become the norm. One or both of these requirements is now included systematically in the briefs that we receive."" So why not jump the gun straight away to not have to rush and bear the brunt afterwards. Especially since it is not always easy to bring together sometimes opposing demands. ""In our industry, the environmental variable adds up to strong price pressure, combined with a requirement to remain uncompromising on luxury codes. The only solution is to act methodically by giving oneself the time to find the best technical solutions,"" Patrice Lhomme."
Ethical sourcing and biodiversity: rising values within the cosmetics industry,"Premium Beauty News - The UEBT has repeatedly drawn the attention of cosmetic manufacturers on the notion of ethical sourcing. In 2010 you were stressing particularly on the lack of credibility of the cosmetic industry on this issue. How have things changed since? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - In 2010 we did indeed highlight that consumers have a very low trust in the cosmetics sector (30%) practicing ethical sourcing. Over the last years these figures have not really improved. However, we do see an important prise de conscience in the cosmetics sector. Various brands have intensified efforts on ethical sourcing. Biodiversity is also becoming more important in their corporate and other communication. From 2009 to 2011 the percentage of companies of the top 100 beauty companies that mentioned biodiversity in their corporate communications went up from 13 to 27%. Premium Beauty News – Involving the private sector in the protection of biodiversity, is also an important part of your partnership with the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity. What are your plans? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - For 2020 the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has set an ambitious target to raise public and private sector awareness on biodiversity. Through its Biodiversity Barometer UEBT supports the CBD Secretariat in measuring this target. Another important goal for 2020 is putting in practice principles on access to biodiversity for research and development, as well as equitable sharing of resulting benefits. Through its hands-on work with companies on this issue, UEBT also makes a contribution to realising this target. Premium Beauty News – Your barometer on the awareness of biodiversity now covers nine countries, including India, Peru and Brazil. What are the main trends? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - The results of the 2012 edition of the Biodiversity Barometer will be presented on 12 April during our annual conference. We are currently analysing the results, but overall we see an increasing awareness on biodiversity at the level of the consumers and private sector in the surveyed countries. With this awareness, consumer expectations regarding companies' sourcing practices are shown to be growing as well. Premium Beauty News - In Europe, do economic uncertainties weigh on these issues? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - Yes, this is certainly having an impact. Companies are focusing on economic variables, and are cautious to engage in new initiatives. Yet, there are also opportunities. In these challenging times a commitment to ethical sourcing may further bind the consumers giving them something to feel good about. We also see that companies are looking for growth outside Europe in emerging markets. In these markets, like is the case in Brazil, biodiversity is an important aspect of ethical sourcing. Premium Beauty News – You are organizing in April in Paris a new conference intended for the beauty sector. What will be the main themes? Rik Kutsch Lojenga - Our 2012 Beauty of Sourcing with Respect conference will explore sustainability trends in emerging markets. There will be an opportunity to learn about concrete initiatives of companies such as Symrise Brazil and Laboratoires Expanscience to mainstream ethical sourcing of biodiversity in their operations. Examples of the strong links between biodiversity and innovation will also be presented in the conference, including initiatives in the Amazon, led by Natura Cosmetics, and in Southern Africa, promoted by Phytotech."
"Sustainable development, a strategic focus for the entire beauty industry","This is the first time that the BeautyFull Club called upon students of a business school to carry out such a survey. The idea of such a survey was announced the club's general assembly which was held at MakeUp in Paris in June 2011. A challenge, which was took up just six months later. Champions of product innovation, selective brands from the perfume and cosmetic industry should also communicate on their good practices in terms of sustainable development. A key challenge in a large number of countries where consumers are extremely sensitive the preservation of ecosystems. The study commissioned by the BeautyFull Club stresses on the need for exemplarity at all levels of the value-added chain. Starting with the ingredients which are essential to the formulas. Packaging manufacturers also have an important responsibility. With of course the key role played by the brands' industrial process and the supply chain to the point of sale where consumers want to find a clear and reliable information on the practices of brands in terms of sustainable development. Because that is the heart of the matter: consumers need benchmarks to identify the selective brands who are virtuous in terms of sustainable development. It is up to the industry players to organize themselves to collect the necessary data for a transparent information from one end of the chain, to the other and maintain consumer confidence. Thus, the BeautyFull Club projects to establish a summary chart of key commitments in terms of sustainable development for the high end beauty sector, and to promote good practices in the selective perfume and cosmetic industry. The BeautyFull Club will also shortly begin the creation of a working group gathering representatives from the selective perfume and cosmetic industry to define the specific challenges of the industry and of sustainable development. The aim also being to reflect on the communication tools to use with consumers to provide them with clear and reliable information in the point of sale. Among other ideas that were presented on January 19, 2012, during the meeting of the BeautyFull Club: interactive applications for consumers and regular publications to support the perception of progress achieved in terms of sustainable development. For your immediate participation to the forum on Sustainable Development hosted by the club's new site, please click on the following link: www.beautyfullclub.com Through these series of studies carried out by students from high schools - the next presentation will be conducted by four students from the Centrale Paris engineering school, Department of Industrial Engineering - the BeautyFull Club is true to its mission of contributing to the emergence of innovative ideas for the Beauty industry."
"""Environmental concerns are transforming hotel cosmetics,"" Marie-Cécile Pineau, GM Group","Premium Beauty News - You launched at the end of 2011 the Cosmébio-Ecocert certified Damana Organic Bath Line. What is the demand like from hotels on this type of product? Marie-Cécile Pineau - We all know that the trend for natural and organic products remains strong among consumers of cosmetics. This is a global and durable underlying consumer trend. With this new range, which complements the N-KI Organic Bath Line launched in 2009, we offer a new solution to help hotel managers meet this customer demand. These certified lines offer them real guarantees concerning the ingredients and manufacturing processes involved. Premium Beauty News - Your group is specialized in guest amenities for hotels. You are one of the market leaders, but you are little known? Marie-Cécile Pineau - The GM Group is a family business founded in 1988 by Georges Marchand, which is now managed by his children. With a network of 24 exclusive distributors, the GM Group is present in hotels the world over, in 60 countries on five continents. It is true that we prefer promoting our distributors, however I can assure you that decision makers in large international groups know us well. From its inception, the group reinvented the concept of guest amenities in the hospitality industry by signing licensing agreements with major cosmetic brands like L'Oréal, Ô de Lancôme, Nina Ricci, Yves Rocher. Today we manage a portfolio of thirty brands that we are always striving to develop. We also have a service for creating made to measure exclusive lines. But we have no intent of putting ourselves forward. Our products must bring added value to our hotel partners and the brands we are working with, although from a legal point of view, we are the ones responsible for placing on the market. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how do you manage the regulatory constraints of this market very international by nature? Marie-Cécile Pineau - Given our position as a global player, it is a requirement that our products comply with all regulations. As a result, we sometimes have to put up to ten different languages on our product packagings, which are by definition, very small in size. To this must added compulsory indications such as the list of ingredients, the name of the person in charge of placing on the market and the period after opening (PAO). But this is very well managed by a highly specialized and professional cosmetic team who stays aware of any regulatory changes and ensures that ingredients used are in full compliance with the regulations of the markets on which we operate. This enables us to guarantee the safety and compliance of our products to hotel owners, they are aware of that and trust us. We have been operating on this marketplace for over 30 years and the fact we work with big names in cosmetics has enabled us to acquire a highly specialized expertise in this area. The placing on the market of hotel cosmetics meets the same regulatory requirements as the marketing of any other cosmetic products, we are faced with the same constraints. The evolution of the European legislation, with the entry into force of the Cosmetic Regulations also represents for us a real challenge, that will result in additional costs. But despite the difficulties they may cause, regulatory constraints are quite manageable for well organized companies. Especially since these new constraints will also result in substantial advantages for consumers. And I also believe that they will help remove from the market some non-compliant products that are still sometimes found in some hotels. Premium Beauty News - What are the other particularities of the market of guest supplies? Marie-Cécile Pineau - It is a very diversified market where the price pressure is considerable. Diversified because we must meet the needs of all size customers. In practice, this goes from the small 10 room hotel to mammoth hotel structures of more than 5,000 rooms in Las Vegas. Not to mention hotel chains agreements, which imply that we must be able to deliver in all countries where the hotel groups are present. The type of demands also varies a lot. A line of guest amenities usually includes individual body and shampoo doses, ranging from 20 to 40 ml, soap, and additional products such as bath salts, hand creams, sewing and manicure kits, etc. Without forgetting the stand for the products. We have a global offer, that also takes account of the specific local conditions in the different countries and cultures, as sizes and usages may vary widely from country to country. The Nordic countries for example, have a strong preference for rechargeable dispensers rather than individual products. In the U.S. products will be larger in size than in Europe. Also in the U.S., shampoos and conditioners must be presented in separate containers. In Europe, on the contrary, people appreciate the convenience of a 2-in-1 hair and body product. Not to mention preferences in terms of scents, that can vary considerably from one area to another. As hoteliers offer these products to their customers, they are often tempted to limit costs on this line item. We must be able to meet all requests staying in a price range below 30 cents per product! But image is an important factor, don't forget that guest amenities are among the first things a customer will notice when he enters his room: product design, presentation and brand name also have a lot of importance for the room enhancement and the perception a customer will have of it. For a cosmetic brand, it is an extraordinary showcase to help reach a targeted customer category. To meet demand from the hotel industry, we have two factories in Europe, one in France and one in Portugal. We also rely on a network of subcontractors around the world including in China to serve the Asian and North American markets. Premium Beauty News - In such a context, how does your offer for natural and organic products find its place? Marie-Cécile Pineau - Quit naturally! This is another constraint of the equation, hotel managers are aware of the difficulty of the exercise and of its impact on prices but they have a strong customer demand for these products. It is a challenge for us and for them. Volumes are still low, mainly because of price constraints. But the trend for natural and environmentally products is strong. Increasingly, in the specifications of their invitations to tender, our customers add sustainable development criteria. A concern for the environment is becoming the norm. Although they are not the only solution nor a panacea environmentally speaking, it is obviously within such a context that natural and organic products find their place. Always with these environmental concerns in mind, the GM Group offers Ecosource, an exclusive solution - with an European Ecolabel certification - consisting in a refillable dispenser that can contain thanks to its airless pouch, preservative-free sensitive formulas. Over 70,000 dispensers of this type have been installed in hotels of our customers around the world. In the coming years, sustainable development will certainly be in our area, the source of many technological innovations but also of changes in consumption patterns."
Industry invited to join the fight against biodiversity loss,"The trend towards an increased use of natural ingredients for the formulation of cosmetic products is raising many questions regarding the sustainability of sourcing practices. The shift from oil-based plastics to plant-derived polymers for the manufacture of packaging is raising similar concerns, since the extension of dedicated sugarcane or corn crops may be detrimental to sensitive natural areas. According to the Union for Ethical BioTRade (UEBT), a Geneva-headquartered non-profit association that promotes the ""sourcing with respect"" of ingredients coming from the world's biodiversity, cosmetics companies source extensively from the natural world, relying on biodiversity to create innovative ingredients for their products. Through the Memorandum of Understanding signed on August 18 with the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UEBT intend to participate in the fight to halt biodiversity loss by increasing public awareness and promoting the engagement of the business community in biodiversity protection. The CBD Secretariat and the UEBT will work together to communicate on the value of biodiversity, in particular by communicating the results of UEBT's Biodiversity Barometer, which provides an annual overview of biodiversity awareness in the world. According to the UEBT, biodiversity awareness has risen worldwide among consumers and business. When asked if they had heard about biodiversity, an average of 65% of the people interviewed in the USA, France, Germany and the UK said yes in February 2011, up from 56% in February 2009. In the same period, 27% of the world's top 100 beauty companies mentioned biodiversity in their reporting, up from 13% in 2009. Engaging the private sector in biodiversity protection is the other important element in the collaboration between the CBD Secretariat and UEBT, said both organisations. ""The business community can help advance the CBD objectives, which are biodiversity conservation, its sustainable use and the equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. Implementing ethical sourcing practices is one way that companies can contribute to these objectives,"" added Rik Kutsch Lojenga, UEBT's Executive Director. In this regard, the UEBT's barometer shows that only 40% of the consumers are confident that cosmetics companies source biodiversity in an ethical manner (i.e. in an environmentally and socially responsible way) and 80% of those interviewed would have more faith in a company that is being verified externally."
Carbon footprint: Swedish cardboard maker Iggesund prides itself on exemplarity,"Premium Beauty News - From cradle to grave! An image that you are claiming? Guy Mallinson - Yes, absolutely! The Holmen group which includes Iggesund is one of the few groups in the world in the paper industry to have its own forests. They are superior in size to the entire forest of the Landes Region in France. Forests consisting of more than 70% of pine trees and birch trees and ranging in age from 0 to 90 years depending of planting times and exploitation times. The Holmen Group is not only one of the largest Swedish forest owners but produces more than 30 million seedlings annually from managed forests which are, of course, FSC and PEFC certified. And when I say ""managed"", I should add ""carefully managed"" with a yield that hasn't stopped increasing in sixty years from 50 m3 to 115 m3 per hectare. Premium Beauty News - Reducing the carbon footprint has become a major issue both vital and global. A recent survey has shown that there was virtually no articles on this subject in the world press in 2005 and that more than 35,000 of them were identified last year! Guy Mallinson - And in the paper industry, I think we are now clearly among the best placed to talk about it. I would like to recall the definition of this concept of carbon footprint: ""It is the measurement of the impact of human activities on the increase of the production of greenhouse gases, that is to say of carbon dioxide, these emissions being primarily due to the use of fossil fuels."" At Iggesund, I can tell you that this awareness did not start just yesterday, but that on the contrary, it is almost part of the company's genes and that we have long since integrated and constantly adjusted the main constraints of our business which are namely the production of greenhouse gases, originating mainly from our industrial tool implemented to process wood and its bi-products, because of the use of fuels and of other raw materials, not to mention the impact represented by the production of steam, of heat or cold, as well as transportation. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us a figure that illustrates the progress your made in this area? Guy Mallinson - Yes of course! If I take, for example, as a reference, Invercote, our range of cardboard, its carbon footprint measured five years ago was of 485 kg/t. This year, we are at 258 kg/t, i.e. half what it was in 2006. The major gains were achieved upstream at the level of our forests exploitation and, downstream, at the end of life level of our products. Premium Beauty News - In this area, is this pro-active and consistent policy going to gain momentum? Guy Mallinson - To further reduce our CO2 emissions, we are currently investing 240 million and 120 million euros respectively in our plants in Sweden and in the UK, which is the equivalent of two thirds of our turnover. I recall that our industrial flexibility is always the same on these topics: Produce without using fossil fuels, be self-sufficient in terms of energy production, zero discharge of waste in the environment, use products that can be recycled or re-used for bio-energy, only discharge water that won't affect in any possible way the fragile ecosystems of the Baltic. Premium Beauty News - Efforts that also involve a continuous improvement of your industrial tool in terms of productivity! Guy Mallinson - That's right! The productivity of our factories is steadily increasing and we are reducing as much as possible the impact of our activities on the environment."
Shiseido wants to become greener,"Shiseido considers the reduction of its CO2 emissions worldwide as part of its ""basic environmental activities"". Concerning its production sites in Japan, the cosmetics maker claims to have reached its initial goal for 2010, that is to say a 15% reduction compared to 1990. In the USA, thanks to the use of solar panels at its production unit, the company's original target to reduce emissions by 10% versus the 2007 level has been dramatically surpassed as the reduction reached more than 20%. [1] Starting from the current fiscal year, new targets have been established for both production and non-production sites in Japan and abroad. In addition to the reduction of CO2 emissions, Shiseido wants to improve the sustainability of its products throughout their entire life cycle, from research and development and the supply of raw materials to their use and final disposal by consumers. To that end, the company will promote the use of plant-based containers and bagasse paper [2], and will encourage recycling activities. Thus, efforts to develop and expand the use of eco-friendly containers within the group will start with the shift to sugarcane-based polyethylene containers for shampoo, body care and other products. In 2008, Shiseido concluded a joint development agreement with Braskem S.A., a Brazilian chemical manufacturer, and Japan's Toyota Tsusho Corporation, with the aim to secure its supply in sugarcane-based polyethylene cosmetic containers. In order to inform consumers about the company's commitment, products using plant-based plastic containers will be labelled with the ""Shiseido Earth Care Project"" logo. Similarly, products whose containers comprise more than 20% (ratio by weight) of plant-based plastics will be labelled with the Shiseido's ""Plant-Based Plastic Container"" mark. The switch to bagasse paper is planned to start in 2012, on the Japanese market for new cosmetic product developments and product renewal requiring paper. Eventually, the use of refills should concern all the company's foundations [3], face powders and jumbo size shampoos and conditioners, as well as more than 70% of skincare products by 2020."
Green Academy: the future of hairdressing salons by L'Oréal,"According to L'Oréal, the future of hairdressing salons will be a mix of technology and ecology. In order to illustrate this conviction, the world leader in the cosmetics market, just opened its first Green Academy in Madrid. The main purpose highlighted by the group is to improve awareness and to increase familiarity with: ""with environmental values and sustainability among professionals in this sector."" The project stems from the Professional Products Division of the company marketing the L'Oréal Professionnel, Kérastase, Kéraskin, Redken, Matrix and Pureology brands for hairdressers. This eco-sustainable Academy is located at the company's headquarters in Madrid. The location will devoted to the training of Spanish professionals about the use of L'Oréal products. According to the cosmetics giant, which claims a 30% share of the market in the country, more than a half of the 35,000 Spanish hairdressing salons, distribute and use its products In addition to this training purpose, the L'Oréal's Green Academy is also seeking to instil future generations of professionals in this sector with respect for the environment – according to L'Oréal estimates, more than 8,000 hairdressers will be trained here each year. L'Oréal's Green Academy pays special importance to recycling products. It features the so-called recycling wall, a glass panel on which to deposit all containers used in the centre's day-to-day activities: plastic, paper, card, aerosols, glass and aluminium. The harnessing and re-use of water take on a leading role in this project, through a display of recycled water exhibited in a public area for contemplation as well as the raising of awareness about the use of water. In order to decrease water consumption, the flow rate of the hair-washing nozzles has been reduced notably. Concerning energy consumption, 80% of which is due to the site heating and to hair drying, L'Oréal's Professional Products Division is working with the industry to offer hairdressers solutions with a lower energy impact. Specifically, L'Oréal is studying with a manufacturer the design of a hairdryer that will last 5 times as long, and with more power but the same consumption as a conventional dryer and able to finish the work more quickly, with the subsequent savings in energy. Similarly, the academy's air temperature is controlled through the application of ""solar cooling"", a technology allowing the integration of heating, cooling and hot water into a single system. A very specific attention was also paid to the materials used for fitting the facility: FSC certified wood, 100%-recyclable steel, recycled aluminium, panels made from 65% fir fibres and 35% mineral agglomerates, as well as photocatalytic ceramics and paint that are anti-pollutant, self-cleaning and antibacterial. Furthermore, environmentally-friendly materials have been used in all joinery work. The furniture and part of the flooring have been made from ecomat, a material obtained from recycled plastic combined with olive pits. The panels used in the walls are made from gypsum and cellulose fibre obtained from recycled paper. The opening of the Green Academy is part of L'Oréal's sustainability strategy that features three fundamental long-term targets for the group's factories and distribution centres between 2005 and 2015: a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, in water for each finished product and in waste generated by each finished product. Some of the company's prime examples in the field of sustainability and respect for the environment can be found in its Burgos factory, which has set itself the goal of being CO2 emissions-neutral by 2015, and it is also encouraging the inhouse generation of energy: the factory at Libramont (Belgium) inaugurated its new biogas centre last year to ensure the plant uses 100% green energy and is carbon- neutral."
Luxury paper bags and the environment: responses from PAK 2000,"200 million bags, 65 million euros in turnover, PAK 2000 remains one of the world's leading designer - manufacturer of high end paper bags and cardboard set boxes for famous luxury houses, and more specifically leading perfume and cosmetic brands. ""Clearly the environmental trend has become more and more present on the market in recent months. We can estimate that currently 20% to 30% of the market is concerned and this trend can only but accelerate. A movement that finds its origin mainly in France, Italy and Germany,"" Éric Blanche explained. ""And the solutions that we are providing today are fully in line with our clients expectations."" Main decision taken by the managers from the company, to offer a range of bags made from paper the traceability of which being a proof environmental respect (FSC and PEFC certified papers and factories) and with suppliers and converter also being certified. ""Which is the case with the ten partner factories with whom we are working!"" said Éric Blanche. A development that does not just concern bags but also accessories such as cords which are more and more made with natural cotton. Not to mention printing inks which are made from vegetable materials and glues which are water based. Finally, an evolution, which does not, on the contrary, keep the company from progressing each day a little more technically. These last months have been particularly rich on this point with the development of very special techniques allowing a deep embossing or with the use of paper combining a soft touch with very sophisticated hot stamping. Key challenges for the team of PAK 2000 for the months ahead: – Accompany brands with paper bags that are authentic image and communication vehicles. – Develop the industrial capacity while ensuring cost control. – Capitalize on our capacity to innovate, improve responsiveness and the range of solutions. – Continue to provide solutions for the development of environmentally friendly products."
Plant-based plastic bottles for Pantene shampoos,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) has made another step forward onits way to sustainability. It is no longer about evaluating its suppliers' performance, but to operate a dramatic transformation to one of its best-selling products. Indeed, the giant US maker of consumer goods just announced it has started producing new bottles made primarily from plant-based plastic for shampoos and conditioners of the Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion line. The new bottles will be initially launching in Western Europe with expansion plans to the rest of the world over the next two years. This innovative material is made from sugarcane, a natural and renewable resource, as opposed to traditional plastic which is made from petroleum. According to P&G, sugarcane-derived plastic has significant environmental benefits: compared to traditional petroleum-based plastic it allows reducing fossil fuels consumption by more than 70% and releases over 170% less greenhouse gases. P&G's goal is to replace 25% of petroleum-based materials with sustainably sourced renewable materials by 2020. The group's long-term vision is to use 100% renewable or recycled materials on all of its products. The new Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion sugarcane-based packaging will become available across several Western European markets over the summer and autumn. According tout P&G it should be a seamless transition for consumers as the formulas will remain unchanged and the new bottle has virtually identical characteristics to its predecessor and it is as recyclable as before. ""The use of sugarcane-based plastic in our Nature Fusion packaging allows us to offer the same performance consumers expect from Pantene but in a more sustainable way,"" says Hanneke Faber, P&G's Vice President & Brand Franchise Leader for Global Pantene."
"Agricultural sourcing in the beauty industry: beware of boomerang effects, says Organic Monitor","Environmental benefits are often cited as a reason for switching to plant-based raw materials. Indeed, apart from being renewable, these substances often have a lower environmental footprint than petroleum-based counterparts. ""However, the diverting of agricultural land from food crops to make cosmetic ingredients raises many ethical and ecological questions,"" says Organic Monitor. According to the market research firm, there is a risk that the increasing use of plant crops in the cosmetics industry sparks a similar debate than for agrofuel crops, with cosmetics makers being blamed for jeopardizing human food resources. ""Food security is becoming a major global concern because of rising food prices and scarcity of agricultural land. The global population is expected to rise by 50% to over 9 billion in 2050, however agricultural land is projected to decrease over this period,"" explain researchers at Organic Monitor. Such a concern is nothing new. It was raised a few years ago when the prices raw materials, energy and feedstock started to rise. According to Michel Griffon, agronomist and economist, it is unlikely that in the near future agriculture be able to produce enough biofuels, and plant-derived chemicals, and to feed all of humanity and preserve biodiversity at the same time. In any case, he wrote in Feeding the planet [1], none of these goals will be accessible without a breakthrough ecological transformation of farming technics, a ""doubly green revolution"". Actually, the beauty industry needs to ensure that the agro-ingredients used for making or packaging its products are sustainable sourced. Organic Monitor sees some early indicators that sustainable sourcing tends to become mandatory in the beauty industry, rather than a preferred option. In Europe, L'Oreal and Unilever, for instance, have already made commitments to sustainable sourcing. In the US, Wal-Mart is putting pressure on its suppliers to adopt sustainability practices. In addition, the media and NGOs are also putting pressure on companies worldwide. In the near future, more ingredients could go the way as palm oil, for which leading beauty firms have pledged to only source from Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)-approved companies. ""Similar sustainable roundtables exist for soya and cocoa, and others are in the pipeline. A number of other sustainability schemes, labels and standards are emerging,"" says Organic Monitor. Natural and organic cosmetic standards already include some sustainability requirements, but brands may want to extend the scope of their claims through additional certifications. Fair trade is an example, in particular in the UK with Boots, Bulldog and Bubble & Balm. Other companies, such as the Brazilian ingredients supplier Beraca have integrated biodiversity into their sourcing programmes. Climate change is yet another issue diverting attention to sustainable sourcing practices, which are likely to become a key factor of success for cosmetics and personal care brands in the very next future."
P&G to launch next step of its suppliers sustainability assessment program,"Created in cooperation with 20 leading supplier representatives globally, and deployed about a year ago to nearly 400 strategic suppliers, P&G's Suppliers Scorecard was designed to track and encourage improvement on key environmental sustainability measures in the company's supply chain. The first year was focused on assessing whether the company would receive clear data on the environmental footprint from its suppliers, including energy use, water use, waste disposal, and greenhouse gas emissions. Other goals were to evaluate the possibility to measure future improvements, and to share ideas to jump-start innovation related to sustainability. According to Procter & Gamble this initial phase was a success since most suppliers demonstrated their ability to track the requested key sustainability measures and that the process of innovation sharing had begun. Indeed, one great satisfaction for P&G is that the scorecard encourages its partners to share innovation ideas to improve the sustainability footprint of the business. According to the company, about 40% of the scorecards received during the year offered at least one innovation idea with some of these having moved forward to become actual projects. ""It was the scorecard that jumpstarted those projects,"" said Larry Loftus, Director of purchases capability and strategy. ""I believe that many of the opportunities we identified through this process will result not only in environmental sustainability improvements but also in improvements to our bottom line as well as growth for our business partners."" Indeed, collecting data was not the only purpose of this initiative, which was led by P&G's purchases department. ""The scorecard is the right tool to give us that snapshot across our supply chain so we can identify where to focus our collective supply network sustainability efforts, develop ideas to work on together, and reward those who excel,"" said Rick Hughes, P&G's Chief purchasing officer. Beginning this year, the results of the scorecard will affect supplier performance ratings, and will therefore impact a supplier's opportunity for future business. Suppliers will be evaluated and given a score from 1-5. Those showing exceptional sustainability performance will be publicly rewarded, while those that do not score well will have to implement sustainability improvement plans based on the scorecard results before being reassessed to measure progress over time. For 2011, P&G will expand the list of suppliers participating in the program to about 600. Furthermore, the company has made a few changes based on partner input. These modifications include in particular a clearer process to allow partners to exclude measures that don't apply; a more transparent and consistent rating methodology. The updated scorecard is available at www.pgsupplier.com"
"Laboratoires Jérodia, riding on the green breaker","Nothing seems to stop Thierry Logre! The Laboratoires Jérodia (comprising the brands Phyt's, Laboratoires Dérmatologiques Gamarde and BioNatural) never stop innovating, to the point that their CEO is almost considered a pioneer and a visionary, a kind of Steve Jobs in natural and organic cosmetics. When he took over the reins of Jérodia in April 2004, this former manager from the Laboratoires Pierre Fabre intends to pursue but also develop the spirit of a company - founded in 1972 - based on the principles of Biocosmetics, textures and original formulations and 100% Natural. And that strategy paid off since Phyt's is currently the leading brand in beauty parlours in France and, building on its capabilities in R&D, Jérodia successfully launched in 2009 Phyt's Organic Make Up, the first bio cosmetic brand certified Cosmébio on all its references. To date, Phyt's is still considered a pioneer in the segment of organic make-up, with an almost complete range since only nail polishes are not available. ""We just had to overcome a few difficulties with bright reds for the lips"", explains Logre, modestly. And it was an immediate success, the line being acclaimed for its quality. ""More and more professional make-up artists are looking for this type of product."" As a result: this start-up makes-up Marion Cotillard for her role in Les Petits Mouchoirs, Guillaume Canet's film which was released late 2010. A success which is probably due to a concern for quality and know-how developed for over 37 years. At Jérodia there is no compromising on principles. The Laboratoires Phyt's never use any preservatives, not even the ones authorized by Cosmébio. ""They never used the exemption authorizing the use of ingredients containing low doses of preservatives"", explains Nathalie Mathan, in charge of the group's communications. Skincare products from Phyt's are made from 100% natural ingredients with no synthetic substance. This originality, which makes of Phyt's a exception in the world of cosmetics as much as one within Cosmébio is only possible thanks to a remarkable know-how in terms of stability and protection of formulas and the systematic use of packaging featuring a barrier effect. Of course, environmental requirements extend beyond formulas, to also encompass packaging. Cosmébio specifications prohibits the use of packaging that would not be biodegradable or recyclable. A plastic such as SAN, which widely used in make-up and which is not 100% recyclable is automatically excluded. ""It's almost as complicated to manage as the formula itself"", emphasises Logre. Another characteristic: Phyt's is a local and independent producer. With 200 employees in France and over 20 million euros in turnover, the group develops in its research centre and formulates in its own laboratories, the entire range of Phyt's cosmetic products. When Jérodia started in make-up, it installed its own production lines, including the purchase of loose and compact powder blenders. ""Everything we sell, is made by us, there is not one single product which doesn't come from our R&D centre."" It is a way of being sure to stay in line with the quality and environmental specifications of the company. ""Our manufacturing process is very stringent. For example, we never use chlorine to wash our machines. We also have a settling and filtration tank, thus we are sure that the water discharged into the environment is clean"". This production capacity, Thierry Logre, obviously wanted to make it profitable by making it available for the many brands seeking to enter the market of natural and organic cosmetics in both skincare and make-up. Thus the Jérodia group created the Bio lines of Marionnaud and of Biguine, and that of the American brand L'Uvalla and also has clients in South Korea and Japan. Furthermore globalisation is today, the main objective of the group wishing to quickly achieve in Asia the same turnover it does in France."
Did you say Eco-design?,"Premium Beauty News - What does your offer consist of today? Jean-Baptiste Puyou - We help our customers innovate by integrating sustainable development in their product and service offer with: – Know-how: eco-design, eco-design and creativity, training, monitoring of R&D projects... – Methodologies: LCA, carbon footprint, products environmental labelling... – LCA and eco-design-dedicated softwares such as SimaPro, e-DEA and WINTED. Premium Beauty News - Communication is an essential parameter! Jean-Baptiste Puyou - First of all and it is an obvious fact, credible and responsible communication can only truly concern products carrying with them values and environmental performance. We can then work on the formatting: eco-design the communication media, check the claims and the visuals using a systematic method like ""Preuv'"" that we have developed. The environmental issue reminds us of the basic rules: the coherence between substance and form secures the communication, and it requires teamwork. Design, Purchasing, Marketing, Sales force, etc., must integrate and anticipate market expectations and let customers be aware of the approaches and achievements. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some examples of this approach in the perfumery and cosmetic segment? Jean-Baptiste Puyou - Yes, I can give you several. Thus, we have helped L'Occitane conduct the Life Cycle Analysis of washing bases. This study has helped put forward eco-design recommendations and the creation of a dedicated position. This approach was supported by Ademe [1]. Another example, Kenzo. Now, the perfume Flower by Kenzo is re-fillable: once emptied it can be refilled at a fountain in an outlet or withthe purchase of a refill. This approach was subject to a communication that we tested before its launch with our ""Preuv'"" methodology... Finally there is Albéa, who is using e-DEA, our eco-design tool and with whom we have specific developments underway."
Gerresheimer: a recycled but beautiful glass for Garnier,"Garnier, L'Oreal's cosmetics and toiletries mass-market brand, has just moved on to the next stage in its search to minimize the environmental impact of its packaging. Garnier is now using a 40% recycled glass in the glass pots of its face care products produced by German glassmaker Gerresheimer: a first for a brand in the mass market channe. For obtaining a material that is as beautiful and transparent as virgin glass, Gerresheimer has developed a specific technical process. The glass comes from a controlled source. After having been collected, sorted, cleaned and ground up according to ""a leading-edge process,"" a high-class cullet is obtained. This cullet is then re-introduced into the glass manufacturing cycle in order to make new glass. The process helps reduce the environmental impact of the glass packaging used by Garnier, through energy savings, the reduction of CO2 emissions, and the preservation of natural resources. Indeed, according to Gerresheimer, the energy needed to melt the recycled glass (cullet) is less than that used to melt virgin glass. So, incorporating 40% recycled glass in the Garnier face care pots means a 9% reduction in the amount of energy used during manufacturing. The decrease in the energy consumed by the furnace then reduces CO2 emissions and thus also the impact on global warming. Gerresheimer estimates CO2 saving during the manufacturing process reaches 29 tons (the estimation for the full year is 58 tons). Eventually, using recycled glass reduces the need to use non-renewable natural resources that are used to make glass (in particular silica, soda, lime). In parallel, Garnier informs consumers on the importance of selective collection and will stick environmental messages on its skin care packaging in order to draw their attention on the advantages of recycled glass."
Eco-design: Chanel proposes a new software to the entire industry,"Premium Beauty News - What is the starting point of your approach? Michel Dupuis - In 2007, the group's Quality Management decided to undertake a carbon footprint of its activities. The main conclusion after a few months was: ""our products packaging represent half of our emissions."" They are followed by such items as logistics/shipping/freight and just after by the transport of people. We obviously gave thought to what we could do to reduce our environmental impact. It was first necessary to refine the existing database on carbon emissions related to the materials and processes used in the trade, which led us to contact all our suppliers in order to obtain additional technical information. But There is more to this. We wanted to go further and integrate other environmental indicators such as the depletion of non renewable resources, air acidification, depletion of the ozone layer, water eutrophication [1] and photochemical oxidation [2]. Premium Beauty News - Work that could only lead to the finding of an appropriate tool! Michel Dupuis - Yes, of course! And it's the approach proposed by the Evea company that seemed the most relevant to help us design a common tool, leading to ""Winted"". All this takes place in 2009! Winted offers both a technical approach on design and an overall view of results obtained through innovations and packaging enhancements. It helps better understand the origin of environmental impacts and presents areas of improvements and check-lists to go further.This software is intended for all corporate stakeholders involved in developing new packaging with several possible levels of use. It allows to address eco-design issues throughout the whole development process. Premium Beauty News - An approach that goes beyond Chanel's framework! Michel Dupuis - Yes, and this obviously surprised a few, when we decided to make this software freely available for the whole industry, packaging manufacturers but also our colleagues in the trade. We had questioned ourselves: ""Do we need to keep all this for ourselves?"" Very quickly, the answer was no! It appeared normal to us to make this tool available for everyone, knowing that it was an immediate and practical contribution that our group could bring to this great global cause which is the preservation of our environment. Moreover, we must be irreproachable vis-à-vis our customers on the quality of our products and their origin. When they purchase a Chanel product, they have totally integrated the fact that we are doing everything in our power to offer them high quality products. It therefore seemed normal to pioneer such a global approach and thus help things move forward!"
L'Occitane: eco-design as a global process,"L'Occitane is currently preparing the implementation of a system to help measure and reduce the environmental impact of its products, and participates inthe French experimentation of the environmental information for consumer goods. Explanations from Philippe de Brugière, CSR Director, Packaging Forecasting and International Production Development. Premium Beauty News - Environment is not strictly speaking a novelty for L'Occitane! Philippe de Brugière - Of course not! It's part of its ""genetic heritage"". Because, right from the outset when the company was created in 1976, at the instigation of its founder, Olivier Baussan, who was very concerned about the future of the planet, he decided to use only recyclable materials. In 2007, a new impetus was given to this approach with the will to organise a real eco-design approach, led by the Packaging Development but not limited to this question as it deals also with ingredients and formulas. And concerning printed packaging, we favour plain eco-designed packs, sourced from FSC paper (Forest Stewardship Council). We prefer using water-based inks and chose suppliers responding to the ""Imprim' Vert"" label. We have decided to use as little as possible such finishing techniques as vacuum metallization or hot stamping and to design separable packaging (pumps and screw caps) to make our products end of life sorting easier. All this resulted in a ""Guideline manual on eco-design"" which very methodically presents different materials and components. Actually, there are three decision levels: a first level of concrete and systematically implementable decisions, a second level of approved decisions but which are not applicable to all processes and all materials (e.g., water-soluble lacquering), and finally a third-level concerning options which have not yet been industrially validated and the process of which has not been fully quantified, but that we are nonetheless committed to develop. Logically, this led internally to the creation and implementation of a qualitative eco-design grid for each product with about fourteen criteria representing all the questions that must be considered for a packaging product in the prospect of a new eco-designed development. We have also launched, a process to measure the environmental impact of all our current products using the Life Cycle Analysis method (LCA), which is entirely supervised by an engineer specialized in this field and who took office in 2009. This will be in fact the method on which we will build the product's environmental information intended for consumers, a multi criteria information but not only focusing on C02 emissions. Eco-design must also be considered as a continuous improvement principle. Premium Beauty News - Concretely, what did it lead to? Philippe de Brugière - This year again we have undertaken actions for improving our sustainable development process through the development of eco-refills, reusable bottles, recycled bottles, by changing snapped-on caps with screwable caps to simplify the sorting. Our approach to measure the environmental impact gives us the opportunity to question ourselves on all the relevant questions concerning eco-design (recyclability, choice of the raw material, environmental impact...) during project launches: by reducing the weight of our sample sachets, by integrating the code of ethics to specifications for suppliers which was signed by 100% of our sub-contractors and more than 96% of our suppliers, by providing consumers with the appropriate information on how to sort out our packaging. We have decided to use new materials such as recycled PET (100% recycled plastic) for some of our upcoming launches. In the new Verdon range launched in 2010, plastic and glass bottles are 100% post-consumer recycled, that is to say they come from the recycling of consumer products for the further effective realisation of the ""cradle to cradle"" concept. We have developed more eco-refills. And we seek to provide the guarantee of an ethically irreproachable sourcing in Asia (on some of our components or accessories, for example). Premium Beauty News - You are also using a LCA software for checking the packaging! Philippe de Brugière - That's right. And believe me, it is a path strewn with surprises. Let me give you an example: to make 1 kg of glass, 0.84 kg of CO2 are released. To make 1 kg of PET, 2 kg of CO² are released. On the face of it, glass is the winner. Well, in the case of a 250 ml glass bottle compared to an identical PET bottle, it's the other way around. PET is the winner! Because a 250 ml glass bottle weighs approximately 200 gr. And the same bottle in PET, only 30 gr. Do the math on it and you will see that glass is almost 3 times more impacting in C02. But be careful and don't forget that glass is infinitely recyclable, while PET is not... Premium Beauty News - What goals have you set yourselves with? Philippe de Brugière - They are ambitious! Zero landfill waste, the least possible consumption in energy, water, non-renewable materials and maximization of the sorting and recycling. We also want to facilitate the reuse of packaging by consumers. Our approach integrates the end consumer. We must help him improve his sorting so that he throws as little as possible. It is useless to buy so called ""virtuous"" materials and to not feel concerned afterwards about how the final consumer will deal with the product we sold him. Premium Beauty News - Your in-house training program on eco-design was a big success! Philippe de Brugière - If we actually had no doubts about that, it's true that it exceeded our expectations! All the people were volunteers. Following the training, we had to face internally, an explosion in requests to conduct impact measurements. Because today, in the development and validation process of new products, the appraisal intends to be irreproachable and honest. And sometimes it may occur that a whole range of products be rejected by the General Management if they do not successfully pass environmental criteria."
France to test environmental information as of July,"Nearly 170 companies, were selected among 230 volunteers, to participate to the experimentation phase on the environmental information on consumer products, starting in France as of 1 July 2011. Companies were selected on the base of the immediately operational nature of their project for a kick off on due time, and in order to set up a varied panel of products originating from all industry sectors and focused on current household consumption. Overall, about 1,000 products are concerned, mainly food and drinks, equipments (electrical, electronics, furniture), stationery and printing products, clothing, hygiene and cosmetic products. In the cosmetic sector, several companies were selected for this test phase, namely the Laboratoire Vendôme (Johnson & Johnson) with its shampoo and shower gel brand Le Petit Marseillais, L'Occitane en Provence, the L'Oréal group (Laboratoires Garnier), Natura Europe SAS, the French subsidiary of the Brazilian group, the Pierre Fabre Dermo Cosmétique group, with its brand Ducray, Sephora (LVMH) and Weleda. Contrary to what was already experimented in other countries in particular the UK, or by some distributors in France, the Ministry of Ecology has adopted a multi-criteria approach, which is not only limited to greenhouse gas emissions but also takes into account other product impacts, such as water pollution. The aim being to prevent pollution transfers. But the experimentation will be conducted in dispersed order. The ways in which the information is made available might therefore change from one product to another, in their form and in their content. For the time being, a number of companies have only made plans to communicate through paperless media such as the Internet and mobile phones, while others have undertaken to display information in stores or directly on their products, on the packaging or in their catalogues. As for the provided information, it will either be given in absolute value for some, in the form a note within a scale of 1 to 10 or even of graphics for others. On the side of the environmental federation, France Nature Environnement its members are more in favour of a single note, synthesizing several criteria, and easily visible on the product or its packaging. As regards calculation methods, again, they vary from one category to another and even from one product to another. The ADEME [1], the AFNOR [2] and industrialists have been working for several years on the elaboration of repositories for each product groups and databases. The majority of companies involved in the experimentation phase are also part of a collective. This is how, producers of detergent (Colgate-Palmolive SAS, Henkel France Mc Bride SAS, Novamex, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser France, Unilever) joined together for the purposes of an operation led by the AFISE (French association of detergents, and maintenance products industry). On the contrary, as regards cosmetics, the FEBEA (French trade association representing manufacturers specialised in beauty products), who conducted the working group in charge of developing a guide for the environmental information concerning shampoos, allowed its members to appear in a dispersed order. Main reason to this: serious differences of opinion among stakeholders, regarding the methodology to apply. Officials at the Ministry of Ecology tend to minimize these difficulties by stating that the objective of this experimentation is precisely to evaluate its technical and economic feasibility, to test various options so to only keep the most interesting ones. The ""consumers degree of visibility"" as well as the ""readability and comprehensibility of the different formats"" should as such represent key factors in the evaluation. In the immediate future, participating companies, most of them not being totally ready, must undertake or complete environmental analysis of the products they selected. The actual circulation of information to consumers will begin on 1 July 2011, when officially begins the experimentation phase, for a minimum period of one year. The evaluation of operations initiated by each company and the overall national experimentation will start in the second half of 2012. After the experimental phase, a report will be forwarded to the Parliament who will decide whether or not to generalize the system and make it compulsory."
POS equipment waste: What are the green answers?,"It is within this context that emerged the project of the Bergonzo company specialized in the organization of points of sale: through the systematic recovery of end of life POS equipment, the sorting of materials and the optimization of waste. More details from Thibault Romemont, Commercial Director of the French firm. Premium Beauty News - What is the weight of the POS equipment sector in France? Thibault de Romemont - POS equipment in France represented a market of 1,021 billion euros at the end 2008. As they were confronted to crisis, advertisers changed their strategy by choosing to highlight the value of their products directly in points of sale, to be as close as possible to the end consumer, as a result in 2008, expenditures for POS advertising progressed by 1.8%. The health and beauty sector is by far the largest consumer of POS equipment, far ahead of the food and beverage industries. Premium Beauty News - Is the environment really a concern for brands? Thibault de Romemont - Today, the ecological approach becomes every day more and more an integral part of the design specification for components of POS equipments and actively participates to a corporate responsibility process. Advertisers insist on the choice of mono-material to favour and facilitate recycling and also recommend the use of cardboard-made POS equipments because of its biodegradability. The issue is important because POS equipment represents large investments for displays of a very short lifespan (two weeks on average), which generates a lot of waste. Premium Beauty News - What do regulations provide regarding the recovery and treatment of such waste? Thibault de Romemont - In France the Environmental Code regulates the obligations of companies in terms of waste treatment and laid down the responsibility of any person who produces or possesses waste (article L.541-2) in case of damages or nuisance or pollution caused by these wastes or inadequate treatment processes. Premium Beauty News - Sorting out one's waste has become something natural! Thibault de Romemont - Indeed, when collection facilities are made available for them, nearly 7 in 10 households sort their waste. They also see to reduce their energy and water consumption. These ""green"" habits are now in fact - increasingly more - part of the French lifestyle. Beyond daily actions, surveys show that French are increasingly concerned by environment issues. Premium Beauty News - What is your project? Thibault de Romemont - Actually, it is nothing more and nothing less than to propose to distributors the management of their whole POS material from the warehouses to the outlets, with the aim to minimize the environmental impact, in particular the global warming potential (GWP) of the activity. That is to say: – Managing the receipt of POS equipments in our warehouses (all brands considered). – Picking and dispatch per outlet. – Delivery per outlet / and recovery of end of life POS equipment, every 15 days. – Installation (real-time reporting included) and dismounting /end of campaign report. – Storage and maintenance for reuse or recycling (environment). Premium Beauty News - It is the whole organization and logistics that need to be reviewed? Thibault de Romemont - Yes indeed, the delivery of the POS equipment in our warehouses needs to be performed between 5 or 2 working days before the date of installation according to a distribution per outlet communicated at the beginning of operation. We have several warehouses located throughout France, to total a storage area of more than 9,000m sqm (Evry, Lille, Nancy, Strasbourg, Lyon, Marseille, Ajaccio, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Tours, Rouen, Rennes). The equipment is checked by sampling and photo taking upon delivery (conformity of equipment, allocated quantities,...). Upon arrival in our warehouses the equipment is identified. A delivery record is sent to the customer. This receipt material procedure is subject to a detailed charter in use in all our agencies to ensure the reliability of the information transmitted. Regarding the supervision of installations, we guarantee the effective implementation of the entire POS equipment, on due date, and in compliance with display requirements. Each installation is subject to an immediate report posted on the extranet with pictures and an alert in the event of problems. The customer distributor or brand contact can follow live the smooth running of the installation. A tour report is issued at the end of each campaign. For each material recovery (cardboard packaging, end of life POS material, ...) the installer will have a specific document validated by the store manager or any other authorized person, indicating the number of m3 collected. A periodic report is sent to the client indicating the average volume of waste picked up per outlet during a given period. Our warehouses follow a charter committing them on the means implemented for waste management: sorting of materials, compacting of cardboard elements, dumping into the bin appropriate for each type of material, collection of the bins by an accredited company for destruction or recycling. Upon request, the record of destruction is given periodically to the customer distributor or to the brands. Premium Beauty News - What are the benefits for the distributor? Thibault de Romemont - Time saving and simplification of processes (see table here below). To note also among other additional benefits, the ability to enable beauty advisors to refocus on the main purpose of their occupation which is advising and selling, but also the outsourcing of these tasks who are time consuming. There is also a gain on additional sales area with the possibility of using the space previously dedicated to storage. The implementation of this process gives the possibility to go forward on environmental issues and to organize an appropriate management in the installation of POS equipments. Premium Beauty News - What are the benefits for brands? Thibault de Romemont - They obviously benefit from this Implementation of an environmental approach upon the destruction and recycling of their end of life POS equipments. They may also consider in a process of sustainable development, the optimization of POS material reusable after recovery. There is a possibility of considering a depreciation rate on reusable equipment according to the unit cost. And some other benefits can be considered: – Sharing of costs (logistics). – Optimization of current installation costs. – Sales force that focuses on its core business: selling and training. – The ability to supervise the smooth running of the installation of the POS in strict compliance with implementation dates and requirements for display. – Anticipating the possible late delivery and non-compliance of equipment."
Carbon balance: what to do next?,"The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to more sustainable modes of production remain important strategic issues. Certainly, the recent crisis has slowed down in this area as in others, the size of investments. But the basic trends of the market appear clearly in green. As for the regulatory framework, all the actors are anticipating a strengthening of the ""environmental constraint"". In France, the Article 75 of the Act of July 10, 2010 [1], requires all companies employing over 500 people to make an assessment of their greenhouse gas emissions before December 31, 2012. The French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME) has developed a method of accounting emissions, known as Bilan Carbone® (carbon balance), which can be used by companies or consultants. A result, giant companies in consumer goods (Procter & Gamble, Unilever) and in cosmetics (L'Oréal) are communicating on ambitious development programs. ""For a company, it's also a development opportunity, another growth path,"" emphasized Yvette James, Director of Responsible Development for the Clarins Group. In this context, the carbon balance of Greenhouse Gas Emissions appears merely as a first step. But to review one's emissions is only the prelude to the implementation of a reduction policy. ""This is often where things go wrong,"" explained Thomas Moreau, Associate Director of the consulting firm Austral, specialized in logistics. Before forty professionals invited on January 20 in Paris by the BeautyFULL Club, he detailed the various pitfalls to avoid, including the managerial control of corrective measures. ""To undertake a carbon balance is not very complicated, as such. But companies often underestimate the scope and magnitude of its impact on their organization and their processes,"" stressed Moreau. A small project with a modest budget, can therefore have important consequences on the company's business. ""It would be a big mistake for the senior management of the company to ignore the carbon balance. Indeed, once it has been undertaken, it's only a very small part of the road that has been gone through. Decisions on measures to be adopted to reduce emissions will be the responsibility of the top management,"" he added. An opinion shared by Yvette James: ""To be successful in a company's sustainable development process, you must know the company perfectly well, including departments and positions that feel less concerned, such as marketing."" The first challenge is to define the scope that will be used to calculate emissions. ""Very often companies are surprised by some emission sources (the use of products or services, consumers trips, ...) and only want to consider the emissions that are directly under their control (energy, travels,…). This is the first remark we hear during the carbon balance. However, it is necessary to retain the broadest scope possible, including all sources on which the company has an influence, albeit limited,"" explained Moreau. But in practice, the selected indicators seem to vary in significant proportions from one company to another, making comparisons difficult. ""In our case, depending on whether or not delivery to outlets is included, not to mention transporting the product to the consumer, results will be very different, and items such as logistics or transport will be more or less important,"" confirmed Philippe Brugière, Vice President in charge of the Packaging Development for L'Occitane. This debate, however, should not conceal the main function of the carbon balance, which is to allow the taking of corrective measures in order to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the company and its partners. It is more than a comparison tool, it is an instrument of internal improvement for the company. ""Within the scope retained by Clarins, the most important emission line item concerns packaging,"" pointed out James. ""This is the point on which we have focused our efforts by committing ourselves resolutely in the path of eco-design."" At this level, the launch last year, of the perfume Womanity by Thierry Mugler is an important milestone in the history of the Clarins Group, which considers it as being ""the first eco-responsible fragrance."" The case is made from recycled and recyclable cardboard, with no box insert nor flying leaflets, to reduce the secondary packaging. The bottle is indefinitely refillable. Another important step, the launch by Kibio, the organic skincare brand from the Clarins Group, of the first application with SGD's Infinite Glass featuring a glass jar in a 50ml optimized size, resulting in a reduction in packaging volume. And another surprise: distributors, more than consumers, had to be convinced of the relevance of these changes !"
Korsnäs sees a greener future for luxury products,"According to Korsnäs there is no doubt that consumers tend to become increasingly aware of environmental issues and more demanding with brands. ""Packaging has become an increasingly important part of the overall brand experience. A factor that determines selection or rejection. In an age of climate consciousness, consumers dislike over-packaging and wastefulness while preferring smart and economical solutions. Brands that have learned this lesson add to their credibility, their brand image - and to their competitiveness,"" explains the Swedish supplier of cardboard packaging solutions. In such a context, Korsnäs deems that to be distinctive and strong, a luxury brand has to address current environmental issues in a clear way and to deal with this matter in their communications. The choice of a responsible packaging solution is obviously a good start. As a cardboard maker, Korsnäs is convinced to benefit from a natural competitive advantage. Based on a report published by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute last year, Korsnäs explains that packaging based on wood fibre is the most environmentally friendly alternative. ""It is better than plastic, which is derived from oil. Better than glass, which is heavy and energy intensive from a life-cycle perspective. And better than aluminium, which is expensive to recycle and whose supply is questionable."" Wood fibre comes from a renewable source, has a limited environmental impact and can be recycled up to seven times. Products made from fibre-based material, such as carton packaging, thus appear as a highly valuable sustainable option. However, Korsnäs does not intend to limit itself to this natural asset. Actually, the carton maker is working at improving the sustainability of its entire manufacturing process. Sustainability is considered at all stages – including sourcing, forestry, production, energy utilisation and transport systems. The company's first goal is to reduce the use of fossil fuels, the main cause of climate warming. This goes for transport modes as well: Korsnäs' recent shift from sea to rail transport alone has led to a 20-30% reduction of fossil carbon emissions. Another area of progress includes waste heat projects. For instance, waste heat from the Korsnäs plant in Frövi replaces heating with fossil fuels in the local district heating system, delivering an annual 100 GWh to 4,500 flats, schools, industrial buildings and public buildings. Similarly, the Korsnäs plant in Gävle supplies waste heat for district heating 20,000 households in that municipality. Another example of good thinking in energy utilisation is the use of dry wood bark in the production process. Moist or wet bark consumes more energy in the bark boiler. Since 2002 the bark used in Korsnäs boilers is dried by the sun's rays. It is a simple but effective technology that has reduced the boiler's oil consumption by 90%. Other recent achievements include a 570-million SEK investment in a brand new evaporation plant at Korsnäs mills in Gävle. This investment will mean a 50% reduction in oil consumption for that part of the production process. As many Nordic carton makers, Korsnäs has a leg up on the others with regard to sustainable development. There are several explanations to explain this situation: the sensitivity to environmental issues in Scandinavian countries, the characteristics of the paper and cardboard industry itself, which has been stigmatized for a long time because of its pollutant processes and which uses raw material that must be carefully managed to remain renewable. ""It takes a tree 70 years to grow to full height, which means that forestry – like any environmental work – is a long-term undertaking."" Consistently, Korsnäs' forests are certified according to FSC and PEFC standards. The company wants its efforts to positively impact its results, both by reducing production costs and by the positive image of the company and its products. ""Any brand that works with Korsnäs joins this positive environmental loop,"" concludes Christer Simrén, CEO."
"Environment: Stora Enso, wants to be at the forefront","Premium Beauty News - Preservation of environment must be an old story for you? Paivi Harju-Eloranta - Yes indeed, we obviously did not wait for all these summits, meetings and congresses centered on this great challenge of the future to make concrete progress, since several years, like most of our colleagues in the field. And the timing couldn't have been any better, since currently end users of our materials are now specially sensitive to these issues. Just have a look, and you have already relayed the information, the approach claimed by Procter & Gamble which was expressed on your website or the one from L'Oreal who has just launched a website specifically dedicated to this topic. But the answers, we already have them! Premium Beauty News - What answers exactly? Paivi Harju-Eloranta - Firstly, you must know that Stora Enso has the huge advantage of being integrated all along the exploitation and production chain: from the tree in the forest to the delivery of papers and boards in every corner of the world. To comply with new environmental standards, we must give the lead all along this chain and we have set ourselves ambitious targets. Thus we will have reduced our emissions of SO2 (Sulfur dioxide) by 30% between 2007 and 2013 and our CO2 emissions by 20% between 2006 and 2020. All the wood we use to produce paper-board come from forests which are managed under the principles of sustainable development, with 100% traceability. Nearly 70% of our needs come from forests which are PEFC or FSC certified. Premium Beauty News - You have mentioned the reduction of your CO2 emissions. How do you manage reducing your energy consumption? Paivi Harju-Eloranta - Actually, We achieve this through different means who, I believe, deserve to be detailed: – CO2 reduction target. This target covers both emissions generated directly by our own facilities and indirect emissions produced in the generation of the electricity and heat we purchase. It target will be achieved by reducing energy consumption through improved productivity, the use of more efficient equipment and streamlined processes, reduced use of fossil fuels, and improved efficiency in power and heat generation. In 2009 we reduced our CO2 emissions by 18% from our target baseline year 2006. Another significant reason to the CO2 reductions achieved during 2009 was increased purchases of electricity generated from low carbon supply mixes. – Direct and indirect CO2 emissions. We continued to reduce our direct fossil CO2 emissions during 2009. Since 2006 we have reduced our direct CO2 emissions from stationary combustion sources by 12%. Our indirect CO2 emissions are significantly influenced by the energy mix in the countries where we operate. During 2009 our fossil CO2 emissions from energy purchased for electricity and heat decreased to a level 23% below their level in 2006. – Regarding the energy use. We purchase fuel, electricity and heat from external suppliers, and generate steam and electricity internally for use at our production facilities. We generated 33% of our electricity needs from our own power plants. – Energy self-sufficiency.Stora Enso is increasingly focusing on enhancing our energy self-sufficiency and access to cleaner energy by investing in renewable energy production at mill sites, and through partnerships with external energy suppliers. Through the use of wind turbines for instance or the supply of low carbon electricity production. – High share of biomass in internal energy production. Pulp and paper production creates by-products that we use to produce large amounts of bioenergy. [1] In 2009 we maintained our use of biomass for internal energy production on a high level, 71% compared to 72% in 2008. – Multifuel solutions. Stora Enso is also increasingly looking into multifuel solutions that can replace purchased energy generated using fossil fuels, in particular through the use of mixtures of different types of fuels in the same boiler, including biomass such as forest residues, bark and recovered wood, as well as various sorted wastes, coal and gas. In 2010 two new power plants will start to utilise multifuels, in Belgium and in Germany. This will result in CO2 emission reductions of about 105 000 tonnes per year. A new power plant in Poland, scheduled for completion in 2010, will also reduce our carbon footprint by an estimated 100 000 tonnes of CO2 annually."
"Emoi Infini, another step in eco-design innovation","The manufacturers gathered into Mouvement Infini share the same goal: crossing a new frontier in the world of eco-designed cosmetics and perfumes. After the launch of Naya, last year, a fully ecodesigned skincare product, Mouvement Infini will showcase Emoi Infini, during the next Luxe Pack congress, which will be held in Monaco October 20-22, 2010. This new project takes the form of a box of three fully eco-designed perfumes (Elle, Lui, Moi for the French Her, Him, Me), which by developing manufactured, optimized and integrated solutions, offer an innovative positioning in the luxury market. For the eight partners within Mouvement Infini (who were five only for the launch of Naya), SGD, Strand Cosmetics Europe, Mane, Extreme Paris, VPI, Wauters, M-Real and Rexam, the segment of high-end perfumery perfectly matches with the spirit of their high-quality eco-friendly developments. The range of three complementary men's, women's and children's perfumes therefore appears as: ""A possibility to create links between materials, trades, but also individuals and generations. It adds a unique emotional touch to the purely functional."" ""EMOI advocates a genuine state of mind: others and ME, exchanging, borrowing, swapping, depending on our moods and desires. Sharing of emotions – that's what sustainable development is all about."" Meant both for manufacturers, who produce it, and consumers, who wear it, Emoi Infini is the fruit of a comprehensive eco-friendly approach. Integrated to the product and its promise, eco-design should no longer appear as a constraint. On the contrary, it anticipates operational solutions, and remains very real. All steps in the process - raw materials, fragrance, production, bottle, box, consumption - have been well eco-planned and eco-designed: a chemical-free colouring process, a box without husks or adhesives, 100% recycled glass and PET, organic jus, and a pump dispenser with a removable cap. All materials can be endlessly sorted and recycled. ""In launching Emoi Infini, underline its creators, we are bringing a whole new perspective, moving from integral eco-design to integrated eco-design."""
Procter & Gamble wants to lead the way to sustainability,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) has just unveiled its new long-term environmental sustainability vision. The US consumer products giant aims at building tools to guide all sustainability decisions and goalsetting within the company. The new vision includes four ambitious steps: – Powering all P&G plants with 100% renewable energy, – Using 100% renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging produced by the company, – Having zero consumer and manufacturing waste go to landfills, – Designing products that delight consumers while maximizing the conservation of resources ""Accelerating P&G's commitment to environmental sustainability is a critical component of the Company's ongoing growth strategy,"" said Bob McDonald, P&G Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. In a first step, P&G is setting a series of 10-year sustainability goals. These shorter-term goals will help the company to ""focus its efforts and incrementally improve its environmental performance,"" so as to be progressively able to achieve the long-term sustainability vision. This first set of sustainability goals will be delivered by 2020. They are in addition to the company's existing 2012 goals. As with its current practice, P&G will report progress against these goals on an annual basis. The company has already launched the implementation of important measures, including, the assessment of the environmental footprint of its main suppliers, which will eventually allow integrate this criteria in the selection process, or the replacement of oil-based plastic packaging by plant-based packaging sourced from entirely renewable materials. P&G also announced it has signed an international partnership agreement with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The environmentalist organisation participated in the elaboration of the group's new sustainability vision. P&G hopes this partnership will help to solve the difficulties linked to sustainability efforts, the company may have to face in the future."
Cosmetic packaging slow to go green,"According to Organic Monitor, when developing sustainability plans cosmetic firms are focusing on green formulations, resource efficiency and life-cycle assessments of their products. Although companies are aware of the environmental impact of packaging, they have been slow to embrace sustainable packaging solutions. The research and consulting firm says that even organic cosmetic brands are lagging in adopting sustainable packaging. ""Such companies have been pioneers in adopting natural and organic cosmetic standards, implementing fair trade and ethical sourcing programmes, and broader CSR initiatives but few are focusing on reducing their packaging footprints."" In certain cases, this reluctance to move to green packaging is linked to the specificity of cosmetic formulas. The use of bioplastic packaging, for instance, is mainly limited to colour cosmetic cases. In many cases, high heat sensitivity and water permeability prevent such packaging to be used for products such as creams, lotions and shampoos. However, there is a growing research in biopolymers packaging and technical progress in this area may help beauty companies to overcome these difficulties within short delays. For instance, cosmetics giant, Procter & Gamble, recently announced a major shift to plant-derived packaging for some of its leading global cosmetic brands. P&G intends to use sugarcane-derived plastic supplied from the Brazilian company Braskem SA, who manufactures the material using ethanol made from sustainably-grown Brazilian sugarcane. But bioplastics are not the only sustainable packaging option. Actually, many beauty companies are looking at recycled packaging materials. Some natural cosmetic firms, such as Neal's Yard Remedies are using Post Consumer Regrind (PCR) poly ethylene terephthalate bottles. Others, like Burt's Bees are going further and making commitments to use only recycled materials. Brazilian cosmetics maker Natura recently launched a fragrance packed in a folding box containing 30% of PCR paperboard. Aveda, that Organic Monitor found to be one of the few cosmetic companies to give priority to packaging on its sustainability agenda, is the largest user of PCR plastic in the beauty industry, saving over 1 million pounds (1,20 million euros) of virgin plastic each year. Its products now contain 80% or more recycled materials. It has also recycled 37 million polypropylene caps through its 'Recycle Caps with Aveda' campaign. Eco-packaging design is another method of reducing the packaging footprint. Some beauty brands such as Nude Skincare have developed sleek packaging that is both stylish and environmentally-friendly. Reducing packaging in design has enabled the Greek brand Korres to save 11 tons of plastic materials a year. According to Organic Monitor, a few pioneers are taking a holistic approach to sustainable packaging. Apart from Aveda, Method Products has adopted the Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) design approach, which ensures packaging is environmentally responsible and packaging materials are recovered after the product is used. Several presentations and workshops will explore these various options on the occasion of the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, taking place in Paris on October 18-20th, 2010."
P&G to use sugarcane-based packaging on leading cosmetic brands,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) is preparing a major shift to plant-derived packaging for some of its leading global cosmetic brands. The company intends to use sugarcane-derived plastic supplied from the Brazilian company Braskem SA, who manufactures the material using ethanol made from sustainably-grown Brazilian sugarcane. P&G expects the pilot to be rolled out globally over the next 2 years, with the first products expected to be on shelf in 2011. Unlike traditional plastic, which is made from petroleum, plan-derived polymers are based on a renewable resource. Braskem SA uses an innovative process to transform sugarcane into high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic, a type commonly used for product packaging. ""It remains 100% recyclable in existing facilities,"" P&G claims. Obviously, by launching this renewable packaging on some of its global beauty and grooming brands, P&G intends to improve the environmental profile of its product. Consumer-driven decision ""This innovation is truly consumer-driven. As we talk with women around the world, they tell us that they want to make themselves more beautiful without making their environment less beautiful,"" explains Gina Drosos, Group President, Global P&G Beauty. ""With this new packaging innovation, women can have confidence that their favourite brands are helping to make a difference,"" she adds."
Environment: one more step forward for Neopac,"In the frame of its ongoing ""Green Commitment"" program, Neopac, a Switzerland-based supplier of tubes for the biotech, pharmaceutical, personal care and cosmetic industries, has appointed Daniel Müller as Environmental Manager, in preparation for the company's ISO 14001 certification. Neopac is striving to achieve ISO 14001 certifcation in May 2011. The standard sets out requirements for an Environmental Management System (EMS), which will help Neopac to measure and document its environmental impact. The company also considers that being ISO 14001 certified would satisfy the growing needs of customers. ""More and more customers are asking for green tubes,"" points out Daniel Müller. ""They are seeking to offer products with a good eco-balance that are safer for the environment as well as the consumer. In this way, they are not only meeting the needs of the consumer, but also creating an image of an environmentally conscious supplier."" According to Neopac, more and more consumers are sensitive to the contents not only of the product itself, but also of the packaging, and are looking for packaging that are free from environmentally harmful ingredients and processes. In addition, Neopac has provided data regarding materials, transportation, the disposal of hazardous substances, etc. to the myclimate Foundation, a Swiss non-profit foundation that is the leading quality provider of climate education and Carbon Management Services as well as a renowned partner for carbon offsetting solutions via effective carbon offset projects. After receiving data from Neopac, myclimate calculates the offset returns required, which, in turn, are used to promote certified environmental projects. Customers can then decide whether they would like to purchase CO2-neutral tubes and are prepared to pay an extra amount to support these projects. Neopac has already adopted a strategy to arrange climate-neutral business trips. Neopac has already taken numerous measures to improve its environmental performance. Nowadays, 95% of its colours and varnishes are UV-cured, which means they contain less volatile solvents. More than one-third of the electrical energy required by the company is provided by hydropower. 85% of the company's wastes are sorted, separated and recycled whilst the remainder is recycled for energy. Short journeys, hazardous substance standard Euro 5 for heavy goods vehicles and the purchase of raw materials solely from Europe are other measures implemented by Neopac in an attempt to take care of the environment and the world's resources."
"Promens ""Green Cube"" program is put to the test","PremiumBeauty News - How far have you got with the Green Cube program? Isabelle Orhan - Before I answer your question concerning the first concrete results of this ambitious program, let me first explain the origins of the project. Today, protecting the environment is a priority to preserve the planet's natural resources and ensure its future. Kyoto has set the objectives: by 2050, our emissions must be reduced by four. We are of course aware of our responsibilities at Promens and we strive continually to reduce the environmental impact of our activity and products. If you recall, a few years ago, packaging had two main purposes: preserve the content and attract the consumer. Packaging had to be easy to use and to carry, provide information to the user (instructions of use, legal requirements ...) and facilitate product differentiation in a increasingly challenged market. Nowadays, environmental awareness has become one of the main things to take into consideration when developing a packaging. Raw materials must be as much as possible, easily sortable, recycled and recyclable. We systematically optimize the thickness and weight of packaging to reduce the consumption of raw materials and preserve fossil resources. We have chosen to develop our environmental expertise internally. We are accredited by the ADEME [1] to carry out our carbon footprint calculations and our innovation engineers are trained to use the TEAM software to calculate lifecycles. Nowadays, like innovation, environment has become an essential pillar! Premium Beauty News - The production stage is obviously essential! Isabelle Orhan - This stage requires a lot of energy but a well conceived design is a guarantee for optimized productivity. Each parameter of the process is taken into consideration and studied accordingly. For example, our engineers prefer using hot runner molds to get rid of sprue waste. Temperature and pressure parameters are optimized, always keeping in mind that reducing a parameter may increase another one, causing higher energy consumption. Incidentally, our plants clearly show their environmental commitment with: – ISO 14001 Certification: the three French factories (Bellignat, Géovreisset and Eagle) have been certified by the AFAQ AFNOR. – An accreditation by the ADEME to audit and assess the carbon footprint. Furthermore, we have developed the PBS (Promens Business System) which is a strategic initiative meant to enhance our operational performance. It involves all staff, from operators to management, in a combined effort to build a culture of continuous measurable improvement to identify and reduce losses. This program, based on the methodology of Continuous Improvement and Total Productive Management, is a global improvement of the system with defined standards, focused on sharing experiences and best practices from the Group. As regards concrete results, today all our factories are analyzed in terms of Carbon footprint whether they are located in France or Poland ... They all follow action plans to improve the Group's footprint. Premium Beauty News - What about the consumer? Isabelle Orhan - Of course, we also imagine how the consumer is going to use the product. The aim being to develop efficient products to avoid waste, facilitate evacuation and deliver accurate dosage. Consumer's awareness is increasing everyday and projects on environmental labelling will further strengthen this trend. Currently, Promens is capable of providing brands with the carbon footprint of all its bottles or jars. Our approach is to offer brands a real expertise in terms of packaging and environment. We opted for an educational approach rather than the use of marketing bluffs which we find many examples of in our industry! For example we advise against the use of organic materials with a CO2 footprint sometimes much worse than raw materials. We prefer to adopt in this area a realistic and long term approach. Premium Beauty News - And finally there is the recycling stage... Isabelle Orhan - Our priority is to find supply chains of recycled materials (PCR). We are focusing on three raw materials: PE-HD, PP and PET. Our challenge is to find raw materials in line with the use of cosmetic products. We can also offer the use of recycled materials coming from our own production waste, the quality of which we guarantee through careful selection. Our strict management of waste is based on an optimization of upstream channels: – Select the origin of waste, – Not discard waste that can be recycled and reused, – Separate hazardous waste from others (neon, aerosol, oil ...), – Send sorted out and separated waste to their respective industry. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some examples of this approach? Isabelle Orhan - There are obviously many. For instance, Green Airfree which is available on the English market. This Airless bottle with a pouch has been awarded with the Ecocert label and granted a favorable opinion from the COTREP. We are currently working with several brand owners on calculating the carbon footprint of our packaging and analyzing their life cycle. We are demonstrating for instance how to improve carbon footprint by skipping some finishing stages and integrating additives in the material. This is concrete work. We are clearly getting ahead of our competition in this domain and for example Johnson & Johnson has asked us to participate to the CDP program (Carbon Disclosure Project)."
The beauty industry invests in CSR and sustainability,"In its new Strategic Insights report, Organic Monitor assesses corporate and social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability initiatives in the beauty industry. The research finds that most investment is going into reducing the environmental footprint of cosmetic products by using greener formulations and sustainable packaging. According to Organic Monitor, packaging is receiving high interest because of its high ecological impact. Companies are looking at biodegradable plastics, recycled materials and innovative ways to reduce packaging such as upcycling and lightweighting, as well as the use of new packaging materials such as biopolymers and bamboo. A major finding is that natural and organic cosmetic companies are leading the way in terms of CSR & sustainability initiatives. ""Many of them have sustainability built into their corporate DNA,"" says Organic Monitor. The report highlights the achievements of the Brazilian company Natura, which has been championing environmental causes since its foundation in 1969. ""It was the first major cosmetics company to become carbon neutral, offsetting its carbon emissions by reforestation of native tree species,"" Organic Monitor notes. Beraca, another Brazilian company, is also commended for its social and biodiversity investment projects in the Amazon. By the use of case studies, Organic Monitor highlights the various methods of reducing the environmental and social impacts of cosmetics products and ingredients. The importance of ethical sourcing is making fair trade prominent, with a growing number of natural cosmetic and ingredient firms investing in grower projects in developing countries. Certification is a major barrier however, with many companies preferring to take the non-certified route because of bureaucracy and the limitations of fair trade standards. Corporate philanthropy is another area becoming important for some beauty companies wishing to 'invest back' into society. The report gives details of the various standards, certifications, labels and indexes for CSR and sustainability in the beauty industry. Natural and organic cosmetic standards have received most attention, however new schemes are emerging that look at the various dimensions of sustainability. Cradle to Cradle certification is becoming popular for companies such as Aveda and Kiehl's as it gives a life-cycle analysis of cosmetic products. CSR and sustainability initiatives in the beauty industry will be extensively featured in the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, taking place in Paris, 18-20 October 2010. The summit will look at how beauty companies can lower their environmental and social impacts by investing in green formulations, sustainable packaging, certification programmes, biodiversity & ethical supply chains."
How did L'Occitane revive fragrances from forgotten flowers?,"It is not uncommon for innovation to find its roots in the past! Regarding the Forgotten Flowers collection by L'Occitane en Provence, the whole adventure began with a dive into the archives – notably those of the Villa Saint-Hilaire and the International Perfume Museum, in Grasse, the cradle of French perfumery – to find the flowers formerly used in old perfume recipes. This titanic work led to the creation of a database gathering more than 800 perfume plants, some of which had been completely forgotten. From these 800 plants, three were selected to form the new collection: melilot [1], woodland hawthorn (known as noble épine, in French) [2], and common tansy (known as barbotine, in French) [3]. It all started in 2015, when the brand committed to supporting a thesis on ""Forgotten perfume plants"" by researcher Anne-Sophie Bouville. ""The project was to liberate knowledge about these flowers, forgotten in perfumery, but sometimes known in other fields. There was also a philanthropic dimension of opening up and sharing knowledge with the general public,"" said Anne-Sophie Bouville, PhD student at the Institut de Chimie de Nice (Université Côte d'Azur, CNRS), then Active Fragrance Project Manager, L'Occitane. Indeed, certain plants, such as rose, jasmine and iris, have been used in perfumery since Antiquity and throughout the ages. Others were used at certain periods and are no longer used today. Sometimes, this disinterest is easily explained by substitution by a synthetic ingredient or by regulatory constraints. But in other cases, the reason may remain unknown. To identify these forgotten perfume plants and develop innovative cosmetic raw materials, several hundred books were studied, some dating back to antiquity, and numerous experts (anthropologists, archaeologists, botanists, historians, linguists, perfumers, theologians, etc.) were interviewed. Information was gathered on the identity, history, symbolism, uses, smell, medicinal properties and hypotheses on why plants were forgotten. Beyond their properties and olfactory potential, the eight hundred perfume plants and more that form a unique database were subjected to strict specifications and studied in the light of L'Occitane's industrial and agricultural criteria to assess their interest in perfumery and cosmetics. This impressive research work resulted in a patent and three scientific publications, and in the launch in fall 2023 of a collection of cosmetic perfumes packed with purpose and steeped in history. ""It's very rare in research to see the concrete outcome of one's work. The strength of this collaboration between the world of research and L'Occitane is that it makes academic knowledge tangible and comprehensible to the general public,"" highlighted Xavier Fernandez, University Professor in Chemistry and Vice-President Innovation, the Université Côte d'Azur in Nice, France. For the creation of these unique perfumes, L'Occitane worked with renowned perfumers who were asked to highlight the history and personality of each of the three selected flowers. For the Melilot line, Julie Massé and Véronique Nyberg, perfumers at Mane, turned away from the absolute of the flower to prefer the infusion technique. The use of this flower, neglected by modern perfumery in favour of coumarin, a more accessible synthetic molecule, was ""really fascinating"", according to Julie Massé. For Noble Épine, the choice of fresh flower absolute appeared as the most logical and Shyamala Maisondieu, Givaudan perfumer, translated it in a tender and delicate fragrance. Finally, for Barbotine, the essential oil of the plant was transformed into perfume by Fabrice Pellegrin and Ilias Ermenidis, from Firmenich. The perfume's olfactory notes present a floral sophistication alongside revealing a fresh aromatic scent. ""Bringing forgotten flowers back to the heart of olfactory creation was a unique adventure, a challenge,"" concluded Fabrice Pellegrin."
"Aloha, an innovative micro-encapsulation system to perfume any materials","The 15-1 Diffusion company wanted to develop ""smart"" materials as part of its eyewear business. A few years ago, it approached French and international research laboratories and embarked on an R&D programme opening up new functionalities for its products. After three years of development, a few months ago, it launched its first anti-lice, anti-mosquito, or simply scented glasses, thanks to an innovative and inspiring new technology called Aloha Matériaux Augmentés. ""We asked ourselves whether we could use chemistry to give eyewear another function. We created anti-lice glasses by incorporating microcapsules into the frame material to diffuse actives, in this case lavender effluents, around children's heads, and create an effective barrier. The same principle applies to perfumes: we can now integrate either juices or compositions into the microcapsules, and then diffuse them"", explains Didier Janot, co-founder of 15-1 Diffusion. On the surface, the technology can be applied to all materials: leather, plastic, paper, metal, glass, etc. In the mass, Aloha works with injectable materials, preferably biobased polymers. ""Our starting point is ecoresponsibility. We aim to work with biosourced materials and natural actives. The name Aloha, which means 'hello' in Polynesian, also refers to the philosophy that links Man to the Earth"", says the director. These microcapsules are oxygen-tight, which means they preserve the integrity of the actives used (juices, essential oils, etc.). The effluents are diffused thanks to the low porosity of the walls. The technology also makes it possible to decide on the mode of diffusion, which can either be continuous, involve friction, or depend on a defined temperature at which the diffuser starts to work. ""We can decide on permanent diffusion, with acceleration by touch or temperature"", adds Didier Janot. He describes other experiments based on this concept applied in different industries, such as wines and spirits, where the aromas of a rum or whisky are captured in the cork or label. ""We can reproduce this approach in all industries, play on the power of olfactory marketing, and trigger the desire to consume"", he says. In perfumery, the technology can be used to integrate fragrances into the bottle caps, the labels, or the packaging, which simply needs to be rubbed to release the scent, or to integrate customized aromas into materials, leather, or textiles, or on jewellery, ephemeral tattoos, or lipsticks. According to Didier Janot, while this approach is not intended to replace traditional perfume, it does allow users to enjoy a sensory experience through a highly precise olfactory performance when it comes to note reproduction. ""Many major brands, particularly in the luxury sector, have been considering applications suited to their own needs or issues. All projects need time to be validated. It is more complicated than applying a brush. There is a whole process involved in finding the right molecule, looking at its ability to be microencapsulated, studying the way it reacts on the material, etc. All these elements together give an idea of the effectiveness of the outcome and the duration of the experiment. It can last from several months to several years, depending on the concentration"", he explains. For the time being, the company aims to focus its applications on the product environment and packaging, rather than on formulation. ""Formulation is not our business, but anything is possible"", concludes the director."
Kao's Curél to launch second skin set to combat severe skin dryness,"Curèl, a Japanese line of facial moisturizers and cleansers designed specifically for dry and sensitive skin, is launching a pair of products that work in tandem to combat severe skin dryness. Available in Japan from April 4, 2024, the new set comprises the Curél Outfit-for-Skin Potion [1], a lotion that diffuses onto the skin as an ultra-thin veil, and the Veil Creator [2], a special diffuser used to apply the ultra-thin veil and create an artificial second skin. As the veil wraps the skin, it releases moisturizing ingredients that seep deep into the stratum corneum to keep the skin hydrated and relieve concerns about severe skin dryness. The ultra-thin membrane technology applied in the new potion and diffuser is based on Kao's ""Fine Fiber Technology,"" a technique that allows to diffuse ultra-fine fibers directly onto the skin as a laminated, ultra-thin veil. Kao Corporation first launched skincare applications based on the Fine Fiber Technology back in 2019, but Curél is now using it to introduce a new skincare method for intensive moisture care. Actually, the earlier renditions of the technology required a two-step care regime starting with the application of a dedicated nourishing essence before diffusing the veil. To simplify the application Kao scientists developed a hydrating beauty essence as the vital ingredient forming the veil. Curél Outfit-for-Skin Potion is the first product to apply this new solution dubbed ""bleed-out technology,"" a process for filling the spaces between the ultra-fine fibers of the veil with moisturizing ingredients to nourish the skin. The ultra-thin veil stays in place snugly like a second skin as the moisturizing ingredients seep deeply into the stratum corneum. ""When applied at the end of the nightly skincare routine, the veil keeps the skin hydrated for hours during sleep, resulting in firm, supple, and smooth skin by morning,"" Kao claims. Kao has collaborated with Panasonic Corporation to develop an advanced version of the Veil Creator diffuser. Once loaded with the Curél Outfit-for-Skin Potion in a dedicated cartridge, the new Veil Creator Diffuser can apply an ultra-thin veil on a targeted area in a matter of seconds. The device is compact and freestanding, for easy handling. The pair of products will be available for purchase from the official Kao online store (My Kao Mall). A subscription service will also be launched on Rentio to help customers easily start and maintain the new care regimen. Two subscription tiers are planned: a basic kit that includes Curél Outfit-for-Skin Potion and Curél Veil Creator, and a premium kit with an add-on Curél product delivered every month."
Tsuno Group creates a new generation sunscreen based on ferulic acid,"Well known for its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, as well as an inhibitor of melanin production by blocking tyrosinase activity, ferulic acid is already used in wide array of cosmetic applications. More recently, several studies have explored the possibility of using it in the fight against photo-induced aging, in particular as a plant-based UV absorber. A study published in 2018 demonstrated its ability to boost the sun protection factor (SPF) of several anti-UV formulations [1]. Toutefois, selon Tsuno Group, a pioneer in large-scale production of ferulic acid, the stability and solubility of this substance have proven to be complex at high concentrations. To overcome these hurdles, Tsuno Group has partnered with cosmetic ingredients producer Matsumoto Trading to pioneer an innovative technology utilizing a high concentration of ferulic acid in a solid stick formulation. According to the two companies, the new technology has made it possible to develop a sunscreen with SPF 50+ and PA++ (tested in vitro), using ferulic acid extracted from rice bran by Tsuno Group as the sole UV filter. ""This unique formulation eliminates the need for other commonly used UV protective ingredients, while maintaining high sun protection effectiveness. Patent pending,"" said Tsuno Group in a statement. A patent application has been filed for this new formulation solution which could make it possible to use ferulic acid as a natural alternative to various UV filters. According to Tsuno Group, ferulic acid can absorb UV rays in a similar range of the spectrum as octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC). This characteristic makes it a potential eco-friendly alternative to various filters of petrochemical origin, including ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC). Indeed, recent studies have shown the negative impact of EHMC (also known as octyl methoxycinnamate or octinoxate) on the aquatic environment, and its role in coral bleaching [2]. Amidst growing global concerns about environmental sustainability, ferulic acid has the potential to gain increased recognition as a natural and effective sunscreen ingredient. It holds significant potential for application in a wide range of cosmetic products. ""We, as a leading company in rice & bran chemistry in the world, have been developing a number of functional products with tremendous efforts through accumulating technologies, have also researched their safe levels and effects to be well accepted in pharma, food, feed and cosmetic industries. Now we have launched a technology of using ferulic acid from rice bran as a natural antioxidant and UV absorber, which is the first innovation ever in the world. We are confident that you shall discover this product as unique and impactful to contribute not only to the human health and beauty but the circular economy for the world,"" said Fumi Tsuno, President of Tsuno Group Co., Ltd. Established in 1947, Tsuno Rice Fine Chemicals manufactures various ingredients from by-products generated in the process of refining rice bran oil, which can be used for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, functional foods, food additives, feedstock, and industrial chemicals. In addition, they are also engaged in the manufacture of cosmetics under their own brand that incorporate these ingredients. ** ""Toxicological effects of two organic ultraviolet filters and a related commercial sunscreen product in adult corals"", Tangtian He, Mirabelle Mei Po Tsui, Chih Jui Tan, Chui Ying Ma, Sam King Fung Yiu, Li Hsueh Wan, Te Hao Chen, Tung Yung Fan, Paul Kwan Sing Lam, Margaret Burkhardt Murphy, in Environmental Pollution Volume 245, February 2019, Pages 462-471 (doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.029)"

"Tech helps beauty 'dreams' come true, says L'Oréal's Guive Balooch","How is L'Oréal embracing tech? Guive Balooch - Our CEO being the CES keynote is such a proud moment for us, and even more for the beauty industry. It's the first time a beauty company CEO is speaking at the largest tech stage in the world. It signals the essentiality of beauty in society today, and the critical role tech plays in elevating products and experiences. We strive to build beauty products that are powered by tech, not tech products powered by beauty. We don't look at the latest tech trend; we look at what people need and where the consumer tensions lie, and then create the tech to solve it. We've had consumer tensions for so long — like the fact that 50 percent of women can't find the right shade match of foundation — and those tensions are now being solved more easily, faster and with more delight. We are meeting people's dreams and expectations more effectively, thanks to the marriage of tech and beauty. Does artificial intelligence (AI) have a role to play? Guive Balooch - In many of our innovations, the common denominator is artificial intelligence – which we have been using for years, guided by our sense of purpose. We have growing experience of deploying AI across our brands and divisions. In 2018, L'Oréal acquired (augmented reality company) ModiFace, enabling us to create services like Virtual Try-On for hair, nail color and makeup try-ons. A great product example is Rouge Sur Mesure by Yves Saint Laurent Beauté. It's an AI-powered, connected personalized lipstick device with augmented reality capabilities to virtually try-on and recommend lipstick shades from a selection of 4,000 shade options with a touch of a button and within seconds. What do you expect from tech? Guive Balooch - Tech isn't about tech. It's about guiding people to the right choices, and it's about understanding your individual beauty based on data that will be powered by tech. We want to offer everyone the best of cosmetics innovation in terms of quality, efficacy and safety; and meeting the infinite diversity of beauty needs and desires all over the world. It is through technology that we can meet these needs. For our newest innovation, AirLight Pro, we're launching with hairstylist professionals first... With other tech products, we launch to consumers first. It varies project to project and brand to brand. How do you decide on tech products? Guive Balooch - Our end goal is to build great products for our consumers. Starting with tech trends can lead to gimmicky results, especially in such a saturated market. While we need technology, we also need deep consumer insights into how we can make beauty lives better... Our approach is to first start with the consumer need, then use the technology that's been clinically tested for 100 percent accuracy, and through that, build products that are enhanced and augmented to bring experiences to a new level. This process helps us constantly challenge ourselves to build on technology and develop great products and experiences that are completely unique. We also say no to projects that don't deliver experiences that go above and beyond what's already existing in the marketplace."
When beauty products pamper with AI: seven innovations spotted at CES 2024,"At CES 2024, the trend in beauty was clear: the time has come for artificial intelligence (AI), with technological innovations intended to get the application of beauty products ever simpler, precise and personalized! At home manicure salon This is the case, for instance, of the Nimble manicure salon, which calls itself the world's first device to combine AI and complex robotics to paint nails flawlessly at home — without the hassle of making an appointment. Resembling a heavyset printer, the eight-kilo white box can varnish all ten fingernails and dry them in just twenty-five minutes. According to its creators, the device uses high-resolution micro-cameras and 3-D imaging to determine nail shape, size and curvature. Then a small robotic arm, guided by AI algorithms, applies the requisite three coats, with a blow dry after each applied layer. When it goes on sale in March, more than thirty colors will be available in capsules costing USD 10 each, enough for two complete manicures. The device costs USD 599. A virtual beauty advisor AI, a term often deployed as the latest catchphrase for anything tech, has also infiltrated beauty industry giants, as exemplified by the free Beauty Genius app, presented by L'Oréal. The innovation is intended to be an AI-supported ""virtual personal advisor."" It recommends skincare and make-up products according to skin type, gives tips on techniques and answers questions about problems such as acne and hair loss. Users can also try out the products virtually. Virtual tryouts This is also the aim of the program Beautiful AI, created by Perfect Corp, which combines generative AI and virtual reality to perform live skin analyses, 3-D hairstyle or jewelry trials and make recommendations. According to Perfect Corp CEO and Founder, Alice Chang, the ultimate goal is to create a ""more fulfilled customer journey"" by helping consumers to identify products and services that align seamlessly with their individual preferences. Custom printed makeup Korea's Prinker, a specialist in ephemeral, customizable tattoos for skin and hair, is unveiling a similar product that will apply make-up this year. The device will also put AI to work with a biometric 3-D scanner to map facial features and then recommend the right contours, ""printing"" the corresponding powders to the face. Infrared hair blower No doubt that beauty personalization tech was a key feature of this year's CES. And companies also brought it to hair care! L'Oréal presented their new connected hairdryer that can be customized via an app, taking hair type into account and automatically adapting power and heat distribution. Dubbed Airlight Pro, the device uses infrared light to dry the hair, allowing it to preserve the hair's moisture, explains Adrien Chrétien, head of augmented beauty development at L'Oréal. Due to go on sale in April, it also offers energy savings of 31 percent compared with a conventional appliance, he added. ""AirLight Pro, with over 150 patents filed, perfectly embodies this breakthrough in beauty by, for the first time, bringing a solution for drying while caring for the hair as well as the planet,"" says Barbara Lavernos, deputy CEO in charge of research, innovation and technology at L'Oréal. Lip diagnosis, care and makeup capabilities in one pocket device After presenting at last year's CES, a device named Cosmechip capable of concocting bespoke skincare at home, the South Korean giant AmorePacific is back with a new innovation focusing on lip care. The Lipcure Beam incorporates sensors that can diagnose the condition of the lips, including moisture levels, simply by swiping it over the mouth. Once this first step has been completed, simply remove the cap from the container to reveal an applicator tool. This applicator emits a customized light beam according to the diagnosis made, which interacts with a light-responsive material to reinforce collagen fibers and form a moisturizing barrier. Not only does this innovation help slow down the lip-aging process, but it also has the potential for color capabilities, based on a universal color system suitable for all skin tones. And best of all, it's portable, making it easy to use any time, any place. The high-tech leggings that stimulate muscles Finally, let's mention the leggings unveiled by biotechnology company Barun Bio, which feature patented WE-Stim (for ""Wearing Electrical Stimulation"") technology. Available in a range of colors, these workout pants feature conductive materials that use the energy produced by the body in motion (during exercise) to generate micro-currents to stimulate muscles and thus enhance performance. A new demonstration of the convergence of beauty and fitness!"
Clean Reserve builds on micro-emulsion for long-lasting water-based fragrances,"Clean Beauty Collective is betting on ethanol-free fragrances with a collection of eight water-based perfumes - Clean Reserve H2Eau [1]. The new collection builds on a micro-emulsion technology developed in partnership Japanese fragrance house Takasago. Dubbed Hydro-Tec, the technology enables the stable mixing of fragrance oil and water resulting in a fragrance that is long-lasting. Designed with sensitive skin in mind, the formulation was extensively tested in the lab and in the field. According to Clean Beauty Collective, consumer research results show a positive user experience with 88% of consumers calling it ""game changing"". Thanks to this technology, the collection avoids the usual flaws of water-based fragrances that, historically, have been tacky on the skin and have lacked longevity. ""Clean Reserve H2Eau's formulation approach is not only long-lasting, but also gentle enough for sensitive skin, absorbing quickly, and leaving skin smooth and hydrated without irritation,"" claims Clean Beauty Collective, which has the exclusive on Takasago's Hydro-Tec for two years. According to the company, the line is packaged in sustainable, recyclable materials and is manufactured in solar powered facilities. The cap is made in Spain from sustainable wood, the glass bottle is fully recyclable and the fragrances are derived from responsibly sourced sustainable ingredients through selected partners that ""give back to the local farmers and their communities."" ""Clean Reserve H2Eau is a testament to our commitment to innovation and sustainability. It represents a leap forward in clean fragrance technology, demonstrating that luxury and environmental responsibility can coexist harmoniously,"" said Clean Beauty Collective's CEO, Greg Black.

HeiQ unveils a 100% biobased probiotics-infused textile technology,"Designed for next-to-skin apparel and home textiles, the HeiQ Skin Care technology harnesses the power of active probiotics and selected prebiotics to enhance the cutaneous microbiome for glowing skin. According to HeiQ, this textile finish helps to provide a balanced microbiome, even after repeated use and washing of textiles. Unlike conventional products, HeiQ Skin Care utilizes slow-release prebiotics and probiotics seamlessly integrated into a biobased textile matrix, enriching the skin's microbiome diversity, and offering long-lasting cosmetic benefits. The proprietary technology was designed to deliver a soothing cosmetic skin treatment in every situation, whether the user is relaxing, working or sleeping. It is based on a synergistic combination of prebiotics and probiotics, known as synbiotics. According to HeiQ, synbiotics promote skin renewal, rebalancing, and improved appearance, reducing the signs of aging and establishing a favorable environment for the skin's natural repair mechanisms. HeiQ Skin Care is suitable for all textile fibres, both natural and synthetic, and can be applied to all textile items that come in direct contact with the skin. Thanks to this versatility the technology can be used in a variety of daily use textiles - at work, during sports, leisure activities, or as bedding items like bed sheets and pillows. Intensive wear trials conducted during the development stage have proven the consistent release of synbiotics (prebiotics and probiotics) onto the skin, creating conditions to foster a well-balanced microbiome. ""HeiQ Skin Care represents a leap forward in textile innovation, combining the power of probiotics and prebiotics to enhance skin microbiome and overall skin appearance. It is another way of delivering our promise of improving the lives of billions, which is at the core of everything we do at HeiQ,"" says Mike Abbott, Head of HeiQ Textiles & Flooring Business Unit.

Bastille Parfums strengthens transparency promise with RFID technology,"Launched in 2020, and then purchased by Sophie Maisant in 2022, the Bastille brand was initially based on the concept of more natural perfumes and more transparency and traceability. To go even further, it has just become the first perfume brand to affix an RFID label on its products, together with a QR Code that provides access to all the product and manufacturing information. ""When we met Avery Dennison, it felt obvious the RFID technology was essential to go even further. Not only does it help us achieve our transparency ambitions towards our consumers, but it also involves operational excellence, which adds to our promise"", explains Sophie Maisant. Avery Dennison provides smart labels based on radiofrequency identification. The data collected with this technology is stored, harmonized, and made readable to Bastille via atma.io, Avery Dennison's connected product cloud. A unique digital identity is attributed to each product, so they can be followed up every step of the supply chain, from sourcing to distribution, with an order tracking function in real time. In addition, the brand has access to the analysis of interactions with consumers. If the RFID technology makes it possible to store product data, once scanned, the QR Code directly leads to an application containing the whole brand's world: list of ingredients, origin identified on a map, packaging suppliers, and date of manufacturing. ""I think we are the only brand to have chosen to communicate the date when our products were made and bottled, only by scanning a QR Code. And it is just the first step; we will soon cover the whole logistics chain. I would love to be able to track products up to the flower, with our partner, IFF. This technology offers endless possibilities. We can add as much content as we want,"" adds the President. If the beauty industry has only just discovered this technology, major companies like Zara and Decathlon have already embraced it. ""There are so many possibilities regarding stock management, consumer experience and authentication"", says Sophie Maisant. ""It is true it is a significant investment for a company, but that is the price to pay for the transparency and operational excellence offered by this technology,"" she concludes. The transformation of the perfume brands to meet the new demands from consumers will be one of the key topics of the next Fragrance Innovation Summit on November 30 in Paris."
Ormaie innovates with mini refills made of 100% glass,"With ""The Small Bottles"" range, Ormaie now offers its collection of nine fragrances in a refillable 20ml format designed to be used at home or taken anywhere else.

Innovation: Who are the winners of the MakeUp in NewYork IT Awards 2023?,"28 new skincare and make-up products, out of a total of over 100 applications, were nominated for this year's MakeUp in NewYork Innovation & Trends (IT) Awards. The 12 jury members met in July to test and assess the short-listed products and select to the most innovative and trend-setting solutions across four categories: accessories, formulations, full service and packaging products. The IT Award in the ""Accessories"" category was scooped by Italian manufacturer Pennelli Faro for their pocket-sized make-up brush Segno. Designed to be wearable on the wrist, like a bracelet, the precision brush is mounted on a flexible lace that is available in various materials. In the same category, the Coup de Coeur du Jury (jury's favorite) award went to China's Beauty Yaurient Cosmetics Accessories for Iron Series, a line of massage tools with natural jade stones. The three sizes are suitable for the face, back, shoulders and neck. ACT Beauty with their line of Bio-Based Blenders, and HNB Corporation for their black and white Zen Makeup Brush Collection were among the finalists. French manufacturer MS BeautiLab won the IT Award in the formulation category for Roll & Remove Beauty Spheres, a range of translucent makeup removing spheres, formulated with over 93% ingredients from natural origin, without PEGs, silicone or preservatives. ""At skin temperature, the spheres will transform into a soft, fluid oil that will effectively remove all traces of makeup and impurities,"" the company explains. Ancorotti Cosmetics won over the jury in the ""full sevice product"" category, with Multilayer a compact offering a hypnotic decoration combining color, patterns and varying relief effects. Based on pure pigments, its multi-layer pressable formula contains moisturizing, emollient and anti-redness agents. Eventually, South Korea's Taeyang Renew scooped the award in the packaging category with their Airtight Slider Mascara: a tube contains a sealed formula and a retractable applicator. In addition to the winners of the IT Awards, Ewelina Aiossa, ambassador of MakeUp in NewYork 2023 and member of the IT Award jury, has awarded ""The Ambassador's Favorite"" prize to her favorite product, selected and tested from among the 10 new skincare products entered in the competition. The prize went to Coreana Bio for its Lavida Vital Recovery BB Cream Pact IRF35, a hybrid antiaging formulation combining UV filters, oils, moisturizers and various active ingredients. The ""MakeUp in"" show will return to the West Coast on February 14-15, 2024 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, then again in New York on September 18-19, 2024, again at the Javits Center."
Chanel 31 Le Rouge: A refillable lipstick housed in a glass case,"For 31 Le Rouge, the French luxury house has chosen to replace the materials usually used for tubes (plastic and metal) with glass. Made by a Japanese glassmaker, the tube houses an aluminium refill with the lipstick formula. The gleam of the metal interior reflects off the glass sides, which are set with a golden-hued ring. ""Inspired by the mirrors that line the legendary Art Deco staircase in Gabrielle Chanel's Paris apartment at 31 rue Cambon, 31 Le Rouge unlocks a fusion of sophistication, technical mastery and design fluidity with an intimate, aesthetic experience,"" said the brand. According to Chanel, four years were needed to overcome the challenges associated with creating a glass lipstick case that is thin and durable enough for a product of its kind. ""I didn't want an ounce of plastic in this object. I wanted to look to the future. To create a glass lipstick was a dream. I worked with one of our manufacturers in Japan. Nobody else was capable of making it like that, neither in France nor in Italy. It took a long time,"" told Sylvie Legastelois, Chanel's Director of Packaging Creation and Graphic Identity, in an interview with the online magazine All I.C. The refills are interchangeable and can be removed and replaced without any limit, and there is no need to use the product completely before changing the refill. The product inside the refill is protected by a cover. The 31 Le Rouge range features 12 shades ranging from soft beige to deep garnet. Finely micronized pigments combine with sheer mother-of-pearl to deliver intense, purely radiant colour. Composed of 75% naturally derived ingredients, the longwearing formula is enriched with Gardenia Oil, and maracuja oil, both of which provide skincare benefits. Clinical evaluations showed a 70% improvement in lip hydration, 44% in smoothness and 55% in firmness, after one month of use."
Officine Universelle Buly works vegetables into perfumes,"Inspired by the Parisian company founded by perfumer Jean-Vincent Bully, in 1803, the entrepreneur couple composed of Ramdane Touhami and Victoire de Taillac awakened this old gem to create Officine Universelle Buly, a new experience of enchantments of the past. ""We were lucky enough to uncover an appealing beauty catalogue created by this 19th century brand. The product names and bottles were engaging, so we opened our first store on Rue Bonaparte, in Paris. This move was in line with our desire to have an outstanding beauty store, which we thought Paris did not offer back then. We mixed the company's iconic products, based on the original catalogue, for example Eau Triple or Huile Antique, and on a selection of 20 to 30 plant oils and botanical powder clays, to revive the original system of beauty stores, with a selection of beauty accessories"", explains Victoire de Taillac. Boosted by an identity focused on the Golden Age and an experience customized with calligraphy, the Buly stores and products soon conquered global markets. And with a dozen more stores opened in 2022, Officine Universelle Buly now counts four points of sale in Paris and about 40 around the world, in particular in Japan (Tokyo, Sapporo, and Osaka), as well as in South Korea. In Europe, the brand is already present in Paris, London, and Munich, and it also recently settled in Milan. Victoire de Taillac, manager of the brand image since LVMH purchased the company in October 2021, believes this success is due to a ""typically French aura"" and a very unique store experience. ""When a customer makes a purchase, we personalize the box with the product name and theirs, written in hand calligraphy. We also offer many customization options, including engraving and embossing. So, to me, we embody a very specific vision of beauty and elegance à la française, both abroad and in Paris"", she claims. In addition to this profoundly anchored identity, the brand does not hesitate to innovate: it launched a new collection of water-based perfumes last spring, putting vegetable garden ingredients in the spotlight, although they are rarely used in perfumes. Inspired by old seeds, the Les Jardins Français collection features fragrances with Indian cucumber, mint from Syria, watercress of the East, parsley from Sardinia, and even beetroot from Iraq or rhubarb from Egypt... The six olfactory compositions let Nature express itself with fresh, light notes instantaneously revealed by the water-based emulsions. This new collection completes the 12 perfumed combinations with a water base, i.e. the Eau Triple fragrances by Officine Universelle Buly, like Eau Triple Al Kassir, which features sandalwood, cardamom, and patchouli chords, or Eau Triple Miel d'Angleterre, composed of honey, amber, and cedar wood chords. Available in 75-ml bottles, the collection can also be purchased as a set containing six travel-size fragrances."
Florence by Mills targets Gen Z with first fragrance Wildly Me,"Florence by Mills describes their first-ever fragrance launch as being inspired by a botanical garden ""where bergamot and soothing sage intertwine with purple iris, blooming wisteria, violet flowers, and fresh lavender."" The fragrance was created in collaboration with Givaudan and combines periwinkle floral notes with sandalwood and upcycled cedarwood base scents. Within Givaudan's palette, the brand made a selection of Orpur classified ingredients, a label awarded by the fragrance house to its finest qualities of natural raw materials. With this debut fragrance offering a frosted glass bottle and a pricing ranging that will range from USD24 to USD 65, depending on sizing, the brand continues innovate in the Gen Z beauty space, its core demographic target. Florence by Mills ranks among the most Googled celebrity brands, in addition to being one of the most followed beauty accounts on social media. ""I launched florence by mills beauty in 2019 due to the lack of clean, high-quality products available for myself and my friends,"" said Millie Bobby Brown. ""As the brand has evolved with me, I really wanted to find a fragrance that represented my journey to adulthood. Over two years in the making, Wildly Me tells my story of what it means to choose your own path, and being unapologetically, wildly yourself. I'm thrilled to finally be able to share this part of my passion project with the flo family."" In a close segment, Luxe Brands recently announced the launch of Cloud Pink, the latest addition to their Ariana Grande fragrance collection."
Prada enters the beauty arena with refillable skincare and makeup lines,"Available since August 1st on the luxury brand's website, as well as at selected retailers, such as Selfridges and Harrods, in the U.K., the two Prada Skin and Prada Color lines have been designed from the outset to be refillable. The Prada Beauty line is developed by the L'Oréal group, under a license agreement that came into effect in January 2021. Simultaneously, the premium label is also launching a virtual makeup try-on service (Prada Color Explorer) and a skin diagnosis device for advanced analysis of consumers' skin (Prada Skin Decoder). ""Realized in tandem, the respective skincare and makeup collections reconcile minimalism and maximalism; sophistication and playfulness; simplicity and versatility, drawing from both heritage and technology for formulas and packaging that bring luxury and responsibility into harmonious conversation,"" said Prada Beauty in a statement. The new beauty line is positioned at the top-end, with cream and serum costing up to EUR 370 (about GBP 315 or USD 400). It takes 60 euros for the ""Reveal"" foundation (and 50 euros for the refill). The new collection includes: 33 shades of ""Reveal"" foundation; 26 ""Monochrome"" matte lipsticks; six ""Dimensions"" eyeshadows quads inspired by classic Prada prints; three ""Augmented Skin"" skincare products; and ten brushes and tools."
Schwan Cosmetics launches BFF hybrid brow liner with highly natural formulas,"Schwan Cosmetics new hybrid formulation contains no less than 91% Natural Origin Content (NOC) as well as skincare ingredients enriched with nourishing vitamins E and C. Designed to provide a soft and gliding application, the Brow Friends Forever (BFF) brow liner is ""easy to blend and correct"". According to Schwan Cosmetics, it allows users to effortlessly achieve flawless, natural-looking brows. Its waterproof and sweat-proof clean and vegan formula promises long-lasting results throughout the day. ""The mechanical pencil design offers an easy-to-use, precise application, while the formula combines natural oils, pure pigments, and powder fillers for easy blending and a buildable brow finish. A selection of structuring waxes and smart fillers ensure precise strokes,"" said Schwan Cosmetics. BFF was premiered at the latest edition of MakeUp in Paris, last June, with six standard shades currently available to cover the entire brow spectrum and cater to different preferences, including a universal brown shade that accommodates all tones. However, Schwan Cosmetics will develop any specific custom colours upon request. Inspired by the Y2K aesthetic, the packaging design combines vibrant colours, shiny materials, and pearlescent shades for a playful and nostalgic vibe. Of course, all the packaging decorations can be customised to perfectly match with the brand's identity. In a panel test conducted prior to the launch, 100% of participants were satisfied with the product properties of BFF, and 97% confirmed that it provided long-lasting brow results. [1] ""BFF addresses the growing consumer demand for clean beauty products,"" said Elza Davida, Product Manager Brow at Schwan Cosmetics. ""We noticed the limited availability of mechanical brow liners with high Natural Origin Content (NOC) that meet these criteria. With BFF, we wanted to fill this gap by offering a sustainable, high-performance brow liner with a focus on clean ingredients. This is another step forward in our liner leader-ship journey as we refuse to compromise on performance."" At MakeUp in Paris, Schwan Cosmetics also presented an upgraded version of their makeup pencils made from Sulapac's sustainable and biodegradable biomaterials."
Pibiplast: A series of eyelash and lip make-up innovations,"At MakeUp in Paris – which took place on June 14-15, 2023 at the Carrousel du Louvre – Pibiplast presented the output of PibiLab, the company's in-house innovation laboratory, including the second opus of their Make Up Your Mood full service collection created in partnership with formulators for a reduced time-to-market. Hot on the heels of a first opus which was fully dedicated to mascara, the second release of the Make Up Your Mood collection features solutions for eyelashes and lips: – Daring, a volume mascara with an innovative mixed fiber brush. The combination of different fibers results in immediate volume and a fanned-out effect on the lashes. The brush is paired with Pibiplast Porto Cervo mono-material PP package, embellished with a shiny ""nacre"" finish. – Daring Waterproof, a water resistant version presented in a mono rPET packaging, with degradé finish decoration in shades of blue. – Flexy, a lip&cheek make-up solution with an innovative geometric shaped flocked applicator: a versatile solution to accurately apply lip and face products. – Glam & Shiny, a duo product combining a matte liquid lipstick and transparent topcoat for a long-lasting effect. The collection highlights Pibiplast's existing synergies with formulators, thus allowing brands to significantly reduce development and launch times of new cosmetic products. Freshly coming out from PibiLab, Duality is a mascara packaging made up of one single bottle, with two different caps and applicators. With only one formula, two different performances are ensured by the different applicators. The company also displayed its new Smooth Lashes collection, a selection of the most recent launches of plastic mascara brushes. The collection features innovative shapes for increased performance and buildable volume on the lashes, paired with a mono material bottle. At MakeUp in Paris, Pibiplast also showcased Due, an innovative mascara solution, which was launched at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna in March. Selected among the finalists of the IT Awards in the packaging category, this smart proposal is made only of two pieces, instead of the usual five, to minimize the impact on the environment. The monomaterial pack in PP consists of a bottle with embedded wiper and a one-piece cap with rod and brush (bio-based fibres are also available)."
Who are the winners of the MakeUp in Paris Innovation & Trends Awards 2023?,"MakeUp in Paris' Innovation & Trends (IT) Awards are open to all exhibitors at the show. They are allowed to submit up to three skincare and makeup innovations. This year, 31 new skincare and makeup products and packaging, among more than 117 products in the competition, were nominated to participate to the final step. Eventually, the jury awarded four innovations and two ""special mention"" prizes, in the following categories: Accessory, Formulation, Full Service and Packaging. The IT Award in the ""Accessories"" category was scooped by Texen for their Multi-Intensity Brush with an innovative rotating mechanism that allows to adjust the length and density of the tuft to create a complete face make-up look with a single brush. In addition to this single-material (PBT) mechanism, the brush's tuft, handle and ferrule can be customized in terms of shape and material. In the formulation category, MS BeautiLab took home the Award thanks to their Supernova Green injectable powders formulated with 99% ingredients of natural origin, and exclusively certified natural cosmos raw materials. While eliminating microplastics, talc, silicones and my synthetic film-forming agents, they have an ultra-sensorial, creamy texture that offers high-performance rendering and a high level of shine. Also in the same category, Aircos (Anjac Health & Beauty Group) won the special mention ""Wow Effect"" prize for their Hypnotic Very Noir compact eyeshadow with a creamy-powdery texture and an intense, golden-black metallic effect. In the ""Formulation"" category, the award went to Italy's Trendcolor for coCOOLmelon, a blush with a hybrid formula between skincare and make-up, based on watermelon pulp and seed oil. Designed by Belotti, the case evokes the freshly picked fruit and when you open it, the pigments and active ingredients float inside the base like watermelon seeds. In the same category, the special mention for ""Technical Innovation"" went to Chromavis Fareva for Maya, a new technology enabling multi-colour heat-cast visuals with high relief and definition down to 1 centimetre. It was presented in a cast texture formulated with 94% natural ingredients, extra slippery, creamy and enveloping, contrasting with the vibrant, deep colours and 3D relief. Eventually, the Packaging award went to Taiwanese company Libo Cosmetics for its Venus Refillable Aluminium Lipstick. The packaging is made exclusively from 100% aluminium, including the cap and shell, without creating plastic waste. Its refillable mechanism further enhances the ecological aspect of the design. The lipstick case is customizable with a wide range of finishes, including matte, satin and gloss metallic finishes. The next edition of MakeUp in Paris will be held on May 29 and 30, 2024."
Using deepfake technology to make virtual makeup testing more realistic,"The pandemic has clearly accelerated online sales in the beauty industry. While consumers have by no means deserted stores, they can now enjoy a hybrid and customised experience, both online and in person. Available from a number of makeup and hair colours brands, virtual testing allows users to test all kinds of products online, including foundation, lipstick and eyeshadow. Apparently, the technology holds great appeal, although some consumers are complaining about a certain lack of precision, potentially linked to poor lighting or an average-quality camera. This observation prompted three students from ESSEC business school in Cergy, France, to push back the limits of technology to enable as many people as possible to enjoy an online shopping experience combining personalization, inclusivity and realism. All this is based on artificial intelligence, through a combination of augmented reality and the art of the deepfake. Sometimes seen as a threat when misused, sometimes viewed as an incredible innovation, in the case of virtual makeup testing, this kind of hyper realistic imagery turns the consumer into a virtual model, literally becoming the face of their own beauty needs and preferences. More concretely, the URMODEL project, by French students Inès Flammant, Marie Landrevie and Sophie Martinez, involves using the two aforementioned technologies to enable anyone with a mobile phone to see themselves as the model on e-commerce websites, so that their face becomes that of the models they are used to seeing when purchasing a makeup product, all with the most realistic representation. Thanks to this technique, all skin tones and skin issues or characteristics can be taken into account during an online testing session, without the fear of buying the wrong shade or product range. Although not yet accessible to consumers, this project won the three young women the international L'Oréal Brandstorm competition, the results of which were announced at the Viva Technology trade show in Paris. No fewer than 30,000 teams from over 70 countries competed, with just 10 teams remaining in the running for the final. The prize provides the three students with the opportunity to benefit from three months' support from L'Oréal to develop their project at the Group's headquarters. The three winners have already thought of improving their concept via machine learning, so that eventually, users will be recommended beauty products according to the characteristics and needs of their previously scanned face."
L'Oréal presents its latest Beauty Tech solutions at VivaTech,"Beauty Tech is now inseparable from the cosmetics giant's core business: it has grown to more than 5,900 dedicated employees, more than 800 online services with 40 million service sessions in 2022. The novelties presented by L'Oréal this year at VivaTech include: inclusive beauty tech solutions such as Hapta from Lancôme, designed to enable people with physical limitations to apply makeup, initially displayed at CES in Las Vegas earlier this year; diagnostic and coaching tools, such as La Roche-Posay Spotscan, Meta Profiler by Giorgio Armani and Kérastase K-Scan; personalized beauty tech solutions such as 3D shu:brow by shu uemura for a professional eyebrow look at home, L'Oréal Paris Colorsonic for a mess-free even at-home hair colour and the Maybelline Beauty App virtual makeover; and sustainable beauty tech solutions with Water Saver from L'Oréal Professionnel, which was launched in 2021 and has saved over 42 million litres of water to date. Focus on four novelties Four innovations particularly got our attention: Shu Uemura, Phygital Stickers Inspired by Japanese calligraphy, Shu Uemura's phygital stickers are driving a bridge between physical and digital beauty experiences thanks to the latest NFC technology. Each Shu Uemura sticker is a 'wearable accessory'. Upon scanning them, the users are directed to Snapchat, then the app uses face recognition technology to unlock an associated augmented reality experience – through A/R lenses, that enhances the user's looks, based on Shu Uemura's Japanese themes. Kérastase, K-Scan This handheld AI-powered scalp and hair smart camera can scan, diagnose and track scalp and hair health-related conditions. K-SCAN uses three kinds of light (white, cross- polarized and UV) to analyse all types of hair and scalps and give stylists the insights they need to address the needs of their clients. Giorgio Armani, Meta Profiler Giorgio Armani's Meta Profiler service is an in-store, 10-minute diagnostic consultation that analyses the consumer's skin in high precision, to then deliver a tailor-made Crema Nera routine and a personalized Armani beauty ""Meta Sculpt"" boosting protocol. La Roche-Posay, Spotscan Developed with leading dermatologists, this free diagnostic tool for acne sufferers has been validated by a clinical study. From just three selfies, Spotscan analyses and scores imperfections to recommend a personalized La Roche-Posay routine. Targeting teenagers and young adults, Spotscan doesn't replace an appointment with a dermatologist, but provides a vital first step in understanding their skin condition in a simple way. In addition, L'Oréal also gave details on its partnership with Impact+ to measure the impact of its digital media activities and on its three-year partnership with Alibaba to reduce the impact of its e-commerce activities in China. ""This level of innovation would not be possible without the growing complementary expertise of Beauty Tech teams, as well as, our open innovation program via partnerships with some of the world's most exciting startups and tech leaders,"" said Barbara Lavernos, Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Research, Innovation, and Technology, L'Oréal Groupe. ""Technology and science enable us today not only to offer unmet services to our consumers, but also to transform ourselves from research to human resources to manufacturing or retail to invent the future of beauty."""
"""Eco-responsibility is a real challenge for sun care products"", Alpol","In a context of growing concern about climate change and global pollution, consumers are looking for products that help them reduce their environmental footprint. In the case of solar products, eco-innovation is coupled with an unavoidable requirement for product efficiency. ""As far as sun care products are concerned, the criteria that consumers are increasingly seeking are: respect for the skin and the environment, as well as advanced sensorial qualities. They want efficient products, together with a pleasant and sensory application. Sun protection products are transforming into real skin care products. Transparency on the composition and the consequences on the environment are additional challenges,"" explains Alpol Cosmétique, a French contract manufacturer specializing in skin care products. In 2015, Alpol created a working group dedicated to sunscreen products with the mission of finding the best formulations combining product efficiency, sensorial qualities and environmental friendliness. ""The poor reputation of certain organic filters, as well as regulatory changes around the world have forced our experts in sun care products to test new formulations,"" highlights the company. As a result of this extensive research, Alpol Cosmétique is launching a new range of six eco-friendly sun care products that are free from PEG, ""controversial filters"" and silicones. – Soft Care Water Resistant Spray SPF 50+, a water resistant spray with a UVA/UVB ratio higher than the regulatory 1/3 and a fluid texture that allows a quick penetration as well as a silky finish. – Anti Pollution Shield SPF50+ PA++++, a two-in-one sun care cream that efficiently protected from sun and pollution, with an moisturizing and easy to apply fluid texture. – The Ideal Care Cream SPF50+ that combines hydration and sun protection with a melting and gliding texture offering a powdery finish that leaves the skin soft and non-shiny. – Velvet Emulsion Protection SPF50+, combines four UV filters for a really high protection against UV rays. Its melting and gliding feeling leaves the skin soft, silky and with no greasy finish. – Protecting Milk SPF50+, a semi fluid milk glides with a UVA/UVB ratio higher than the regulatory 1/3. – Cream To Powder SPF50+, a hydrating and softening skin an sun care product, with a compact texture that allows a cream application and a powdered finish. For an optimal reduction of the environmental footprint, Alpol Cosmétique has formulated the products with ingredients of natural origin in the highest possible concentrations and has tested the compatibility of certain formulas with packaging mixing plastic and cardboard. ""However, beyond environmental-friendliness, consumer awareness of skin cancer risks and premature aging due to exposure to UV rays, leads them to favour a high sun protection factor. This is why we have developed all our sunscreens with an SPF50+"", adds Alpol. For the development of these new formulas, Alpol's R&D team relied on state-of-the-art equipment, in particular a high-performance optical microscope with a high definition camera, a filter solubilization calculation tool (developed by in-house) and in vitro SPF tests conducted internally to save time and improve performance. For all new projects of sun protection product, three support and customization options are possible depending on the needs and priorities of brand: ready-to-use tested products that are immediately available; products with specific tests adapted to brand needs; or products with extensive customization."
Yves Rocher strengthens its solid offering with new cosmetics and perfumes,"As many other beauty giants, Yves Rocher is tapping into the solid cosmetics segment, which seems to be gradually taking root in consumer routines. ""Our collection of solid cosmetics has been developed with eco-design in mind and the ambition of offering more responsible beauty products, free from plastic waste, in order to reduce our environmental footprint,"" explains Philippe Msika, Research Director Innovation & Development at Yves Rocher. To complete its range of solid cosmetics launched in 2021, the brand is debuting two new beauty items in June: a first Solid Face Scrub, and a Conditioner Bar for all hair types. Formulated without sulphated surfactants and without soap, the new Solid Face Scrub is infused with organic peppermint grown close to the brand's historic in Brittany, France. 100% plant-based grains allow a gentle scrub while the 60% recycled cardboard packaging is fully recyclable, with zero plastic waste. For its part, the new Conditioner Bar promises to nourish the hair for 72 hours, to detangle it and facilitate styling, with a formula that restores softness and shine without weighing it down. Easy to rinse, it is formulated without silicone, it is vegan, and infused with organic flower oils grown in Brittany. From August 21, 2023, four fragrances (Sur la Lande, Cuir de Nuit, Sel d'Azur, Plein Soleil) from the Pleines Natures fragrance collection will be available in solid versions. This new range is alcohol-free and is made of wax and vegetable oils. These solid fragrances, intended for intimate perfuming, can be combined with the corresponding Eau de Parfum, for a more intense sillage. These new fragrances (13 g - EUR 17.90) are presented in a fully recyclable lightweight tin box, free from plastic."
Industry 4.0: How artificial intelligence could transform factories?,"There has been an explosion of interest in uses of AI across many sectors since the launch last year of chatbot ChatGPT from US start-up OpenAI. And at last week's Hanover Fair on industrial technology in Germany, the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) in the manufacturing sector was firmly in focus. An illustration of the potential of AI was given by American IT services provider HPE. Via a tablet in his hands, a young employee of the company was able to chat with an AI-equipped virtual assistant, asking it to operate the arm of a robot. In order to solve a technical problem, ""factory workers no longer need to get a qualified expert on site: the artificial intelligence takes charge"" of guiding the repairs, said Thomas Meier, a data analyst from HPE who was presenting the prototype. The US firm, which has some 60,000 employees, has been working for the past year with Aleph Alpha, a German start-up with some 50 staff, seen as one of OpenAI's leading European rivals. The innovation communicates with factory workers who can, for example, send a photo of a machine for the programme to detect any problems or check that it is correctly installed. Aleph Alpha's resources are modest compared to those available to OpenAI, which has received major financing from Microsoft. But the German start-up believes it has at least one major advantage — it will keep customer data in Europe. But Aleph Alpha CEO Jonas Andrulis told AFP that Europe's contribution to the AI revolution must go ""beyond regulation"". At another stand at the Hanover fair, Siemens was also exhibiting an application aimed at improving factory performance. In partnership with Microsoft, the German industrial conglomerate is this year planning to bring out a new version of the Teams messaging platform. It will feature ChatGPT and be specifically designed to help workers and spot defaults in products. Microsoft and Siemens, who say they are working with a number of clients in the automotive and aerospace industries, rejected accusation that AI will lead to job losses. Anthony Hemmelgarn, CEO of Siemens Digital Industries Software, said that 70 percent of issues were not being recorded and that AI was ""not replacing anybody"", as certain tasks were not getting done. ""It's all about increasing efficiency"", he added. Another advantage that AI could bring is ""alleviating the shortage of skilled workers"", particularly in Germany, said Jochen Koeckler, head of the Hanover fair organisers. In Europe's biggest economy, almost 58 percent of manufacturers complain of workforce shortages, according to a study by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training published in December. For Andrulis, AI will undoubtedly lead to huge upheavals in the world of work. But he also sought to offer assurances. ""It's not like AI will take your job. But the company who will use AI will take the market share of the company who doesn't."""
Schwan Cosmetics strengthens their face portfolio with hybrid concealers,"Launched globally on at the occasion of Cosmopack Bologna, the Pure On-The-Glow Concealer (a liquid concealer with a sheer light-diffusing finish and instant moisturizing effect) and Pure Easy-Peasy-Glow Concealer (a lightweight formulation offering an instant moisturizing effect with a light, diffused finish, and medium coverage to create a natural look) are the latest additions to Schwan Cosmetics' face portfolio. Inspired by skinimalism and with the aim to streamline the daily beauty routine of consumers, the new products combine colours and skin care benefits. ""Our team of experts worked diligently to achieve the perfect formula balance, which contains Hyaluronic Acid and Erythritol, a moisturizing derivative of fermented sugar. That way, the skin feels fresh and hydrated. Looking forward, we are excited to continue exploring the inter-section of colour and care in our future R&D efforts. This new concealer concept is just the beginning of our commitment to creating innovative face products that seamlessly blend the benefits of skincare ingredients with the power of colour cosmetics,"" said Katrin Hollmann-Raabe, Director Formula Development, at Schwan Cosmetics. Clinical studies have proven the skin benefits delivered by the new concealers. ""Our efficacy study [1] confirmed that more than 90% of volunteers had a significant reduction in under-eye bags and increased skin tightness, smoothness, and moisture,"" highlighted Leonardo Luce, Head of Competence Unit Color & Care, at Schwan Cosmetics. Furthermore, 91% of consumers reported smoother skin at the crow's feet, and 100% noted a moisturizing effect on their skin after applying the concealers. Alongside the new concealers, Schwan Cosmetics also showcased a wider collective of highlighters, blushers, and primers to celebrate a comfort-first mindset and no-size-fits-all-approach to skincare-colour-cosmetic-hybrids. In addition, Schwan Cosmetics unveiled the first felt tip pencil liquid eyeliner and also showcased their colour cosmetic pencils made with Sulapac sustainable and biodegradable biomaterials."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics unveils a rechargeable mechanical cosmetics pencil,"Faber-Castell Cosmetics' latest innovation in the field of responsible packaging -– a rechargeable mechanical cosmetics pencil — took the stage at the latest Cosmopack fair, which was held in Bologna in March. Still in the process of being industrialized this new solution has been developed with the aim to reduce waste and add more value to the product. ""While wooden pencils are an important segment that is highly appreciated by professional make-up artist, mechanical plastic pencils are our key category. Consumers appreciate them because they more convenient to use and facilitate make-up application. Therefore, it is of the highest importance to decrease their environmental footprint,"" Dagmar Chlosta, President, told Premium Beauty News. Consumers just have to switch out the cartridge when it's empty or when they want to change colours, or simply change the application area. The rechargeable pencil was presented featuring two different vegan and clean textures for lips, eyes and brows. At Cosmopack 2023, Faber-Castell Cosmetics also showcased a new line of high-performing wooden cosmetics pencils for eyeliners, lipliners and browliners. ""On the heels of the launch of our PEFC-certified airtight wood pencils, we wanted to create a line with strong colour payoff and high smoothness. Additives like upcycled olive stone powder and upcycled organic avocado oil allow the formula a creamy and soft-gliding application suitable for all application areas,"" explained Claudia Heinig, Head Of Marketing. In addition, the pencils are now available in different lengths and with different ferrules. Both the rechargeable mechanical cosmetics pencil and the high-performing wooden cosmetics pencils line are part of Faber-Castell Cosmetics' new Protopia collection. Forged by US editor/publisher Kevin Kelly, the Protapia concept is based on the belief that ""it is possible to make the world a little better - step by step."" With regard to cosmetics this can include, according to Faber-Castell, choosing products designed to reduce waste and consciously use nature's resources."
I.D. Swiss Botanicals harnesses the potential of plant-based neurocosmetics,"Founded in 2021 by Cédric Rimella and wife Aude, a doctor and dermatologist in Lausanne, after three years working hard on R&D, I.D. Swiss Botanicals combines science and nature to connect wellness and beauty. ""We have been trying to understand the link between our skin and our brain. It is widely acknowledged that mental wellness has a direct impact on the skin. We use neuroactive ingredients, including the CBD molecule, and we have also been working on the endocannabinoid system skin receptors to trigger communication by applying a product on the skin"", explains Cédric Rimella. The laboratory owns several active complexes, including CBDVectorS, which can be integrated to formulas as liposomes or double encapsulations. These actives are combined to make up the base of the range products, which contain at least 99.4% of ingredients of natural origin: a moisturizing serum rich in hyaluronic acid, a skin-brightening moisturizing cream, and a (neuro)cosmetic mask. Performance is focused on prevention rather than repair, by strengthening the skin and helping it regulate its response to daily aggressors, like UV rays, pollution, etc. ""We have measured an antioxidant effect of over 56% (vs vitamin E), reduced skin sensitivity up to 67%, and enhanced cell renewal up to 30%. We aim to provide skin cells with energy (+300%), so they can protect themselves from aggressors,"" says Rimella. The brand has also released Skin Stress Balancer, a powder-based serum to be mixed with a day cream and recently received a Product Innovation award by The Beauty Short List for it. ""It is a simple gesture: users just have to mix a bit of cream and a bit of powder in their hands and gently massage the skin to complete their skincare product without modifying the texture and smell. We provide additional efficacy without imposing a routine change"", adds Rimella. With this flagship product with an atypical form, I.D. Swiss Botanicals firmly positions itself as a Made-in-Switzerland brand with natural, technical, efficient, and relatively affordable products: 69 euros for the serum for 160 applications. Other than on its e-shop, the brand is present in Switzerland, the EU, and the UK, and is now making its debut in the US. The products are distributed through specialized, consulting-oriented channels (beauty salons, spas, chemists', or concept stores), although a few major companies, including Nocibé in France, Druni in Spain, Sephora in the UK, and Manor in Switzerland (starting from 2023) have already taken hold of the project. The new reference to be launched this year is also focused on plant-based ingredients with neuroactive properties and on the powder solution. ""We deeply believe in this type of formula, because it is pleasant to only sell efficacy, but our customers are not used to that yet. We actually aim to boost the efficacy of their routines by targeting the root causes of skin ageing. As part of our research, for example, we have been working on cell/neuronal regeneration or cell energy and mitochondria. We convey this fundamental research in cosmetic products, thanks to I.D. Swiss Botanicals,"" concludes Rimella."
"La Bouche Rouge launches upcycled, natural and refillable fragrances","Known for its luxurious plastic-free makeup products, the brand created by Nicolas Gerlier is launching its very first collection of perfumes with a major challenge: to show that luxury can be resource efficient. With 30% upcycled ingredients and 90% natural ingredients, La Bouche Rouge bets on formulations that are ""respectful of the environment and our skin,"" and from which all ingredients that do not meet the criteria of zero impact on nature have been discarded. In the same vein, the brand has chosen to use 100% organic alcohol. The result is a collection of five perfumes, identified by five colours illustrating their personality: Rouge, by Dora Baghriche, Nude, by Alexandra Monet, Bleu, by Alexis Grugeon, Ambre, by Coralie Spicher and Rose by Nicolas Bonneville. As far as packaging is concerned, La Bouche Rouge has designed a perfume bottle inspired by its other iconic objects. The result is a 100ml refillable bottle topped with a twist off spray, housed in an entirely hand-crafted leather case, coming in the five colours of the fragrances in the range. The leather, as for the makeup line, comes from the prestigious Tanneries du Puy, and is certified by the label 'entreprise du patrimoine vivant' (living heritage company). The leather protect the glass bottle and allowed La Bouche Rouge to ask the glassmaker to aim a zero waste target in its production. ""In traditional production, a third of all bottles are rejected for small imperfections in the outer glass or shape of the inner drop. La Bouche Rouge is putting a stop to this wasteful madness for the 21st century,"" claims the brand. To reduce pressure on resources, the brand has developed a single material, plastic-free refill made of 100% upcycled aluminium and 100% recyclable. To completely eliminate plastic, the brand had to invent a breakable pouring spout. ""If a perfume refill is just a second glass bottle with a plastic tip, how much unnecessary waste does that produce ?"" questions La Bouche Rouge. To really encourage changing habits, the brand has also chosen to allow real savings when buying the refill. Thus, the perfume extract in the 100 ml glass bottle is sold for 195 euros, and the 100 ml refill is offered at 95 euros. ""In the world of beauty, the revolution is played out in the search for balance between aesthetics, performance and sustainability,"" concluded Nicolas Gerlier, the brand's President and Founder."
Trade shows : Six innovative formulas spotted at MakeUp in Los Angeles,"In keeping with current major beauty trends, exhibitors at MakeUp in LosAngeles pushed inventiveness to the highest level in order to showcase natural formulas as well as packaging solutions with a reduced environmental footprint. New York headquartered Mana Products, for instance, presented an amazing lotion for sensitive skin offering SPF 50 and broad spectrum UVA and UVB sun protection with a formula composed only of non-nano mineral filters. Composed of 86% ingredients of natural origin, the formula called Skin Barrier Lotion SPF 50 can be used as a primer or as a moisturizing and soothing lotion. It transforms upon application into a powder that blends from transparent to clear with a matte finish without a white streaking or flaking. Skin Barrier Lotion SPF 50 won the Innovation Award from MakeUp in LosAngeles in the formulation category. Italy's Chromavis Fareva introduced Inception, a powder made from a new thermosetting technology offering a solid-fluid consistency similar to the feel of porcelain when applied to the skin. Its formula is based on a blend of low melting point waxes. Chromavis Fareva was also distinguished with Snowglobe, a lip product in stick format with a novel patented rigid structure that combines liquid and solid textures in a single transparent ball that can incorporate three different types of liquid core: a fluid hybrid core infused with water-soluble actives, a liquid gloss or an anhydrous liquid lipstick. Snowglobe received the ""Coup de Coeur"" award from the MakeUp in LosAngeles Innovation Awards in the formulation category. Focusing on naturalness, Pascual Cosmétiques (Anjac Health & Beauty Group) showcased a universal primer dubbed Skin Refiner with a 99.7% natural formula that blurs small imperfections and evens out skin tone. Its light, non- greasy texture melts on contact with the skin. For its part, MS BeautiLab presented Skin Fusion, a ""care veil"" based on dermofusion a dermofusion technology that allows an optimal concentration of active ingredients and merges the advantages of anhydrous and aqueous cosmetics. The product is contained in a 100% biodegradable packaging. Under the effect of massage, the texture changes from solid to liquid to fuse with the skin. Skin Fusion won the Innovation Award from MakeUp in LosAngeles in the Full Service category. Honored with a ""Coup de Coeur"" award in the Full Service category, ITIT Cosmetics' MakeUp Snacks come in the form of single dose products with different colors and for different types of use (eyeshadows, lipsticks, eyeliners, kohl, lip contours, lip balms, glosses, highlighters). According to the company, the format is ideal for air travel as well as for creating make-up testers at points of sale."
Eclo adds semi-solid foundation to its regenerative beauty range,"For the new, Cosmos-Organic-certified range, Eclo has taken up the challenge of formulating makeup with 100% organic ingredients or ingredients of natural origin, and eco-designed packaging. The main active, rye, is combined with vegetable waxes – castor, coconut or sunflower – for a melting texture with nourishing properties. ""It's a sensory, long-lasting balm that's easy to apply, with adjustable coverage, and a natural finish"", says Priscille Charton, the co-creator of the brand. All formulas contain an active derived from regenerative agriculture. Here, the organic rye extract was selected for its action on skin tonicity, but also because its numerous roots help restore the habitat of living organisms in the soil, and therefore biodiversity. ""This plant also withstands climatic hazards"", says Priscille Charton. ""We aim to source raw materials from regenerative agriculture and to build bridges between producers, who thus leave the full power to nature, and the cosmetics industry, which most of them do not supply"", she adds. Ten shades are presented in the range packed with the iconic compostable solution developed by Sulapac. ""It was a technical challenge to cover as many skin tones as possible, from the lightest, pinkish porcelain, to the darkest, chocolate. Very light shades are generally not well represented in foundation ranges, so we worked a lot on these ones. As for white, the formulas contain non-nano titanium dioxide"", she explains. Launched eight months ago after a fundraising campaign on Ulule, Eclo is available in an increasing number of concept stores in France, in addition to its e-shop. ""We have received a lot of incoming applications. Outlets feel that we have a value proposition and that we are actually meeting customer needs with healthy, travel-size, easy-to-use makeup products that beautify, without seeking to transform"", says Priscille Charton. This enthusiastic reception has enabled her to consider extending the existing lipstick and blush ranges in 2023, with shades chosen in collaboration with her community, and a mascara. ""Our biggest task is to encourage the use of regenerative agriculture in cosmetics, at all value stages,"" she concludes."
The beauty innovations spotted at CES 2023,"Skincare has been booming since the start of the pandemic, with a focus on personalization and accessibility. The goal? To allow as many people as possible to pamper their skin at home by responding to specific, individual needs. This is increasingly made possible by artificial intelligence, which has been reshaping the beauty industry for several months. The Cosmechip device from the South Korean group Amorepacific, for example, lets home users concoct entirely personalized treatments thanks to a little water and various Active-Chips, containing ingredients tailored to specific skin issues. And this all happens in a single step, since all you have to do is insert the chip into the device and the ingredients will mix with water to form a treatment product ready to be applied to the skin. In addition to personalization, the device allows you to obtain fresh – and therefore effective – skincare products without having to worry about shelf-life. For its part, also with the help of artificial intelligence, L'Oréal presented Brow Magic, an applicator allowing personalized eyebrow makeup, in a few seconds, at home. Amorepacific also introduced Tonework, a science-led bespoke makeup brand that empathizes individuality and allows customers to find their ideal makeup colour through the Authentic Color Master algorithm. This AI driven algorithm performs precise colour analysis in 3,448 areas of the face, with emotion recognition. The service collaborates with the Tonework Alchemist, a fully automated multicategory cosmetic manufacturing device, to rapidly produce various personalized products. After the personalized 3D printed sheet masks launched in 2019, and a skin analysis app launched in 2020, Neutrogena continues to explore the potential of personalization in cosmetics. This year, the Johnson & Johnson group brand thus introduced, in partnership with personalized supplements specialist, Nourished, a range of 3D printed gummies tailored to the nutrient needs of each individual's skin. L'Oréal also presented an applicator that can mimic the movements of a makeup routine to help those who cannot apply lipstick or mascara. Dubbed HAPTA, this smart, portable applicator is intended for people with limited arm or hand mobility. Featuring a 360-degree swivel magnetic attachment with 180-degree flexibility, the device stands out for its ability to mimic the different actions of a beauty routine via customizable accessories. This can range from handling packaging to the precise application of a product such as mascara or lipstick, for example, L'Oréal says. Currently, in development, the applicator will be launched by Lancôme, one of the group's brands, sometime in 2023. After skin shade analysis, L'Oréal has introduced its Hair Reader, a hair colour evaluator, which analyses the client's hair, measuring factors that influence the effectiveness of hair dyes, including hair colour, grey percentage, length, and density."
CES 2023: Neutrogena introduces 3D printed personalized beauty gummies,"Skin diagnostics, virtual try-ons or customized skincare solutions have been among the essentials of the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas for several years, which opened its 2023 edition to the public today. Riding on the trend, Neutrogena is launching a new-generation range of gummies. A novel offering that is the result of a collaboration between the cosmetics brand and personalized supplements specialist, Nourished. The two organizations have worked hand in hand to develop gummies tailored to the nutrient needs of each individual's skin, and all of which are 3D printed. To achieve this, Neutrogena invites consumers to use Skin360, its skin diagnosis mobile app, which was presented a few years ago at CES. However, the gummies can alternatively be prepared and purchased online via a dedicated platform called SkinStacks, which is also the name of these new supplements. The idea is quite simple, and relies on artificial intelligence, and more specifically on skin diagnosis through a scan and a questionnaire. These allow users to obtain a one-month course of gummies containing the necessary ingredients to pamper their skin. In detail, all you have to do is visit the website or the mobile application, and then start the diagnosis with a 360-degree scan of your previously cleansed skin. An initial assessment provides information on the current state of the skin, whether in terms of wrinkles or radiance. Then consumers are asked to fill out a questionnaire about their goals, their beauty routine, the problems they encounter on a daily basis, or the level of pollution where they live. Once these two steps are completed, the algorithm creates the gummies that best match the user's skin, with no less than seven layers of ingredients specifically selected according to its specific needs: vitamins, zinc, selenium, and other nutrients designed to enhance the skin. It's a sort of tailor-made beauty prescription! All that's left is to do is buy the gummies that will then be 3D printed by Nourished."
Serge Lutens opens its olfactory universe with its At Home collection,"Premium Beauty News - How does At Home fit into the Serge Lutens universe? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - With At Home, Serge Lutens the architect meets the perfumer through five novel olfactory journeys transcribed in three gestures. A storyteller, an immobile traveller, an eternal dreamer, he invites us on an olfactory world tour of the Houses he chose and whose character has always seduced him: from the meditative Japanese residence to the rocky Scottish house, from the luxuriant Moroccan night garden to the lavish woodwork of an Arabian palace, and finally to the familiar, clean and comforting welcome of a linen closet. Premium Beauty News - What is the link between a Home Fragrance collection and fine fragrances? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - This new collection is the next logical and legitimate step in the well-thought-out diversification of the brand. After perfumes and make-up, home fragrances prolong and intensify the link between our customers and the brand. This collection stands as an obvious option for our extremely loyal customers. Premium Beauty News - Were the inspirations different? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - The desire to create home fragrances grew out of the unprecedented situation we all experienced during the first lockdown measures. Feeling comfortable at home appeared to us all as a need and for Mr Lutens as a new creative opportunity. Just like the desire to travel while staying at home. Mr Lutens likes to place himself in the lineage of immobile travellers, a theme often discussed in the literature. His inspirations are the meeting of his experience, his history, but also his imagination and his desires. Premium Beauty News - What was his creative approach? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - As an artist, Mr Lutens always follows the same creative processes, whether it is in the creation of perfumes or the stories associated with them. However, for this collection, he adjusted his approach because a room fragrance recreates an atmosphere that will be shared collectively unlike a skin fragrance which will rather highlight a personality or intimate facets. A particularity of the creation process for this range was the need to adapt the olfactory rendering to different media. The aim was to fully respect the fragrance on the three media: incense, cartridges for the electric diffuser and sprays. We worked with Scentys on the electric diffuser technology with perfume capsules. This partner has undeniable expertise in this field. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose different media ranging from the traditional candle to the electric diffuser, which is quite new in the Home Scent universe? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - For Mr Lutens, a traditional candle is a beeswax candle that conveys the fragrance nobly. ""Commercial"" candles made of paraffin totally detract from the nobility of the essences. The spray solution, therefore, appeared obvious to us as it faithfully conveys the expertise and olfactory richness expected by our customers. Incense is an invitation to Japanese tradition, to a spiritual experience dear to the brand. For this launch, we collaborated with Nippon Kodo, a Japanese company with over 400 years of expertise in this field, guaranteeing exceptional quality. The electric diffuser takes the shape of a lantern, an object that is part of both Japanese and Moroccan traditions. The diffusion system was chosen for the perfection of its olfactory rendering. Premium Beauty News - What is your take on this home fragrance market? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - Successive lockdowns have fundamentally changed the way we live, work and travel. We have taken a closer look at our living spaces, which now take on multiple facets. We enhance them with a variety of means, including home fragrances, to recreate places of well-being and living well. We are recreating a new art of living suiting our present times. For instance, home fragrances can also be used to enhance and give a special touch to the different moments of the day: work, relaxation, or conviviality. We want to make our mark on this market by offering home fragrances in line with our values and our strong identity. Premium Beauty News - Where does this collection stand within the Lutens House? Olivier Tholliez & Marion Doré-Fabius - The pre-launch in boutiques shows us how much this new collection was anticipated by our customers. It clearly meets a need to experience the Serge Lutens brand throughout the day and in all spaces. The At Home spray will now be one of the most affordable products in our range. It will therefore play a recruitment role. The home fragrance will be the first step to entering the Serge Lutens universe. Of course, the collection will be regularly expanded through new media and new fragrances. We are very confident about the future of this range, which will allow a greater number of people to join the Serge Lutens experience."
UK start-up behind algae-based packaging bids for Earthshot glory,"Notpla — whose mantra is ""we make packaging disappear"" — is competing with 14 other firms for five prestigious awards, to be dished out by the prince and a star-studded cast at a ceremony in US city Boston on Friday. In its second year, the initiative to reward innovative efforts to combat climate change will then be broadcast on UK and US television on Sunday and Monday, respectively, as well as online. The five winners will each receive a £1 million ($1.2 million) grant. The co-creator of Notpla, which rather than using environmentally damaging plastics makes various naturally degrading — and even edible — packaging from seaweed and other marine plants, says they have already felt the competition's benefits. ""Just being there is a massive boost to our visibility,"" French co-founder Pierre Paslier, 35, told AFP. ""So that's already a huge asset to be part of the finalists and I think that if we win, it's just going to be that on a much larger scale."" Together with fellow former Royal College of Art student and co-founder Rodrigo Garcia Gonzalez, 38, the duo began their eco-business adventure in a small London kitchen. They were intent on finding natural alternatives to petrochemicals-based packaging, sampling a variety of materials from tapioca seeds to other starches. ""Eventually, we found seaweed,"" explained Paslier, a former packaging engineer at French cosmetics giant L'Oréal who created Notpla with Gonzalez in 2014. ""Now we have a flexible film, we make seaweed paper, we have rigid materials. So it's really the beginning of a family of seaweed-based technologies that hopefully can help us stop using so much plastic."" He said their early kitchen exploits had eventually led to the secretly-formulated ""Ooho"" creation. An edible bubble membrane made from seaweed — holding water, sports drinks or other flavoured liquids including cocktails and sauces — it is marketed as a replacement for single-use plastic cups, bottles and sachets. Tasting like a gelatinous candy, it can be consumed whole — like a cherry tomato — or from a larger sachet, making it ideal at sporting events and festivals. It has been widely used at marathons across the UK, including the 2019 London run. Viral online interest has helped attract the attention of investors, with Notpla expanding rapidly to boast more than 60 employees and finding itself on the verge of manufacturing its products on an industrial scale. Production of ""Ooho"" takes place at the firm's offices in a large warehouse, a stone's throw from the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London. Notpla's growing young team also has laboratories there as it continues to develop new algae-based products. Among the more recent results: a naturally biodegradable coating protecting takeaway food boxes from grease and liquids. The company now supplies industry giant Just Eat in Britain and five other European countries. It also provided the packaging for all the food sold during the final of the women's European football championships at London's Wembley Stadium in July. Another of its new innovations is a transparent package for dry goods, such as pasta. Paslier noted that although his products may currently cost more than plastic alternatives, the latter's sales price fails to account for ""the impact on societal ecosystems, health for humans or for marine life"". ""This is basically going to be paid for [by] the next generations and that doesn't come into the price of plastic that you buy on the market today,"" he added. ""So what we want is to be the most affordable, sustainable packaging solution that takes into account its whole lifetime costs."" Paslier believes seaweed can become the most affordable packaging option, in large part due to its fast growth rate which can top one metre (3.3 feet) a day in the lab. ""It's a very, very renewable resource,"" he added, noting it doesn't require any fresh water or fertilisers. Its emergence is undoubtedly timely. A recent OECD report found, at the current rate, worldwide plastic waste will triple by 2060 to one billion tonnes per year, much of which will pollute the oceans and threaten many species."
C16 Biosciences' bio-manufactured palm oil enters commercialization stage,"Since 2018, C16 Biosciences has been developing a fermentation process based on food waste to produce a palm oil alternative. A precise selection of a yeast strain drives the natural fermentation process to produce a kind of synthetic palm oil that contains as many fatty acids as its plant-derived model. In 2020, this innovative company founded by a Harvard business graduate, a biological engineer and a doctor of physics was producing only ten kilos of its palm oil alternative per week. In the meantime, twenty million dollars have been invested to support the project, in particular by the Breakthrough Energy fund, founded by Bill Gates in 2015. And the results are up to expectations as C16 Biosciences has just announced that its palm oil alternative is headed to market early next year, under the Palmless™ brand name. The company was able to commit to this timeframe after achieving industrial production estimated at 50,000 liters. While the new oil is suitable for use in a whole range of products, from food to household goods, the start-up has said that it may first come to store shelves within beauty products. ""The launch of Palmless™ is a big step forward in making a palm oil alternative a reality. Consumer brands have been seeking a palm alternative for years, but have lacked a real solution - until now,"" said Shara Ticku, co-founder and CEO of C16 Biosciences. ""Brands using Palmless™ in their products demonstrate they are making every effort to reduce their impact on climate change."" Its use is so diverse that palm oil holds the title of most consumed oil in the world, far ahead of soybean oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil. It can be found in nut butter spreads, chips, in instant stock cube, and a wide array of personal care products, including shampoos and lipstick. According to C16 Biosciences, palm oil is found in nearly 50% of products on supermarket shelves in the US. In order to meet this demand, the country's imports of palm oil have increased by nearly 30% since 2014. Indonesia and Malaysia lead in terms of volume, providing 85% of the world's production, according to the WWF. The agricultural areas devoted to palm groves continue to expand: in 2020, in Malaysia, there were 5.3 million hectares compared to 3.3 million in 2000. In addition to deforestation and soil pollution, this form of agriculture also takes away space from certain species such as orangutans and elephants. Palm oil widespread use can be explained through its lower cost compared to other vegetable oils. This will be a determining factor for the success of the alternative solution proposed by C16 Biosciences."
Cosmetic 360: Beauty manufacturers innovate to offer more frugal products,"Cosmetic 360, the trade show dedicated to cosmetic innovation, brought together around 4,000 visitors and more than 200 exhibitors on October 12 and 13, 2022 at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris, France. Reduction of the global carbon footprint, shorter supply chain circuits, innovative supply chains, improved waste management, reduction of transport and packaging pollution: this year, cosmetic makers were the best supporters of more responsible models. At a time when the impact of water consumption linked to cosmetic products is a major issue for our industry, with global warming heaping added pressure on freshwater resources, anhydrous formulations were ubiquitous, coming in several formats, such as powders, sticks, and tablets. ABC Texture, for instance, showcased a reinvented cushion wby remonving the applicator thanks to a memory shape anhydrous texture free from silicone. With a natural origin index of at least 97%, the formula offers a soft focus powder effect. Global Beauty Consulting, which had presented at Luxe Pack Monaco, an anti-aging serum in a stick, in partnership with Superga Beauty and Cosmogen, this time explored the potential of powders for the formulation of anhydrous make-up products. Inavive Lab launched an eco-designed solid sunscreen free from water and chemical filters. The formula protects the marine environment and is suitable for the whole family from the age of three. The format is less bulky than liquid sunscreens and avoids generating plastic waste. Marie Pratt Cosmetics highlighted their solid sunscreen stick (SPF30) free from chemical filters. The 100% natural formula is non-greasy and streak-free upon application and is suitable for cardboard packaging. As for Laboratoires Paris Dôme, a new complete range of solid cosmetics was in the spotlight: wet powder, dry powder, cold saponification, hot pouring, soluble micellar water or shower gel, a shampoo stick, soluble skin cream, etc. Lyophitech presented its freeze-drying solution designed to support manufacturers. The technology transforms plant extracts and formulations into tablets that are easy to handle and dose. Nuwen put the spotlight the focus was on a new format of cleansing gel: a soluble tablet allowing to reduce packaging without impacting the sensory qualities of the product. Its minimalistic and highly nature-based formula contains only essential ingredients and sulfate-free surfactants for an excellent foaming effect. The must-see product at Technature was a hand cleanser formulation in the form of solid beads that melt when they come into contact with water and transform into a cleansing foam. Two of them are enough to clean one's hands. Technature also presents a hydrogel stick formulated with red algae. Its ultra-fresh film-forming effect allows quick and targeted application to the eye contour area. Upcycling confirmed to be a fast-growing trend in cosmetics,. For instance, Alpol Cosmétique has shown with its new Upcycl'Care range, that it is possible to formulate skincare products with upcycled ingredients that are not limited to active ingredients. Portugal's HPRD (Health Products Research and Development) showcased an exfoliant using the cherry pits upcycled from by-products of the food industry. For its part, JRS Rettenmaier showcased a series of minimalist formulas, free from surfactants and fragrances, and very pleasing to the senses, based on apple by-products for highly recycled natural cosmetics. Eventually, Sarbec Cosmetics debuted a 100% natural cream enriched with upcycled ""hyperactive"" pomegranate with a soft and melting texture for day-to-day skincare."
Superga Beauty creates natural fragrances with innovative galenics,"Superga Beauty is continuing to roll out its full-service offering across all areas of the fragrance category. During this must-visit event for luxury brands, the French manufacturer presented a series of innovations focusing on natural ingredients and sensoriality. As fundamental products in promotional perfume box sets, scented derivatives (body lotion, shower gel, aftershave, etc.) have not escaped the trend of natural products and brand specifications must now be sure to integrate this natural dimension into product formulations. Created in partnership with GBC laboratory, an expert in natural product formulations, Superga Beauty's new range of natural scented derivatives named EcoScent+ offers natural formulations that please all five senses, with a controlled cost, and the ability to integrate the specific ingredients of fine fragrances. ""Our experts have successfully mastered the development of effective natural galenic formulations, which are extremely stable, and able to use existing scents, without any change being needed to the formula"", stated Leslie Bréau Méniger, CEO of Superga Beauty. This all-new range of natural products — featuring a shower gel, body lotion, after-shave balm and hand cream all made with a minimum of 95% natural ingredients — is aimed at perfume brands and Indie Brands who wish to create multi-product box sets promoting their fragrances. ""Thanks to our Superga EcoScent+ range, we are able to offer a 360-degree service for brans or, even further up the ladder, project funders. We welcome them with an idea to be implemented, and then are able to make a proposed style guide, design, fragrances and then create the products – formulation and packaging – matching the ideas on which we have agreed. We handle everything, all the way up to joint packaging of the box set"", continued Leslie Bréau Méniger. ""Cost management continues to be a fundamental element in the development of scented derivatives, but not the only one. With Ecoscent+, we support brands in their new focus on eco-responsibility which is now so key to the perfume sector, and fulfilling our role as industrial partner with our clients"", adds Leslie Bréau Méniger. In partnership with Grasse-headquartered perfume maker Expressions Parfumées, Superga Beauty introduced Parfum en Eau, a brand-new range of eight scents based the Aquaco patented technology, which allows to concentrate the most powerful scented essences, in water, without the need alcohol. The result is a transparent liquid, with a non-sticky texture which lasts and has an intensity comparable to that of any alcohol-based fragrance. These alcohol-free perfume formulations boast the advantage of being allergy-free and non-milky. They are packaged in transparent non-lacquered packaging and tint-free bottles. The technology can indeed be used for fine perfume making, and is also available in a Cosmos (natural) version. This new approach to formulation can also be used to create children and baby products, fresh water products, scented hair mists and home fragrances."
L'Oréal creates more inclusive sun care products for Brazilian skins,"L'Oréal Brasil is expanding its sun care portfolio to better address the huge diversity of skin phenotypes in the country. Last year, the company's research and innovation centre developed 11 new coloured sunscreen formulas, increasing its range from 32 to 43 shades dedicated to Brazilian skins. Another change implemented by the company with the aim to provide Brazil's diversity with more inclusive sunscreens: a new nomenclature to classify sun care shades based on a simple numerical scale ranging from 1.0 to 6.0, from the lightest to darker. This evolution was designed by L'Oréal's Consumer & Market Insights team, in partnership with Estúdio Nina, a Brazilian agency specializing in the expectations of colour consumer. A large survey was launched among dermatologists, make-up artists, Black consumers and members of L'Oréal Brasil's AfrouSOU network. The goal was to understand how the coloured consumers perceived the previous names given to the various sunscreen shades and to collect proposals for establishing a new nomenclature. This graduated scale will first be introduced in the Anthelios Ultra Cover and Anthelios Airlicium+ ranges, by La Roche-Posay, Capital Soleil UV-Age Daily, by Vichy, and Solar Expertise Anti Oil, by L'Oréal Paris. By 2024, the entire coloured sun care portfolio of L'Oréal Brasil will have transitioned to the new nomenclature. Due to its geographical and climatic characteristics, Brazil enjoys strong sunshine across most of its territory throughout the year. As a manufacturer of sun protection products, L'Oréal Brasil aims to raise awareness among the Brazilian population about the importance of photoprotection for all skin types, including darker ones, due to the risk of cancer caused by excessive sun exposure. ""The sun's UV rays affect all skin types, regardless of their colour. For lighter skin types, which blush immediately, the impact of UV is more easily visible, hence the myth that darker skin types don't need as much protection. We want to remind consumers that sun protection is important for everyone, because it protects against premature aging, hyperpigmentation and above all against the appearance of skin tumours"", emphasizes Humberto Martins, director of cosmetic research and innovation for L'Oréal Latin America."
Deardot: Anhydrous skin care products in water-soluble sachets,"Straight from South Korea, the brand known for its anhydrous single-dose sheet-type products that transform into a light foam upon contact with water is taking another step towards zero waste with 100% water-soluble and plastic free sachets. On the occasion of the Cosmetic 360 trade show, which was held on October 12 and 13 at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris, Deardot presented two new versions of its nomadic and ultra-practical anhydrous skincare products, this time packaged in sachets which dissolve in water in seconds, with ""no pollutant residue"". For its new Dangyuja Face Cleanser Sheets and Dangyuja Body Cleanser Sheets, packaged in individual sachets, Deadot is therefore shifting from biodegradable paper used in the packaging of its previous products to a brand new solution. After using the cleanser, the sachet dissolves in the sink and can be flushed down the drain ""with no worries about the environment,"" claims the brand. Easy to Easy to carry and use, Deardot's anhydrous sheets are lightweight and hygienic. They combine a low carbon footprint and a sustainable packaging. Deardot's solution was rewarded by the jury of the Cosmetic 360 Awards in the packaging category."
Superga Beauty introduces a solid and eco-responsible anti-age serum,"Surfing on the wave of popularity of stick products, which are increasingly being used in the facial care universe, boosted by start-ups such as Maison Dakōta, or more established brands in search of naturalness and sustainability, Hyalustick is an anti-aging serum in a solid, refillable stick format for direct use on the skin. Thanks to its high concentration of natural hyaluronic acid, combined with a natural addition of three active anti-age ingredients it perfectly combines an immediate smoothing action with deep-acting effect on wrinkles and ageing. ""Effective, natural and strong on the senses,"" the Hyalustick also saves 56% of plastic thanks to its refill system, according to Superga Beauty. This innovation is proposed in Cosmogen's Stick ReUse, a recyclable, watertight and reloadable mono-material (PP) patented packaging. The tube can be filled from the top or from the bottom and can therefore be adapted to different industrial tools. The formula was developed by Global Beauty Consulting (GBC), the creative laboratory partnering with Superga Beauty. ""Hyalustick meets a dual objective and is on-point with trends. Unique for a serum, it reinvents easy-use facial care, which can be applied directly, with a gentle hand massage. It meets the current challenges of eco-responsibility, with a 99% natural formulation, combined with recyclable packaging and refillable, saving on raw materials"", explains Leslie Bréau Méniger, CEO of Superga Beauty. Hyalustick can be customized and adapted to the specific needs of beauty brands through Superga Beauty's full-service offer. At the Luxe Pack Monaco tradeshow, the Superga Beauty group also highlighted its full-service Upcycling offer, also in partnership with GBC, in addition to its full range of expertise - across perfumes, cosmetic and joint packaging - with an offer ranging from the manufacture of a single accessory to complete development of a finished product."
Anhydrous and nomadic: Maison Dakōta reinvents the shape of skincare products,"""We wanted to completely rethink the consumer experience for luxury skincare products. So we decided to divert the lipstick from its original form and adapt it to totally innovative, solid, water-free, yet highly sensorial skincare formulas that can be taken everywhere in a handbag,"" explains Piergil Fourquié, a Parisian designer and co-founder of the brand. Maison Dakōta proposes a never-before-seen product line: premium solid and nomadic skincare products. ""If more and more hygiene and toiletry products can be found in a solid format, skincare products are still rare in this galenical form and almost non-existent when you go upmarket,"" underlines Eva Jouët, co-founder of the brand and also Sales Director of Premium Beauty News. Anhydrous solid formats indeed have the advantage of making saving on the weight of water in the products. In addition to its environmental benefits, this solution allowed adapting it to people on the go. ""We wanted to extend the use of skincare products beyond the bathroom to allow women to protect their skin, anywhere, anytime,"" adds the founder. ""As a starting point, we took the real needs of consumers to come up with a solution matching their expectations"". Maison Dakōta takes its name from Native American hunter-gatherer peoples of North America's plains and forests. ""We wanted to pay tribute to these peoples who, in their traditional way of life, only took from nature what they strictly needed, who were aware of being part of a whole, alongside animals to which they paid homage through totems,"" explains Piergil Fourquié. With this in mind, Maison Dakōta devised a refill system that would limit the consumption of resources and reduce packaging waste. In a similar vein, the formulas were designed to combine ease of use and efficiency in an ultra-compact format. ""The ideal of sobriety has influenced the entire development process,"" admit the two co-founders. ""This led us to do less, but better, to get to the essence thanks to concentrated actives, sometimes even obtained through upcycling."" Free of water, natural formulas can also do without preservatives while maintaining maximum shelf life. These are all choices that involved taking up many technical challenges. ""The project was an ambitious and difficult to implement. The natural and anhydrous formulas made the filling of the stick particularly difficult,"" explains Eva Jouët. In particular, it was necessary to find a company capable of carrying out the project within the budgetary constraints of a start-up. This was quite a challenge, as Maison Dakōta was keen to have products that were 100% made in France. ""Fortunately, the market is changing and suppliers are aware that a large part of the activity is moving towards young emerging brands. The project was technically difficult, but supporting young innovative start-ups is one area where manufacturers really have the opportunity to differentiate themselves,"" she points out. The French brand is now starting its meetings with its customers, through a pre-sales campaign on the Ulule platform from 22 September 2022. ""This is the culmination of many months of research and development. We recently presented our range, with four innovative products. The first feedback is positive. We now have to bring it all to fruition,"" conclude the two founders. The range consists of an Eye Contour, made up of 98% natural ingredients, including a moisturising upcycled coffee oil rich in antioxidants; a Face Care (98% natural) to apply on blemishes for an absorbing and mattifying effect and an immediate corrective effect, made up of upcycled avocado to regulate sebum secretion, volcanic perlite and Candelilla wax; a nourishing and protective Lip Balm, 100% natural thanks to a blend of natural waxes, vegetable oils and shea butter, and finally a solid Pink Pepper Perfume (90% natural), alcohol-free and rich in plant-based emollients. And to match the container with the content, the packaging of each product displays the totem animal to whose protection it is entrusted: the eagle for the eye contour, the bear for the face care, the owl for the perfume and the wolf for the lip balm."
Marionnaud partners with Revieve to debut AI sun care advisor in Italy,"The European retailer of prestige fragrances and beauty products has partnered with digital brand experience creator Revieve to develop a digital sun care advisor for its customers in Italy. Dubbed ""AI Suncare Advisor"", the tool has been designed to provide consumers a hyper-personalized brand experience that helps them discover the most suitable sun care routine based on their skin, their environment, and their lifestyle preferences. ""Suncare products have historically had a bad reputation. Most people think they are sticky, messy, and only suited to one skin type. That reputation plus lack of sun prevention education makes some people shy away from sun protection,"" says Sampo Parkkinen, CEO of Revieve. ""At the same time, consumers are more than ever vocal about their concerns for proper sun care and the need for personalized options to protect their skin from the harmful effects of sun exposure."" This gap inspired Revieve and Marionnaud to develop a new way to enlighten consumers about the importance of sun protection, and help them better understand their skin concerns and conditions, while guiding them on their personal sun care journey. ""The challenge was to provide all that within one seamless online experience,"" emphasizes Parkkinen. Available on the retailer's website the experience consists of three easy steps. At first, consumers input their concerns and expectations out of a sun care routine. Next, they take a selfie that's analysed with patented mobile selfie diagnostics based on advanced selfie skin metrics to detect essential sun exposure concerns, such as hyperpigmentation, melasma, freckles, and wrinkles. Finally, the user is provided with an optimal sun care routine proposal consisting in a curated list of Marionnaud sun care products. ""The AI Suncare Advisor makes it easier for customers to find suitable sun care products tailored to their desired sun care goals. Accounting for each individual user's lifestyle, the AI Suncare Advisor empowers Marionnaud shoppers to educate themselves about their skin health and needs by taking into consideration skin tone, skin type, personal skin health concerns, current lifestyle and environmental factors that may affect their skin,"" concludes Parkkinen."
Who are the winners of the MakeUp in NewYork IT Awards 2022?,"MakeUp in NewYork's Innovation & Trends (IT) Awards are open free of charge to all exhibitors at the show. They are allowed to submit up to three skincare and makeup innovations. This year, 22 new skincare and makeup products and packaging, among more than 100 products in the competition, were nominated to participate to the second step. Eventually, the jury [1] awarded four innovations and a ""jury's favorite"", in the following categories: Accessory, Formulation, Full Service and Packaging. The IT Award in the ""Accessories"" category was attributed to ""The Ocean Brush"" by Raphaël Make-Up Brushes: the handle is made of 50% shell and 50% bioplastic derived from the castor plant, and the head is made of 65% recycled fiber from PET bottle waste and 35% raw fiber. In the ""Formulation"" category, the award went to OPAC for their Beauty Pills, based on a ""Fast Disgregation System"" formulation technology (patent pending), which makes it possible to obtain a 0.14 g solid tablet that, when in contact with water or a serum, transforms into a 2.2 ml cream-gel with a light and velvety texture. This technology, which is fully customizable in terms of active ingredients and performance, introduces whole new prospects in the beauty industry which is precisely seeking innovative and sustainable dosage forms. In the same category, Regi's Cherry Smack was voted ""Jury's favorite"". The innovation consists in an emulsion transformed into a lipstick in stick form, which retains all the benefits of a cream or serum, and provides a lasting sensation of freshness. Its formula, based on organic cherry extract (48%), glycerin and phytosterols, benefits from a process that allows the use of a very low pigment load (3%) while obtaining a high coverage. The Full Service IT Award went to R&D Color for their A316 Royal Balm, a lip balm in a stick pen made of bio-based materials with a sensory formula that glides on the lips while providing a pulpy effect. Although completely transparent, its texture gives a unique pinkish tint to the lips that varies according to the skin's pH. In the ""Packaging"" category, the jury awarded Taesung for their 100% PP Mono Material Airless. This 100% Polypopropylene mono airless has passed the leakage test with the same standard as a normal airless, i.e. 600 mmHg for 10 minutes. With a minimalist design, it also distinguishes itself from existing mono airless by its 0.5cc dosage, ideal for creamy cosmetic formulas. The next edition of MakeUp in NewYork will be held on September 21 and 21, 2023."
"""Inclusive make-up is still a long way off,"" Aïmara Coupet, Be+Radiance","Premium Beauty News - When you speak of Be+Radiance, you prefer using the term healthy make-up rather than clean make-up. Aïmara Coupet - Clean to me doesn't mean much. It's simply about choosing ingredients that are healthy for the environment and people. The same goes for organic and natural, many things in naturalness can harm the skin. We also hear a lot about skincare make-up, but what is it really? Silicone-based products, a petrochemical mineral oil, to which a few drops of hyaluronic acid and a couple of good ingredients have been added. It doesn't respect the skin and provides no benefits, on the contrary. It's only marketing, and it misleads consumers. Healthy make-up means that it is really good for the skin and does not offset the effects of our beauty routine. It should be part of it and not just a cosmetic cover-up. This is tomorrow's make-up and this is the process Be+Radiance is part of. Premium Beauty News - More and more probiotic-based skincare products are appearing on store shelves. You have integrated them into your make-up formulas. How did you become aware of their potential? Aïmara Coupet - In 2018, during a Premium Beauty News Day, I met a doctor in biology who was presenting his work on probiotic encapsulations and their benefits to the skin. His goal was to maintain the probiotic bacteria alive. These encapsulations were very complicated to integrate into cosmetics, but not impossible in make-up products. My foundation was not on the market yet but I was already thinking of developing powder blushes and illuminators. This is how we ended up formulating them with probiotic encapsulations. Our face oil also contains them and users are delighted with them. Studying microbiota is fascinating. We realise how important it is to not impair its balance. However, we do this daily by using active ingredients such as retinol, for example, which are ultra-aggressive and have a disturbing effect rather than a healing effect. Premium Beauty News - You are particularly committed to inclusive beauty. Why is that? Aïmara Coupet - My mother is from Martinique and has black skin. Throughout my childhood, she never managed to find lipsticks or foundations suited to her skin tone on the stands of leading luxury brands. So I was faced with this issue from an early age, but it was only when I came to Black Up that I realised how much of a problem to women it was. Darker skins have completely different skincare and make-up needs, but this difference is not acknowledged and the market wants to stick to a one size fits all approach. Let's take the example of silicone: if lighter skins may benefit from the occlusion effect they provide, this is less true for melanin-rich skins. I also have in mind sunscreens and nacres that tend to make darker skins look grey. Shadows and highlights are not worked in the same way because curves and reliefs are different. The same is true for the lips. Premium Beauty News - With Fenty or Huda Beauty, it seems that progress has been made on the subject of inclusion? Aïmara Coupet - In my opinion, there is clearly a before and after Fenty. There were already a lot of foundation shades available from MAC, Estée Lauder, Clinique or Lancôme. But Rihanna has really revolutionised things by thinking equitably about the needs of all women. This is the first time that a launch was done with a range built in a rainbow and not shade extension. The same goes for textures, which were also designed for both matte and dark skins. Rihanna adopted an inclusive approach from the start and that is what makes her brand so successful. Huda Kattan undertook a similar process with Middle Eastern women. Premium Beauty News - Today, a lot of brands advertise ranges of 30, 40 or 50 foundation shades. Is this the inclusion you've been hoping for? Aïmara Coupet - In the wake of Fenty, all the brands wanted to offer ranges of 50 shades or more. But that's not the point. Today, we need to have a real understanding of the differences in the structure and needs of the skin. That's inclusion and that's my vision for the future. The day when we will come up with ranges that are thought through to the end to take into account the specificities of all skins, then we will be inclusive. It's complicated to get people's attention on the topics surrounding diversity and inclusivity. In all development teams, non-Caucasian skins are under-represented. We are far too Caucasian-centred. Very little has been invested in understanding the needs of melanin-rich skins. Dark skin is an extraordinary medium, you can do magnificent things... as long as you have the knowledge and the will to do so. Premium Beauty News - Your cucumber water foundation only comes in 17 shades? Aïmara Coupet - What is important to me is equity. My rainbow is quite proportionate. There are ranges with more shades than mine, but less choice for coloured skins. It's not logical. Besides, finding one's shade is a debatable notion in make-up. You don't look for a product that matches your skin tone, but rather the right shade to correct your flaws and make your skin look even without it looking too flashy. We don't want to conceal our skin, we want something that will unify, correct, give radiance and blend well. Premium Beauty News - What are the prospects for Be+Radiance? Aïmara Coupet - A seed fundraising in 2020 allowed us to launch the powders and the probiotic oil, and also to beef up our teams, especially in R&D. After two years, our concept has been validated but we need the means to go further. We have been working for a few months on a new seed survey to expand our range and distribution, particularly to enter the North American market."
Prince Charles is launching a Highgrove-scented perfume with Penhaligon's,"Soak up the scent of the gardens of Prince Charles' estate at Highgrove in Gloucestershire. This is what Penhaligon's is proposing with its first fragrance inspired and created by the Prince of Wales. And while the perfume house is used to taking a humorous approach with its olfactory characters that poke gentle fun at the British aristocracy, here it pays tribute to ""the magnificent fragrance of Highgrove gardens in summer, when the odour of blossoming, weeping silver lime fills the air."" Named Highgrove Bouquet, this fragrance is indeed an ode to the gardens of Highgrove House, the residence of the royal family member now nicknamed ""Grandpa Wales."" A real floral explosion, the fragrance is characterized by scents of silver lime, geranium and lavender and seems to be already a hit on social networks. In line with the Prince's environmental vision, the project has been developed with the aim to replace all plastic from the secondary packaging, using 100% recycled and recyclable paper and sugar cane eco-foam, and printing with all organic ink, free of mineral oils. Exclusively available in the United Kingdom, the perfume ""Highgrove Bouquet"" is sold at a price of 155 pounds (around 180 US dollars or Euros) per 100 ml. Part of the proceeds from the sale will go to Prince Charles' charity, The Prince's Foundation. The foundation offers education and training programmes across a broad range of disciplines, from artisanal and heritage craft skills to horticulture and engineering. These are available for all ages and backgrounds, with many programmes taking place at Highgrove itself. This isn't the first time Prince Charles has gone off the beaten path with unexpected product launches. Like Queen Elizabeth II, in 2020 he unveiled his own organic gin, also inspired and created from the plants of the Highgrove garden. A year earlier, it was a collection of ethical clothing that had been launched by a duo of designers with nettles harvested from Highgrove estate."
TiL and Francis Kurkdjian create fragrance with objectified soothing effects,"The virtues of linden go far beyond evening herbal tea. After a fulfilling experience in the beauty industry, Sylvie Polette and her sister Odile revived their childhood memories bathed in the smell of linden at their Dordogne family estate to develop a comprehensive self-care range that pays tribute to this age-old tree. ""We felt like exploring the physiological and holistic properties of this tree, because it is so evocative of happiness. We found out that this plant was in the Pharmacopoeia for its anti-spasmodic and liver- and kidney-detoxifying virtues. Together with the Greentech laboratory team, which carried out the chemical and biochemical analyses, we discovered that linden was also very rich in moisturizing, soothing, and antioxidant molecules, which makes it a very complete anti-ageing ingredient. And then, there is this smell, whose facets are closely related to the popular emotional unconscious. But it is hardly used by perfumers. This tree is good for the skin, body and mind,"" says the brand's co-founder. Based on these new data, the brand's development was driven by a global approach which included cosmetics, food supplements, and an eau de toilette. The Eau qui Enlace fragrance is a wrapping, white floral smell close to orange blossom, with musky and honey notes. ""Linden is a silent flower. Francis Kurkdjian did an extraordinary olfactory job. We told him the story of our estate in Dordogne, of our childhood memories, the wellness we felt, and the whole product environment we wanted to create. He felt like creating a contemporary, luminous, very bright linden – a writing style that would be as delicate and authentic as possible and evoke a picnic under the trees on a summer Sunday,"" explains the co-founder. The perfumer also worked on each cosmetic galenic form based on this storyline, with different facets for each product. Just like they had objectified their skincare formulas, the founders wanted to scientifically assess the emotional impact of their perfume, moved as they were by the public's enthusiasm. A real action was demonstrated based on a measuring protocol developed and executed by neuroscientists Francis Vial and Arnaud Aubert, of the Emospin company specialized in the study of emotions. The protocol was based on the analysis of various components of emotions through verbalization, the emotional charge created by the voice, the words used, the tone, but also the respiration rate… ""We cross-reference the verbal and non-verbal methods which, combined by an algorithm, help quantify the hedonic potential of the experience, by characterizing the emotion felt by the subjects when they discover the perfume,"" explains Francis Vial. Three keywords were expressed by the 22 women consulted as part of the study: joy, appeasement and comfort. ""Comfort had never been related to a perfume in a study,"" says Sylvie Polette. ""What was very interesting about this fragrance was that the results did not really vary from one individual to another, it is the lowest variability ever observed. With perfumes, there is always someone that says 'I don't like it'. Indeed, depending on the many memory, but also sensorial, psychological, or genetic dimensions, there are things to which we are hardly responsive, and we will even be on the defensive. Here, on the contrary, this perfume actually gets optimum acceptance, there is even a sort of craze for it,"" adds the neuroscientist. L'Eau qui Enlace is gentle; there is something intimate about it: it gets top scores in terms of pleasure and relaxation, which confirms the power of olfaction on the emotional state – if proof were needed. Launched in September 2021, TiL is available on the brand's e-shop, til-time.com, as well as through the Beauty Success network. It should open to the European market in 2023."

UVMune 400: L'Oréal's new sun care technology against ultra-long UVA rays,"Available in pharmacies since March 2022 in several markets, including Europe, South America, South-East Asia and South Africa, La Roche-Posay's Anthelios UVMune 400 is L'Oréal 's first range of products to benefit from this technology based on Mexoryl 400 [1], a new generation of UV filters. According to L'Oréal, it is the first that is able to block efficiently ultra-long UVA rays from 380 nm, which alone accounts for 30% of UV sun rays [2]. ""These long UVA rays penetrate the epidermis the most and are among the main causes of skin aging. They also contribute to the development of skin cancer, along with other UVA and UVB rays,"" said the French group in a statement. ""Our L'Oréal R&I teams have successfully risen to the real scientific challenge of inventing a sun filtering technology to cover the UVA zone that was so far less covered. This allows us to provide our broadest filtration and protect the skin from the damaging effects of the sun, even the most insidious. This discovery is fully in line with the Group's approach of providing answers to public health issues, such as the risks linked to skin exposure to UV radiation,"" explains Barbara Lavernos, Deputy CEO in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology at L'Oréal. This launch follows on from several decades of innovation by the L'Oréal group's R&I in terms of protection against UV radiation. The group obtained its first patent for a sun protection oil in the 1930s. In 1982, L'Oréal launched Mexoryl SX, a filter that was effective against short UVA rays and was photostable and hydrophilic. In 1985, it obtained the first photostabilization patent of the Parsol 1789, which made it possible to filter UVA rays up to 360 nm. In 1989, L'Oréal debuted Mexoryl XL, a soluble lipophilic molecule capable of absorbing UVB and short UVA rays and increasing the effectiveness of other filters. With UVMune 400, the solar filtration range is increased by 20 nm. According to L'Oréal, it took 10 years of research to design the new technology, which also benefits from an improved environmental profile. Tested on all skin types and phototypes, La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 is available as either Invisible Fluid SPF50+ or Hydrating Cream SPF50+."
Mono Skincare puts luxury skincare in tablets and offers own technology,"Powders are gaining ground on the segment of anhydrous solutions that help get rid of single-use packaging. Laurie Mias, the founder of the Mono Skincare brand, preferred an even more compact version unique on the skincare market. ""I wanted a convenient solution. Powder can absorb moisture, and it is always hard to get the right quantity of product, so I started from the idea of pills, which did not exist in the cosmetics industry,"" she explains. It took her two years to develop this project focused on an actually unexplored galenic form with a laboratory located in Belgium. Now, the patents she registered make it possible to share her private brand solution with other market players. ""It is a revolution in skincare. No one has done that before, even on the global level. I hope others will follow us,"" says the founder. The Mono Skincare range is composed of 14 references – makeup remover, face cleanser, toner, day cream, serum, deodorant, body mist – with 100% natural formulas and renewable, traceable ingredients sourced in Europe. They are suitable for pregnant women, children, and hypersensitive skins. One tablet can produce 50 ml of solution. Once water has been added, the product is reconstituted in 30 minutes and can be used for six months. Undiluted, a tablet can be stored for 12 months (tests are being carried out to validate the 24-month storage). ""We have designed each product with a very specific promise, focusing on efficacy: results are visible after four days, by acting on the microbiome, integrating prebiotics to nourish the flora. And we took great care to use at least the minimum concentration levels required for ingredients to really have an effect,"" explains Laurie Mias. Packaging is made of recyclable and/or recycled materials: glass, wood, aluminium. All bottles can be refilled over and over. On the e-shop launched last January in French, the brand mainly received encouraging feedback on this new form of beauty. ""More than 40% of our customers have already recommended their tablets. The comments are extremely positive,"" says the founder. ""We wanted to create a very inclusive range; there are many men among our customers, as well as people of all ages. The younger ones like the innovation, while the sophisticated, efficient assets, in particular anti-ageing formulas, help us reach customers aged 50+. As for the price, our products are affordable, about EUR 30, so we offer a high quantity/quality ratio. Then, customers only need to buy the refill,"" she adds. The brand had already confirmed its presence at Sephora Hong Kong and Singapore within the next six months, and it should sign with several major companies in the US, the UK, Australia, and of course, France."
"""LED light therapy helps minimize wrinkles,"" Dr. Jason Wersland, Therabody","At first glance, the TheraFace Pro looks like some kind of futuristic space gun. What is it exactly? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO is the ultimate all-in-one device for facial health, bringing together science-backed treatments and innovative technology with eight treatments in a single, handheld device. This device utilizes the proprietary percussive therapy technology we use in Theragun but optimized for the face — the result is reduced tension, relaxed facial muscles and a deeper level of care for the face. There are already devices on the market that focus on massage and LED light. How does the TheraFace Pro differ from these beauty tech products? Dr. Jason WerslanD - The TheraFace PRO is unique compared to other massage and LED light therapy devices because it combines both of those treatments and more, all into one. Not only does TheraFace PRO include three different light therapies — red, blue, and red + infrared — but it also gives you cleansing, percussive therapy, microcurrent, and cryothermal treatments. We believe in creating products and solutions that will help people reimagine the way they think about whole-body wellness; when it came to TheraFace PRO, we didn't want to create a beauty device like every other one on the market that works primarily on the surface of the skin. Instead, we created an innovative device and introduced an entirely new category to the market, facial health, which targets much more than that surface layer of the skin - it allows you to care for the deeper layers of the skin and the 40+ muscles in the face, which are often overlooked. Did you work with skin and health experts to develop the device? Dr. Jason WerslanD - Everything we do at Therabody is backed by science, and TheraFace PRO is no different. We went through rigorous research and development to create an effective, all-in-one facial device and worked extensively with dermatologists, scientists, medical doctors and skin health experts through the product development process to carefully perfect each modality and understand its benefits for the face. The device is designed to get rid of wrinkles, fine lines and acne, to massage, to improve skin's radiance and tone, and even to cleanse it... Does this mean we can throw out all our creams, serums and other anti-wrinkle products? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO is not a replacement for other products but can be used to enhance the effects of creams, serums, and other products. The way LED light therapy helps minimize fine lines and wrinkles, for example, will work in a different way than the chemical makeup of a serum works — but together, they should create an even longer-lasting effect. Similarly, the hot ring for TheraFace PRO is great to use alongside creams or moisturizers — heat therapy helps those solutions to absorb into the skin faster and deeper. The cosmetics industry is increasingly interested in LED light. What makes it a go-to for skincare today? Dr. Jason WerslanD - LED light has become progressively more popular among consumers because of its versatility and recent increase in accessibility. We recognized the major benefits LED light therapy can have on facial health, so we decided to incorporate that into TheraFace PRO. Red LED light is intended to reduce wrinkles, fine lines, and mild acne scars. Red + infrared light takes those benefits to the next level and adds a therapeutic warming effect that goes deeper into the muscles to temporarily reduce pain and discomfort. Blue LED light can be described as a disinfecting light therapy for the face — it helps treat mild to moderate acne and breakouts. The TheraFace Pro is about beauty, health and wellbeing, drawing on the very concept of holistic beauty, which is often associated more with nature than with technology. Can the two be compatible? Dr. Jason WerslanD - Absolutely! Therabody's entire ecosystem of products and services are at that intersection of nature and technology, and help people work toward achieving holistic wellness. Holistic wellness is more about connecting the wellness of your body and mind than anything else — and this is a construct we keep as a north star through every product we develop. The pandemic has accelerated the arrival of professional-style care at home, but can a device really be as effective as expert treatment? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO does not replace seeing your dermatologist or esthetician if you are working with them on a specific condition, but it is important to keep up with home care in between treatments. For tips and tricks to get the most out of your TheraFace PRO at home, we have carefully curated a series of 'how-to' videos on each attachment, as well as facial routines using a mix of treatments, which are available on our website or by scanning the QR code on your device. Is the device suitable for all skin types? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO is suitable for all skin types. Since every face is different, our versatile eight-in-one device can meet the needs of everybody, no matter your facial health goals. Prior to launching our latest innovation, we conducted a 12-week clinical study with participants ranging from ages 25-61, presenting all skin types. The study yielded amazing results, with 97% showing a reduction in wrinkles around the eyes and increased firmness. The TheraFace Pro is priced at €399, so it is not necessarily accessible to most people. What makes it is a sound and cost-effective investment? Dr. Jason WerslanD - TheraFace PRO is the first facial health product to offer such a wide range of personalized treatments. Gone are the days of spending hundreds of euros on multiple products and devices; this one, easy-to-use, versatile and customizable device helps you simplify your life and your facial routine based on your current and future needs."
Pink Frogs introduces the first eco-label compliant SPF 50+ sun oil,"With the EU Ecolabel no longer limited to ""rinse off cosmetic products"", new development opportunities arose within the cosmetic industry to provide more products in line with the expectations of consumers. To provide brands the possibility of green claims with an official seal, Pink Frogs Cosmetics has developed the first SPF 50+ sunscreen ready to get the European Union eco-label stamp. The Italian contract manufacturer describes its new Smart Rolling Sun Oil as ""the first sunscreen product designed according to the criteria required from Ecolabel, the European Union's ecological quality label for cosmetics with a reduced environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle."" The product was evaluated for its biodegradability and a low aquatic toxicity. According to Pink Frogs, the vegan formula is free from nanomaterials and allergens, and ocean and coral reef friendly, while offering safe protection against UV rays. Beyond the formula, the product also benefits from a refillable recycled plastic packaging allowing a 60% reduction in plastic consumption. Last but not least, ""dispensing the product via a roll-on helps to reduce product wastage by facilitating the application of the desired dose,"" explains Eleonora Tauriello, marketing manager, Pink Frogs Cosmetics."
Start-ups: AI-powered Proven Skincare launches personalized eye cream duo,"Since its launch, Proven Skincare has achieved impressive growth. The company's sales rose from less than USD 100,000 in 2019 to USD 10 million in 2020 and to more than USD 20 million during 2021. Co-founded by strategy consultant Ming Zhao and data scientist and an engineer Dr. Amy Yuan, Proven Skincare utilizes a three-minute quiz to create an individual profile based upon more than 45 categories, including skincare goals, geography, genetics, lifestyle, and more. The promise of this data crushing is a personalized combination of ingredients matching the customer's specific skincare needs initially delivered in a set of three different products: a day moisturizer, a cleanser and a night cream. To create the individual profiles, the algorithm created by Proven is capable of interrogating the ""Skin Genome Project"", an in-house database of built over 28 million consumer reviews and 4,000 skin-related research papers. According to the creators, it is ""the largest beauty database on earth"". The same technology was used to create Proven Skincare's two new products: Personalized Day Eye Cream and Personalized Night Eye Cream. The creation of the duo comes after Proven surveyed its community about its skincare needs. Findings include: – 70% worry about wrinkles on their face. – 43% of those worry about eye wrinkles and crow's feet. – 58% are concerned about undereye bags. – 82% are at least a little concerned about dark circles under the eyes. Like all of Proven's products, the two formulations are tailor-made to work for an individual's unique skin and in harmony with its specific lifestyle and environmental factors. ""We considered the smallest details such as stress levels, hours of sleep, local pollution levels, and water hardness to create a unique solution that brightens users' eyes and combats signs of aging like crow's feet or dark circles,"" said Proven co-founder and CEO Ming S. Zhao. As for Proven's initial range, customers have the option of taking out a subscription, then receiving regular shipments, or buying products as and when they need them. The Duo's subscription price is USD 129.99 while the one-time purchase price is USD 179.99. On October 2021, Proven Skincare launched a USD 60 million fund-raising round under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation A regime. At that time, the company said its aim was to use the funds to invest in further AI innovation and talent, to expand domestic and global marketing efforts for its existing products, and to invest in further research and development of new product lines and categories."
Le Jardin Retrouvé uses the blockchain to guarantee perfume authenticity,"The blockchain technology, which combines authentication, security, transparency, eco-design, and customer relationship assets, has seduced niche perfume brand Le Jardin Retrouvé. Founded by master-perfumer Yuri Gutsatz in 1975, and then relaunched in 2017 by his son Michel Gutsatz and Clara Feder, the brand successfully banked on a strong presence on the Chinese market, which forecasts predict will soon be the second perfume market in the world. ""We chose the right strategy. Sales are definitely as high as expected, and we should multiply our global turnover by three or four this year, with China as a driver,"" says Michel Gutsatz. Driven by a new brand identity and a definite clean perfumery positioning, Le Jardin Retrouvé is now riding the Asian wave. ""As things were going faster, we realized there was a huge problem with counterfeiting and grey markets in China. It is also a problem in France, actually,"" explains Clara Feder. ""All around the world, our approved distributors struggled with convincing their final customers that their products were authentic. So, this fear is everywhere. Brands and distributors all deal with the same issue on many key markets: how can we authenticate our products?"" adds Michel Gutsatz. To reassure both customers and distributors and guarantee the authenticity of the products delivered, the company turned to the blockchain technology brought by Sorga. ""There are only winners with this technology: the final customer fearful of buying a counterfeit, the distributor who provides evidence of his approval, and the brand which reassures customers,"" says Michel Gutsatz. Beyond the guarantee of authenticity, the brand's founders were soon convinced by the advantages of the blockchain technology as regards traceability and customer relationship. By scanning the QR Codes printed on the packaging, consumers get access to a large number of inviolable pieces of information tracing the origin and manufacturing of products. Then, once they have bought a product, they can subscribe with a code printed inside the pack to receive a certificate of ownership and be identified by the brand as the sole owner of the product. They can also get additional information about suppliers, ISO and IFRA certificates, plant locations, etc. ""When a customer subscribes to the Sorga platform after buying a product, we directly receive an email to make them enter an automation flow. Then we can start a live conversation with them. It is wonderful for a brand, especially when you sell your products on the other side of the world,"" explains Michel Gutsatz. ""Today's brands do not have access to their consumers across the world: now, thanks to the blockchain, they can, and it is a real step ahead,"" adds Clara Feder. The platform is available in four languages, English, French, Chinese, and Spanish, but direct exchanges are automatically translated, so it can be used in any country. Le Jardin Retrouvé adopted the blockchain technology last January. The Sorga ""diamond"", the QR Code, seals the secondary packaging, and the owner code is printed inside. Given the advantages it offers to the luxury product category, the blockchain technology is set to boom. Three giants of the luxury industry, Cartier (Rochemont Group), LVMH, and Prada, launched Aura a year ago: this common blockchain platform offers transparency, a guarantee of authenticity, and traceability. ""In the cosmetics industry, brands mainly choose this technology for the sake of traceability. Then comes transparency: it is a strong demand, so we need to find a way to certify information. An increasing number of details will be required to reassure consumers about products' origins, so we are going to have to make any evidence available. Countries themselves, Europe, China… they all demand that for certification and quality purposes. So, the blockchain is really likely to develop on the luxury and perfume markets,"" explain the creators of Le Jardin Retrouvé."
Neurotechnologies will soon help you choose your perfume at Yves Saint Laurent,"The L'Oréal group continues to explore cutting-edge technologies for creating new beauty experiences. On the occasion of International Fragrance Day, L'Oréal, French cosmetics and fragrances giant, has announced a strategic partnership with Emotiv, the leading neurotechnology company, in order to help consumers make accurate and personalised choices around their fragrance desires. ""The intersection of neurotech, AI, and science is an exciting next step. The science of choosing a fragrance is very complex. This partnership promises innovation for the entire beauty industry as this is truly the first time that consumers will have access to a state-of-the-art, in-store experience that uses neuroscience to provide personalized, precise fragrance advice,"" says Guive Balooch, Head of L'Oréal's Technology Incubator. L'Oréal hopes to renew the experience of choosing perfume in stores, through a multi-sensor headset based on electroencephalography (EEG) that connects neuro responses to fragrance preferences. The headset uses machine learning algorithms that interpret EEG, while consumers experience proprietary scent families, to provide the ability to accurately sense and monitor behavior, preferences, stress, and attention in real-world contexts. The aim is to help consumers determine their perfect scent suited to their emotions. Indeed, according to L'Oréal, people connect various emotions, including happiness and relaxation, to their scent preference. Indeed, according to L'Oréal, many consumers want their fragrance to bring them emotional benefits (77 percent) or choose a fragrance based on their mood (more than half of consumers ages 12-34). ""There are thousands of fragrance options, and we know it can be challenging for consumers to navigate the vast number of scents and make a choice that's right for them,"" says Stephan Bezy, International General Manager at Yves Saint Laurent Beauté. ""Through this immersive system, we were able to get 95% of people the right fragrance personalized to their needs and desires, which is enormously higher than without this technology. It's a huge first step in this category. Once we know which scents make people feel happy, energized, or other emotions, we can customize fragrances even more - the potential is boundless."" The experience will be available worldwide in Yves Saint Laurent flagship stores in multiple countries later this year and through 2023."
Transparency & communication: beauty is adopting the blockchain,"As many industries have already done, the cosmetics sector cannot but meet the rising demand for transparency on products and manufacturing. Following the example of LVMH, the luxury world has embraced the issue with the launch of the Aura Blockchain consortium designed to help create a secure computing protocol to provide customers with a digital certificate that gives direct access to the history of the product they bought, from design to distribution, and to its authenticity certificates. The blockchain is the perfect tool for consumers to have easy access to safe information on products (formula composition, packaging, brand commitments, etc.). ""Consumers no longer want declarations, they need evidence"", says Philippe Guguen, Director of the MAP Emulsion company that developed Sorga, a French blockchain technology already adopted by several cosmetics brands. For each product, Sorga creates a unique passport with a broad range of information. The main advantage of the blockchain is that, thanks to its decentralized nature, it guarantees the information is accessible to all, anytime, anywhere, but cannot be modified. ""There is no central platform. It is all divided into dozens of thousands of servers. The information just cannot be deleted. When you enter a piece of information, it is signed and dated, so the cosmetics industry can guarantee the authenticity of products and fight counterfeiting,"" explains Philippe Guguen. ""We need to substitute storytelling marketing for evidence marketing,"" confirms Maxime Finaz de Villaine, CEO of Bloomup Energie Fruit. This natural and organic skincare and hygiene product brand has launched the B-Heart application which, thanks to the blockchain technology, offers total transparency and traceability on products, the origin of ingredients, packaging, and manufacturing. The objective is to provide access to a platform secured by the blockchain technology simply by scanning a QR Code. Once the product batch number has been entered, the user can access all the information provided by the various players involved in the value chain. ""The blockchain helps go back upstream, from sourcing to the product, but above all, since the information is provided by each of our suppliers, not us, it is given in an independent, safe, immutable way: it is true. It empowers consumers who want evidence and facts,"" explains Maxime Finaz de Villaine. For her Clever Beauty nail polish brand, Maéva Bentitallah was seduced by the Sorga technology whose digital identification is unique to each reference. ""Every passport is unique and has its own code. Each nail polish bottle can carry with it totally personalized information, which also creates a unique experience with customers,"" she explains. By purchasing a product, consumers also get this unique passport for themselves. They get access to it by scanning the tag with four key types of information: – Who: who is behind the product - the team, manufacturers and different suppliers; – Where: manufacturing site; – What: description of all aspects of the product (colours, how long it lasts, INCI formula…); – Why: brand's history and commitments. ""I can also add certificates, like that of the laboratory which certifies our innovative no-waste cap helps gain 20% more product, or the test results that demonstrate our nail polish is safe for pregnant women, or my vegan label. It is inviolable. It helps communicate and provide total transparency with proven information,"" adds the founder. As far as experience is concerned, personalized messages or videos can be added to the passport to create a direct relationship with consumers. Lastly, this approach is also said to minimize the environmental impact, and even free brands from secondary packs. ""This way, brands can also replace the instructions in several languages. The information is more easily understood, in all languages, and tutorials can be added… Plus, all this is updated in real time,"" says Philippe Guguen. ""Sorga helps provide verifiable, original evidence, and offers anyone interested access to all the information, at any time, while minimizing the environmental impact with a low-energy process. Also, it is a digitally sovereign solution, so it is 100% safe from American GAFAM software,"" he sums up. As consumers have become familiar with scanning, they might think of this approach as a new way to be reassured about cosmetics products and brands. ""70% of consumers hardly believe brands' statements about their sustainability, 94% think they should be more transparent, and 71% would even be willing to spend more money in brands that provide product traceability. It is a crucial issue. If the blockchain becomes democratic, I think it is the future,"" concludes Maxime Finaz de Villaine."
Color cosmetics: The best 2022 innovations awarded at MakeUp in Los Angeles,"The winners of the 2022 edition of the MakeUp in LosAngeles IT Awards were revealed on the first day of the beauty trade show, during a ceremony hosted by Sandra Maguarian and Aurélie de Boisvilliers, the show organizers, and beauty expert and jury member Luisa Oliva. The competition involves two steps. First, exhibitors submit the products with a video pitch and an in-depth description of their added value compared to similar existing products. In a second step, the short listed products are evaluated and tested by a jury of 12 international experts [1] who will reward the winners in four categories: Formulation, Full service, Packaging and Accessory. 22 skincare and make-up innovations were shortlisted this year, among 87 submissions across the four categories. In the Accessory category, the paper handle applicators submitted by HNB Corporation were declared winners.

All the selected products were exhibited on the show floor and the winners were rewarded with a trophy during the award ceremony."
Simplicity: Vegan makeup pencils for all skin shades by Faber-Castell Cosmetics,"Faber-Castell Cosmetics new ""Simplicity"" collection was made keeping the diversity of people in mind, as well as the environmental challenges humankind is facing. With this new range, the company's aim was to create a collection of vegan formulations made of sustainable ingredients that would match all different skin tones, with no compromise of performance, and meet current consumer's expectations for more individualized and clean beauty products. For the lips, the new collection features an impeccable-to-wear lipstick that combines the latest colour trends like ruby red or garnet with a new clean and minimalistic texture to provide a lightweight application and a soft-gloss effect. The matching lipliners contain a smart combination of different waxes to draw accurate, soft-gliding outlines. The wooden concealer, is made with 99% ingredients of natural origin. It is available for different skin tones to complement users with a light, fair, medium or dark complexion. As far as the eyes are concerned, the aim is to maximise the impact with a minimum effort and a maximum of natural ingredients. Faber-Castell Cosmetics therefore designed an eyeshadow stick with a skin-caring and protecting new formulation based on marula oil and rice bran wax. The eyeliner offers a new extremely resilient texture that lasts even up to 20 hours. Finally, a liquid eyeliner completes the concept featuring a natural new formula and a sustainable packaging using a PCR cap to contribute to an eco-friendly product. For the collection, Faber-Castell Cosmetics has selected eye-catching and trendy colours including Rose Sapphire, Taupe Agate, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Ruby Red and Gartnet and combined them with a selection of natural ingredients chosen for their skin care benefits: sunflower seeds, candellila and carnauba wax, marula oil and bran wax, etc. When possible, the use of PCR materials also helps to upgrade the sustainability credentials of the packaging."
"At CES 2022, the Beauty industry gets in on the Metaverse","Originally expecting more than 2,200 exhibitors, this year's Consumer Electronics Show has been muted by pandemic-driven cancelations. Despite these challenging conditions, the event has been once again home to much that is cutting-edge in the cosmetic industry. This year, global beauty giant L'Oréal revealed an at-home hair dye device dubbed Colorsonic and an AI-connected system for salon stylists called Coloright, while Slovenian start-up Ninu introduced a handheld device that can create a personalised fragrance when connected to a smartphone app. After teasing the concept last year, Ninu showcased the final version of its app-controlled ""smart perfume"" that features 100 fragrances in one bottle. The device connects via Bluetooth to an Android or iOS smartphone. Using an app, the user can choose from a set of pre-defined scents created by master perfumers, or can enlist the help of the AI to select a fragrance based on time of day, mood, and weather. For their part, IFF and SleepScore Labs introduced a new scent-based solution to improve sleep quality. But above all, it was the expansion of virtual beauty that stood out this year, especially when linked with the much-hyped idea of the metaverse. Procter and Gamble, for instance, opted for fully virtual experience. The company hosted a virtual booth dubbed LifeLab, allowing attendees to virtually walk up to representatives from brands such as Gillette and Oral-B to chat with them. Furthermore, P&G Beauty launched its BeautySPHERE metaverse experience in partnership with London's Royal Botanic Gardens. A first step into the metaverse, it allowed visitors to virtually interact with the group's portfolio of brands through live and simulated content. Easily accessed from home or anywhere with a desktop computer at: BeautySPHERE.com, the immersive 3D interactive experience doesn't end with CES but is the group's first step in offering education and engaging brand experiences. Similarly, Taiwan's provider of AI- and AR-powered digital experiences Perfect Corp. has scaled back its presence at the Las Vegas show and has chosen to offer access to its most innovative technologies through a metaverse virtual experience on their website. The aim was to provide a first look at the beauty and fashion tech innovations that are set to enrich customer experiences and prepare brands for the forthcoming metaverse. Perfect Corp's new virtual try-on tools highlighted include a new foundation-matching tool, video chat AR makeup application and jewellery try-on. In addition, Perfect Corp. also aims to democratize access to beauty and fashion virtual assets by bringing digital products from the metaverse world to all camera-enabled devices, as well as creating beauty and fashion NFTs and enabling fully immersive eCommerce virtual try-on experiences in the metaverse. A much quieter CES than usual, but one which allowed us to take a fascinating look at the new horizons of beauty tech!"
CES 2022: L'Oréal aims to reinvent hair colouring,"L'Oréal is hoping to change the game regarding hair colouring with two high-tech innovations showcased at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: Colorsonic, for at home colouring, and Coloright, for the salon experience. As far as at home hair colouring is concerned, the Colorsonic brush concept is simple. Once in possession of the new brush, all that consumers have to do is to pick the colour of their choice from among 40 shades available on the Colorsonic website, then wait for their kit to be delivered at home. Instead of the traditional pouches and bottles, consumers will receive a cartridge that loads directly into the device. Then all that's left to do is turn on the brush, wait for it to mix the colour and the developer, and then brush the hair from root to tip with no fear of leaks, drips, patchiness or potentially excessive saturation. Wait for 30 minutes, rinse, style, and it's done. Finally, remove the cartridge and keep it for any future touch-ups. ""When the COVID-19 pandemic caused the temporary closure of many salons, the at-home hair colour business grew by 6%. During this time, consumers experienced the challenges of an at-home haircolouring process that has remained virtually unchanged for decades, namely the messiness of hair dye and the difficulty of applying hair colour to hard-to-reach places,"" said the company. In addition, L'Oréal has made sure that this new concept is also as sustainable as possible, thanks to recyclable cartridges and reusable gloves. However, anyone eager to give this gadget a try will have to be patient. Colorsonic isn't slated for release before early in 2023 in the United States. In addition to transforming the at-home haircolouring experience, L'Oréal is also focused on the next evolution of the salon hair colour experience. The French group therefore seized the opportunity of CES 2022 to unveil Coloright, an AI-connected hair colour system for salon stylists that creates on-demand, customized hair colour. The machine features a reader, which analyses the client's hair, measuring factors that influence colour's effectiveness, including hair colour, grey percentage, length, and density and a dispenser that contains dry beads consisting of hair dye, accompanied by cartridges of base creams, developers and diluters. Thanks to a patented algorithm, these dispensed components create a personalized hair colour recipe. ""The ultra-precise machine dispenses all the components of the formula and, in total, Coloright can provide more than 1,500 custom possibilities,"" adds L'Oréal."
Makeup brands are (cautiously) tapping into the metaverse potential,"Many players in the fashion and luxury industries have already been seduced by this new world where, for the moment, anything seems possible. Nike, adidas and Balenciaga have already launched, or are working on, their own iterations of the metaverse, with plans to present collections or even stage fashion shows, to sell NFTs, and, more broadly, to showcase their worlds, their DNA, and better interact with customers. And in these parallel universes, user avatars are generally seen wearing clothes. So if you're going to dress your avatar, you might as well do it with style. But the same logic seems more difficult to apply to cosmetic brands hoping to carve out a place, since makeup is not — or is much less — something everyone uses or wants to use. But this hasn't stopped some brands from making remarkable breakthroughs, showing the potential that these new worlds can offer. When the pandemic caused retail stores to close, cosmetic brands had to accelerate their transition to the virtual world, doubling down on initiatives to ensure that their customers did not give up on their beauty routines. As a result, apps offering virtual makeup testing — essentially based on augmented reality — started springing up during lockdown, giving everyone the opportunity to experiment with different shades of foundation, lipstick and nail polish before buying them directly online. It's precisely this technology, along with the now ubiquitous filters found on many social networks, that is, or will be, echoed in these virtual worlds. The South Korean metaverse Zepeto, launched by Naver Z Corp, has already partnered with several beauty brands, such as Nars, which offers several makeup looks, and Dior Beauté, which presents looks created exclusively by Peter Philips, creative and image director of the luxury brand. That alone could be enough to entice more than one beauty addict into these new worlds. Especially since they also open up a field of endless possibilities to budding creatives, who can test a host of beauty looks without ever having to show them off in the real world. As well as promoting their products in the metaverse, brands can also offer NFTs, which are on the rise. Nars plus Givenchy Parfums and Clinique are among the companies that have already unveiled non-fungible tokens. And these could multiply at great speed in this brave new world, whether to offer exclusive and rare products, or to show cosmetics through the eyes of different artists. In a bid to get ever-closer to their customers and to offer them interactive and immersive experiences, brands could also rely on their own metaverses to run livestream shopping sessions. These online events are booming all over the world, especially in China. And it's a phenomenon that could take a new direction thanks to the metaverse and its world of possibilities."
Fragrance Innovation Summit: A perfume sector in search of a sense,"Setting the tone for the day, Philippe Ughetto, representing Fragrance Foundation France, stressed in his opening speech that innovation should from now on make sense for consumers as well as for the planet. Mathilde Lion, Director, Global Client Development of the NPD Group, then drew up a rather positive economic assessment, highlighting perfumery - not skincare - as the sector leading the recovery in selective cosmetics. She even wondered if perfume had not become the new ""lipstick effect"" in North America. In fact, the main drivers of this recovery, the Z Generations and Millennials purchase perfumes to fulfil their desire to take care of themselves and treat themselves and are influencing growth levers towards higher concentrations, online sales, and sets, testers and mini-products. Sampling as a means of discovery in the post-pandemic era was discussed several times during the day. And in particular regarding its evolution towards sustainability. Céline Boix from Sampling Innovations Europe presented Ticket Scent, a dispensing system of individual scented labels that can be opened and closed several times with 100% olfactory restitution. For his part, Maxime Caffon presented ID Scent's Scent Touch technology, which allows using the sample a hundred times, thus extending its life span. This innovation was developed in particular for Givenchy, in the form of a cut-out card taking the shape of a mini hanger to perfume one's wardrobe. When it comes to sustainability, for Karine Torrent, the founder of the Floratropia brand, it was a ""duty of utopia"", questioning each pillar of the chain to achieve perfumes with the strongest possible impact and smallest possible environmental footprint. Result: 100% natural perfumes sold in doypack formats, the container becoming an accessory. Elisabeth Salom l'Ancien also proposed to adapt the perfuming gesture to the juice, and presented Aptar's collection of Inune sprays. In particular, Silk, which can be either precise or enveloping, allowing to reveal more perfume facets than a classic spray. Facets that evolve in all olfactory families, as Isabelle Ferrand of Cinquième Sens explained, by relying on new channels or over cycling, particularly of vegetables. This is what Symrise offers, with Symtrap™ technology, in its Garden Lab range. Hence, Pierre Guéros described the creamy and velvety notes of artichoke, the nutty and cereal facets of asparagus, or how cauliflower brings to mind ambergris. In terms of more sustainable sourcing, Rémi Pulvérail introduced the Eden Ecosystem joint venture, which was born out of a concern to integrate farmers' issues into the value chain, and in particular the sustainability of purchases. The joint venture provides tailor-made solutions, from plant cultivation to industrialisation, and combines extraction methods to offer more complete aromatic spectrums. For the Master Perfumer Antoine Lie, these 'full spectrum' extracts reveal new facets, closer to the scent coming from the fields than traditional essences and absolutes. To rethink our resources more responsibly, Jérémy Pessiot, the founder of Afyren, developed a solution for the over cycling of the lignocellulosic biomass of beetroot, allowing the production on French soils of synthetic perfumery molecules, which today come from the international petrochemical industry. The 7 platform molecules forming these molecules are manufactured using a unique, low carbon, Cosmos, Ecocert and ISO 16128 certified process, which results in 100% natural biosourced synthetics, with preserved analytical and olfactory performances. In her analysis of free expressions on social networks, Michelle Algazi from Dynvibe pointed out that lock-downs had given rise to a new hobby: the discovery of perfumes. And for many, they were the opportunity to dare more audacious perfumes. Post-confinement, these notes remain a source of empowerment and allow attracting the attention of other people. The approach of the ajnalogy movement (from the Sanskrit Ajna, the chakra of intuition) is in line with this spirit: Agathe Jacquinet and Éléonore de Staël develop 100% natural fragrances offering a better connection to one's emotions and self-acceptance. Experience is also at the heart of the DTC concept of Maison21G: to compose, online or in-store (in Singapore for the moment), one's tailor-made perfume resulting from a personality test. The founder, Johanna Monange, has worked with IFF to make sure that each juice could be incorporated up to 21% while still complying with toxicological requirements. Integrating all the trends discussed at the Summit, she also presented a collection of candles and diffusers to personalise one's home fragrance, as well as in-store workshops and an olfactory discovery box. The discovery of perfume is one of the innovation levers as recalled by the consultant Laure Braive, who proposed a world tour of phygital innovations: from virtual shops to synesthetic polysensory tours, including all the edutainment options facilitated by NFTs. She also suggested putting exclusivity, craftsmanship and human values back at the heart of the customer journey. A journey that intends to facilitate Frédéric Besson, who has developed, with Perfumist, a set of mobile applications to help everyone, anywhere (online and in-store/duty-free), to find the ideal fragrance for themselves or as a gift. An ability to inspire the customer, mentioned by Mathilde Girardon and Sylvain Eyraud, from Takasago, is one of the keys to success on the Chinese market. A market of incarnation, they believe, that one should try to understand from the inside, with its rituals and legends, to shift from 'made in China' to 'crafted in China'. Betty Touzaud from Panda Meetings, recalled the importance of e-commerce in China, where almost all sales of perfumes come from live-shopping platforms. And therefore the need to adopt the codes of retailnment and gamification, with impactful, fun visuals and lots of movement."
"Lumson awarded for XPaper, their innovative paper airless dispenser","The airless dispenser with a paper bottle was judged one of the most innovative products by the Italian Association for Design (ADI, Associazione per il Designo Industriale). The new packaging solution was added to the 2021 ADI Design Index and won the ADI Design Index Award for Innovation. The ADI Design Index gathers the best Italian designs put into production during the year. In 2021, the 233 finalists were selected among over 1,000 candidatures by ADI Design's permanent Observatory. ""I'd like to thank all those who worked on developing XPaper, and who believed in this project, which sprang from careful market analysis, deep knowledge of the industry, and from great enthusiasm,"" said Matteo Moretti, Lumson's Chairman at the award ceremony, which was held in Rome on 18 November 2021. ""The innovation that XPaper brings is even more significant, because at its core is sustainability - a value that has become an integral part of Italian culture and design,"" he continued. XPaper's main innovation lays in the use of cardboard as a lighter and greener alternative to plastic, glass or aluminium for the dispenser's bottle. According to Lumson, this was made possible thanks to R&D's major strides that allowed to increase the performance and aesthetic appeal of paper. ""Thanks to fine printing techniques, it is possible to create sophisticated paper products,"" said the Italian supplier of primary packaging solutions, in a statement. ""I feel that XPaper has what it takes to become an iconic product: it is sustainable, functional, safe, and sophisticated,"" said Moretti. ""Once the product has run out, you can separate the dispenser from the bottle in paper and send it down the right recycling chain. It's practical and safe to use, because, like all of our airless dispensers with a pouch, it was developed to optimally protect the product from the risk of contamination from the air or other outside agents that could alter the formula. And then there's its look. The packaging is customizable with conventional and digital printing technologies, to become a unique product with strong personality."" The new paper airless dispenser is part of Lumson's Touchless family, which gathers dispensers with hermetic pouches. All the airless systems (jars and bottles) in this range are based on four key pillars: – The use of a patented hermetic closure system (the HSCS -Hermetic Snap Closure System - is positioned between the dispensing system and the bottle in order to protect the formula); – A mono or multi-layer pouch depending on the characteristics of the product; – The use of sustainable materials, including glass, plastic, aluminium and now cardboard; – The possibility to separate the various components in order to facilitate their disposal in the correct recycling chain."
"Made By Me, combinable solid fragrances to personalise one's perfume","Solid formulas, layering, eco-design, new gestures... the new Made By Me brand concept combines several of the major trends of the moment, in particular, the personalisation of one's perfume, the intimacy and practicality of the gesture. ""After 20 years spent in the cosmetics sector. I witnessed the progression of the ability to take ownership of one's make-up or skincare, in particular through tutorials and influencers. I thought it was a pity not to apply this for perfume and thus bring out one's personality, one's inner emotions, but also to be able to break away from it so as not to be confined to the same register,"" explains the creator. Layering or the superposition of several juices or single florals already introduced by some brands does not suit her. Because the volume and the liquid format of traditional perfumes entail too many constraints, Nathalie Duran explored the solid perfume avenue with formulas that she wanted to be soft and non-greasy, but also coloured to accentuate the ""tutorial dimension"". ""We went looking for make-up formulas and worked on solutions that contain colours that fade on the skin. These formulas also had to adapt to a high perfume concentration because our fragrances are 11% concentrated,"" adds the creator. Five perfumes were created by the Perfumers Domitille Michalon Bertier, Caroline Dumur and Fanny Bal from IFF on the theme of Nude, to project a true olfactory identity, alone or combined. Like a palette designed by a make-up artist, these fragrances are designed to live together. At the centre of the palette is All Over U Musk, a full-featured fragrance that serves as a base for the compositions. Revolving around it, Candide Blossom and its orange blossom notes, Orange Fever, Blitz Fig and finally Musk Crush with its sensual notes. ""We recommend making one's recipe with 1 to 3 fragrances maximum, possibly adding a few hints of the other fragrances depending on the moment or the mood. The most important thing is to explore one's desires, to make it a fun moment of creation,"" assures Nathalie Duran. To achieve the right balance, which is essential for a good release, the brand recommends dosing light colours more than dark colours, which have stronger and more persistent notes. ""In terms of staying power and persistence, the user will be fully satisfied as long as he or she puts enough on. In terms of sillage, we have developed a whole ritual for the wrists and hair,"" says Nathalie Duran. The formulas are free of parabens, phthalates and alcohol. The packaging - a palette of five or two fragrances - is made of 100% recyclable or reusable cardboard, and covered with a bioplastic coating. The brand has been available online since 8 March and plans to open a retail site in South Korea by the end of the year, as well as developing a new palette of five fragrances in 2022."
"After shampoos, Everist launches waterless body wash concentrate","With this thoughtful line extension, Everist aims to deliver to its consumers the perfect trio of shower essentials. Similar to the hair care and conditioner concentrates, which were launched in February, the body wash is water-activated by water with a simple paste-to-lather gesture. Consumers just need to lather the paste between their hands to start cleansing and moisturizing their skin. The plant-based, vegan and cruelty-free formula, includes Everist's signature blend of essential oils in lieu of synthetic fragrance. With notes of orange peel, bergamot, peppermint, rosemary and clary sage, the body wash is both refreshing and uplifting. The choice of a creamy paste texture aims to keep the experience of the new body wash concentrate as close to traditional shower products as possible, with a creamy lather that ""stands out in the clean beauty space"". As a partner accessory, the brand is also launching a 100% biodegradable and home compostable Konjac Sponge made of natural konjac plant fibre. The body wash is priced at $24 USD / $28 CAD per tube and the sponge at $12 USD / $16 CAD. ""Reducing the carbon and plastic-waste impact of traditional, water-filled beauty products is the premise Everist was built on. Just like hair care, traditional body washes are primarily water and packaged in single-use plastic and so we were inspired to do better. With this addition to our product lineup, we combine the benefits of skincare ingredients with gentle cleansing properties to encourage customers to eco-upgrade their routine. For us, it always comes back to performance first,"" said Jayme Jenkins, Chief Brand Officer at Everist. Everist claims to have recorded rapid growth since the brand was launched in February 2021, with a both a loyal customer base and a promising retail expansion strategy. Most recently, the eCommerce-first company secured distribution deals with Credo Beauty, an American clean beauty retailer, the Allure Store, an online and IRL beauty destination in Manhattan, New York, Well.ca, a Canadian wellness online shop, and Verishop, an eCommerce platform for shopping today's hottest brands. ""The launch of our body wash is set to revolutionize the category, and it marks an important milestone for Everist,"" expressed Jessica Stevenson, CEO of Everist."
"Phantom, Paco Rabanne's latest men's fragrance, taps into techno-digital trend","""When I think of Paco Rabanne, I don't think retro - I think revolution, rebellion and renaissance,"" said Julien Dossena, Paco Rabanne's Artistic Director about its work for the fashion house since 2013. In line with this vision, the brand has chosen robot-shaped design by Pierre Dinand (glass bottle by Pochet du Courval and Heinz Glas) for its latest men's fragrance that was launched this summer. The bottle is topped with a spray cap by VPI, which can be connected to a smartphone thanks to an NFC chip (by STMicroelectronics). Four perfumers from IFF participated in the fragrance creation. Loc Dong came up with the lavender and green citrus idea. Juliette Karagueuzoglou contributed with her knowledge of natural-ingredients, and Master Perfurmers Dominique Ropion and Anne Filipo fine-tuned the formula. IFF perfumers have also relied on artificial intelligence-propelled ""augmented creativity"" tools that have been developed by the perfume house. From the first formulas designed by the perfumers, the algorithm suggests new combinations or dosages to amplify the desired emotional effects. A complex creative process which also relied on the Science of Wellness platform recently launched by IFF. Imagined by the Pierre Dinand design agency, under the direction of Vincent Thilloy, the robot-shaped glass bottle was produced by Pochet du Courval and Heinz Glas. ""We are very proud of this achievement. This was a real technical challenge, with its flat shoulders, the need to control of glass distribution to avoid brittleness in the most sensitive areas and the quality of the glass surface required for perfect tension after metallization. This was a real technical challenge due to the shape of the bottle,"" said Mélina Weinmann, Business Development Director for Glass Bottles, at Pochet du Courval. The metallization of the glass and the laser etching revealing the logo were entrusted to Solev. The bottle is topped with a metallic finish spray cap in galvanized ABS made by VPI Faiveley Plast and SAF. An NFC (""Near-field communication"", for a contactless communication) electronic chip is integrated into the spray-cap (i.e. the robot's head) to allow smartphone connections and full immersion in Phantom's universe (games, playlists, etc.). With sustainability in mind, the 150 ml bottle can be refilled, thanks to the unscrewable spray cap and Techniplast's RT-Twist technology."
Make-up: Global Bioenergies' naturally sourced isododecane is gaining strength,"An essential ingredient in long-lasting make-up, isododecane was historically derived from petrochemicals. However, French biotech company Global Bioenergies has successfully developed an innovative technology for converting plant resources (sugar and starch residues, agricultural and forestry waste), into isobutene, one of the main petroleum derivatives, and then to transform it into isododecane. Six months after releasing its first batch of naturally sourced isododecane, Global Bioenergies has finished producing and released a second batch of the innovative ingredient to be marketed from 2022 under the name Isonaturane® 12. Part of the batch will be used to produce lips range of the LAST brand, which was recently launched by the company to illustrate the potentialities of its ingredient. Scheduled to be launched this autumn in addition, the new range will complement the eyes range launched last spring and available at www.colors-that-last.com. Thanks to the naturally sourced isododecane, LAST's lips range will offer fourteen shades of a long-wear liquid lipstick comprising over 90% natural ingredients and delivering the same performance as the top products on the market. Production of the new range has just started in the Lyon factory of MS BeautiLab, one of the largest cosmetics manufacturers in Europe, whom Global Bioenergies had already entrusted with the industrialisation and production of the eyes line last spring. ""We plan to launch other products in 2022, with the same intention of using our innovative ingredient to bring naturalness to product categories where it is not yet present,"" explains Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies. Beyond the making of the lips range by MS BeautiLab, the second batch of naturally sourced isododecane will also be used to serve the numerous cosmetic industry players who have requested sampling. ""Since the beginning of the year, we have received more than 40 unsolicited requests from cosmetic companies (brands, manufacturers and distributors). Further to discussions now well underway, we will provide samples to interested parties before we start delivering commercial volumes from 2022 onwards. This innovative ingredient will radically increase the level of naturalness in long-wear make-up, without compromising on performance. It will also be used in dermo-cosmetics and hair care,"" said Florence Thueux, Global Bioenergies Chief Business Officer. To meet the demand, Global Bioenergies is reorganising its production to allow rapid scale-up of Isonaturane 12 deliveries over the next years. In particular, an industrial production unit is currently under construction at the Pomacle-Bazancourt site and will combine with upstream and downstream industrial subcontractors. This new unit will produce enough Isonaturane® 12 to manufacture around 10 million units of longwear, natural make-up by 2022, the first year of operation."
Virtual makeup try-ons are now possible for Instagram Shopping,"To adapt to the new reality of shopping during the pandemic, cosmetic brands found themselves having to reinvent their approach in order to allow customers to enjoy an online shopping experience that was similar to that in physical stores. Testing makeup, textures and shades in particular, is becoming a must to ensure that customers end up with products that suit them. Virtual try-ons have, therefore, become essential for beauty industry players who now want to focus on digital, whether on their own e-commerce platforms or on social networks. With this in mind, L'Oreal and Facebook have joined forces, and brought their respective expertise in the field to an initiative that allows Instagram shoppers to virtually test makeup products before they buy. This service is offered through ModiFace, L'Oréal's augmented reality and artificial intelligence company. ""AR Try-On is an exciting new foray within Facebook that's already helping people shop online with more confidence. Through this new integration with L'Oréal, shoppers can expect a more personal shopping experience from even more of the brands they love, right where they're already finding beauty inspiration: on Instagram,"" outlined Sue Young, Head of Spark AR at Facebook. For now, Instagram shoppers can experience virtual try-ons for NYX Professional Makeup, Urban Decay, Maybelline New York, and Lancôme lipsticks. They will soon be able to use it for other brands, and other product categories. Facebook will also integrate ModiFace AR try-on into new advertising formats on Facebook app."
France's Bioseptyl launches a toothpaste stick,"Bioseptyl, which has already completed its ranges of made in France toothbrushes with a series of oral care products for adults (toothpastes, oral baths and sprays), juniors (Dentifrance) and children (Dentifraise), is launching the Stick Dentifrice, an ""economical and travel-friendly"" solid toothpaste. COSMOS ORGANIC certified and mint flavoured, the Stick Dentifrice [1], contains only 100% natural ingredients and offers an innovative texture, both solid and creamy, that helps to reduce water consumption. Before application, the brush does not need to be wet. After application, rinsing is quick and easy because the toothpaste has been designed not to produce foam. According to the brand, a 12 gram stick allows about 250 brushings, which corresponds to a period of use of four months, significantly higher than that of conventional toothpastes. Available since June 15 on bioseptyl.fr as well as in various points of sale, including the Biocoop network in France, at a price of 6.95 euros, the Stick Dentifrice fits easily into a travel kit. For even more durability, the product is sold in a refillable packaging. The set of two refills is available at a price of 9.20 euros in a PEFC cardboard outer pack printed with vegetable inks, each refill being wrapped in a bio-based cellulosic bag certified to be compostable at home."
Upcycling: Rose Pirate wants to give a new lease of life to abandoned lipstick tubes,"The principle is simple: Rose Pirate collects the lipstick cases that consumers do not want to throw away simply because the grape inside it, has become unusable. The start-up will empty it, sterilise it and refill it with its unique 100% natural lip balm formula. As long as the tube is in good condition, the process can be repeated over and over again. To make her project a reality, Audrey Ducardonnet, the founder, has just launched a crowdfunding campaign to reach 200 pre-sales by 7 June. The aim was to check that consumers were interested in the project and that they were ready to make an effort, ""to send back their lipstick tube for me to refill it"". After a career at the Chanel laboratory and as Project and make-up innovation Manager, the young woman created her own structure as an innovation consultant to ""transform a designer's brief into a concrete product."" She is the link between the creative process and the manufacture of a product, ensuring that it is feasible and that ""it is up to expectations"". The Rose Pirate project is part of this reflection on the future of the cosmetics industry. To replace the grapes in the lipsticks, several sizing operations must be carried out manually, along with a chemical-free cleaning. The tube can then be sterilised and refilled with the balm. Audrey Ducardonnet developed her formula with Michèle Mousset, a formulation expert who worked for brands such as Chanel and Dior. Most round tubes with a ""standard"" diameter can be refilled. A check on the arrival of the tube allows verifying that it still works properly. If this is not the case or if its shape is too complex, the tube is returned to its owner. On the crowdfunding pre-sales, the first 40 pieces are at 12 euros, the rest at 15 euros. The project is aimed at environmentally conscious consumers who wish to adopt an upcycling approach ""with the desire to consume less but better"". The lip balm is of natural origin and 100% vegan. It is made of cherry pit oil and sweet potatoes, ingredients with antioxidant properties. An ideal balm for women ""who don't want to get rid of their favourite lipstick tube and/or who want to take care of their lips by combining quality and naturalness""!"
Juni draws inspiration from the past to create 100% recyclable lipstick tube,"When she created Juni, makeup artist Madeleine White aimed to combine luxury, high performance, and green beauty in a sustainable line. For example, she endeavoured to pack her formulas with packs as ecodesigned as possible. ""I have grown aware of the huge problem of plastic in the beauty industry. Over 142 billion pack units are produced every year around the world in the beauty sector, 95% of beauty packs are thrown away after only one use, and only 14% are transported to a recycling centre. 'Good plastic' does not exist,"" Madeleine White tells Premium Beauty News. Following this logic, she aims to develop a lipstick line completely free from plastic. ""About 900 million lipsticks, mainly in the form of single-use plastic tubes, are sold in the world every year. We were determined not to contribute to this plastic pandemic, but to produce an innovative alternative,"" she adds. Dissatisfied with the packaging solutions currently available on the market, she chose tailor-made design with a local designer team. The final choice is an infinitely recyclable single material: aluminium. Free from the usual twisting mechanism that requires plastic machinery, it features a push-button system inspired from a 1930s tube. ""Our lipstick tubes are fully made of aluminium. By using only one material, we avoided the tricky, costly separation which often hinders or prevents packaging from being recycled. Aluminium is infinitely recyclable,"" explains the founder. This initiative mirrors that of turnkey cosmetic solution supplier Meiyume, inspired from the tube patented in 1915 by American inventor Maurice Levy, or the one made of machined aluminium recently unveiled by packaging creation agency Cinqpats, also inspired from vintage tubes. By design, the Juni tubes are fully recyclable by the users, who can also return them empty to the customer service, so they can be reused or recycled. Madeleine White deliberately chose not to offer a refillable version. ""Although refillable cosmetic products are gaining ground, we do not believe they are the best solution for all products. Our products are not refillable right now, because it is extremely difficult to transport delicate makeup like lipstick without secured primary packaging. Refills require extra packaging or plastic components that cannot be recycled. We will make no compromise,"" she concludes."
"Izzy launches a reusable, recyclable zero-waste and locally sourced mascara","""As a Millennial mom, I wanted to provide my daughter with truly sustainable beauty options, ones that would go beyond the standards of the current clean movement,"" explains Izzy Zero Waste founder and industry veteran Shannon Goldberg. ""By 2050, the oceans are projected to contain more plastic than fish. If we want to give our children a fighting chance tomorrow, then we need to do something radical about reversing this cycle today."" The start-up's debut product is a vegan, clean, reusable, recyclable, locally sourced and CarbonNeutral certified mascara. A real technical challenge, given the specificities of this type of product, composed of multiple components associated with formulas that are often difficult to clean. Evidently, the packaging plays a big part in this cosmetics innovation. The Zero Waste Mascara comes in a US-made medical-grade stainless steel tube designed to be refilled again and again, and with no plastic components. While Izzy's Zero Waste Mascara is made with 94% less plastic than the majority of global mascara brands, it was not possible to use another kind of material for the applicators and wipers. However, these plastic components are rendered 100% zero waste by regrinding them and melting them down to make new ones. Izzy Zero Waste Beauty also promises low carbon emissions linked to transportation, since the brand's supply chain is located within a 400-mile radius (approx. 640 km). To reach its sustainability goals, the brand has created a direct-to-consumer subscription model. By becoming a Zero Waste Member, customers can receive a sterilized refilled mascara tube that's ready to use, every three months, accompanied by a prepaid returns envelope to send back the mascara tube when it runs out. Membership starts at US$35 (about EUR29) for the starter kit plus US$19 (about EUR16) per quarter for quarterly refills, but it's also possible to test the mascara without subscribing for US$39 (about EUR32). The mascara ships without secondary packaging in reusable envelopes made using recycled materials. Designed to be cleaned and refilled over 10,000 times, once returned the mascara tubes are sterilized and refilled. ""Even the water from the patent-pending triple cleaning process is reused, rather than dumped in the ocean,"" claims the brand. Other, similar initiatives have been cropping up around the world. The US company Ace of Air, for example, recently launched a moisturizer, a serum and supplements according to a similar model based on the return and refill of long-lasting packaging."
"Blockchain fragrance: Look Labs mixes perfumery, technology and art","The creative studio has partnered with Montréal artist Sean Caruso to launch the world's first digital fragrance encoded into NFT artwork. They created ten exclusive digital artworks that are auctioned online on the Rarible marketplace. The digital artwork is inspired from Cyber, a physical unisex eau de parfum designed by Look Labs. Created by a master perfurmer in Grasse, France, the fragrance evokes sci-fi movies and high-tech universes. The fragrance comes in a glass bottle with an LED label. The artwork consists in a photorealistic representation of the bottle with its illuminated label together with a digital representation of the fragrance in the form of NIRS data. The first owners of the NFT artwork will receive the collector's edition of the physical fragrance signed by the creators and additional hi-resolution versions of the artwork. Each future corresponding NFT owner will be able to redeem the physical version of the fragrance for an additional fee. ""I was curious about the merging of the physical and digital worlds through blockchain and NFT artwork,"" said Sean Caruso. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - units of data stored on a blockchain - are increasingly used to certify a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. Look Labs imagined this combination of digital artwork and physical fragrance to capture the emerging trend of NFTs and how luxury products will appeal in the future to the new generation of consumers. The aim was to create ""the ultimate luxury fragrance that combines traditional craftsmanship with the latest disruptive technology. Choosing the highest quality ingredients and materials was an imperative step in the process of designing and crafting a product that is unique and the first of its kind on the market,"" said Look Labs founder, Jordan Katzarov."
Scentys transforms the ritual of home fragrance with a connected diffuser,"An expert in the diffusion of fragrance in the air since 2004, Scentys now launches a new B2B2C fragrance diffusion concept designed to fit into our daily lives. A voice command option makes it as easy to use as possible. The platform is compatible with Amazon's Alexa voice service. In addition, all the fragrance diffusion devices are equipped with bluetooth and wifi. Get slot machine tips, discover slots myths, and don't forget to check out our listings of free slots comps currently being offered by our favorite casinos. ""You can ask the voice assistant to start one or more diffusers, to select your favorite fragrance, or to choose where you want to launch the diffusion. For instance, if you want to relax in your living room, you can tell the diffuser to switch on and create a soothing atmosphere. Wellbeing begins immediately,"" says Scentys. A dedicated smartphone application allows to control and program fragrance diffusion in a single step, either on-site or remotely. Compatible with Apple and Android devices, it can be used to start or stop diffusion in a specific room, or to diffuse a specific fragrance to create the desired atmosphere. In order to ensure that diffusion is always perfectly safe, exposure rates (based on the quantity of fragrance, the size of the room and many other parameters) are calculated in real time. Intended for brands, this new diffuser is fully customizable. Scentys develops the technical specifications and manages the project every step of the way, from the creativity/design phase through to the prototype and manufacturing. Fragrances are provided by the client, and Scentys uses its exclusive technology to ensure: – high-quality fragrance diffusion; – optimal safety; – eco-design and recyclability of capsules. This connected and smart platform allows brands to create a dialogue in real time with their clients. Gathering data about their habits and usage will help marketers get to know them better so they can offer personalized content and recommendations. For example: suggest a new fragrance, let them know their capsule is almost empty and propose buying a new one, or offer advice on optimizing their olfactory comfort. The concept for this custom fragrance diffuser is the result of more than three years of research and development, in partnership with Amazon Web Services. It is based on Scentys' exclusive, patented fragrance capsule technology that allows a cold-air and completely dry diffusion process. Small beads packed with solid fragrance concentrate, but no alcohol or solvents, are stored in the capsules. When air blows through them, they release the fragrance in a subtle, light and even way. This process guarantees that fragrances are reproduced accurately and that users can create a comfortable olfactory environment in total safety. Diffusion leaves no after-scent, so only the new fragrance is present once the capsule is changed. The capsules are easy and safe to use. They are made in France, in Scentys' factory near Paris, and are 100% recyclable. As the home has never been more of a refuge, Scentys is introducing a new ritual for enjoying fragrances and creating wellbeing, and meeting the quest for wellbeing, healthy products, simplicity and immediacy in homes that are ever more connected and have become the ultimate refuge."
"Chanel launches Lipscanner, their first-ever try-on lipstick app","Dubbed Lipscanner, the app allows users to get colour inspiration from their everyday life, or from social media, magazines or items of clothing, to imagine and create their future beauty looks. All consumers have to do is to scan a colour on an image from a magazine, from social networks, or on the face of a friend, or a piece of clothing or accessory, and the application will instantly offer the product with the closest shade from the Chanel's range of lipsticks. Lipscanner's recognition engine compares the scanned colour with the entire Chanel lip range in real time to find the desired product. The app is the result of collaboration over several months between Chanel's Connected Experience Lab (CX Lab) and the brand's Makeup Creation Studio. It took several months to design an exclusive algorithm and to train it to develop its analytical capacity from tens of thousands of facial images. This machine learning ongoing process will be progressively integrated in future releases of the brand's lipstick products. Once the desired colour and texture have been identified, the app's ""Virtual Try On"" feature allows consumers to test the Chanel make-up product that was recommended by the app. Of course, Lipscanner offers to go beyond the virtual make-up experience, with the possibility of transforming the test into reality thanks to a link to the desired shade on chanel.com. The app is available for free from 22 February 2021 in France, the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Korea and 15 other countries on the Apple App Store."
"Ace of Air enters the beauty market with a ""return the empty packaging"" model","The packaging waste issue is becoming crucial in the beauty industry in 2021. In such a context, both heritage and emerging brands are testing new ways to reduce the environmental footprint of their products. In this context, Ace of Air enters the beauty and wellness market with an entirely circular business model. Indeed, after using up their Ace of Air moisturizer, serum or supplements, consumers can ship the packaging back to the company to be cleaned, refilled, and re-used. Made of stainless steel, food-grade ceramic, using fair-trade rubber for the seals and other packaging elements that are normally made of plastic or silicone, the packaging of each product has been designed to last for 100 cycles of use at least. Ace of Air defines itself as a ""Buy the Product & Borrow the Package"" brand, taking responsibility for the full life of its packaging. ""We created this business, not because we thought the world needs another beauty and wellness brand. It doesn't. We did this because our planet needs a beauty and wellness brand that fundamentally changes what and how we consume,"" explained Stephanie Stahl, CEO & Co-Founder of Ace of Air.

"A plant-based isododecane for greener, long-lasting makeup products","Isododecane is a key ingredient in the cosmetics market. The substance is used for its emollient properties in a large number of skin care and hair treatment products. It is also a major ingredient in long-lasting makeup products, such as waterproof mascaras or long-lasting liquid lipsticks. It provides the long-lasting performance, no transfer and waterproof effects, while maintaining optimal comfort. According to Global Bioenergies, isododecane can represent up to 50% of the formulations belonging to these categories. While the long-lasting make-up segment already weights around 25% of the global makeup market, this ingredient was only sourced from petrochemicals. Until now! Thanks to this technological breakthrough, the entire long-lasting make-up segment might get rid from petroleum resources. For producing this renewable isododecane, Global Bioenergies relied on their proprietary innovative technology for converting plant resources (sugar and starch residues, agricultural and forestry waste), into isobutene, one of the main petroleum derivatives. Then, after several steps respecting the naturalness criteria specific to the cosmetics market, isobutene was converted into isododecane. ""This first batch of cosmetic-grade isododecane undergone about fifteen analyses, carried out by specialized and independent experts. All the tests confirmed the high level of purity of the product as well as its compliance with technical specifications defined during toxicological studies conducted by the company in 2020. These analyses led to the release of the batch for commercial use,"" the company explains in a statement. This important step could allow long-lasting make-up to reach levels of naturalness above 90%. ""Without any compromise on performance"", according to Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies. To demonstrate the value of this innovation, Global Bioenergies plans to create their own beauty brand. To carry out this project, the company created an ad hoc committee inspired by Romain Desfresnes, an ex-Coty and ex-Dior executive, who brought together experts from the various field of expertise required for new project development in the cosmetics field. ""We have put performance at the heart of our offer: we have succeeded in combining the ultra-sensorial textures and colour intensity with a high rate of naturalness (between 90 and 99%), in 2.0 make-up products with a high long-lasting, no transfer and comfort performances, matching with the best market standards. Our unique approach 'from biotech to beauty' will enable us to respond to consumers, who are always more eco-conscious when making their purchases,"" underlines Romain Desfresnes. Around 300,000 product units can be produced using this first batch of isododecane."
CES 2021: L'Oréal rolls out its innovations,"L'Oréal has unveiled Yves Saint Laurent Beauté Rouge Sur Mesure Powered by Perso, an at-home system that represents the ultimate in lip colour personalization. Based on the technology originally developed by the L'Oréal Technology Incubator and presented at CES 2020. The device allows the user to create thousands of shades of the YSL Beauty Velvet Cream Matte Finish at home. Using the Perso technology, consumers can create new lip shades within the corresponding app. They can, for instance, design a lipstick shade to match their outfit or opt for a colour that is trending on social media. ""There are four colour universes with three set of cartridges each, thus allowing to produce virtually almost all shades in each universe,"" Guive Balooch, Head of the L'Oréal Technology Incubator, told Premium Beauty News. A limited pre-sale of the Yves Saint Laurent Beauté Rouge Sur Mesure device, priced at USD 299, is available on registration for early Spring 2021 U.S. delivery. The at-home system includes two colour cartridge sets from one of YSL's iconic universes of red, nude, orange or fuchsia. YSL Beauty Rouge Sur Mesure Powered by Perso will be available to consumers widely September 2021. The Perso technology can also create custom formulas for skincare and foundation. These capabilities will launch later in 2021. Along with personalization, L'Oréal has also put technological innovation at the service of the environment. With its Water Saver, a technology developed with Swiss start-up Gjosa, the beauty giant wants to help consumers to reduce water consumption during hairwashing while enhancing the effectiveness of hair care. First unveiled in 2018, this innovation has already been used in select hair salons in the US. Presented in its final version at the CES, it will soon head to France, followed by a global rollout. The technology promises to not only make it possible to considerably reduce water consumption - by up to 80% - but also to reinvent the application of hair care products. The ""high-powered water-optimizing technology"" was directly combined with specially designed L'Oréal Professionnel and Kérastase products that flow directly into the water stream. This would allow, among other things, to use only two litres of water per minute, compared to an average of eight litres per minute for a home shampoo at present. Already available in a selection of salons in New York, L'Oréal Water Saver will arrive in some Parisian salons next February, before being deployed internationally between 2021 and 2022. Professionals should also benefit from a dashboard providing data on savings in water and energy consumption, and a history of the treatments used. Individuals won't be left out since L'Oréal has announced that an at-home shower device ""will be launched at a later date."" ""Within the L'Oréal Technology Incubator, we investigate market gaps focusing on personalization and on enhanced product performance and sustainability,"" concludes Guive Balooch."
Zero-waste beauty start up Everist launches waterless haircare concentrates,"""Coming from big beauty, we understand what goes into making great products,"" said Jayme Jenkins, Chief Brand Officer at Everist. ""We also know and care about the impact that the beauty industry is having on the planet. To make eco for the masses we had to do things differently. Our approach is not to solely focus on the 'desire' to be conscious, but to have formulas that are best in class and maintain sustainability throughout their entire product lifecycle. Our haircare concentrates will change the way people look at eco beauty."" The Toronto-based brand business model is to create new products that are modern and sustainable in performance and design. Driving the concept for their first launch in haircare was the insight that most shampoos and conditioners on the market are more than 70% water and packaged in single-use plastic. ""So basically, it's about shipping plastic bottles of water around the world. This didn't make sense to us"", added Jenkins. Everist therefore invented a new concept: shampoo and conditioner concentrates. ""We found shampoo bars to be messy, powders clumpy and performance has always been our No1,"" she said. The brand's debut line of haircare products features a Waterless Shampoo Concentrate and a Waterless Conditioner Concentrate, both of them being packed in a 100ml travel-friendly aluminum tube. As the products are three times concentrated, this is the equivalent of 300-ml sizes of traditional shampoo and conditioner. ""A first of its kind in the industry,"" according to the brand. The products are formulated with coconut-derived cleansers, aloe vera and peppermint, amla, and rosemary oils among other ingredients. Developed to be 'super clean', these plant-based formulas are free-from parabens, sulfates, silicones, dyes, synthetic fragrances, as well as being vegan and cruelty-free. Completely waterless, the products are free from preservatives and offer a creamy paste texture that is 'activated' with the water in the shower. The brand said the goal was to keep the experience of the new haircare concentrates as close to traditional shampoo as possible. To use the products, consumers simply need to wet hair and hands, and squeeze a 1-inch strip of product onto palm (for medium length hair), rub wet hands to activate and build up lather in the hair as normal. In order to avoid generating non-recyclable packaging waste, Everist has opted for infinitely-recyclable aluminum tube. For optimal use, the products are sold with a key enabling customers to squeeze out all the formula from the tube. As far as the plastic caps are concerned, Everist will run the so-called 'CapBack' closed-loop program to collect them. Made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the caps will be recycled or upcycled. In addition, Everist has committed to 1% for the Planet and Climate Neutral certification. Everist was built by two women with a collective 25 years of experience working in the beauty industry. Jayme Jenkins started her career at Procter & Gamble before spending nearly a decade at L'Oréal and The Body Shop where she worked in Europe launching global beauty innovations across multiple categories. Co-Founder Jessica Stevenson began her career at General Mills before leading marketing for Revlon's professional division, and ultimately serving as General Manager for Australian clean beauty brand Nude by Nature. The brand has received financial support from several investors, including Wonderment Ventures, social impact firm Good & Well, and the female-founders of Canadian brands Knix and SMYTHE among others. However, the amount of this pre-seed funding round has not been disclosed. ""We were fortunate early on to have people who saw the potential of our big ideas,"" said Jessica Stevenson, CEO of Everist. ""In a world of misinformation and greenwashing, zero-waste and clean beauty requires a great amount of thoughtfulness to ensure it is done right. We are committed to discovering new ways of doing things across the entire supply chain and creating better, higher performing products as the result. We are lucky to have partners that believe in us and understand the rigor that it takes to bring this to life."" Everist is taking pre-orders now and will begin shipping their patent-pending shampoo and conditioner haircare concentrates in early 2021 across the United States and Canada. Products are priced at USD 24/ CAD 28 per tube."
Orlandi unveils new connected tool for in-store perfume testing,"Users just need to connect to the dedicated application on their smartphones or tablets and scan the QR codes on the back of the diffuser, which is the size of a tablet, to have access to the 20-fragrance catalogue it contains. This way, they can get informed about the products and trigger the olfactory tests of those they want to discover. The dry diffusion faithfully reproduces all fragrances' notes. It is also possible to discover several fragrances in a row without saturating the atmosphere or mixing smells. Then, the diffuser can be cleaned and sanitized with an antiseptic solution. The recyclable cartridges made available by Orlandi need to be replaced after 100 shots. ""For now, the tablet can contain up to 20 cartridges, but we may offer even more in the future. We are considering developing a second generation tablet fitted with a touch screen,"" explains Philippe Ughetto, Senior VP of Orlandi, the exclusive global distributor of the digital device. Convenience, hygiene, proximity… This new testing tool available in physical points of sale, travel retail stores, or through direct selling, offers multiple advantages. Brazilian giant Natura &Co has already chosen this technology to replace the standard test catalogues used by their beauty advisors, both for direct selling and in physical stores, in Brazil and Latin America. The MultiScent 20 diffuser is already a star in the brand new phygital concept store opened by Natura on Oscar Freire street, in São Paulo. The application offers a quiz which analyses customers' preferences and suggests a personalized perfume selection. As for brands, the digitalization of perfume discovery paves the way for shot personalization, content sharing and data collection regarding the user path. ""With MultiScent 20™, olfactory testing takes on a new dimension: it is now possible to perfectly reproduce and miniaturize smells, while connecting consumers with our brand,"" adds Philippe Ughetto."
TwinSet airless duo: Aptar's solution for hand hygiene and care,"Inspired by pieces of a puzzle that snap together, Aptar's TwinSet airless duo package consists of two 15ml airless pumps that snap together or apart in one simple movement. One of the pump can be filled in with a hand sanitiser and the other with a hand care cream, thus offering a solution to the problem of dry hands caused by frequent washing and sanitizing. The individual pumps stand upright alone and can be used together or separately. According to Aptar Beauty + Home, the TwinSet's airless pumps are fully customisable and interchangeable and can be easily modified to accommodate various types of skincare creams or sanitizers according to the combination preference. The petite, portable format of TwinSet duo offers the added convenience of being easily slipped into a purse or thrown into the car's glove compartment, ensuring the product is on hand at a moment's notice. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of hand sanitizing products became an entrenched part of everyday life. While hand washing and sanitising have always played a large role in the daily hygiene habits for most consumers, these habits have been magnified in 2020. According to Euromonitor, nearly all consumers (93%) now wash their hands at least twice a day and over half of them do so five or more times. ""For all their benefits in preventing transmission of the virus and other germs, repeated use of hydroalcoholic gels may damage the skin's natural protective layer of sebum, sometimes leading to skin dryness and the need to moisturize more often,"" explains the packaging manufacturer. With TwinSet, Aptar intends to provide an easy remedy to the problem: a two-in-one packaging solution that enables consumers to sanitize and moisturize immediately afterwards. Aptar's TwinSet offers the usual benefits of airless pumps, for instance, it ensures formula protection, even when the product is subjected to the rigorous demands of on-the-go portability. Furthermore, the airless pumps deliver a precise and progressive dose each time. ""Made from ultra light, 100% plastic, TwinSet duos are easily recycled,"" adds Aptar."
"Ozmi, a platform that makes cosmetic product development easier","Launched last October on the European market by German startup Chemster, Ozmi is positioned as a partner of beauty professionals throughout all phases of product development. The platform consists of an ecosystem which simplifies searches as regards formulas, ingredients and packaging specialists, and provides services for easier, safe exchanges every step of the way. ""It is very hard for brands to coordinate all aspects of product design, due to the huge market fragmentation per business segment. And it is hard for suppliers to be visible for young brands and to provide them with the main information. Our concept is easy to use and time-saving,"" says Udo Eberlein, CEO of Chemster. According to him, in certain cases, the system can half reduce time-to-market, which is pretty significant for young brands, the platform's main target. In addition, users can choose to search a specific design aspect. Suppliers' information and data are available, so they can contact any company to exchange and get a quote. Project management tools provide advice from the brief to the formula creation. ""The platform is mainly aimed to offer tools to create any beauty-hygiene product, including perfumes, in the long run,"" adds Udo Eberlein. The functionalities are designed to evolve day after day, depending on users' demand. Right now, Ozmi counts 200 open accounts, but it should quickly develop as regards service providers. About 20 French partners are referenced, ""but we sign new entries every day,"" explains the CEO. Based on a collaborative system, the platform provides free access to most functionalities and a complementary offering of paid services."
"O My Note, the perfume app focused on emotions","By launching this app, Dr Sameh Megrhi, founder of OMИ, aims to both make it easier for non-specialists to choose a perfume and encourage those who gave up on this category to come back. Sameh Megrhi, PhD in computer vision, has worked in the field of AI for 12 years. She registered a patent for this solution out of her own resources. ""Although it was created by humans, AI enhances creativity on unexpected levels,"" she explains. She is now helped by seven people, and OMИ is part of Willa, an incubator which promotes women, who are still underrepresented in the data science industry. To offer a different perfume experience that meets ill-informed consumers' needs, OMИ decided to focus on the origins of perfumery: emotions. ""There is a semantic gap between what consumers express and the perfumes launched,"" says Sameh Megrhi. As a result, the application makes it possible to record your own story (with a video, an audio recording, or a text) and explain your current cravings through your emotions and olfactory memories. The algorithm turns in real time the emotions you express into olfactory notes to suggest the smell you are looking for. OMИ selects key ingredients, which you can combine to others, to better identify your tastes. Based on the results, the application makes several perfume recommendations using a database of 40,000 products. In other words, a new language emerges, which consists in communicating your feelings to express your needs when purchasing a perfume. OMИ's second level consists in meeting the rising demand for personalization. Buying a unique product is a recurring demand from Millennials and the Generation Z. These two generations have given up on this category which, in the long run, represents 30% of the purchasing capacity on the perfume segment. This second solution will be available on networking platform DeepNoze. The service will only be accessible with the Premium subscription. The application will encourage customers to use this means with perfumers, so as to implement a real co-creation process for which both parties will be responsible. For this service, Sameh Meghri selected perfumers Joëlle Lerioux in Grasse, Rawya Catto in Dubai, and Shahzad Haider, in Los Angeles, California. Currently in its beta version, OMИ is now ready to be taken to another level. A fundraising will soon be on the agenda."
ABBI customizes skincare based on a selfie,"A new example of the global digital wave in the beauty world, ABBI has just been launched on the market based on a concept combining personalized, connected, and clean beauty. ABBI - French acronym for authenticity, beauty, wellness, and individuality - was created by a couple, Joanna and Frédéric Ifergan, who took three years to develop a new generation of AI that can scan the face and identify the areas of improvement for cosmetics. On the Skan My Skin application, the Apoticare.fr website, or with the connected mirrors installed in pharmacies, users take their pictures to obtain a cream composed of a skincare base and three specific actives that meets their needs. Six skin problems are analysed - wrinkles, sensitivity, pimples, pigment spots, shininess, and radiance - and 40,000 formulas are available to solve them. The mixture is based on one of the six bases, the best-adapted to the skin problem identified (caviar and hyaluronic acid, stem and multiprotection cells, selenium and vitamin C, honey and shea, arnica and niacinamide, and aloe vera balm), enriched with three tailor-made actives. All this is made upon request, and the skincare product is sent 48h later with the customer's first name engraved on the bottle."
Euro Wipes and Fibroline intend to revolutionize impregnated products,"This is a real revolution announced by Euro Wipes (Anjac Group), the French leader in the manufacture of products impregnated on a support, and Fibroline, the world leader in powder impregnation solutions, for impregnated wipes and masks serving the hygiene, cosmetics and health markets. The two companies signed, on October 7, a collaboration agreement to develop and market impregnated products (wipes, pads, masks) as part of a dry process, i.e. with no water or solvents. Both companies, relying on their respective technological know-how, seek to achieve a real technological breakthrough in the next three years to come. ""With this waterless formulation technology, the fields of possibilities are huge,"" they explained in a joint press release. Indeed, the dry impregnation of fabrics can make it possible to use new actives, which are to date difficult to integrate into a lotion, to increase naturalness in formulas, in particular by doing without preservatives and solvents, to reduce water consumption. Ultimately, these future innovations offer ""enhanced safety for both consumers and the environment."" And, which is more, this paradigm shift could be achieved ""without compromising on the efficiency and performance of products."" Indeed, according to Euro Wipes and Fibroline, the impregnation technique allows releasing the actives in the precise areas where their action is required. Concerning sensoriality, it is expected that it will be very different between wet products and dry products, not necessarily to the detriment of the latter. Everything will depend of the supports used and of the method of application. Using electric fields, Fibroline has developed technologies that allow distributing all types of powders in porous structures such as textiles, nonwoven, foams or papers. ""These patented solutions avoid the use of solvents or water, thus enhancing compliance with environmental standards,"" explains Jérôme Ville, CEO of the Fibroline Company. ""Also, our R&D centre is the ideal tool for our partners who are seeking to assess our solutions and secure their projects before the industrial launch. We have invested heavily over the past two years to offer our customers the latest generation laboratory and pilot units, and this, for all of our technologies."" By joining forces, the two French SMEs aim to change the way these products are manufactured and used, to meet consumer expectations in terms of safety and sustainability. ""Environmental and societal responsibility is at the heart of our corporate strategy"", underlined Guillaume Cantelou, CEO of Euro Wipes. ""We have been investing for years in responsible innovation, we strive to design, develop and manufacture continuously sustainable solutions, to offer products and services suited to the needs of customers and consumers, while encouraging an ecological attitude and responsible consumption."""
Towards an increasing digitization of facial skin care?,"Lockdown measures have generated a great deal of frustration in terms of beauty routines. Both men and women have scoured the internet for ideas, tips or advice to refresh their haircut, do a hair color, or treat themselves to a moment of well-being through treatments to be performed from their bathroom. While many beauty professionals have eventually reopened the doors of their salons, with sometimes drastic health and safety measures, they are struggling to regain lost ground. In France, according to a study carried out by consulting firm Asterès for the French beauty federation (FEBEA), beauty salons should see their annual sales fall by 25% in 2020. However, some brands are anticipating a potential second wave lockdown - or simply looking ahead to the future of the beauty sector - by digitalizing their skincare offer. That's the case of Optiphi, a brand from South Africa, which has launched digital facials. To take advantage of these new-generation facials, all customers have to do is order one of the three kits offered on the brand's website, which will be delivered to their home, and wait for a beautician to contact them to set up a virtual appointment. During the session, the professional will guide the client step by step to mix the products if necessary and perform the treatment with the appropriate gestures, provide advices you in relation to the client's skin type, and monitor whether its skin reacts well to the application of the different products. While this new approach to skincare treatments sounds tempting, a few questions arise. Is it really possible to reproduce the - often highly technical - gestures of beauty professionals? And what about the relaxation aspect, inherently implied by an appointment in an institute? ""Due to covid-19, many concepts such as this one are bound to emerge, but they take it from being a moment of advice and relaxation to something virtual, devoid of any pleasure. It ends up being something quite different,"" said Dr. Isabelle Rousseaux, aesthetic dermatologist and board member of the French Union of Dermatologists. Lockdown measures have shown that men and women are ready to switch to the digital realm for many services in many areas. However, patterns of consumption remain very different from one country to another with specificities for each one. ""In France, people are rather attached to beauty treatments in salons. I don't think that this concept would function here, unless people can't leave their homes. However, in 10 years, I may say the exact opposite, who knows? But not at the present,"" stressed Rousseaux, who nevertheless believes that this type of digital concept could be developed in the future. Periods of lockdown have helped shake things up quite a bit all around. While beauty professionals have not had time to develop these types of at-home products and care, many have begun to offer online diagnostics, whether for skin or hair, so that everyone can buy the most suitable products or carry out hair coloring at home. Solutions that should sooner or later become more widely available. Actually, digitalization, online skin care and brick-and-mortar salons can be complementary. In any case, this is what Jean-Michel Karam is banking on: the creator of the IOMA brand has just bought France's Atelier du Sourcil salon network. The clients will be offered the possibility to subscribe to an at-home skin care service guided by a smartphone app. ""We will develop synergies between the two subsidiaries, our digital beauty solution IEVA and the Atelier du Sourcil network. Moreover, the technology provided for L'Atelier will also be massive. There are many innovative solutions to enhance services and solutions as regards personalization according to the face's morphology,"" Jean-Michel Karam told Premium Beauty News in a recent interview."
"Wikiparfum, an olfactory discovery tool for the general public","In line with the recent purchase of The Alchemist Atelier, a physical concept which makes it possible to create your own perfume during personalized workshops, Puig has just made an additional discovery tool available to the general public. In just a few clicks, this perfume Wikipedia offers a beautiful illustrated presentation to learn about the ingredients, notes and olfactory families of most perfumes on the market. The search can be done by perfume name or raw material. Wikiparfum also makes it possible to discover perfumes with ingredients similar and alternative to what you searched. ""With The Alchemist Atelier, we found out that people need to understand perfume to compose it. It is a major obstacle to know how to explain bases and accords. So, we worked hard on perfume visualization. When people smell something and picture it, they can decipher the main ingredients more easily. Associating another sense makes olfaction much more accurate, so we decided to offer people interested in perfumes a simple tool to develop this knowledge,"" explains Camila Tomas, Vice President Innovation Technology of Puig. This free digital tool is mainly intended for fragrance lovers, but it is adapted to any public. It can also be used by advisors in points of sale. ""It is an excellent tool for them to exchange with consumers who do not know what they want, but can name their favourite fragrances,"" adds Camila Tomas. Thanks to this platform the industry can gain understanding of emerging trends and consumer preferences resulting from consumers' searches and choices. In particular, Puig is offering this tool to retail partners. For example, Nocibé has launched a fragrance profiler using this technology. ""We already have about a thousand visits a day, without any ads. But for us, what matters is not traffic, but what we learn from traffic. It is a source of knowledge about what people like. As part of one of the pilot projects we will implement with this technology, we will also ask people to evaluate our recommendations, so we see whether they think they are accurate or not,"" adds the Director. Regularly updated, the platform should soon become a 10,000-perfume database. Available in French, English, and Spanish, it is only accessible in Europe for now. ""Right now, we are working on broadening the platform content to perfumes popular in North America and Latin America, so that we reach these continents, as well as the Middle East. We also want to become a niche perfume showcase,"" concludes Camila Tomas."
Geka adapts its offer to the post-Covid era with new beauty & care line,"Observing that the skin care and the colour & care categories are now increasing at a much faster pace than the liquid colour cosmetics segment, Geka is launching ""Take Care"", a range of liquid beauty products and accessories combining beauty and self-care benefits. ""In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, people are spending more time at home and changing their behaviours: focusing on wellbeing, body and soul harmony,"" explains the full-service provider of liquid cosmetic products and beauty accessories. Focusing on mindful self-care, Geka's latest beauty collection features: a lash & brow serum, a lip pampering oil, a Gua Sha board, a silicon mask brush and a beauty bag. The collection's packaging was designed to be strongly evocative of the skincare category and all formulas are vegan and enriched with super food ingredients. According to Geka, the light and transparent lip pampering oil included in the new collection conjures-up a sensuous and soft feeling on the lips. It is enriched with jojoba oil for extra lip hydration. Combined with the brand-new patented pearl shaped softPEARL applicator, the product can be easily and gently applied on the lips. Concerning the lash & brow serum, it's vegan, paraben-free, transparent and enriched with vitamin E formula has been designed to naturally comb and fortify lashes and brows. The serum is applied with the asymmetrical wonderSTYLIST brush allowing a 2-in-1 application: the longer bristles on one side enable to comb and well-define the lashes by taking them at the root, while the shorter bristles on the other side can be used to define and comb brows easily. In addition to the two cosmetic products, the ""Take Care"" collection consists of three accessories: – A gua sha board made of white jade. The facial tool is reputed helping to reduce wrinkles, dark circles under the eyes and promote lymph drainage for improved skin elasticity. – A silicone mask brush designed for an even and smooth application of face masks. – A make-up bag made of canvas. Earlier this year, Geka presented Reborn, a line of eye make-up products with sustainable packaging solutions, either using recycled materials or bio-based alternatives. Bottles are made of 100% PCR-PET and caps are made of 100% PCR-PP. Flocked applicators are made of minimum 25% recycled flock and brushes are of exclusive EOSgreen and EOSgreendelta fibres (bio-based fibres consisting of 100% renewable raw materials derived from the castor oil plant). The wiper is made of LDPE with a bio-based content of 84%, derived from sugar cane. Eventually, the thread parts are made of 100% bio-based materials also delivered from the renewable castor oil plant. Recently, the company also announced the launch of new product categories available within their 3D online configuration tool. In addition to mascaras, beauty brands can now configurate and style online tailor-made packaging and application solutions for their hair, eye, lip and face make-up product launches. ""By combining Geka's packaging and applicator expertise, along with our digital knowledge, we provide users with an efficient solution to develop their products and transform what is typically a lengthy and costly process,"" explains the company. ""With over 150 stock components and thousands of combinations, the user can find a perfect match by selecting different criteria: desired make-up result, type of applicator, packaging filling volume or material, to name a few options."" The online configurator is available at: configurator.geka-world.com With this set of new products and services the German supplier once again proves its ability to quickly address new trends and adapt to the ever changing market environment."
N.A.E. tests online sales and zero plastic packaging with Amazon,"In partnership with Amazon, N.A.E. further enhances its commitment to sustainability with an eCommerce pilot project featuring reduced packaging material and optimized supply chain methods. N.A.E.'s new plastic-free Solids Box is available for purchase in Germany, Italy and France and can be ordered exclusively on Amazon. Each box contains a solid face, body and shampoo bar as well as a reusable soap pouch. The solid bars from N.A.E. are vegan, certified organic and contain ingredients with 99% natural origin. The three bars in the Solids Box come without any additional packaging and are thus ""naked"". This way, no additional material is used for the wrapping of single items inside the box. The quantity of material has also been reduced for the outer packaging. The box is made from 100% FSC-certified paper and is ready for shipment without using any secondary packaging from Amazon. Only an address label is needed so that the boxes, which fit into any regular mailbox, are ready to be sent to consumers. According to Henkel, the packaging is ""frustration-free"" meaning that it is easy to handle and - more importantly - that all its materials are 100% recyclable. ""The plastic-free packaging and water-reduced formulas of the solids make this project a great example of accelerating sustainability,"" said the company in a release. Beyond the reduction of packaging material, Henkel also worked on the simplification of supply chain processes. Since the products are directly supplied in the paper container itself, the boxes are ready for dispatch and do not need to be additionally packed, which again allows to skip certain steps in the supply chain. In 2018, Henkel set up its sustainability targets for 2025, with the aim that 100% of the group's packaging being recyclable, reusable or compostable."
Meiyume addresses beauty retails' new normal with touchless testers,"With retail shops around the world beginning to reopen, Meiyume is prototyping a touchless sampling tester to create a safe and hygienic in-store environment for consumers and retail staff. Powered by battery packs or AC power, the new device is motion-activated and can dispense any type of fragrance or liquid skincare product. The mechanism uses existing 'off-the-shelf' products so there is no need to design new tester packaging or change the current supply chain. According to the supplier of packaging, product and retail solutions for the beauty industry, the touchless tester display is easily adjustable depending on the size of different tester bottles. However Meiyume is also able to offer bespoke designs for specific projects. The company expects its touchless testers to launch in stores in the next few months, thus allowing shoppers to continue the essential experience of physically and personally testing products in-store, an area facing tremendous disruption as consumers remain cautious about touching potentially contaminated surfaces outside their home. ""Retail stores are where customers engage with beauty products, and Meiyume's touchless fragrance and skincare testers allows them to continue to experience this in a safe and hygienic way,"" said Steve Dodd, Senior Vice President of Retail Solutions at Meiyume. ""Our touchless testers are motion-activated, and can be retro-fitted on existing displays or added on store countertops."" Taking into consideration the new normal, Meiyume has also developed solutions such as adapting their in-store displays to provide an automated density guide so customers and sales associates maintain social-distancing guidelines to help flatten the curve. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the customer tracking dashboards included in Meiyume's in-store digital displays help to better understand new consumer behaviours. ""During the Covid-19 pandemic, Meiyume has been actively supporting our customers and our communities. We want to be proactive in offering innovative solutions for our customers, especially during these challenging times,"" said Gerard Raymond, President of Meiyume. ""Our retail solutions team has been working hard to continuously develop new products and solutions that will re-imagine how consumers will interact with beauty products during the pandemic today, and in the future."""
Kanebo to offer more color and texture flexibility with new makeup lineup,"In a move to offer more inclusive products, Kanebo Cosmetics has announced the launch of a series of new products and limited editions, including base makeup and foundation that can be mixed together. A total of thirty-six items of nine types will debut in Japan on September 04, 2020, at prices ranging from 800 to 6,000 yen (880 and 6,600 yen, including tax). The coming releases will extend Kanebo's creative focus on expressing hope while highlighting the attractions of individuality. On a functional level, the makeup strategy shifts away from ""concealing"" skin concerns with foundation on top of makeup base, to widening the range of expression by finishing the skin with a base-and-foundation blend.

Kanebo Moisture Rouge Neo lipstick combines makeup with care. It colors the lips while moisturizing them. The oil base, with its wrapping effect, comforts the lips with sensations of moisture while protecting them from dryness."
Green chemistry: these new ingredients about to change perfumes,"The companies replacing petrochemistry-derived perfume molecules with their 100% natural counterpart obtained by green chemistry processes still represent a niche. As the molecules are produced in small quantity, their high cost curbs the development of these natural solutions at a large scale. ""So far, no established brand producing large volumes has claimed an all-natural offering with ingredients derived from green chemistry. However, some customers impose constraints on their use, but the cost of the formula is multiplied by three or four,"" says perfumer Antoine Lie. Much involved in this search for natural perfumes, the creator is now turning to players from new industrial horizons who have been developing natural reactive precursors to be mass-produced – and more affordable. Afyren valorizes plant biomass to create molecules that are usually synthesized with oil. ""Our solution consists in valorizing agro-industrial by-products to obtain already-existing synthetic molecules based on oil,"" explains Jérémy Pessiot, founder and Director of Afyren. These by-products are derived from the agro-industry, in particular the sugar industry. Afyren retrieves beetroot pulp or treacle at sugar refineries to make them ferment and get organic acids used to produce molecules for different industries, like human and animal food, cosmetics, and of course, aromas and perfumes. This company founded in 2012 is singular in that it is getting ready for the large-scale production of these natural, environmentally-friendly products. In late 2020, they will launch the works to build a plant based in France intended to supply 16,000 tonnes of organic acid per year. This industrial volume will make the molecules derived from this technology much more competitive and help Afyren become the global leader in this field. ""We have managed to copy nature through biomimicry and make it a 100% natural, waste-free process at the industrial scale satisfying all circular economy criteria. In addition, we will produce seven carboxylic acids at the same time, whereas seven different plants or processes are required to obtain them from oil. Lastly, our process reduces CO2 emissions by 70% per tonne produced,"" adds Jérémy Pessiot. Pending this industrial step, Afyren has already started working with perfume houses to produce solutions in smaller quantity. As far as perfumes are concerned, these molecules are mainly used to get fruity notes and ingredients in the ester family – by combining an alcohol with an acid. ""It is a family that can be reproduced as long as the two natural components are available. There are plenty of esters in the perfume sector: they are rather cheap molecules, so they are widely used. Therefore, it is very interesting to be able to find alternatives. My job consists in guaranteeing olfactory equivalence compared to the synthetic version,"" explains Antoine Lie. ""Players like Afyren use their strike force due to their size to provide perfumers with more and more competitive products as regards the price, but other research programmes focused on new original ingredients are underway,"" he adds. The idea is to try and combine existing natural ingredients with reactants derived from green chemistry. This time, the result might offer the market new olfactory materials, both original and in large quantities. ""This other aspect of creative research is very exciting. It shows green chemistry has a bright future in the perfume sector. All these initiatives contribute to the transition to an ever-greener perfume industry,"" states Antoine Lie."
"In search of sustainability, La Roche-Posay launches first cardboard-based tubes","Available from May in France, Anthelios' new moisturizing sunscreen body lotion (Anthelios is La Roche-Posay range dedicated to protect the skin against the harmful effects of sunrays), aims to protecting both the skin and the environment, with an eco-designed packaging and an innovative formulation. By incorporating cardboard, this new tube reduces by 45% the quantity of plastic required for its manufacture compared to a conventional tube. Fruit of the international partnership announced last October between L'Oréal and Albéa, the global leading supplier of packaging solutions for beauty products, this new generation of tubes was designed as an alternative to the various solutions currently used for cosmetic products. ""We have adapted our manufacturing process to incorporate this new technology, replacing part of the plastic in the tube with cardboard. This is a first,"" commented Barbara de Saint-Aubin, Managing Director at Albéa Tubes Europe. While not recyclable (actually most tubes aren't), these new packs allow significant environmental gains. In order to assess the impact of the new Anthelios 200 ml tubes, La Roche-Posay and Albéa have conducted an initial life cycle analysis. The results show that the tubes' carbon footprint is ""the lowest in their category"". ""The launch of these very first Anthelios tubes to incorporate cardboard represents an important step in our quest to reduce the environmental footprint of packaging. We intend to extend this experimental technology to other iconic products of the brand and to offer it in as many countries as possible,"" said Laetitia Toupet, International General Manager of La Roche-Posay. Other eco-responsible cosmetic tube solutions already exist, including mono-material tubes, sometimes recyclable, tubes made from post-consumer recycled plastics (PCR) or from bioplastics. But this new solution allows La Roche-Posay to progress rapidly towards their goal to significantly reducing the use of virgin plastics in their products by replacing them with recycled materials. In 2020, La Roche-Posay will pass the 25% mark of recycled plastic (10 times more than in 2018). The brand's ambition is to increase this proportion to 70% by 2025, the equivalent of 10,000 tonnes of virgin plastic saved in five years. Since 2012, the brand has also focused on reducing the weight of its tubes to reduce the use of plastic. In 2020, all large format bottles will have their weight reduced by 10%. In addition to these packaging innovations, La Roche-Posay is also committed to ensuring the safety of their formulas for aquatic environments. Anthelios formulas have been tested in fresh and salt water on a representative sample of marine organisms. The laboratory therefore called on experts from the Monaco Scientific Center (CSM) to define new evaluation standards, notably on the impact of sunscreen products on corals. These environmental concerns do not hamper the brand's efforts to protect the skin. Indeed, the new Anthelios moisturizer is based on the new patented Netlock technology, developed by L'Oréal's research, thus enhancing protection against UVA rays thanks to an ultra-resistant water, perspiration and sand proof formula. With this new product, La Roche-Posay is therefore continuing their journey towards the drastic reduction of their environmental footprint. The brand, which achieved carbon neutrality for its French factory in 2018, already announced that other initiatives based on the use of paper or cardboard are currently being assessed."
How to develop ecodesigned sun products,"More ecoconscious, more careful with ingredients, more protective of the environment… today's consumers have quickly changed expectations. And as they are faced with this new equation, i.e. provide more performance with cleaner and cleaner formulas, brands and laboratories constantly look for more innovation, in particular as regards UV filters, key elements in these formulas. ""There are two UV filter families: chemical and mineral filters. But they both involve constraints,"" explains Ludivine Burlot, R&D Director of Laboratoire Shadeline, specialized in the formulation of dermocosmetics and sun products. Two of the most common chemical filters are controversial. ""Brands ask us to develop formulas without using these controversial materials, if possible, i.e. octocrylene and OMC (Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate or Octyl methoxycinnamate), because they are the most disparaged chemical filters for being endocrine disruptors, although they are authorized by regulations,"" confirms Justine Alexandre, Marketing Project Manager of Alpol Cosmétique. To cope with this constraint, formulators have been working on alternatives in line with a protective efficacy objective. ""There are other filters available, but they are more expensive, because they are more recent, and we have been studying different combinations mainly focused on efficacy, but also on the naturalness aspect. Sometimes it is preferable to choose a better SPF over naturalness, because protection is the main criterion. Guaranteeing a satisfactory SPF is a priority for us,"" adds the Alpol Cosmétique expert. Providing efficient, natural, healthy protection also requires using mineral filters, provided they are free from any nanoparticles, a category consumers are wary about. However, these mineral filters tend to offer less sensoriality. As they are very heavy, the titanium and zinc molecules used create a white colour on the skin, which is difficult to prevent without compromising on naturalness. ""Non-nano mineral filters are those that best meet the naturalness, efficacy, and safety demand. White traces are inherent to them, but thanks to our expertise, we can formulate products with pleasant, easy-to-spread textures. And it is also possible to incorporate chemical filters that leave no doubt. They are not all bad,"" explains Ludivine Burlot. So, for now, the consensus would involve a combination of non-controversial chemical filters and mineral filters. The will to minimize the impact of products on aquatic environments adds even more difficulty. This recent, but strong consumer expectation is now driving innovation. Given the ever-increasing demand, in 2015, Alpol Cosmétique set up a research and innovation group on sun care, which identified three main ocean-friendly principles: reinforced waterproofness, so that the formula does not flow into the ocean, biodegradable formulas, and fewer endocrine disruptor residues likely to cause fish feminization. Within this context, the brand SeventyOnePercent created ten years ago by two surfers, Raphaël Vannier and Marc Levy, develops environmentally friendly, technical sun products adapted to their sport. ""We wanted to go natural, but not to the detriment of sun protection,"" explains Raphaël Vannier. Initially, the brand entered the surf market with a small range of water-resistant products free from any controversial filters, based on a very pragmatic principle: products ""which stay on the skin instead of ending up in the water"". In 2018, the range was reformulated based on new technical advances and adapted to the general public. ""Our definition of clean beauty makes us constantly question ourselves. There is no such thing as a perfect product. If you introduce a foreign body to the ocean, it is hard to say there will be no impact. So, we minimize our products dissolving in water by making them hyper-water-resistant,"" adds Raphaël Vannier. New developments combining organic and mineral filters are anhydrous products or oily formulas based on a rational choice of filters. ""We endeavour to use as few filters as possible in our formulas, while providing an SPF50+. We aim to offer the best-adapted product at a given time,"" says the co-founder. With ten references, reinforced distribution, an online store and a strong presence on Instagram, SeventyOnePercent is pretty successful. The products are 80% to 100% natural and available in three shades: invisible, white (surfers/sportsmen are not bothered at all by this effect) or coloured (more playful for children). ""Our success is due to the fact that we deal with this issue in a different way, playing on transparency in our messages. We do not pretend to make the best product, but we try to offer the best-adapted. We also need to adopt less inhibited communication to keep enjoying our time in the sun as a moment of pleasure,"" says Raphaël Vannier. As there are no ""ideal"" alternatives to sun filters, laboratories have been working on reducing their quantity for the same result. For example, in collaboration with the other laboratories of the Anjac Health & Beauty group, which they belong to, Laboratoire Shadeline has been working on a patented natural molecular complex: SPF Boost. This complex of natural ingredients multiplies the power of chemical and mineral filters to reduce the quantity used, without compromising on the efficacy of an SPF50+ formula, while preserving great sensoriality. Laboratoires Shadeline, Sicaf, and Innovi, the ingredient's inventor, are still in the development phase, but SPF Boost should be marketed this year. ""Because it involves a public health issue, sun protection is getting more and more widely used everywhere in our environment, even on a daily basis. So, filters should not be the only answer to protection. We need to adopt new habits. We have also been working on filter-free formulas, which will take more time,"" concludes Ludivine Burlot."
Odore responds to Covid-19 with a new device and a vision for beauty retail,"Designed and developed in a very short time, Odore's new dispensing devices are designed to be deployed to public spaces within the UK, in order to dispense products such as hand sanitisers and masks, whilst showcasing the latest government initiatives and other educational measures and helping combat the spread of the virus. The purpose-built devices have been introduced to reduce human contact, whereby a customer scans a QR code on screen and completes a short questionnaire highlighting key symptoms, and other experiences linked to Covid-19. Following this, the customer would receive an essential hygiene item immediately from the device, for instance a hand sanitizer. With this non-profit initiative, Odore has created a frictionless mechanism to distribute of essential products, whilst also providing a platform to showcase the latest governmental educational measures and advice against the virus. Furthermore, Odore explains they can use their data analytical capabilities to feed the information they have collected during the distribution back to governmental agencies with a goal of getting one stop closer to stop the spread of the virus. ""We are proud to support this initiative within the UK and fully cooperating to ensure that these devices can be successfully deployed to fulfill the purpose of combating the spread of the virus,"" says Armaan Mehta, who serves as co-founder at Odore. Actually, the new device provides almost the same innovative features than the latest generation of Odore's dispensers of beauty samples. They allow, to optimise distribution by ensuring products reach more people as they can be placed in multiple key locations across the country, They can collect data to show who is receiving the products. And they offer a frictionless process through a QR Code scanning. In this evolving and challenging landscape, Odore's initiative might also pave the way to an alternative to boost online sales. ""We are facing an unprecedented crisis, and we are working with our brand partners to revise strategies and priorities. As bricks and mortar stores are closed, and we cannot predict customers' retail behaviours after the situation improves, we assume that e-commerce will be our brand partners #1 priority,"" confirms Mehta. Indeed, with their intelligent dispensers of samples, interacting with social media and collecting data, Odore intends to help brands bridge the gap between the digital and the physical. The company can now create digital sampling campaigns to target the right customers on social media, email and even on the brand's website and combine them with their sampling devices. ""This gives our partners the ability to increase awareness, incorporate appealing offers and provide tailor-made discovery tools, while customers can try their products within the comfort of their own homes. This solution would complement a brand's marketing efforts by growing online sales in quantitative and irresistible ways,"" concludes Mehta."
When artificial intelligence optimises online beauty shopping,"Premium Beauty News - Beauty Matching Engine (BME) is not your first beauty tech entrepreneurial adventure? Nidhima Kohli - Five years ago, I have developed a tool called My Beauty Matches (MBM). It helps consumers find the best products for themselves following a diagnostic quiz. They will then receive personalised product recommendations based on the submitted answers. They can then shop them online through the connected retailers thanks to price comparison. To develop this tool, we had identified key ingredients and product claims to match to any beauty concerns. It's not only for skincare but for every beauty category from makeup to fragrances and hair. Premium Beauty News - Why develop this new concept? Nidhima Kohli - We wanted to launch a B2B white label plug-in solution for beauty brands and retailers so they can also now offer their customers a digital beauty assistant, but also help them personalise their full customer journey, i.e. their complementary products, upsells, emails, product listing pages and more - using five years competitor data via MBM. Also currently in the market there are many 360 degree personalisation solutions which are great but they are not beauty specific, so they do not give the same 400% uplift in sales like using a beauty specific solution or they take 3-6 months to really show an uplift and are quite manual. Our solution provides effective results from day one. The Beauty Matching Engine (BME) solution helps companies provide their customers a personalised shopping experience with or without a digital beauty assistant. When replying to the online quiz consumers receive a gradation in percentage, to see which products matches their needs the most and it continuously optimises, unlike a general beauty diagnostic. The AI technology also explains to the customer why the product is being recommended to them. Premium Beauty News - How does this work? Nidhima Kohli - By merging AI with beauty specific intelligence, the BME plug-in applies dynamic machine learning algorithms to identify nuanced patterns within consumer datasets. In other words, BME identifies preferred beauty products by age, skin concerns for instance. The more consumers visit the online shop, the more information and the more the tool learns (and we already have 5 years of data). The engine then narrows down customer choice, predicting which product the customer is most likely to buy, increasing sales & loyalty. BME personalises product recommendations, complementary products, emails, landing pages. Eventually, it improves sales conversion rates by 30-600%. Beauty websites offer plethora of products and the recommendations are not always accurate in terms of skin tone, lipstick colour or hair thickness for instance. It can result in lower sales conversion due to incorrect product recommendation or choice paralysis (too much choice). Also, without proper targeted data, consumers visits are less frequent or lead to less conversion. Premium Beauty News - Can the solution be implemented on any platform/website. How does it work for the consumer? Nidhima Kohli - It's completely transparent for the consumer. They can click on ""Digital Beauty Assistant"" or any other nudge on the website to start the quiz and be recommended products. They need to answer a diagnostic quiz asking for their skin type, skin concerns, hair and body concerns and product or scent preference for instance. The solution can be implemented directly onto a brand website or an online retailer. We just plug it on top of the current website (Javascript/API plugin) without altering the design or the shopping experience. It's just an additional help to direct the consumer. We just need the product feed and it takes the brand / retailer just 1-2 hours to set up. The diagnostic quiz can be personalised according the brand category. We have implemented BME in the UK with the The French Pharmacy. They needed a beauty personalisation solution for the website and a digital beauty consultant to match the in-store recommendations as close as possible. The tailor-made technology was super quick and easy to implement, needing only a couple of hours from the founder. They have already seen a 50% increase in AoV (Average Order Value) a 400% increase in conversion rates to sales. The tool also offers companies an analytics dashboard with granular beauty profile consumer insights & metrics so their clients can hyper personalise their social media advertising and e-mailings. It can be implemented online, through email or in-store for every beauty category. Premium Beauty News - You've recently joined the L'Oréal beauty tech start-up accelerator at Station F in Paris. How is it helping you? Nidhima Kohli - The program is aimed at innovative Beauty Tech start-ups, from small to big sizes businesses. BME joined the program in February, and it gives us access to resources from L'Oréal but also business mentoring and investor connections for instance. Station F and L'Oréal also host their own events to help us grow and learn more skills. It's a real luck and advantage in our competitive world, which I'm really thankful for."
Kao launches new sustainable personal care line MyKirei in the USA,"With MyKirei, Kao bets on the clean beauty trend to gain some name recognition with consumers in the USA. Indeed, the Japanese word 'kirei' describes something that is clean, well-ordered and beautiful, all at the same time. The word was already used by the Tokyo-headquartered group - whose brand portfolio includes Bioré, Goldwell, Jergens, Laurier, Merries, John Frieda and Molton Brown - to promote its new Environmental, Social, and Governance strategy last year. ""In Japan, Kirei has many meanings. It can describe beauty and cleanliness, as well as simplicity, balance and sustainability,"" explains Karen Frank, President Kao USA. ""The Kirei sensibility has always been unique to and treasured by the Japanese people. With MyKirei, we are bringing this wisdom to the Western consumer with innovation for a gentler, more sustainable way of living."" The new product collection features three products: a Nourishing Shampoo, a Conditioner and a Hand Wash. The products will be available exclusively at amazon.com beginning April 22nd at USD18 each. According to Kao, MyKirei products were developed with global sustainability challenges - including climate change, aging societies, resource scarcity, and plastic waste in the ocean - in mind. As far as ingredients are concerned, MyKirei products offer vegan-friendly, plant-based formulas that are 95% biodegradable with authentic Japanese ingredients, like Yuzu Fruit, Rice Water and Japanese Tsubaki flower. ""Each of these treasured ingredients has been trusted for centuries in Japanese folklore for their multiple, legendary benefits. Carefully curated fragrances, ranging from the calming, soothing Rock Garden scent, to the fresh, energizing citrus Yuzu fruit blooms, signal the beauty and tranquility of Japan,"" claims the brand. In addition, all products in the range are packed in bottles using up to 50% less plastic compared to traditional bottles. The lightweight bottles gain their rigidity through an air fill, allowing them to stand upright, like a traditional bottle. The water tight design of the delivery system prevents contamination and allows consumers to use nearly every last drop they have paid for. ""Competitors leave up to thee times more product in more traditional packaging,"" claims Kao. Eventually, to ensure that no waste is left behind, Kao has partnered with TerraCycle to create a program to allow consumers to recycle the package and the pumps post-use."
Netlock: A new technology for L'Oréal's next generation sunscreens,"In the cosmetic world, the sunscreen category represents a sensitive segment in many respects. From a health point of view, brands need to convince as many people as possible to adopt UV protection gestures, with a range of products that are safe, accessible and suitable for everyday use. Whether light or dark, all skin types are affected. Yet, to date, only two out of five people protect their skin from the sun (Yougov Study - 2019), even though UV exposure is known to be the main cause of skin cancer (2 to 3 million new cases each year according to the WHO). Consumer awareness is however rising steadily with, in particular, a significant 58% increase in the use of SPF 50 and 50+ products in France. The consumption of daily photo-protection products is also evolving in parallel, with 43% increase in 2019 against + 8% for other sunscreen categories, according to L'Oréal. Fully aware of these issues, L'Oréal's Research & Innovation laboratory has worked on its formulas in order to ultimately achieve the best possible protection, namely to cover the entire spectrum of UVA/UVB rays while ensuring a comfortable application and long wear properties over time. ""Traditionally, sun filters are located in the oil droplets of emulsions, but they won't be able to do a proper job if these droplets don't cover the skin areas properly. Our objective was therefore to ensure an optimal distribution, to fit skin reliefs and offer stability over time,"" says Stéphane Douezan, Head of the Photoprotection Development Laboratory at L'Oréal and inventor of the Netlock technology. After three years of research, the laboratory identified an ""ideal"" polymer, co-developed with its active ingredients suppliers. This polymer gels and stabilizes the droplets containing the filters, thus forming an extremely tight and protective structure. The Netlock technology anchors the filters in an ultra-thin film, invisible on the skin, thus giving formulas increased efficiency, but also higher resistance to water, sweat, sand, while preventing product migration in the eyes. The potentially negative impact of sunscreens on coral bleaching, which would eventually lead to their disappearance, is an additional challenge to formulators. To this outstanding issue, L'Oréal replies by confirming that its formula has no impact on ecosystems. ""L'Oréal researchers only use ingredients that do not present foreseeable risks for the environment,"" says Marc Léonard, Director of the Group's Environmental Research Laboratory. The teams rely on the data provided by their ingredient suppliers, or even on their own ingredient biodegradability tests. According to Marc Léonard, only a small fraction of sunscreen products are found in water in extremely low doses, with no consequences. Finally, backed by supporting studies, the group challenges the idea of a proven effect of sunscreens on corals. ""Coral bleaching mostly results from global warming, the poor purification of urban effluents and industrial waste, but also to the leaching of agricultural land, which during tropical rains, deposit sediments, fertilizers and pesticides inside lagoons,"" says Marc Léonard."
Pujolasos launches a skincare version of their natural and compostable cap,"Recently patented by Pujolasos, the new Woork cap responds to the growing demand for 100% natural, ecological and responsible packaging solutions in the cosmetics perfumery perfumes industry. Two months after the launch of a first item dedicated to the fragrance market, Pujolasos Packaging has showcased a new version of their innovation at ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2020. The caps can now be adapted on skin care jars, while retaining their original characteristics: they are free from plastic and only use 100% natural materials. Woork caps are only made from natural and compostable materials, such as wood and cork. All plastic inner parts have been removed and there is no glue between the different materials. Wood and cork are a fully renewable natural materials, they are 100% recyclable and fully compostable. ""This innovation responds to the current need and demand of the market aimed at offering to 100% organic and sustainable packaging products for the beauty sector. The innovation departments of the main brands in the sector work very intensely on how to obtain more sustainable packaging and offer to consumers the most ecological packaging. Woork, is Pujolasos' contribution to make a better sustainable world,"" said the company in a statement."
"Hermetica, the first brand of molecular fragrances","Hermetica wanted to ride the wave of cleaner perfumes. ""People want to know if what they wear on their skin is safe, for them and for the environment, so we had to challenge conventions in the world of fine perfumery by leveraging on creativity,"" describes the founder. The discovery of Symrise's Innoscent technology convinced her of the advantages of an alcohol-free formula where olfactory molecules take pride of place in a water-based support, thus revealing an intense and lasting fragrance with hydrating properties for the skin. ""Freed of alcohol which dries up the skin, these perfumes are hydrating, transparent in appearance, easier to market in some countries and above all more powerful than formulas containing alcohol,"" explains Aliénor Massenet, Perfume Creator at Symrise, who collaborated for more than two years with Clara Molloy to develop the range. The Innoscent technology, exclusive to Hermetica, instantly reveals the heart of the fragrance, as the creator points out: ""It has been proven that, six hours later, the olfactory strength of Hermetica perfumes is 56% more powerful than those containing alcohol, more hydrating and with a softer scent. What's also special about the formula is that top, middle and bottom notes are released simultaneously."" Beyond this unique olfactory specificity, the brand boasts a new mode of creation more consistent with its desire to offer ""clean fragrances"". ""We can stress on the fact that Hermetica perfumes contain up to 50% ingredients of renewable origin. The muguet molecule in Jade888 was created from orange peels originating from the production of orange juice. Several of the molecules present in Megaflower, Rosefire and Spiceair also originate from a renewable source, recovered from paper industry waste. It's another way of being clean, giving new lease of life to what was considered as waste. The approach also applies to packaging: our bottles are renewable and made from recycled glass and locally sourced sand,"" says Clara Molloy. The range is available in 13 scents, 12 of which make up the 4 collections, Emerald Stairways, Vertical Ambers, The Door and Dry Waters. These are complemented by Source, the mother fragrance, which is self-standing and found in each perfume. In France, the fragrances are available on the Hermetica.com site as well as at the Printemps Haussman department store. ""Even if talking about chemistry and waste in the composition of a perfume may still seem a long way from traditional codes, yet, this is the way we must think our work today, as a Fragrance House. We are entering a new era,"" concludes Clara Molloy."
Beauty Tech : The main innovations of the 2020 CES,"Undoubtedly, the two beauty highlights of the 2020 edition of CES in Las Vegas were the devices introduced by L'Oréal and L'Occitane and allowing to make custom cosmetic and skin care products at home. Developed by the L'Oréal Technology Incubator, the Perso smart skincare system is capable of providing personalized skincare solutions via a four-step process taking into account the specificities of the user's skin, local weather conditions, and the user's product preferences. According to L'Oréal, the device is also able to make custom formulas for lipstick and foundation. However, the beauty giant plans to roll out those features at a later date. Firstly, the device is scheduled to launch in partnership with one of the group's leading skincare brands in the year 2021. L'Occitane en Provence is also betting on personalized beauty with Duolab, a machine developed in partnership with Rowenta. The patented innovation comprises a device, a range of capsules - including three moisturising bases and five targeted concentrates - and a skin diagnostic tool. The tool assesses the customer's skin requirements and generates a personalised care protocol. Different combinations of capsules are recommended for morning and evening, taking into account each customer's specific needs. A patented emulsification process delivers a freshly blended single-use dose in 90 seconds. Customers can either buy their capsules on the go or have a set delivered to their door monthly through a subscription. Korea's leading beauty company, Amorepacific, presented a 3D face mask printing system. Dubbed IOPE Tailored 3D Mask and created in collaboration with the 3D printing system developer Lincsolution, Amorepacific's system uses a smartphone app to instantly measure users' facial dimensions and print a personalized hydrogel mask that caters to individual facial features and skin conditions. P&G Ventures, the startup studio within Procter & Gamble, returned to CES 2020 to showcase the development of Opte Precision Skincare System. Introduced to the public last year, this personalized handheld inkjet printer can instantly make the appearance of skin's hyperpigmentation disappear and fade spots over time. Opte's digital camera scans the skin and instantly analyzes each image using a proprietary algorithm to detect tonal imperfections not visible to the human eye. The device then precisely deposits picolitre droplets of Spot Optimizing Serum on target areas until there is a perfect colour match with the surrounding skin tone. However, smart mirrors have not disappeared from the landscape. New devices designed for at-home use are now available. With its latest innovation, HiMirror thus intends to democratize the use of connected mirrors. Priced US$119, the HiMirror Slide is designed for both at home and on-the-go use. The HiMirror Slide's 8"" size comes equipped with slideable panels plus a foldable, rotatable stand for easy storage and both portrait and landscape viewing. To ease makeup application, two LED ambient-light strips surround the mirror. The mirror includes smart features such as Amazon-Alexa, music streaming, social media, weather and news updates, as well as Google Assistant conversation actions. An Enterprise Pro version, intended for retailers, dermatologists and physians wishing to better serve their customers and patients, was also showcased at CES 2020. Korean manufacturer INCO.AI also presented a smart mirror intended for use at home. Their brand new Venus model features 7"" touchscreen LCD, Alexa built-in, skin diagnostic/AR makeup function, table mood lamp, LED ring lights for makeup, and artificial intelligence tools. Neutrogena relaunched their Skin360 app, which was initially presented at CES 2018, eliminating the need for a separate skin analysis tool. The selfie analysis is now powered by Perfect Corp.'s YouCam technology, that provides lightning fast analysis for a broad range of skin parameters including wrinkles, fine lines, dark under-eye circles, dark spots and smoothness. Among the multitude of other innovations presented at CES 2020, let's also mention the Oral-B iO smart toothbrush from Procter & Gamble, and the smart mirror solutions for hair salons by Wella."
"L'Oréal introduces Perso, a smart device that makes beauty personal","Developed by the L'Oréal Technology Incubator, Perso stands at just 6.5 inches high, but offers big solutions: the smart skincare system is capable of providing personalized skincare solutions via a four-step process. First up is a personal skin analysis, performed via the Perso mobile app using L'Oréal-owned ModiFace artificial intelligence (AI) technology to assess the user's complexion. Then, using Breezometer geo-location data, Perso assesses any local environmental conditions - such as humidity, weather and the UV index - that might influence the state of the user's skin. The third step sees the user share their personal skincare concerns and product preferences with the app, before the final step, in which the device dispenses a single dose of a personalized blend of product such as moisturizer, serum or under-eye cream. The technology also adjusts for morning and evening application, and the brand claims that with regular use, Perso's AI platform will be able to alert users to the formulas that are working best for them and automatically adapt its formulas. According to L'Oréal, Perso is also able to make custom formulas for lipstick and foundation, with the beauty giant planning to roll out those features at a later date. In the meantime, the device is scheduled to launch in partnership with one of its leading skincare brands in the year 2021. ""We know that customization relies on information about your unique skin and personal preferences as well as your environment; this technology accounts for that,"" said Guive Balooch, Head of L'Oréal's Technology Incubator, in a statement. ""Perso uses AI to optimize the formulas and actually gets smarter as you use it."" The new device is the latest in a string of solutions created by L'Oréal in recent years with a view to personalizing the beauty space - last year, the company unveiled Color&Co, a personalized hair coloring experience allowing users to achieve the look they want from home, while its Garnier label launched a 'Virtual Shade Selector' hair color tool capable of recommending different shades to consumers in just one minute."
Thin skin: Kao unveils ultra-fine spray-on facemask,"After applying an absorbent lotion, users spray the fibres onto their face and a thin translucent sheet is quickly formed, acting as a ""greenhouse"" for the real skin below to soak up the moisture and still be able to breathe. The ""second skin"" can be worn overnight or peeled off after about a minute. ""This is the world's first cosmetic product using such technology,"" according to Masayuki Uchiyama, skincare researcher at Kao. Developed in partnership with Panasonic, the hand-held diffuser was 10 years in the making, said Uchiyama, who admitted: ""We struggled to make the device small."" Kao researchers did not initially think of using the technology of ultra-thin fibres to create a layer on the skin, he said, adding that the precise material from which they were made was a secret. ""But we learned that the skin can still breathe under the thin fibres for many hours"" in an environment akin to a greenhouse. Such cutting-edge tech does not come cheap though, with each diffuser costing 50,000 yen (US$460). Nevertheless, Kao predicts cosmetic sales could reach 100 billion yen if the technology is applied to the medical field. In the future, Uchiyama said it could be used to cover scars or to create an invisible medical patch. Similar technologies already exist, including those using cells or polymer, but Uchiyama said Kao's technology is different. ""Ours is focused on fibres. They're more flexible and hard to break even if you move."""
Formula One makes a move on the fragrance industry with innovative 3D-printed bottles,"The racing giant is launching its new five-piece scent collection globally in April 2020, it has announced. But to whet fans' appetites, it has unveiled three limited-edition, 3D-printed artworks designed by Ross Lovegrove. A total of 100 of the pieces, with the collection of five interchangeable fragrances, was made available to purchase at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on December 1, priced at up to USD 10,000. If we still know little about the fragrances that will be launched in 2020, Designer Parfums - whose portfolio includes brands such as Jennifer Lopez, Naomi Campbell, Ariana Grande, Ghost, Aigner Fragrances, Porsche Design, Scherrer, Cerutti 1881, Playboy - announced a haute parfumerie positioning with a retail price of USD 250 for the premium collection. As for the preview limited edition, the final version should offer glass bottles housed in a resin-based 3D printed exoskeleton. Also, if the name of the five fragrances that will be eventually proposed has not been disclosed yet, nor the ingredients they will contain, we know however that renowned perfumers including Aliénor Massenet and Emilie Coppermann, participated in the creation. ""We are leveraging the sport's heritage and principles to build a unique fragrance brand that merges a highly legitimate approach to the perfume world with the core values of Formula 1,"" said Dilesh Mehta, Designer Parfums Chairman and CEO in a statement. ""Being the first fragrance brand to utilize 3D printing is a huge achievement, and we look forward to pushing this even further in future years when we will offer consumers the ability to create their own customized designs."""
Forget about their familiar features: Aptar modernizes perfume sprays,"After five years of research and development, Dolce, the new dispensing solution by Aptar, offers an exclusive approach to perfuming gestures. Slower, longer, more silent and wrapping, the Dolce spray has nothing to do with the experience of a standard pump. Aptar had it tested by a panel of consumers: two thirds of them declared they preferred it, and it was found it plays a role in their buying decision, even if it is a bit more expensive. This technological innovation is mainly based on its push button and on a new generation sprinkler composed of a multitude of micro-holes, contrary to standard sprays, which are fitted with only one output part. It is compatible with all Aptar screw or crimp pump ranges. The balance of pressure between the different openings has an impact on the spray duration, which is estimated ten times longer than a standard spray. This way, users can choose both more or less continuous spray duration and the quantity of perfume delivered, depending on the moment of the day: the dose ranges from 70 to 140 microlitres. The panel of testers described the sensation provided by the very fine droplets as a gentle perfumed veil on the skin. From an olfactory standpoint, ""the different facets of the perfume are highlighted thanks to micronization, which creates a unique perception of appreciation over time,"" said perfumer-creator Antoine Lie at the product presentation. The serial production of Dolce by Aptar will start at the end of the first quarter 2020 in Normandy, France."
The Fragrance Innovation Summit attracts numbers around the future of perfumes,"Sabine Chabbert, representing the Fragrance Foundation France, an early partner of the event, inaugurated this day structured around 15-minute-long, speed talking presentations. Mathilde Lion, Global Client Development Director of the NPD Group, set the stage with a statistical assessment of selective perfumery around the world. Although perfume still dominates the prestige category, sales tend to remain stable on mature markets. However, she did mention a few growth drivers, in particular travel shoppers, who increasingly buy perfumes in duty free areas and on local markets, e-commerce, which still has a huge growth potential in this category, and naturalness expectations, mainly expressed by young generations. Vincent Gallon, chief editor of Premium Beauty News, took the public on a world tour of the most astonishing perfume innovations in terms of positioning, gestures, or formulations, and put an emphasis on the 2019 trends: sustainable development, customization, reinvented uses, and new experience-oriented concepts. Highly technological, highly data-oriented: a new way to approach creation Claire Viola, Vice President Digital Strategy Fragrance of Symrise, and Muriel Jacquot, founder of Myrissi, gave a presentation about how to integrate the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence to the creation process. ""To us, AI can be considered the next perfume revolution,"" said Claire Viola. Using the Philyra tool developed in collaboration with IBM, two fragrances were designed for Brazilian brand O Boticario based on formulas with proportions and combinations never tested before in the perfume sector. As for the Myrissi tool, thanks to AI, it helps anticipate the intuitive interpretation of a fragrance in order to optimize its emotional impact. Highly natural, highly ethical, highly authentic: towards committed perfume? However, creation should also adapt to major societal changes. Pascale Brousse, founder of Trendsourcing, deciphered consumer expectations as regards ""clean perfumery"" – a trend highlighted by Camille Lefeuvre, founder of pH Fragrance. Natural creation might well represent tomorrow's biggest challenge. Perfumer-creator Irène Farmachidi, of French company Technicoflor, an expert in this field for over 12 years, detailed what creative work consists in when it comes to integrating the constraints of a palette with fewer natural raw materials. Still, the natural, ethical palette can be further enriched, confirmed Behave founder Stéphane Piquart, a perfumer sourcing specialist who has adopted an ecoresponsible and fair approach. He explained his strategy by highlighting the work he has done on three flagship raw materials: sandalwood, myrrh, and ylang-ylang. Then, Marie-Gabrielle Jouan, founder of the BGene laboratory, put an emphasis on the role played by biotechnologies in the production of aromas and molecules based on wood by-products. Convinced that storyproving is gradually replacing storytelling, Sandrine Sommer, Sustainable Development Director of Guerlain, gave an overview of the various actions implemented by the Bee brand in this field, in particular the new traceability platform called Bee Respect. Accessible online, the website provides all types of information, including the origins of the components contained in every single Guerlain product: skincare, makeup, and soon, perfumes. After a whole morning of discussions, Marc Giget, President of the EICSI and of the Paris Club of Innovation Directors, reminded everyone of the need to put innovation back at the core of societal and human expectations. His speech was substantiated with the experience shared by Chantal Roos, guest of honour of the event for her exceptional career in the perfume industry, in particular as the President of Maisons YSL Parfums and BPI, and as the creator of niche brand Roos & Roos. Vanessa Cots, of digital communication agency Dix Sept Paris, focused on the need for luxury brands to approach social media from a different angle, i.e. by getting rid of existing static strategies and banking on quality through richer, more original, even committed communication… Echoing her presentation, Michelle Algazi, Insight Crafter at Dynvibe, warned the audience about an emerging, powerful feeling of overconsumption and weariness towards cosmetics, perfumes included, among young consumers. For his part, Carl Allain talked about how Arcade Beauty offers to test a perfume via Instagram. After an overview of the most striking innovations showcased at Luxe Pack – this year, most of them were environmentally friendly initiatives – leading luxury glass and plastic packaging players, Aptar, Albéa, Pochet, Bormioli Luigi, and Verescence, gathered around the table to detail some of their answers to the environmental challenge they are facing. Perfume can be considered from multiple standpoints. For example, it can meet rising wellness expectations: Greentech's Scientific Director Edith Filaire explained how her company developed a protocol for analyzing the emotions induced by cosmetic products. And then, why not play with the borders between the different markets, creating multisensory experiences mixing taste and smell? Independent perfumer-creator Cécile Zarokian presented the work she did for various spirits brands to convey the evocation of a gin or old rum in a fragrance, or even create an edible perfume – which all participants tested with great curiosity. Without opposing physical stores and e-commerce, Joël Palix, President of Palix Unlimited, reminded the audience of the increasing influence of online stores to which retail needs to adapt. ""Stores need to be reinvented through a new role distribution; they should play on new closeness levers or new practices, like refillable solutions,"" he said. TopNotes founder Nathalie Pichard focused on a well-known tricky challenge, that of training physical store teams in order to stand out, while Nicolas Dewitte, General Manager of the Bogart Group, given his experience as both a perfumer manufacturer and retailer, explained how useful it would be to transpose values between the two activities. ""We need to bring olfaction back to the heart of our stores,"" he recommended. Given the interest in its dynamic formula and the scope of the themes discussed, a 4th edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit will be held in November 2020 in a bigger venue, in Paris."
Pujolasos launches 100% natural and compostable cap for fragrance bottles,"""We have placed sustainability at the core of our company's strategy. One of our goal was to achieve a sustainable cap made with natural materials that could be thrown away to the organic waste. A fully compostable cap that could thus be easily returned to nature,"" told Angel Pujolasos, CEO of the company, to Premium Beauty News. It's all done with the new Woork cap! ""The first 100% organic and compostable cap of the market,"" claims Pujolasos Packaging. The patented innovation features a wooden external part and a cork insert that insures the junction between the cap and the perfume's pump. With wood and cork being completely natural and renewable materials, the company thinks the innovation responds perfectly to the current needs and demands of the market. ""We had to cope with several technical challenges, such as finding out how to remove the plastic without altering the cap functionality or how to remove the glue while ensuring the grip between the cork and the wood,"" explained Angel Pujolasos. ""Once we overcame the technical difficulties, another big challenge was how to make large quantities a very competitive price,"" he added. With no other material than wood and cork, when the product's end of life has arrived, the cap can be disposed in the organic waste. ""A huge contribution to improve the sustainability of perfumes packaging,"" according Pujolasos Packaging. The cap can be customized to adapt to specific projects, and several PEFC or FSC certified wood options are available, including beech and oak. ""The concept that we have launched is designed to work with pumps, it is therefore mostly aimed at the fragrance industry, although we are working on similar packaging solutions to fit the needs of cosmetic brands,"" concludes Angel Pujolasos. Reducing the environmental impact of packaging has become a key issue in the cosmetics and fragrances industry, as the latest edition of the Luxe Pack Monaco tarde fair has shown. And perfumes are no exception to this global trend, as packaging is getting greener from all standpoints, including glass, pumps and caps. Most recently, Quadpack also responded to the winds of change in the beauty packaging industry with Eco-warrior, a new concept with a minimum number of components where the 100% cork cap can be both composted and recycled."
Will paper bottles soon be available for cosmetic products?,"Driven by Paboco, a joint venture between BillerudKorsnäs and Alpla, the project is designed to create and industrially produce 100% recyclable bottles made of wood cellulose with a bio-material based barrier capable of resisting liquids, CO2 and oxygen, and suitable for liquid goods such as carbonated and still drinks, beauty products and more. To date, the high barrier properties (the ability to withstand gas permeability) required for the bottle are provided by a thin layer of PEF (polyethylene furanoate) by Dutch company Avantium. PEF is a 100% plant-based and recyclable polymer. Thus, it is possible to fully recycle the Paper Bottle by separating the paper and PEF. Building on years of experience, the development journey towards a sustainable paper bottle first met with success in 2015 when Danish company ecoXpac presented a first paper bottle for beer, in collaboration with Carlsberg Group and BillerudKorsnäs. To explore further development and commercial opportunities of such paper bottles and bring sustainable progress to the bottling industry, Paboco wants to bring together leading experts in material, design and technology, and world-leading consumer brands. ""It is all about the team! We are collaborating across the value chain, sharing the risks and are united in our vision that the Paper Bottle will become a reality and fundamentally change this industry for good"", says Mrs. Gittan Schiöld, interim CEO of Paboco. Each of the brands pioneering the Paper Bottle project will develop and design their own paper bottle to meet the needs of their category."
"Eponyma, the first safe customized skincare concept in industrial production","Usually formulated in stores or at home, most customized skincare products escape critical focal points related to hygiene, traceability, formula homogeneity, and dosing compliance. ""Given how significant the safety issue is for consumers, we decided to create a new business model, a new industrial system that could ensure the safety of customized cosmetics. This system can automatically manufacture products individually, in compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in force in the cosmetics industry,"" explains Florent Pascal, co-founder and CEO of OTO-Systems. On the Eponyma website, consumers create their own profile to determine the extrinsic and intrinsic factors that can have an impact on their skins. Depending on this profile, a transposition algorithm defines a tailor-made active complex out of over 15,000 possible combinations. Consumers can also choose a texture - rich or light cream, serum… - and the colour of the formula. Plus, they can personalize the packaging with their names. The order is sent to the machine in real time, so the product can be manufactured immediately. Then, it is shipped within 48h. Every product is unique and bears its own formula and batch number to ensure traceability. ""We keep a sample of every single product we make to ensure perfect traceability and make it possible to perform a posteriori tests, if need be,"" explains Florent Pascal. Since every formula is unique, by definition, to avoid any cross-contamination between the different products, the system is automatically cleaned and sterilized as soon as a product has been manufactured. The concept covers most issues related to consumers aged 20 to 80 – hydration, anti-ageing, radiance, UV protection… – in a way that is adapted to every person and their own environment. The multifunctional product is available for EUR 76 to EUR 99, depending on its composition, in a 50ml airless glass bottle. ""The first feedback we got from our consumers is excellent. They like the fact that they use only one product meeting all their personal needs,"" rejoices Florent Pascal. The startup has launched a fundraising campaign and now aims to set up a first workshop in France, diversify their offering to other segments than face care, and gain visibility on the French market."
Fragrance Innovation Summit: a day dedicated to major perfume transformations,"About thirty speakers, perfumers, communicators, packaging players, startups, retailers, trainers, analysts, consultants, and others will take turns the whole day to screen the major avenues of investigation offered to brands. Both in Europe and around the world, today, the challenge for the perfume industry lies in seducing, but also surprising specific, less dynamic categories. Mathilde Lion, of NPD Group, will present a world tour to make an update of the industry, talk about prospects, and highlight the most innovative launches. Then, other conferences will discuss the means of intervention offered by new technologies during the various phases in the life of a perfume. Consumer expectations related to good practices, Guerlain's transparency commitment, the introduction of a new virtuous brand, biotechnologies, the all-natural challenge, ingredient sustainability… many aspects will be described throughout the summit, showing how the perfume industry reinvents itself for more naturalness, similarly to the transformation made on the cosmetics segment. Thanks to endless practical solutions, industrial partners show how committed they are to meeting new challenges related to the circular economy, digitalization, or time-to-market. They will detail their strategies in these different areas. The customer experience, the last consumer approach phase for brands, represents a major challenge driven by communication, the social media, the in-store experience, and cross-channel marketing. Experiences and recommendations will be shared for everyone to take stock of the possibilities available mixing the human and digital aspects.

L'Oréal and Albéa create paper-based cosmetic tube,"""Since 2007 we have been constantly improving the environmental footprint of our packaging,"" said Philippe Thuvien, Vice-President Packaging & Development of L'Oréal, in a statement. ""Today we are going one step further and launching this new technology based on certified paper. By working upstream and closely with Albéa to co-develop this breakthrough innovation, we aim to create a new paper-based tube packaging for our cosmetic packaging."" L'Oréal targets a first market launch for skin care products packaged into the new tube in the second half of 2020. La Roche-Posay should be the first L'Oréal brand to test this paper-based tube for its creams for the face and body. ""L'Oréal is committed to improving the environmental or social profile of 100% of its packaging by end 2020. This innovative, alternative solution is an integral part of the Group's packaging strategy,"" adds Philippe Thuvien. L'Oréal has taken multiple steps towards improving its environmental credentials recently, including taking a minority stake in Carbios, a start-up that focuses on finding bio-industrial solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textile polymers, earlier this year. The group is also a signatory of the Ellen McArthur Foundation's 'New Plastics Economy Global Commitment.' « Our ambition today is to accelerate the development of innovative, responsible solutions, to dare break the codes, to aim for breakthroughs. It is only through collaboration with our customers and partners that we can invent the safe, circular, minimum-impact packaging that the beauty market wants, » said Gilles Swyngedauw, Vice-President CSR, Innovation & Marketing of Albéa. The replacement of plastics by more sustainable alternatives has been a key issue during the 2019 edition of Luxe Pack Monaco and another model of paperboard-based tube for cosmetic products was also presented by the Finnish cardboard producer Stora Enso. The body of the tube is made from a barrier-coated, grease-resistant paperboard by Stora Enso, which makes it suitable for the primary packaging of skin creams. Currently, according to Stora Enso, making the body of the tube from paperboard reduces the use of plastic by 70% compared with a plastic tube. Sustainable packaging has become a major focal point within the beauty industry recently. Back in April, the personal care conglomerate Unilever unveiled a three-part plan to tackle plastic use in the US, while January saw Procter & Gamble partnered with several major companies to co-found the 'Alliance to End Plastic Waste,' a non-profit organization designed to tackle plastic waste levels in the ocean."
Asquan partners with Pylote to provide fully hygienic makeup and mascara brushes to cosmetic brands,"""Our strategy here at Asquan Group is to develop fully effective, holistic innovation based on delivering a robust benefit to the end user. By partnering with recognised experts in their field, we can guarantee our clients cutting edge and proven technology on a fast to market time scale,"" said Henri Tinchant, President of Asquan. The manufacturer of accessories, applicators and packaging solutions for cosmetics brands, therefore contacted Pylote, a young company headquartered in Toulouse, South of France, specializing in the chemistry of minerals and ceramics. The start-up company has developed a patented technology to prevent the contamination of applicators during their use. The tools therefore remain clean without promoting microbial growth. ""Our goal was to guarantee the hygiene of our applicators. Pylote has developed a unique technology, with a spectrum of activity much wider than any existing solution. Indeed, it protects not only from bacterial contamination but also from viruses,"" highlights Henri Tinchant. Giving makeup brushes and beauty accessories an unprecedented level of safety and hygiene as yet, unseen in the market, the Pylote technology automatically extends the shelf life of the product. Moreover, brushes and other tools would not require typical drastic disinfecting during their entire period of use, which brings tremendous benefit and peace of mind to the consumer while reducing the ecological footprint. To give entire legitimacy to this breakthrough innovation, Pylote has conducted a complete industrial evaluation and qualification of the benefits of prototype ""Pylote Added"" makeup accessories. ""The results of these tests showed that the technology maintains a high level of microbiological hygiene in worst conditions against even the most virulent antibiotic resistant bacteria and viruses such as those responsible for herpes or for conjunctivitis, therefore guaranteeing a safer use of cosmetic accessories and applicators. It is also extremely effective at eliminating the risk of contamination between uses as well as cross contamination between consumers,"" said Loïc Marchin, CEO of Pylote. In partnership with Pylote, Asquan has made the prototypes that have been tested and are ready to be marketed. ""We have validated the entire industrial process and the efficiency of the technology for brush and mascaras fibres. We are ready to produce on the basis of tested materials,"" added Henri Tinchant. If the client chooses other materials, qualification process can be quickly carried out. But the technology has the advantage of not changing the existing manufacturing process the industrial process and has no impact on minimum order quantities. Based on the action of mineral particles, without any migration into formulas, Pylote's technology is in compliance with the FDA, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, food, international regulations and COSMOS approved. Obtained by in-house clean manufacturing process, mineral ceramic microspheres are directly integrated into the fibres of makeup and mascara brushes, offering ""a safe and effective way to address growing concerns regarding the risk of microbial contamination and the consumer demand for hygienic, healthy, safe and environmental friendly products."" The two companies will present the new makeup brushes and mascara applicators to the cosmetics and beauty industry on their booth at the MakeUp in NewYork show next week. Stéphane Thiollier, Managing Director Business, Pylote and Henri Tinchant, President, Asquan will also detail the innovation through a presentation on September 11th (12-45pm - 1:20pm)."
Israeli farmer remixes ancient scents near Dead Sea,"With a passion for ancient plants, Guy Erlich set out in 2008 to try to grow them himself to turn into fragrances and other products, on a small hill in the West Bank, near the Israeli settlement of Almog, in occupied Palestinian territory. He now cultivates around 60 biblical plants, from which he creates creams, perfumes, soap and honey, and attracts tourists who come to learn about the rare plants and take in their scents. Erlich, 48, dreams of bringing back into widespread circulation the balm of Gilead, used medicinally during the ancient Roman era and referenced in the Bible. He's even named his farm after it. The balm is thought to have been used by the ancient Greek physician, Galen, to heal infections and wounds, he says. He mentions Jewish teachings from the Talmud and Christian sources that name it. A farmer before making a job out of his fascination for biblical agriculture - some of which has long disappeared - Erlich says he has read everything he can find on the subject. Elaine Solowey, a desert agriculture specialist at Israel's Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, helped him to identify some of his plants. Speaking to AFP, she said that she could not say for sure if Erlich's plants were those found in biblical times since more research was necessary. ""The species produced by Mr Erlich are probably those cultivated in the region during antiquity, but we can't be certain,"" Solowey said. ""Many plant species mentioned in the Bible have disappeared and it is vital that we figure out how to study the subject,"" she said, adding that more funding was needed. Erlich makes honey with the flowers of Boswellia trees that yield frankincense — one of the offerings to the baby Jesus in the Bible's New Testament. The trees grow in places like Somalia, Yemen, Ethiopia and Oman but Erlich has planted them at his Balm of Gilead Farm. For now, the small leafed species takes up only a limited part of his farm, but the honey he produces sells at a premium price: $1,000 (900 euros) per kilogram. The farm is currently quite spartan and he hopes in time to be able to develop his tourist centre, a simple, wooden structure that shields visitors from the sun next to his fields. Wearing boots and a large hat, he explains to visitors the story behind each plant and its name. Erlich is seeking to attract investors but says it is difficult since his farm is in occupied territory. For Palestinians, his work has more than a whiff of controversy, given the location of the farm. Abdallah Abu Rahma, a Palestinian Authority official who monitors Israeli settlements, was unequivocal when asked about the project. ""Everything produced in the settlements is illegal,"" he said. ""That's why we call for a boycott of such products."" Settlement expansion has accelerated under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a policy that detractors say reduces the chances of a two-state solution to the Jewish nation's conflict with the Palestinians. But Erlich is undeterred. Noting the ancient Egyptians' use of fragrances and the possibility that several of the plants he grows were used at that time, he advertises his perfume as a type used by Cleopatra. ""Offer your wife Cleopatra's perfume, the fragrances of antiquity, the scents of Rome,"" he tells visitors. Erlich also claims to have re-created fragrances used at the time of the two biblical-era Jewish temples, the first destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 BC and the second by the Romans in 70 AD. ""On your right hand, you have the scent of the first temple, on the left hand the second temple, and if you rub them against each other, you will smell the incense that will be burned in the third temple,"" Erlich said. According to Jewish tradition, the third temple will be built when the Messiah comes. Erlich sells his products from his farm. He has so far sold four kilos (8.8 pounds) of his frankincense honey in 30-gram (one-ounce) bottles and hopes to increase production. Visitors can also buy a five-millilitre (0.2 ounce) bottle of fragrance for 100 shekels ($29, 26 euros). ""These products have a history, a specificity,"" he said. ""They are unique."""
"Cosmopolitan makes fragrance debut with smoothie-inspired ""Eau de Juice""","The series, which represents Cosmopolitan's first foray into the fragrance industry, comprises four playful perfumes corresponding to different moods. They are 'Extra Concentrated,' a fruity mix of apple and champagne accord top notes with a heart of praline, '100% Chilled', a cozy scent made up of red berries and bergamot as top notes and a base of cashmere woods and sandalwood, and 'Love, Unfiltered,' which blends top notes of red berries and mandarin with a heart of wild freesia and an amber base. 'Pure Sugar,' a flirty combination of wild strawberry, pink grapefruit and plum blossom notes, completes the collection. The scents, which were created in partnership with perfumers at Firmenich, come presented in juice box-inspired packaging with a lip print on the straw, in shades of gold, pink, white and blue. They launch online on August 1st at the cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty, and will be rolled out in stores from August 5. ""It's been said, a woman is not fully dressed without her fragrance, so for Eau de Juice we forged the unprecedented collaboration with our talented editors at Cosmopolitan to inspire a range of scents that speak to her every mood and fancy, allowing new opportunities for Cosmo girls of all ages to express their individuality,"" said Steve Ross, global chief licensing officer and head of brand development for Hearst Magazines, in a statement. ""Our vision was to create a brand narrative that is aspirational yet relatable, with a wink of humorous sensibility,"" elaborated Chief Marketing Officer of Luxe Brands, Noreen Dodge. Latest innovation in fragrances will be discussed at the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris on November 7th, 2019. Program and registration: Fragrance Innovation Summit 2019"
Luxcos takes its make-up innovation to new heights,"Put forward at MakeUp in Paris, the new Nail + Lips Night Balm 2in1: ""It's a multifunctional vegan nail care and lip care; it acts like a comfort mask for the nails, and forms a protective film on the lips at night, thus preventing them from drying out,"" explained Aurélie Ignaccolo, Product Strategy & Marketing Director at IL Cosmetics. ""It's a no-gender, versatile, easy to use product, suiting all-ages that also adopts all the codes of clean beauty through its anti-waste side (i.e. a single pack for 2 functions). But for us, it is also an iconic product, because it draws on all our skills: those of International Lacquers for nails, and of Luxcos for make-up"". The formula won over to the jury members of the Innovation Tree at MakeUp in Paris, who selected it in the best full-service innovation category, especially for the audacity of its dual purpose and its adequacy to consumer expectations in terms of ease of use, product benefits and ethics. The strong point of Luxcos is undoubtedly mascara. ""At the Group level, it is the most important category after nail polish and as such is granted important R&D resources,"" underlined Juanita Parra, Marketing Manager, Makeup Division for IL Cosmetics. Once again, Luxcos has put the consumer at the centre of its innovation drive. ""Mascaras follow the same underlying trends as other cosmetic products: the need for more practical formulas that are easy to use and remove. Mascaras users are also looking for both eco-friendly solutions and vegan formulas, a growing trend particularly in the United States and Europe,"" highlighted Juanita Parra. To meet these new expectations, Luxcos has been working on ways of replacing beeswax, an animal-based, key ingredient in many mascara formulas. The challenge being to preserve the make-up performance of the formula using carefully selected vegetable waxes. ""We are able to offer vegan alternatives whatever the texture: cream, waterproof, easy-removal or lash-care while guaranteeing make-up results."" Among the 100% vegan favourites showcased at MakeUp in Paris: – Naughty me - a mascara made from vegetable rice waxes enriched with jojoba oil, sweet almond oil and vitamin E - which offers a buildable volume effect. – The new Life-Proof technology: an anti-smudge formula that can withstand all sorts of challenges: sports, sweat, rain, tears; the formula dissolves easily with warm water and takes the form of small tubes when removed from lashes. ""Consumers today have become much more demanding and are looking for mascaras suiting their lifestyles and therefore expect brands to propose them products with all the pros and no cons,"" added Juanita Parra. On the clean beauty side, Luxcos is working on formulas with a high concentration of natural ingredients, which will be presented in the second half of 2019 with on top of it, a recycled packaging. Luxcos benefits from the expertise of the IL Cosmetics Group when it comes to studies and consumer panels. ""For mascaras, volume still stands as the most expected and desired parameter and each consumer has a definition of its own. Tastes vary from one market to the other and from one profile to the other. One of the challenges for formulators is to design samples which are representative of this diversity,"" observed Aurélie Ignaccolo. Driven by performances, Inspired by You, also seems to be the path of the winning strategy to follow for Luxcos, by only offering technologies in line with consumer expectations."

"""Make-up is turning green and increasingly efficient,"" Luisa Oliva","Premium Beauty News - How the colour cosmetics category is transforming itself? Luisa Oliva - We can see that natural is a key concept in make-up formulations today. As seen at the in-cosmetics Global tradeshow, which was held in Paris last in April, a more sustainable approach is being developed all throughout the ingredients portfolios. Companies are moving into natural products with a focus on efficiency. The innovations allow for extreme results and high performances of the finish product. Premium Beauty News - As far as ingredients are concerned, what were the main innovations showcased at in-cosmetics Global? Luisa Oliva - Some ingredients improve make-up formulations and other make them more sustainable, such as Seppic's Hydralixir. The company has extracted cellular water from a collection of algae collected in Brittany, France. The algae are already engaged in an existing industrial exploitation, their water is extracted using a gentle drying and energy-saving technology. This clean water allows to lower the carbon footprint in cosmetics. Stéarinerie Dubois has developed esters that offer a natural alternative to non-volatile silicones (DUB OE HP for D5 et DUB So Green for Dimethicone) under the INCIs: ethyl oleate and ethyl olivate. They offer good spreading and boost formula emolience and also boost hydration with a silicon like feel on the skin. Myoshi Europe has developed a film forming agent from plant origin. It offers high adhesion and flexibility with high hydrophobicity. Compatible with most usual oils compounds, it also improves colour dispersion. It is Cosmos Organic Ecocert certified. Clariant's Plantasens Flash 80 [1] is a lightweight emollient, fast spreading, very satin. It's an alternative to light emollient such as D5 to give weightless textures. Ideal for skin care, hair care, make up, deodorant. Naturex showcased Natcolor [2] a range of natural colorants and pigments extracted from plants, with colours ranging from Red, Orange, Yellow, Brown, Green, Pink to Black. Premium Beauty News - As far as formulations are concerned, you also identified several interesting innovations at MakeUp in Los Angeles and Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna? Luisa Oliva - Innovation in this area is propelled by sub-contractors such as Intercos. The Italian leading supplier of makeup formulations has developed a 3D powder, using their in-house Prisma technology. Dubbed Obsession Highlighter the product contains a high level of nacre providing it with very soft and interesting sensorial features. It is very smooth and creamy even in a 3D for a press powder. Visually speaking, nacre helps to highlight the 3D shape of the product. Intercos has also developed a patented lip stick with a 3D effect surface featuring several geometrical effects with a creamy texture. The technology offers an infinite range of possible shapes. As far as lipsticks are concerned, Weckerle has also developed a new technology allowing the insertion of 3D effect inside the lipstick within three different layers. It means you can have up to five different colours or textures in a single lipstick. The lipstick has two concentric layers on the outside and three layers on the inside. The 3D effect appears inside the lipstick while using it. A new jumbo stick for the eyes with metallic effect was also developed by Weckerle. It offers a long lasting and intense effect in a very cream and light formula. Beukay showed a peel-off eyeliner with a nacre topcoat. While the eyeliner has dried, the nacre top-coat can be applied, with more or less intensity depending on the application. IL Cosmetics launched two innovations for make-up removers. A lip-tint remover that helps removing all traces of colour. Indeed, tinting products have a long-lasting and dry effect that can prove hard to remove. The remover which comes with a lip-applicator helps gently dissolve any colour on the lips. The Luxembourg-based company has also launched a waterproof-mascara-remover. It is applied on the lashes with a specific brush and is easily removed with a cotton pad. It gently cares for the eyes while removing sticky formulas. Premium Beauty News - Ethical beauty is also a rising trend, isn't it? Luisa Oliva - Yes, in particular when we speak about clean, natural and vegan beauty. Pascual Cosmétiques, for instance, has developed a lipstick only featuring so-called ""clean ingredients"". It has a smooth texture and easy application and offers great sensorial characteristics. The formula is claimed to be free from silicones and without ingredients derived from petroleum. Ancorotti has launched a lip marker (actually a long-lasting lipstick) with an intense colour in a vegan formula. Faber Castell has launched Pure and Pure2 Beauty its own clean cosmetics seals which guarantee that the textures are formulated without identified controversial ingredients PLUS vegan and natural, and free from D5, silicones, Fragrance, etc. The range of 12 different colour cosmetic pencils, with high performance and rich pigments, is designed for the eyes and the lips."

Alkos launches bio-based cellulose-made pencils,"The latest edition of the Cosmopack tradeshow, which was held in Bologna, Italy, on 14-17 March 2019, was strongly shaped by the green revolution which has taken the cosmetics industry by storm over the last few months. In this context, the Alkos Group presented a brand new technological innovation consisting of cellulose pencils made from recycled paper fibres. ""An ecological alternative to plastic of course but also to wood, a natural resource to protect,"" explains Alkos. According to the French manufacturer, these pencils made of up to 95% bio-based materials can be sharpened as easily as wood or plastic pencils while being compostable and recyclable. For optimal durability, they can be combined with a biobased or recycled plastic cap. In terms of formulation the main advantage is that these cellulose-made pencils can be filled with either 100% natural formulas or long-lasting waterproof formulas requiring an airtight container. Concretely, Alkos proposes three typologies of different formulas for these pencils: – Natural Beauty, natural and/or organic formulas (Cosmos Organic certification), – Natural Smooth Intensity, natural formulas with intense pay off, – Mad Matte, long lasting waterproof formulas. All these formulas are available for the eyes, eyebrows and lips. As far as customization is concerned, two shades of cellulose tubes are available, black or raw. All the possibilities of decoration of the outside of the pencil are available and the cap can also be customized on demand. ""It's a true innovative solution for a sustainable and ecological recycling,"" highlights Laura Mariani, Marketing Manager of the Alkos Group."
"With ModiFace, L'Oréal wants to bring digital tools into daily beauty routines","L'Oréal is not the first beauty company to launch a skin diagnostic tool, but with Vichy SkinConsultAI, the new application deployed by the French giant's dermo-cosmetic brand, no need for dedicated electronic sensors: a mere selfie is enough! And it is well known that where new digital tools are concerned, simplicity, ease of deployment and wide access are key factors of success. Designed for Asian, Caucasian and Afro-American users, the new diagnostic tool is capable of predicting and addressing visual aging signs. The tool functions via a three-step process that involves users provide a selfie before the technology detects aging signs such as under-eye wrinkles, lack of firmness, fine lines, lack of radiance, dark spots, deep wrinkles and pores. These signs are then analysed, before users are given a tailored suggested skincare routine. The development is based on 15 years of L'Oréal scientific research regarding skin aging. It uses a series of 'skin aging atlases' and an AI-powered algorithm developed by ModiFace, as well as a photo database of 6000 clinical images. The skin diagnostic is behind the 'Vichy SkinConsultAI' that launched in Canada in January and is scheduled to be rolled out on the brand's websites globally later this year. ""For the first time, this technology allows all women to obtain a personal diagnostic to better understand their skin aging and to find a skincare routine tailor-made for them,"" said Myriam Bekkar-Schneider, Vichy General Manager. Earlier this month, L'Oréal and ModiFace also unveiled a 'Virtual Shade Selector' tool that uses personalized technology to recommend different shades to consumers in just one minute and can be used both in-store or online, via smartphone or computer. The launch follows the announcement of a similar tool for L'Oréal Professionel in January. In both cases, the results are calculated by taking into account each user's current hair colour, level of grey, and desired finished look. The tool is being piloted by Walmart at ten US locations this month, before coming to select Wakefern and Meijer stores in March and heading to ten Walgreens stores in June. Since acquiring ModiFace last year, L'Oréal has also harnessed the technology to test out virtual makeup application via Facebook, offering users the chance to 'try out' cosmetics from some of its best-known brands, including Maybelline, L'Oréal Paris, NYX Professional Makeup, Lancôme, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Urban Decay, and Shu Uemura. ""With the acquisition of ModiFace, we have started a second phase of L'Oréal's digital transformation, focused on reinventing the beauty experience through technologies such as voice, AR and AI,"" said Lubomira Rochet, Chief Digital Officer of L'Oréal. ""We believe that services will be the new gateways for discovering our brands and products."" However, L'Oréal is far from being the only beauty company manipulating AR and AI technologies to improve the consumer's experience. In January, the Coty-owned brand Wella Professionals unveiled a new AR-enabled 'Smart Mirror' at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2019, which allows users to virtually test out different hair colours with live results, incorporating Perfect Corp's AR and AI technologies. Clairol has also been getting in on the act, launching a Google Assistant tool for Google Home last year that is designed to guide consumers through the at-home colouring process."
Beauty Tech: The latest innovations from CES 2019,"Smart mirrors made a big impression at this show. CareOS, a Baracoda Group Company, announced at Las Vegas the launch of Artemis, a smart mirror integrated with the patent-pending CareOS platform that connects health, beauty and wellness for a holistic view of each user. More than 50 IoT [1] devices, products and services are integrated into the CareOS platform including major brands such as Coty's Wella Professionals, Group SEB, Legrand, Roca, and IoT leaders like Snips and Terraillon. Also at CES, CareOS and Coty have unveiled the Wella Professionals augmented reality enabled smart mirror, which is powered by Artemis for a revolutionary salon hair colour experience. Powered by the existing CareOS operating system and incorporating Perfect Corp's YouCamMakeup augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Wella's new mirror uses facial recognition technology to retrieve archived looks, and features a 360° video element to let clients view their hair from all angles. Furthermore, the smart mirror lets clients and stylists keep in touch via a connected app in between visits. AR has had an enormous impact on the beauty industry over the past few years, with multiple brands such as ModiFace and YouCam driving the increase in connected solutions and devices. Last November saw Modiface unveil a 'Virtual Nail Salon' app that lets users virtually test out 30 different nail polish shades, while YouCam and Eylure teamed up earlier in the year to test out an augmented reality (AR) makeup experience focusing on false eyelashes. At the CES 2019, Perfect Corp, the developer of the YouCam MakeUp app, has unveiled a ""Beauty 3.0"" vision that will allow users to personalize their platforms in real time using artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. The update will mean users could soon use the app to get recommended foundation shades that match their skin tones perfectly, for example, or track dermatological concerns over time. Other options include complex live virtual makeup trials (such as ombré hair color makeovers) and on-demand beauty consultations with professionals. Cosmetic giants also went big on connected beauty at the show. For its first participation, Procter & Gamble introduced multiple new connected devices from several of its brands, including an artificial intelligence Skin Advisor platform for Olay. For its part, L'Oréal has unveiled My Skin Track pH for its brand La Roche-Posay. The sensor offers users a personalized measure of their skin pH levels, which can, in some cases, be responsible for conditions such as eczema, dryness or atopic dermatitis. The wearable works by using microfluidic technology to capture trace amounts of sweat from the pores on a patch of skin on the inner arm. Betting on personalisation, Neutrogena has launched the MaskiD app allowing users to get fully customized 3D-printed face masks, by giving them an accurate assessment of their skincare needs and facial measurements via the TrueDepth camera on the iPhone X, XS, and XR. This year again, French start-ups were well represented at CES with many innovations in the beauty sector. Artiris unveiled Compoz, a composer of bespoke home fragrances. The device can charge up to five interchangeable scented capsules and is controlled from a touch screen. Already showcased in Paris at VivaTech, BeautyMix builds on the DIY trend and offers a small mixer and accessories to make natural cosmetics at home. Litica Labs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of France-based Officinea laboratory, has created Beautylitic, an app allowing retailers to analyse the composition of all their entire personal care portfolio. The system is inspired by the beauty apps developed for consumers. The algorithms propose an analysis of the current referencing and suggest improvements taking into account the new expectations of the consumers."
SK-II brings futuristic 'phygital' beauty store to CES,"P&G's prestige beauty brand has showcased its 'Future X Smart Store' at the Las Vegas show, which opened its doors on 08-11 January. The retail concept was initially launched in Tokyo, Shanghai and Singapore last year. The store concept relies on 'phygital' retail experiences that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to take shoppers on a digital in-store journey, beginning with a reading of their facial expressions and movements at a large-scale digital wall called 'The Art of You.' The wall generates different energy lines and colours with every facial movement or twitch, creating a unique artistic image for each user. Next up is a revamped version of the brand's signature 'Magic Ring' skin analysis, which, unlike regular facial analysis, is carried out digitally and remotely by an interactive screen that scans the face and displays the results. A 'Smart Beauty Bar' offers advice and personalized product browsing, while a projection mapping table that tracks hand motions allows shoppers to add goods to their digital carts with a wave. ""Emerging technologies such as AI and facial recognition allow us to challenge existing retail norms and share our brand experience in the way that is the most meaningful to our consumer,"" said Sandeep Seth, Vice President, Global SK-II. ""She can experience our products and learn about her skin at her own pace without being watched, judged or pressured. Our journey with the Future X Smart Store is not about replacing humans with tech, but supplementing to create a better and more meaningful shopping experience for our consumers."" SK-II is one of multiple beauty brands focusing on incorporating innovative technologies into the in-store retail experience. Makeup brand Covergirl's new flagship store in New York, which opened in November, is one such example: the boutique features a 'virtual greeter' powered by artificial intelligence, who directs shoppers to their favourite products, as well as an 'augmented reality glam station' that lets consumers virtually try on lipstick and eyeshadow before digitally sharing the result with friends. Meanwhile, August saw the French brand L'Occitane en Provence open the doors to a New York flagship of its own, complete with an in-store 'rain shower' sink and an interactive skincare consultation area, aimed at producing user-generated content for social media."
Procter & Gamble goes big on connected beauty for CES 2019,"Connected beauty products are fast becoming the cosmetics and wellness industry's hottest new trend, and Procter & Gamble is doubling down on the concept. For its first participation in the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the personal care and lifestyle giant is presenting six innovations across its beauty, health and skincare portfolio. First up is skincare brand Olay's new 'Skin Advisor' platform, which uses artificial intelligence to offer users personal skincare consultations and advice. Prestige skincare brand SK-II also has a new concept up its sleeve, in the form of the 'Future X Smart Store' concept, which will offer ""phygital"" experiences for in-store shoppers, via techniques such as facial recognition and digital diagnostics. Another of P&G's major skincare launches is the 'Opté Precision Skincare System' — a single device featuring camera optics, proprietary algorithms and printing technology to scan the complexion and detect hyperpigmentation. It can even be used to apply exact quantities of corrective serum to the face. In the health and hygiene sector, the company is set to unveil an 'Oral-B Genius X' artificial intelligence toothbrush that offers personalized feedback on brushing techniques, and a GilletteLabs 'Heated Razor' that warms up in under a second for a more comfortable shaving experience. Eventually, P&G is rolling out a new room-freshening device called Airia. The smart home fragrance system uses ink-jet technology and can be managed with a smartphone app. ""We're innovating faster than ever, combining more than 180 years of capability with the entrepreneurial spirit of a lean startup,"" said P&G Chief Research, Development and Innovation Officer, Kathy Fish, in a statement. ""As consumers are changing, so are we. What remains the same is our focus on deeply understanding how consumers live, work and play so we know precisely what they want."" The Cincinnati-headquartered group is not the only corporation focusing on connected beauty for CES 2019 — earlier this week, skincare brand Neutrogena unveiled a personalized face mask app that will make its debut at the show, while L'Oréal is introducing La Roche-Posay 'My Skin Track pH', the first-ever wearable microfluidic sensor to measure skin pH levels, which complete the brand's range of wearable devices."
BGene produces wood-based fragrant molecules for the perfume industry,"Initially a micro-organism specialist, the BGene company chose to turn towards wood joint products to launch a new molecule production solution. ""We identify in nature itself the bacterium that can transform wood molecules into the molecule the customer expects,"" sums up Marie-Gabrielle Jouan, President of BGene. The metabolism of micro-organisms or bacteria helps them assimilate carbon to multiply and/or produce. It is a fermentation process of the bacterium. ""Our bacterial system shelters the enzymes that can make wood carbon accessible to it and transform it to multiply, but also to produce molecules of interest, in particular aroma and fragrance precursors,"" explains the scientist. This solution is possible for a multitude of different molecules: each molecule has its own solution. Some bacteria can produce several molecules or families of molecules. This almost unique biotechnology associated with wood is aimed at meeting the naturalness expectations of players in the perfume and cosmetics industry. ""Today, this naturalness is recognized due to carbon dosage. We actually do biotechnological synthesis: 100% of our carbons are natural, since they are derived from wood,"" confirms Marie-Gabrielle Jouan. Above all, this disruptive sourcing innovation offsets the high cost of natural plant extraction and ensures production continuity. ""In the perfume sector, you need to grow plants in fields to get an odorous molecule, but these are fields that could be used for cultivating food. Extraction itself is very polluting and little profitable. Besides, production is subject to climatic variations, so resources can fluctuate, and so can prices."" Already in touch with the main industry players seduced by this innovation, BGene, a company that counts 14 employees, 80% of whom are scientists, satisfies customer demand, but they have also been developing their own ingredient family in the field of aromas and perfumes. The 2017 fundraising campaign should help accelerate the new product launch."
Skin microbiome is set to revolutionise dermatology,"As new clinical data transpires to support the role of the skin microbiome in common conditions from acne and eczema to dandruff and skin allergies, Pharmaceutical Researchers and Cosmetic Formulators alike are turning their attention to designing and testing products that contain live bacteria, bacterial extracts or prebiotic and postbiotic ingredients to manipulate the skins microbiota.

Can Artificial Intelligence make more unique fragrances than a human nose?,"Richard Goodwin, along with his research team at IBM and global flavor and fragrance producer, Symrise, ""created an AI system that can learn about formulas, raw materials, historical success data and industry trends"" bringing perfumers intelligent machine-learning apprentices. Globally speaking, this can save master perfumers time to perfect a fragrance rather than searching for new combinations. The project was built upon previously done company research that used artificial intelligence to pair flavors and create recipes combined with the more recent Research AI for Product Composition. As a result, a new system using advanced machine learning algorithms to comb through enormous databases of formulas and materials to recognize patterns and new mixtures was conceived. This system, called Philyra, is used to, ""design entirely new fragrance formulas by exploring the entire landscape of fragrance combinations to discover the whitespaces in the global fragrance market."" Such a method can be applied to various fields of fragrance from fine fragrances, home care, and beauty care. All these categories require very specific scents based on various fragrance families (like floral, fruity, or musky), especially fine fragrances which are considered works of art. The information that the AI analyzes can then be used to develop fragrances for incredibly specific markets like, as Goodwin used as an example, for Brazilian millennials. The algorithms used by Philyra span four main categories: raw material complements and substitutes, raw material dosage, human responses, and novelty level of the composition. With each of these taken into account, Symrise's Philyra successfully designed two perfumes for O Boticario. The first fragrances created by an AI are expected to go on sale next year in Brazil. Before committing these fragrances to the market, however, the initial formulas... were tweaked by a master perfumer to emphasize a certain note and improve how long it lasted on the skin. ""This effort brings together human expertise with machine intelligence to create novel, fine fragrances. Philyra's understanding of consumer preferences and knowledge of formulas and ingredients, led to new fragrance combinations, which allowed our perfumers to accelerate the creative design process and focus on perfecting the final products,"" said Alexandre Bouza, Marketing Director, O Boticario. ""Advances in AI are helping us introduce unique, new fragrances to our customers. We are very excited to be part of this collaboration with Symrise and IBM Research."" Once perfecting the algorithms used for creating fine fragrances, Philyra can be modified to other, less luxurious, fields of fragrances like laundry detergents, shampoos, or basically any other beauty or cleaning product we use. Fragrance is integrated into basically every aspect the human experience. As Goodwin wrote, ""the art and science of designing a winning perfume is something humans have explored for hundreds of years,"" which means perfumers have hundreds of years of fragrances to sift through. With a machine by their side, perfumers can focus on the art and human experience behind a fragrance, rather than trying to find a novel composition."
"Hackathon LVMH: ""We want to help new generations emerge,"" Marc-Antoine Jamet","Premium Beauty News - This year's competition was unique in that it imposed a finished product created in 3D. How did it go? Marc-Antoine Jamet - This year was more complex than expected. We had three main difficulties. The first was the theme: the idea was to deliver something concrete with a prototype, which is much more difficult than delivering an idea. As a result, the challenge also involved learning how to use prototyping tools, i.e. the software and the printer. Lastly, we had very high expectations as regards environmental protection. The award went to the team that managed to streamline the process, but generally speaking, once again, I am astonished at the work everyone did in four days: they did not know each other the day before and they teamed up to deliver really great work. Premium Beauty News - How would you sum up the 2018 Hackathon Maker? Marc Antoine Jamet - The strength of Hackathon lies in the youth it puts forward. These young people face a jury of professionals happy to work in a different context. There is this notion of knowledge transmission and preparation for the future, this will to support and create new emerging generations. Premium Beauty News - What about next year? Marc Antoine Jamet - I think we will go back to a blend of nationalities within the teams, just like we did in 2017. We could not do it this year due to the 3D software and printer training: we needed French participants. But global participation creates interesting dynamics. In 2019, I want to open the competition to creative freedom, not restrain it."
Samplicity aims to make beauty samples enter new era,"Since October 11, the samplicity.co platform offers its community cosmetic product samples for free (perfumes, face care products, makeup…). ""We target a public interested in beauty and willing to test a perfume, a skincare product, a foundation… before making a quick purchase online,"" explains Valérie Jacob, the start-up founder. Samplicity aims to revolutionize the world of websites specialized in product testing. Far from deceptive e-mail pumps, the platform is designed to offer customers an integral medium for them to create a communication and sampling campaign and give value to direct consumer connection in a secure environment that guarantees brand image and preserves personal data. ""We know that for brands, the world in which their products are distributed is certainly not a trivial matter. The same should go for samples. So, we mainly aim to offer brands a new digital medium dedicated to beauty, where they can communicate with a community that is qualified in their worlds, tell a story about the product, add a tutorial, a video, and create a real experience when customers discover the sample, i.e. the product. We connect the sample with brands' communication campaigns, whereas apart from press distribution, which is more massive, but anonymous, it was a bit neglected until now, due to the lack of an adequate solution,"" explains Valérie Jacob. Contrary to the solution retailers usually choose, you receive the sample before you make a purchase, so it plays its ""testing"" role more than its ""gift"" role. To Valérie Jacob, the idea is to ""help brands regain control of sample distribution, as samples do represent a significant cost for them, both in the development and production phases."" If all studies converge in that they highlight the major role samples play as a means to make consumers buy cosmetics, too many brands struggle to control their distribution, not to mention their use. Samplicity offers brands a comprehensive, customizable service, from digital campaign creation and management to sample shipment to the members, and from communication and SEO referencing to, of course, campaign return analyses. But above all, Samplicity is intended to help their partners better understand consumer expectations and motivations. ""Samples represent a gateway, a starting point to get to know consumers even better,"" emphasizes Valérie Jacob. Based on the data collected through website connections and product feedback from members, the platform's sophisticated algorithms decipher consumers' virtual and real-life behaviours and create a new segmentation based on emotions and motivations. One of the objectives is to go beyond generational communication, because it is too often ill-adapted to new consumption patterns. ""The power of emotions is being rediscovered in all sectors. We designed Samplicity as a showcase to draw consumers' emotional attention and make it possible for them to try beauty freely!"" concludes Valérie Jacob.

Fragrance Innovation Summit: Paris shakes up the perfume category,"With consumers increasingly eager for new experiences, the pace of new launches keeps speeding up and new brands have emerged, supported by distributors trying to stand out. New concepts have been created and distributors themselves are starting to take control, as can be seen with the partnership between H&M and Givaudan. High perfumery needs to remain attractive, but it is increasingly compelled to surprise and penetrate unexpected territories. New ingredients, new notes, new applicators, new textures, new functions: brands, suppliers, and distributors have been methodically exploring these multiple avenues for innovation. In keeping with the event organized last year, the 2018 Fragrance Innovation Summit to be held next October 25 in Paris will provide an overview of the major market trends, the latest innovations, and the emerging technologies, as well as testimonies of professionals. The presentation agenda was deliberately reduced to focus on the essentials. Ultimately, philosopher and essayist Gilles Lipovetsky will put new consumer expectations in perspective in a world marked by hyper-seduction. Discover the whole day's agenda and join us to imagine the future of perfumery together. Detailed programme and registrations: here A Premium Beauty News event, in partnership with the Fragrance Foundation France and NEZ la revue."
Cosmetic 360 to highlight research & innovation,"Cosmetic 360 is characterized by an approach based on innovation, the key condition for any exhibitor to take part in the event. Just like when it all started, every innovation will be materialized by a totem display on all stands, and expert paths will guide visitors within each area of application. ""This event embodies the Cosmetic Valley, as it highlights the importance of Research and Innovation across the whole industry. It also positions France as the place where investors, start-ups, and SMEs from all around the world come and meet each other. I will not reveal any details, but overall, I can say that this year, there will be multiple innovations in connected beauty, naturalness, and fast prototyping. We will talk about bioprinting of skin, plastic, or other materials,"" announces Christophe Masson, CEO of the Cosmetic Valley, the organisation behind the event. The zone created in 2017 is an attractive feature of the show. It gathers 30 start-ups and will offer new animations this year: – The Studio, a specific action initiated by the Coty group, will materialize the attending start-ups' answers to the greatest industrial cosmetics challenges through interviews – a way to provide an immediate perspective on the different technologies showcased focusing on tomorrow's needs. – The Start-Up Solution Area designed by Beauty Tech Chartres will act as a transient accelerator for two days. It is intended for all visitors willing to create their own company and will provide support in the form of ten experts, workshops, and conferences to get a more concrete vision of each project. Just like every year, several leading groups will settle in a specific area as prime manufacturers. Johnson & Johnson, Les Laboratoires Pierre Fabre, L'Oréal, LVMH Research, Puig, Rodan + Field, and Yves Rocher will be able to meet project managers that have submitted an application as part of the Open Innovation, so that they can exchange and even set up new partnerships. Over 200 qualified events will take place over the two days of the show. And this year, this feature will be accessible to distribution companies, so that young brands can meet the global QVC network in search of French jewels to distribute. To complete these different paths, the TechCorner animated by CNRS will put forward a new emulsion manufacturing process still under study. ""The idea is to show how these processes still in the phase of academic research will impact tomorrow's plants,"" explains Christophe Masson. As for historic partner Greentech, they will put an emphasis on a challenge intended to finance an action for the economic development of Burkina-Faso. The global dimension of the event should also be highlighted: it counts over 30% of foreign exhibitors and hosts the global meeting of the Cosmetic Clusters International Network. Japan Beauty will be in the spotlight this year, in the presence of the Japan Cosmetic Center, which gathers ten Japanese companies as part of an animation programme set up by Shiseido. Sponsored by LVMH, this year, this new challenge intended for young professionals and students will be focused on the design of a ""new, sustainable product inspired by nature in the era of experience."" Hackathon Maker, as it is called, will offer participants the possibility to go beyond the formalization of an idea by developing its prototyping. ""Launched last year, the Hackathon embodies our will to make this show more than an exhibition: a moment to create innovation. Participants will start working in teams two days before it opens and will print their projects at the show with the 3D printer available to all. The projects will be presented to a jury, but also to the visitors,"" adds Christophe Masson. The different LVMH brands will play the role of mentors for the participants, Dassault Systèmes will make their CATIA software available for 3D design, and ID3P will provide the high resolution printer. A €4,000 prize will reward the winning team at the end of the second day."
Schwan Cosmetics launches a ceramic case for luxury pencils with premium textures,"In the wake of the launch of Perfect - the first wooden case pencils that can store premium formulations - the German designer and manufacturer of cosmetic pencils - continues on its drive for innovation with the launch of the Treasure Collection, a range of make-up applicators featuring premium textures in exclusive ceramic designs. ""Ceramic combines a unique, cool surface with an elegant appearance and ensures a pleasant feel and maximum break resistance,"" explains Schwan Cosmetics. The Treasure Collection is currently available in the colors black and white, in an elegantly shiny or soft matte finish. The decor can be individually adapted, whether as embossing with a seductive feel, laser engraving, or screen printing. With such features, the Treasure Collection could soon become a must-have for brands from the premium sector. But the customization can go even further. As the ceramic cases are based on a so-called platform concept, the design of the ceremaic can be optimally tailored to the customer's needs and brand DNA. Indeed, the ceramic design is attached on a plastic master and can therefore take the shape desired by the brand. The successful new product ""The InLiner"" - the liquid eyeliner with an innovative wheel applicator - was selected for the launch of the Treasure Collection. Other products are already being planned and will also be available in ceramic. ""With the Treasure Collection, we are offering cosmetic and even non-industry brands an absolutely high-quality, customized product for their premium segment,"" explains Dagmar Chlosta, Chief Market Officer at Schwan Cosmetics. ""The customer can work with us to create their very own individual product design, tailored to their brand and needs. The shape of the cosmetic pencil can also be changed as desired."""
Show review: A broad range of innovations at MakeUp in NewYork,"Just like for the Paris edition last June, MakeUp in NewYork teamed up with trend intelligence group Beautystreams to launch the ColorWave space, providing insight into the shades that we can expect to see influencing the colour palettes of future makeup launches. The show also played host to conferences on hot topics of the moment, such as the growing importance of indie brands in North America, or the blurring border between skin care and make-up products. As far as innovations are concerned, most packaging makers and product suppliers have presented several new launches. Here is a short selection: – The Alkos Group highlighted Superstamp, pencil for coloured and fragranced tattoo stamps, and Body Butter Stick, a body moisturizer on a stick featuring a rich and ultra-soft texture. – Asquan has introduced several new ranges of packaging, including: Frame, a series of very instagramable packages inspired by minimalist architecture, Solace, which combines simplicity and elegance, or Press Play, which features post-modern pastel shades, and Dark and Dangerous, with transparent effects. – Axilone USA has highlighted its ability to control the use of glitters for decorating packaging, both in terms of number, size and distribution. – Faber-Castell Cosmetics presented their latest ready-to-market concept Universal Beauty which is targeted to all beauty lovers.

Schwan Cosmetics creates airtight wooden pencils,"""As the inventor of the wooden cosmetics pencils, we are extremely excited to create yet another first in the industry. We thereby enlarge our portfolio of eco-friendly products with a new line of high performing formulas in wood pencils – a collection that will undoubtedly resonate with today's consumers,"" said Dagmar Chlosta, Chief Market Officer at Schwan Cosmetics. Thanks to a new technological process that is kept secret, wooden pencils are made airtight and can thus contain formulas with volatile compounds. So far, it was impossible to fill these formulas in anything else than plastic containers. According to Schwan Cosmetics, it is a real leap forward for the environment. High performing ingredients, never used before in a wooden pencil, and enabling long lasting and waterproof formulas, can now be used to produce a brand new and unique product range featuring sustainable pencils made of renewable wood! A good way to reduce the use of plastics and to meet current expectations of consumers. In addition, Schwan Cosmetics' ""Perfect"" collection also features high concentration of pure pigments creating an intense colour pay-off. A highlight in itself is also the innovative ""worry-free"" safety-lock cap introduced by Schwan Cosmetics for this collection. Its special design makes it possible to close a wooden pencil airtight for the first time. Thus, the cap will never fall and will keep the formula fresh. ""The safety cap also avoids any accidental opening when transporting the pencil in a purse or a make-up bag. A novelty that will be praised by consumers,"" explains Sonia Huneau, Public Relation Manager at Schwan Cosmetics. The ""Perfect"" range includes and eyeliner, that also be used as a kajal (the super soft formula lasts up to 18 hours as eyeliner and up to 15 hours as kajal), a brow liner (with a gel-gliding waterproof formula that can be colourless or highly pigmented and lasts up to 24 hours), a lipliner (with a no feathering formula that lasts up to 12 hours)."
Texen: A new benefit-oriented turnkey mascara offer,"In 50 years, mascara has become the most commonly used makeup product the world over. Consumers are increasingly demanding of a perfect makeup result, and make no concessions. Brands are therefore seizing each opportunity to swiftly launch the most competitive products. Whether their chosen product promise is to boost volume or lash length or for a long-lasting result, such claims are built on a subtle combination of brush, wiper and formula. To address the demand for shorter time to market, Texen has chosen to go beyond packaging production or sourcing to launch a consistent and ready to customize offer. ""This new mascara collection is designed for the needs of a market increasingly looking for speed. We have created a complete offer with specific benefit claims,"" explains Émilie Bleton, Marketing and Innovation Director at Texen. After extensive sourcing work and thorough consumer tests in collaboration with a top network of experts, Texen elaborated its mascara collection to be the most relevant possible for the market. Texen Innovation then selected the most promising makeup results. Based on this turnkey offer, Texen can then add its own packaging solution. ""The idea was to develop mascaras like a brand would have done, with the aim to make products ready to be launched on the market. Offering a turnkey solution is meaningful only when the outcome is a comprehensive product,"" says Aïmara Coupet, marketing and makeup development consultant. ""As far as mascaras are concerned, there is a very high need for performance because clients are very demanding,"" she adds. Texen offers a total of eight mascaras, two fibre brush mascaras and six injected brush mascaras, with formulas originating from Europe, for benefits such as application accuracy, volume, long-lasting, or curly. With this ""ready-to-wear"" mascara offer with guaranteed product efficacy, Texen wants to offer significant time savings to its customers. Indeed, product development time can be dedicated entirely to packaging personalization. It's worth to be noted that to fastly meet beauty to go expectations, 12ml packs have already been designed. ""Texen's teams will put their expertise to work for their customers to develop either 100% standard or fully bespoke projects depending on the constraints of time-to-market and budget,"" says the company. With such targeted makeup results, Texen is engaging in a ""B2B2C"" strategy, in order to offer agile turnkey solutions while reducing costs and time to market. A revolution for this historical packaging player, which has been able to reinvent itself to meet a changing market!"
Cosmogen and Pylote launch innovative antimicrobial makeup tools,"Cosmogen, a leading European developer and supplier of cosmetic brushes, accessories and packaging is partnering with Pylote, a start-up offering an innovative microbial protection technology. Founded in 2009 by two researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Pylote has developed a green process for manufacturing mineral microspheres that can be integrated into many consumer products, without any change of the existing manufacturing process. These microspheres have the particularity of providing products with-specific properties including an increased microbial cleanliness and hygiene throughout their use by the consumer. The microspheres are obtained through an innovative patented and exclusive green manufacturing process (spray pyrolysis) in one single step without any organic solvent or waste. It has won several awards (Pharmapack Award, CPhl Pharma Award, Packaging Award, CSR Solutions Award). It is also COSMOS approved and in compliance with international cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food regulations. One of its main interest of Pylote's mineral microspheres is that they do not release any substance in the products' formulas. After having conducted industrial tests and assessed the effectiveness of this innovation on foams, brush fibres and plastic spatulas, Cosmogen is launching innovative ranges of more hygienic, safer and greener accessories and makeup applicators, made of antibacterial materials. ""This partnership with Pylote fits a key objective for consumers, whose demand for hygienic, safe and healthy products is growing strongly,"" said Cosmogen's CEO, Renaud van den Berg. Most importantly, according to the manager, it is a ""realistic, industrial, reliable and value-added solution."" Indeed, cosmetic accessories and applicators are examples of high-risk products in terms of microbial contamination during use. This contamination poses a risk for consumers and is a source of concern to manufacturers in the cosmetics industry. To address this issue, Cosmogen successfully integrated Pylote's microspheres on the industrial production lines of many accessories and applicators (sponges, brushes, spatulas, etc.). Tests have demonstrated that the microbial population contained in the accessories (lower count than the quantification threshold) was totally eradicated. ""I am delighted that our innovative technology made in France can benefit all players in the cosmetics industry, and primarily consumers. The blend of our expertise with that of Cosmogen is a leap forward in providing solutions that are today fully operational, responsible and safe, while having an immediate impact of safety and comfort for consumers,"" added Pylote's CEO, Loïc Marchin. The innovative cosmetic accessories developed by Cosmogen with Pylote's technology were featured last week at the MakeUp in Paris tradeshow."
A generator of scented clouds that renews the olfactory discovery,"Originally developed for a major French brand, the generator integrates a technology that diffuses an olfactory cloud using only the perfume concentrate (without the alcohol contained in the formula). ""Nowadays, this system is one of the most faithful way to transcribe a perfume and it passes the tests of the most advised noses,"" says Julie Gesnouin, Byzance's Associate Founder. ""When you test a perfume on a blotter, there are always olfactory interferences."" In practice, the system is based on a mix of pure perfumed concentrate mixed with dipropylene glycol in proportions that vary depending on the fragrance and the desired cloud volatility. ""The cloud thus created may be more or less volatile according to marketing requirements. We can also control the release time and add LEDs to colour the cloud,"" details Julie Gesnouin. And the cloud does not trigger smoke detectors! The development of the blend is validated with the brand and requires about a month. Byzance has carried out numerous tests to assess the safety of its system for the consumer health especially with regard to the inhalation of the smoke. The generator of scented clouds can be presented in a dedicated support or be duplicated in a display thus allowing the discovery of several fragrances in a raw. It can be integrated into existing counters or used as a standalone in POS. Olfactory Cloud Experience from BYZANCE on Vimeo. The cost for a brand is about 550 euros per machine. The kit of three 10 ml vials blends (allowing a total of 600 to 700 tests) costs 50 euros, but brands can manufacture them using their own filling lines. The machines can of course be reused for other fragrances. ""For the brands this incoming technology is a new alternative of olfactory discovery for their fragrances. For consumers, it's a rediscovery of how a perfume is tested. There is a real enthusiasm,"" concludes Julie Gesnouin."
Visual fragrance: IFF partners with Amkiri to boost the technology,"Amkiri, an Israeli-based start-up that was founded in 2014, has launched the Visual Fragrance technology last March. Amkiri's Visual Fragrance technology is a new 'ink' that can be drawn on the skin that also delivers a longlasting fragrance, thus connecting the senses of sight and smell. ""This is a significant innovation in the fragrance category, merging strong and deeply personal visuals with the resonance and emotion of fragrance,"" said IFF Chairman and CEO Andreas Fibig. ""The Visual Fragrance technology creates a new platform from which IFF can showcase our capabilities, including naturals, molecules, and cosmetic actives. The potential for innovative applications are nearly endless and our teams are truly inspired by the possibilities."" Amkiri's patented Visual Fragrance is applied to the skin using specially designed applicators, allowing the user to adorn themselves with individual multisensory body art. According to Amkiri, the formula is long-wearing and can work with any fragrance or colour. ""Some of the most disruptive innovations come from the start-up community — this is as true in beauty care as it is in technology,"" added Nicolas Mirzayantz, IFF Group President, Fragrances. ""This extremely emotionally engaging technology brings a very timely category innovation to the market place."" ""This partnership with IFF signals Amkiri's commitment to product excellence and establishing Visual Fragrance as a part of consumers' daily beauty regimen. The company will continue to develop more ground-breaking technologies that will continue to serve and disrupt the beauty industry,"" said David Chissick Amkiri Chairman."
"""Raw materials and ideas are the two keys to innovation in perfumery"", Maurice Roucel, Symrise","Premium Beauty News - What is your definition of your trade as a perfumer? Maurice Roucel - It is an act of creation. Just like painters mix colours or musicians mix notes, we mix smells. This act leads to a work that results from your own creative skills, inspiration, and technique. Similarly to many fields, you need to learn the technique, but creativity cannot be learnt: you have it or you don't. Premium Beauty News - Has this trade changed over the past few years, in particular from a technical standpoint? Maurice Roucel - It is a trade that is constantly evolving. Generally speaking, every new raw material, whether it be synthetic or natural, can produce a new form of creation. Technically, there are more and more synthetic molecules that are key to new fragrances. The perfume trade has also changed according to social behaviours. For example, men's perfumes have been freed: they used to be confined to woody notes, whereas you can find sweet, fruity notes now. We are heading towards an increasingly genderless style, which is also the case for women's perfumes. What was true at some point in a given country is no longer so 30 years later, in the same country or continent. Social changes impact perfumery, things are not fixed. Premium Beauty News - How can you innovate in perfumery today? Maurice Roucel - There are two ways to innovate: if you have ideas, and if you have the right raw materials to help express them. Historically, France has never been too keen on fruity, sweet notes. The perfume Angel was introduced with a new molecule, and it revolutionized the market. That is innovation. People are also more open-minded, so perfumers can better express themselves, in particular thanks to the niche market. Premium Beauty News - Is that what explains the success of the niche market, following the slowdown of traditional perfumery? Maurice Roucel - To explain this slowdown, you need to have a look at the number of launches per year. When I started, in 1973, there were 20 launches a year. Today, this figure has reached 1,700 to 2,000, with both good and bad products. It is true that perfumery has become democratic, that all the greatest brands took to the streets with a multitude of perfumes. These are not necessarily bad perfumes: the raw materials are often qualitative, but the creative quality is no longer the same. What is paradoxical is that major groups purchase niche brands at high cost, whereas they make dozens of millions with their own brands. I think these big companies encounter difficulties when it comes to developing creation, so they turn to alternative brands. Premium Beauty News - What type of perfumery do you prefer to work for? Maurice Roucel - I prefer to work with creators, people who have this passion for their trade. It is like a tennis match, you have fun when you play with someone who knows how to hit the ball back. The act of creation in perfumery is an exchange. For a perfumer, it is more interesting to work with these people that have such freedom. It is not a specificity of niche perfumery, though. It was like that when I worked with Sylvaine Delacourte for Guerlain. Premium Beauty News - You spent several years in Brazil for Symrise. Is it an interesting country in terms of perfumery raw materials? Maurice Roucel - It is a country that has a bright future due to its strong potential, but it is not a great ingredient producer for perfumery yet. There are many different fruit species, but only few perfume plants. Premium Beauty News - What can you say about the relationship between Brazilians and perfume? Maurice Roucel - Brazil is the biggest perfume consumer in the world, whether in terms of tonnage or value. They are Latins, they like wearing perfume, it is a natural gesture for them. Brazilians love powerful, heady perfumes with a long-lasting trail. They are fond of persistent fragrances."
Could 'visual fragrance' be the next big perfume trend?,"In the age of highly image-driven social media, perfumes hardly leave their mark in the mind of influencers who are spontaneously more attracted by the fast-visual effects offered by colour cosmetics. To solve the equation of the visibility of perfumes, Israel-based cosmetics company Amkiri has announced that it has developed and successfully patented a scented 'ink' infused with fragrance. The creme-like product is designed to be applied to the skin using specific applicators, allowing wearers to craft colorful body art while anointing themselves with a perfume that the brand claims lasts for up to 12 hours. According to Amkiri, the patented technology can carry any fragrance or colour and can therefore adapt to any form of skin. The concept is the brainchild of designer Shoval Shavit, entrepreneur David Chissick and chemistry expert Aliza Shavit. ""As a designer, and a very visual and expressive person, I initially came up with the notion of Amkiri for my own personal needs,"" said Shoval Shavit in a statement. ""I asked myself how I could create a fragrance that is visual? I wanted to blend makeup, tattoos and fragrances in one product."" Perfumes brands have been shaking things up in terms of fragrance formats recently - back in February, cult label Glossier put solid perfumes back on the map with the launch of a consolidated version of its ""You"" scent. Last spring saw designer Derek Lam reimagine his ""10 Crosby"" perfume line as a series of twist-up wax fragrance sticks, while Maison Margiela's portfolio includes a dry body oil. (See our article here). At the latest edition of Luxe Pack Monaco, several suppliers of packaging solutions have put forward applicators allowing to handwrite fragrances on the skin. Another challenge was to make the fragrances visible and compatible with a wide variety of colours, it is apparently what Amkiri achieved. The company is set to launch a selection of products in May, with further releases planned for later in the year."
MakeUp in Paris opens to start-ups,"Premium Beauty News - Fred Ghenassia, you proposed organizers of MakeUp in Paris 2018 to animate an area dedicated to start-ups and revolving around the world of makeup and beauty? Can you tell us more? Fred Ghenassia - Two years ago I created Open Bay a start-ups incubator. This led me to meet dozens of young companies and notice their difficulties, either to meet key players in their market, or to introduce their products or solutions. Knowing the MakeUp in Paris trade show and its organizers since its inception, I proposed them to set up an area within the show dedicated to startups. A project they welcomed with enthusiasm. Indeed, this event has always been both the initiator of very original animations and actively in tune and listening to the market. Premium Beauty News - What will be the special feature of this specific show area? Fred Ghenassia - First, I would like to recall that I have been working in the cosmetics sphere for twenty years. I have a good knowledge of this market and I know the world of startups in France quite well. My goal is twofold: enable start-ups to meet market players in an appropriate setting and conditions and give visitors the opportunity to discover innovations. The originality of my approach is a support to these companies before, during and after the show. All our team members at Open Bay are dedicated to identifying the most innovative projects, help companies introduce themselves at the show, animate the area during the two days and monitor results. Premium Beauty News - What animations will be organized at the show? Fred Ghenassia - With the organizers, we have two highlights planned on Thursday, June 21st and Friday, June 22nd. There will be a conference that will give each company the opportunity to present its concept in a few minutes. The form of these presentations will be original and fun. But be patient, I will tell you more at the kick-off of the show! Premium Beauty News - What would you be tempted to say to startups managers wishing to test this show area called Start in Make Up Paris? Fred Ghenassia - This is a unique opportunity to meet, at almost no cost, the people and companies that play a part in the make-up and beauty industry. The challenge for these start-ups managers will then be to clearly explain their concept to them, while our role will be to attract them to this area thanks to the quality of the start-ups we selected.

Chanel takes a major step with a 3D-printed mascara brush,"At a time when innovation is all about digital and virtual experiences, Chanel reminds us that industrial excellence can also lead to dramatically disruptive projects. Announcing the development and future industrial production of an innovative 3D-printed mascara brush, the brand has taken a major step in the industrial use of additive manufacturing, which was predicted several years ago to become an effective competitor to traditional production methods such as plastic injection. Chanel says it has understood the potential of 3D-printing no later than in 2001, before filing a first patent in 2007 for the manufacture of cosmetic products applicators, including a 3D-printed mascara brush. This project is about to become a reality soon with the launch of Chanel's Le Révolution Volume new mascara, whose brush is manufactured with the printing of successive layers of a polyamide powder polymerized with a laser beam. The main advantage of the 3D printing is that the technology eliminates the need to design and manufacture pricey injection moulds. The removal of this time-consuming step brings new flexibility to the whole process. Indeed, 3D printing allows manufacturing inexpensive prototypes to makes as many tests as needed to obtain the best brush-formula pair. According to Chanel, the forthcoming Le Révolution Volume mascara brush went through more than 100 rounds of trials until the final shape was validated. In order to create and industrialize this unique brush, the Packaging Innovation Department of Chanel Parfums Beauté teamed up with Erpro 3D Factory, a company specializing in big scale additive manufacturing [1]. The two companies have jointly designed a production line consisting of six machines capable of producing 50,000 brushes per 24 hours, 250,000 brushes per week, or up to 1 million brushes per month. The production, which is expected to begin in June 2018, follows a stringent process, especially as its concerns products intended to be applied in the sensitive eye area: raw material analysis, powder preparation, polymerization with the laser beam, cooling of the brushes, cleaning, rinsing, quality control and mechanical tests. Allowing a perfect reproducibility and fully mould-free, the process the subject of several patent applications. As far as the mascara's functionalities are concerned, 3D-printing also allows to produce a unique and innovative product with a specific shape that would have not been possible, according to Chanel, with the traditional production methods. In particular, the brush features: a granular texture, so as to improve how the formula adheres to lashes; micro-cavities at the core of the wand to store enough matter to pre-empt double-dipping; and a bristle-grid separated by millimetres to prevent clumping. The new step forward industrial 3D-printing paves the way for future production processes offering more freedom, more agility, more flexibility and more reactivity as well as an increased freedom to enhance brand's creativity."
L'Oréal: Another step forward for ultra-personalized skincare,"""At L'Oréal, we are poised to leverage technology to respond to the rising wave of consumer demand for personalized products and services,"" said Guive Balooch, Global Vice President of L'Oréal's Technology Incubator, in a statement. ""D.O.S.E acts like a mini skincare laboratory, combining lab grade formulation and factory grade manufacturing into a machine that sits on the counter."" Developed by L'Oréal's Technology Incubator in partnership with the group's skincare brand SkinCeuticals, D.O.S.E scans and evaluates consumers' skin needs. In the wake of this consultation, the results are transmitted to an automatic compounder machine, whose 2,000 plus algorhythms make it capable of offering multiple ingredient combinations to suit up to 250 skin types. The result is a tailor-made, corrective serum that targets skin aging issues like wrinkles, fine lines, and discoloration. The personalized serum thus produced is then adorned with a custom label that includes an expiration date and a bar code for easy reordering. Each Custom D.O.S.E evaluation takes between 3-5 minutes and the serum takes about 5 minutes to dispense. ""The D.O.S.E technology empowers skincare professionals to co-create personalized formulas that address patients' unique skincare needs on the spot, in minutes,"" said Christina Fair, General Manager of SkinCeuticals. Custom D.O.S.E is set to launch in select U.S. physician offices nationwide from this summer. The launch of D.O.S.E is a new step forward for the development of ultra-personalized cosmetic solutions in line with what the L'Oréal group already offers through Lancôme's Le Teint Particulier.

Fiabila announces new hybrid nail polish generation,"Fiabila is about to unveil a brand-new generation of hybrid nail polish at Cosmopack next March 15-18, 2018 in Bologna, Italy. ""This new nail polish can be used like standard polish, at home or in salons, but it provides absolutely breath-taking long wear and shininess results. Just like traditional nail polish, it is featured in transparent glass bottles for every shade to be seen, and is removed with acetone-free solvents,"" explains Alexandre Miasnik, Fiabila's General Manager. Hybrid nail polish was first created a few years ago. These new formulas combine the advantages of gels (or semi-permanent nail polish) and traditional nail polish. To this aim, Fiabila uses a real innovative oligomer for which they registered a patent. This resin creates a physical hardening effect thanks to a 3D molecular structure, while preserving incredible flexibility, even at high concentrations. As a result, hybrid nail polish offers much more long wear and shininess than traditional nail polish. Contrary to gels, these hybrid formulas do not require any UV lamp during the drying phase and are very easy to remove. Hybrid formula pioneer Fiabila has been working for several years on improving these products' performances to reach almost the same levels as gels, but without the drawbacks. The new generation of formulas that will be showcased in Bologna actually promises exceptional quality results confirmed by now systematic tests on external panels. ""Based on a technology we developed, we managed to get unequalled long wear and shininess results. Today, we can make our polish last a whole week with formulas containing safe raw materials, and which dry as fast as traditional nail polish. We are one step ahead and are now competing with permanent nail polish,"" emphasizes the young leader. With 40 multi-disciplinary technicians exclusively dedicated to nail polish R&D, Fiabila has made innovation and creativity two of their main strategy pillars. The company owns eleven plants around the world and undertakes to offer their customers the same quality on all markets. After two less dynamic years – although they followed a long boom –, according to the analyses of different market research agencies, including Euromonitor, the global nail polish market should record a significant growth at least until 2021 (+28%), driven by the strong dynamism of regions like South America, in particular Brazil. ""The nail polish market is very cyclical, it is stimulated by creativity and the colour and effect offering. That is why we offer two collections of 72 shades every year, and many new products and innovations on a constant basis,"" explains Alexandre Miasnik. Just like every year in Bologna, Fiabila will showcase a new collection of exclusive shades available for all their formulas (traditional or hybrid), but also a record number of new effects, many of which are definitely innovative."
ID Scent revives the perfume sample,"By incorporating the perfume into the paper fibres by air compression, the material provides an accurate, stable, homogeneous reproduction of the fragrance over several months, even years. The material remains with the consumer over time, while perpetuating an accurate expression of the perfume. ""The contact cost is quite low, since it is easier to share the soaked fragrance for an opinion or a test,"" explains Maxime Caffon, ID Scent's Associate Director. It took ten years for ID Scent, a company specialized in olfactory marketing, to develop this innovation, which combines several advantages and possibilities other than long wear. The perfume may be partially or totally applied on the material, on one or two sides, so it does not come in contact with the decoration. This detail creates multiple finishing options, like hot stamping, without any disturbance. The perfume does not harm the prints, and vice versa. Scentest is available on standard sample cardboards, but also for press samples, press kits, or mailings. All forms are possible, and more creative materials can even be used. ID Scent actually managed to use their unique know-how on other materials. The Scentwear technology makes it possible to perfume textile and also opens up possibilities with clothes, accessories, or bracelet ribbons. Lastly, at the Paris PCD show, ID Scent unveiled the latest Scentrub technology designed with composite gum for incorporating perfume directly concentrated in the product mass. Durably perfumed, the object becomes an excellent communication medium."
Alternative fragrance formats make a comeback,"Earlier this month, Glossier surprised fans with a solid version of its fragrance ""You,"" offering up the signature scent's notes of ambrette, ambrox, musk, iris root and pink pepper in a creamy, transportable form. But although the concept of a fragrance that resembles a lip balm is charmingly retro, the product's millennial pink packaging offers up a thoroughly modern twist. Last spring saw US fashion designer Derek Lam reimagine his ""10 Crosby"" perfume line as a series of twist-up wax fragrance sticks that claim to offer up to six hours of wear. Another example is Le Labo's famous ""Santal 33"" fragrance comes as an eau de parfum, a solid perfume and a practical ""liquid balm"" - which features an alcohol-free formula and can be easily rolled onto any part of the body. For the ultimate stress-free fragrance application, check out Pinrose's perfume 'petals', or towelettes. Each wipe contains exactly one dose of scent, taking away the anxiety of potentially overdoing things. If spray perfumes and solid scents aren't your thing, consider a perfumed dry body oil. Maison Margiela's 'Replica Beach Walk' fragrance is available in this format, which allows the product to absorb quickly into both the skin and hair for a natural, grease-free scent. Last but not least, Chanel recently launched the world's first cushion fragrance, a technology usually used for liquid makeup products, such as liquid foundations. The Chance Eau Tendre Delicate Fragrance Touch-Up is a limited-edition item that can fit in any handbag."
HPBioTECH relies on high hydrostatic pressure for the safety of cosmetics,"Mastering the microbiology of cosmetic formulations is a key issue to ensure their safety, which is also becoming more and more complex to achieve. On the one hand, regulations tend to limit the list of authorized preservatives and on the other, the wariness of consumers for these substances and the trend towards natural products is prompting manufacturers to look for alternatives. In addition to preservatives, ultra-high temperature (UHT) or ionization technologies (the use of which is forbidden for organic cosmetics), HPBioTECH proposes to use high hydrostatic pressures. Created in 2011 and certified as ""Young Innovative Company"", HPBioTECH is headquartered in Léognan, near Bordeaux. ""As with ionization, we treat cosmetics in their final packaging. But we only use water, it's a totally natural process which is less energy consuming than UHT,"" explained Adrien Plumecocq, R&D Engineer at HPBioTECH. ""In practice, to destroy micro-organisms, we play on several parameters, mainly pressure, temperature and the duration of the pressure applied. Due to the low amount of energy developed, processing must be optimized for each type of formula and packaging to secure the content while preserving its organoleptic properties. Among companies proposing high hydrostatic pressure technology, we are the only ones capable of inactivating bacterial spores and thus obtain a 'sterilization equivalent'."" To date, this technology is mostly used by the food industry. However, it could be of great interest to the cosmetics industry. As products are processed in their final packaging, implementing a complex and expensive system to ensure the sterility of packaging lines is no longer necessary. Moreover, the array of products that can be treated with this technology is very wide. And because it is possible to work at low temperatures, it is also possible to process fragile formulas containing sensitive ingredients. The current limitations are the ones coming from the stiffness of primary packaging. ""For pressure to be efficient it must be able to act on the formula and therefore the container must be relatively flexible. For example, treating products in a glass container is not possible,"" detailed Adrien Plumecocq. And because packagings will be subjected to high hydrostatic pressures, they also need to be perfectly sealed to prevent water from entering. Ideally, tubes should be sealed. After developing and patenting sterilization processes by means of high hydrostatic pressure, HPBioTECH wants to enter the segment of service providers specialized in high hydrostatic pressure treatment by acquiring an industrial tool. HPBioTECH will present its technology at the conference ""Translating consumption trends in innovative cosmetics"", which will take place next February 15 in Paris. [1]"
Coty launches Amazon Echo virtual beauty experience,"Dubbed 'Let's Get Ready,' the concept has been designed specifically for the Echo Show - Amazon's first Echo device with a screen - and launched in the UK this week. Using Amazon's Alexa voice service, 'Let's Get Ready' offers users on-demand beauty tutorials, occasion-based look planning and shopping opportunities. Coty's explains the strategic choice of Echo Show and the Alexa voice service by the need to focus on voice-driven beauty services with visuals, which are critical in Beauty. The personalized beauty offering provides curated makeup looks, visual 'how to's' and quick tips, as well as recommended corresponding products from Coty's beauty portfolio, which includes brands such as Clairol, Rimmel, Max Factor, Bourjois and Sally Hansen. The technology is capable of delivering over 2,000 unique combinations of looks for hair, eye and skin colour, as well as by event type. It can be synced up to Facebook profiles, in order to suggest specific looks for upcoming events, and allows users to add products from each look directly to their Alexa shopping list. According to Coty, the looks and events are based on extensive consumer insight and engagement, social listening and trend scanning to deliver an authentic beauty experience focusing on both classic and trending looks for most any occasion. ""Digital innovation with a focus on voice and virtual assistants is a key part of our digital strategy as we aim to bring consumers frictionless beauty experiences,"" said Jason Forbes, Coty Chief Digital and Media Officer. ""Further, this skill allows us to deliver an authentic and personalized experience for beauty enthusiasts that happens near real time, delivering customized looks in the context of a person's lifestyle and personal attributes."" Sales of smart speakers are expected to nearly double in the US, to US$3.8 billion, from last year according to Lesley Rohrbaugh and Steve Koenig, researchers with the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the annual CES trade event, which took place earlier this month in Las Vegas. Being able to order items, select music, get information, and more by speaking to digital assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft's Cortana has been such a hit that pressure will be on for more ways to interact with machines using voice, the researchers predicted."

The Cosmetic Victories - Third edition,"One of the most challenging issues of the Cosmetic Valley is to detect and support the young innovative companies, as well as to promote the research and the cosmetic sciences. This led to the creation of The Cosmetic Victories competition in 2015, sponsored by the Cosmetic Valley-ESSEC endowment fund. The competition, recognized by the profession, aims to reward and promote students, researchers, start-ups and SMEs in charge of innovative projects, related to the perfume and cosmetics industry. – To support and promote projects run by researchers, start-ups and entrepreneurs from the perfume and cosmetics sector. – To facilitate the prize-winners' access to the market. This year, the Cosmetic Victories Awards consist in two prizes: – The Academic Prize, for the most relevant project that meets the new technical challenges of the cosmetic industry. – The Industry Prize, for the best cosmetic innovation of the year. The Cosmetic Victories is open to French and international contestants: – The Academic Prize: for recent graduates, PhD students, post-doctoral fellows and researchers. – The Industry Prize: for managers of business-creation projects, innovative start-ups and SMEs. All kind of innovation may be presented as a project submission, in any fields of application of the perfume and cosmetics industry: raw materials, formulation, packaging, tests, finished goods, … Note: The innovations can come from the perfume and cosmetics industry or can be the result of technology transfer from other sectors to the cosmetic field: new technologies, new products, new processes, new services, new concepts or new organisations. – Recognition by the profession. The international jury's excellence adds value and considerable scope to each prize-winner's project. – International exposure. Following the competition, there will be major national and international press coverage. – Technical backing. Cosmetic Valley is able to support the prize winners in their efforts to develop their business in France, through the Cosmet'Up tool: a national platform for working alongside and supporting French start-ups and SMEs. The prize winners will also be able to benefit from project engineering facilities at Cosmetic Valley, in order to help them obtain government funding. – Financial backing. To support the competition's prize-winning projects, and based on the Cosmetic Valley-Essec endowment fund, winners of The Cosmetic Victories award will receive a cash prize of €10,000. The Cosmetic Victories relies on a prestigious jury consisting of members of the major companies and top names in the perfume and cosmetics sector.This year, LVMH, Clarins, Sisley and Shiseido were represented. We have also greeted two honoured guests, with Ms Axelle Tessandier, founder of AXL Agency, and Mr François Demachy, perfumer-designer for Christian Dior. Research and innovation institutions, such as the CNRS [the French National Centre for Scientific Research], the GDR 3711 Cosm'Actifs [French Research Network], the SFC [French Society of Cosmetic] and Bpifrance will also be present, as well as ESSEC, our endowment fund partner. The Cosmetic Valley-ESSEC endowment fund was set up in 2013 to promote French research and to take part in developing employment in the perfume and cosmetics field, with the aim of showcasing the reputation of French cosmetics and the ""Made in France"" label. That is why the Endowment Fund authorised the establishment of an annual international competition for young researchers, academics, university students and those from France's prestigious higher education institutes, as well as people in charge of innovative projects (from start-ups and SMEs) in the perfume and cosmetics field. The first edition of the competition was launched in 2015 with the name ""The Cosmetic Victories""."
The beauty brands that shook up the industry in 2017,"It may have only made its (long-awaited) debut in September, but Fenty Beauty by Rihanna was the undisputed makeup victory of 2017. The brand's initial 91-piece debut won global acclaim for its inclusive approach to beauty, thanks to its 40-strong foundation range, and its lineup was quickly bolstered by the addition of a holiday 'Galaxy Collection' and 'Stunna' lip paint, with a new lipstick collection set to launch on December 26. The business was recently named one of the 'Inventions of the Year' by Time Magazine. Fast fashion retailer Asos pulled a surprising move back in September, with the launch of its first-ever own-brand makeup collection. The 46-piece series was devised to enable everyone to experiment with textures and colors, with the company stating: ""At Asos, we want to empower 20-somethings to confidently be themselves, however they choose to do so."" Another majorly successful celebrity beauty launch came courtesy of reality TV star and social media powerhouse Kim Kardashian, whose KKW Beauty label began operating this June. Its debut 'Contour and Highlight Kits' sold out in a matter of hours, and the collection has since been extended to include liquid lipsticks and a range of 'Ultralight Beam' highlighters. The star also made her first big move on the fragrance industry this year, launching her KKW Fragrance brand and releasing a sell-out trio of scents this November. The iconic makeup mogul Pat McGrath began to build up her cult beauty label, Pat McGrath Labs in 2015, but this year saw her supplement her highly limited-edition launches with a much more accessible permanent collection that is also carried by Sephora. The beauty star also made waves in November, when she teamed up with singer Maggie Lindemann became the first makeup entrepreneur to sell products through the music streaming service Spotify. One of the most unexpected beauty launches of the year came from convenience store 7-Eleven, which dreamed up its debut cosmetics line earlier this fall. The chain store's 40-piece collection is dubbed 'Simply Me Beauty,' and was designed for millennials on the go, prioritizing affordable price points and a fashion-forward vision."
L'Oréal embraces natural beauty with new plant-based hair dyes,"The beauty giant's professional division has announced the launch of Botanea, its first-ever vegetal hair colour line. The collection eschews the chemicals that are traditionally present in hair dye ingredients for a formula that is 100% plant-based. The line uses botanical dyes sourced from Indian plants such as Henna, Indigo and Pure Cassia, with a natural coco oil coating. The range consists of a trio of products designed for professional use, and is set to be rolled out to salons in Europe in May 2018. In a first, the range should be made available in about 30% of hair salons working with L'Oréal Professionnel. Furthermore, according to some media reports, the cosmetics group would also prepare the launch of similar natural hair dyes in the mass-market channel. Natural and sustainable beauty has proven itself as a lucrative trend over the past year, with several brands making huge strides towards adopting a more environmentally and ethically conscientious approach towards the industry. The once-niche world of natural beauty brands has grown to include household names such as Lush, Neal's Yard and Tarte Cosmetics, while there has also been a rise in popularity of vegan and cruelty-free labels that avoid ingredients that come from or are tested on animals, with headline brands such as Kat Von D, Too Faced and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna leading the way. The natural movement looks set to continue to break boundaries in 2018, with research released in November by market intelligence agency Mintel predicting that encompassing local approaches and developments in biotechnology with a more organic approach to ingredients will become a major beauty industry trend over the coming year."
The brands that shook up the male beauty industry in 2017,"While Mintel recently highlighted a general shift in attitudes regarding the topic of male beauty, with consumers moving away from gender stereotypes while embracing gender neutrality, a new market research by Reportlinker has valued the global male grooming product industry at USD 47.582 billion (about EUR 40.412 billion) for the year 2016, with steady growth predicted to push this figure up to USD 61.567 billion by the end of 2026. In this context, some cosmetics brands are waking up to the growing consumer trend for specialist beauty products and treatments for men, resulting in a slew of new and innovative solutions. We take a look at some of the hottest new arrivals on the men's beauty scene in 2017. Skincare staple Kiehl's made a big move earlier this year when it expanded its men's beauty products with the launch of a 'Grooming Solutions' line. Described as the 'essential toolkit' for perfectly groomed guys, it contains everything from soap to styling gel, but one of the most ingenious products is the 'Nourishing Shampoo + Conditioner,' which hydrates the scalp while removing buildup. Hip fragrance brand Le Labo also rolled out a men's grooming line over the summer, described as ""an ode to old-world, traditional Americana barbershops."" The six-piece collection spans shaving creams, beard oils and balms, but it was the 'Face Bronzer' that really stood out. Eventually, streetwear brand of the moment Supreme made a surprise move on the grooming sector back in September, when it teamed up hair accessory company Andis Envy Li on a pair of cordless hair clippers. The tool, which features a high-speed adjustable blade, reportedly sold out in under 10 seconds."
"Neose Pro, a mobile, quick digital nose","Based on the fact that brands increasingly expect digital values less costly and more reliable than human evaluations of smells, Aryballe relied on a combination of technologies (optical, microfluidic, biochemical, electronic, and computer technologies) to develop the first digital nose. The recognition of smells is carried out by about forty biosensors inspired from human olfaction that are directed to a database containing several hundreds of smells that serve as references. The company is constantly working on the classification of these references to go as far as detecting unknown smells. ""Both users and perfume houses can also set up their own database of references,"" explains Tristan Rousselle, co-founder and Director of Aryballe Technologies. There is a broad range of applications for the perfume and cosmetics industry. During the manufacturing phase, the electronic nose can be used for verifying the quality of the raw materials, compared to reference standards, following up the smell stability at each production phase, or validating the quality of the finished products. During the post-production phase, it can make it easier to monitor the drift in time of the fragrance in the formulas, support the panel of testers during sensorial analyses… The device provides a documented answer extremely close to the human olfactory experience, without the drawbacks of panel tests, which can be undermined by a saturated or affected human nose. Beyond the Perfume & Cosmetics industry, NeOse Pro applications may apply to diverse fields, like the food industry for aromas, or environmental pollution monitoring (waste, public restrooms, etc.). Mobile and quick – it only takes 15 seconds to make a measurement – NeOse Pro will be marketed for an industrial public in January 2018 for EUR 10,000."
Sephora embraces voice control era,"Getting in touch with Sephora while talking to your smartphone or to a connected speaker without even installing the app? That is the service offered by several pioneers now available in Google Assistant, an intelligent personal assistant which is able to held a conversation using Google's natural language program. To use the service, you need to launch Google Assistant - for instance by saying ""OK Google"", if the phone is listening - and say ""Speak with Sephora"" (or another service also available on Google Assistant). Sephora has developed its chat bot in collaboration with VISEO, using artificial intelligence bricks allowing customers to interact with the company via Google Home as well as Android and iOS smartphones via the Google Assistant. ""The use of voice assistants and more recently voice-activated speakers is proving to be much more than a trend but the preparation for a small digital revolution in which Sephora wants to be a forerunner. With these first features and this collaboration with Google, we intend to test the audience and the reactions of our customers with regard to voice assistance,"" said Anne-Véronique Baylac, Chief Digital Officer at Sephora EMEA. A first wave of services has arrived in early November but, according to Sephora, this is just the beginning and new features will be available in 2018 through this new channel: – Beauty services booking such as a complete make-up at the Beauty Bar or at the Benefit's eyebrow bar. Thanks to Google Assistant and Google Home, it is now possible to check all availabilities in Sephora stores. Appointments are finalized by email afterwards. – Beauty quizzes in order to allow the retailer to get information about the client's level of information. – Exclusive beauty podcasts with influencers. According to Sephora, with more than 49 million voice assistant users and 10 million voice-activated speakers sold in the United States in 2016 [1], voice assistants are emerging as a key channel. Sephora explains a retailer must adapt to its customers' new uses in order to better respond to changing expectations and make their lives easier."
Artificial intelligence & beauty: China pushes back the limits of the possible,"Since 2015, L'Oréal has been developing applications using facial recognition and virtual reality like Make Up Genius, Vice Lipstick (Urban Decay), and Style My Hair (L'Oréal Professionnel), to make it possible for users, via hundreds of functionalities, to view their faces with different makeup, lipstick, or hair styles, and then buy the products they liked the most. ""These applications are highly successful around the world, in particular Style My Hair, which puts hairstylist and customer communities in contact and is present in dozens of countries, including China,"" Asmita Dubey explains. The application also localizes the nearest hairdressing salons offering the type of treatments the users chose. However, in China, it cannot compete with Meitu ( 美图, ""beautiful image""), the popular photo processing application that brightens the skin, conceals blemishes, and widens the eyes in accordance with Chinese standards. ""Meitu counts 270 million active users per month. In China, everything is in a larger scale,"" Asmita Dubey reiterates. This success has triggered new initiatives by people eager to ride the wave of applications dedicated to virtual makeup, beauty tips, and skin diagnosis, like Tmall, Chinese conglomerate Alibaba's e-commerce website specialized in lifestyle brands. These applications are supported by the mostly mobile use of digital devices in China, which counted 751 million web users in July 2017. As far as vocal recognition is concerned, Chinese giant Baidu has developed Deep Speech 2, which turns the voice into textual data – an essential tool, ""since we know 50% of all searches will be made orally in 2020,"" Asmita Dubey says. ""For cosmetics brands, the objective is to provide an oral, not written answer, and make the dialogue as fluid as a conversation. Many groups have been working on this and their results will soon be available on the market,"" she announces. An additional step towards purchase customization will then be completed, since artificial intelligence makes ""recommendation"" easier with the user data recorded. At the forefront of this technology, Tmall organized a Singles' Day last November 11, which the Alibaba group managed to turn into a national shopping day in China – an operation called ""1,000 faces, 1,000 pages"". The site provided product recommendations on a web page depending on the buyers' profiles, tastes, and consumption habits. ""This recommendation function is still being enhanced by the xiaohongshu RED site (小红书, ""little red book""),"" Asmita Dubey continues. Depending on the type of products sought, this website presents the purchases of influential Chinese bloggers and their recommendations. Launched in 2014 as an application giving Chinese travelers the opportunity to rate and review the products they bought abroad, RED has added an ecommerce functionality - including mainly Asian cosmetics brands - as a result of its strong growth. This huge quantity of collected data does not only concern final buyers, but also the information influencers on blogs and social media provide. ""We often work with American company Tribe Dynamics, whose technology makes it possible to relate the content generated by influencers to the brands they talk about. If you take the example of Asian brand Tatcha, the analysis of what influencers say about it around the world can determine in which region and within which chains the brand will grow, to what extent it will grow, etc."" The progress made in artificial intelligence is not only meant to make companies more profitable, Asmita Dubey claims: they can also involve a social commitment, as can be seen with application QQ Alerts, created by Tencent, another Chinese web giant that has been working on this technology. By giving a kid his future adult appearance on a picture, the application offers the possibility to find lost or abducted children. However advanced they may seem, none of these applications has reached the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence yet: combine detection, reasoning, and optimization, as the technologies developed for designing self-driving cars do. ""There is still a lot to do, including solving the problem of personal data and privacy protection,"" emphasizes Amita Dubey. To her, in China, ""the question has more to do with data security than privacy."""
Handwritten fragrances: Closer to the skin,"In the wake of the launch of Note in 2015, Aptar Beauty + Home continues its innovative exploration of the fragrance gesture towards an ever more understated elegance. At the Luxe Pack tradeshow - which was held in Monaco from 2 to 4 October 2017 - the manufacturer of fragrance and facial skin care packaging delivery systems has launched Fragrance Master, an innovative applicator that aims to renew the perfuming experience through an application that was designed ""to appeal to both connoisseurs and millennials in search of fun innovations."" Born from the Skin Master technology, this ""perfume pen"" delivers a dose for instant distribution and traces its fragrance trail on the skin. ""The application is quick, controlled and highly sensory, and the object travel-friendly, innovative and precise: perfect for application to pulse points, to which it is recommended to add fragrance to create a lingering trail."" For an optimal customization of this new perfume ritual and its calligraphic sensory feel, Fragrance Master can be adapted with specific applicator options (quill, drop, brush,…) and a wide choice of customised features for the design. Also on the occasion of Luxe Pack, Texen presented its own technical solution for an innovative, intimate and ultra-practical product to use on-the-go. The concept immediately appealed Mugler for its new perfume Aura. This fragrance pen can be refilled by soaking its nylon tip in a perfume bottle. The tip quickly get imbibed by capillarity with approximately 0.2 g of perfume after 60 seconds of immersion. Thus refilled, the pen can be used for seven days with two applications per day. Texen's standard fragrance pen and the associated bottle can be customized to the brand's needs. For Mugler, the PP pen has been anodized with silver-coloured aluminium and the brand's named has been silk-screen printed in black letters. A wide range of decors and printing solutions are available. ""With this fragrance pen, Texen addresses consumers' demand for an elegant, practical, easy-to-use and easy to refill product,"" said the company. These two high-end solutions complete the already known fragrance pencils and sticks, such as Alkos' Perfume Touch Up, with a super-light texture designed to ""melt onto the skin"". Another example is BCM's Fragrance Stick, available in two formulas, transparent or opaque. Each of these solutions requires a specific formulation (solid, liquid or gel) that shows the extent of variations available in the fragrance category."
Cosmetic 360: Innovation more than ever on the agenda,"""Cosmetic 360 is an event based on qualitative values: all the companies present come to put forward their competitive advantages and what makes them stand out in terms of innovation,"" asserts Franckie Béchereau, Show Manager. To do this, the event organizers decided to resume the notion of Expert Routes to identify innovation types according to five themes: Tests & Analyses, Packaging & Conditioning, Raw Materials, Formulation & Manufacturing. ""We pride ourselves on offering solutions that have never been presented to the perfume & cosmetics industry. We contacted exhibitors in other business areas like logistics or pharmacy, so our professionals will discover applications for the first time,"" Franckie Béchereau promises. The Startup Zone was quite dynamic last year, so this time it will be located in a larger dedicated room in which young companies will also have a few minutes to introduce themselves to a public of investors and partners. ""This show is actually in turmoil, it is turned to new products, so it was logical for us to support startups,"" she explains. This positioning is confirmed by the new area called Solutions Startup, which makes it possible for people with innovative projects set up within a company or not, but who do not come as exhibitors, to introduce themselves in a few minutes to players essential to young structures, like banks, INPI, or BPI… This way, organizers assert a new positioning as 'startup creators' in relation to innovation. There is something else that is new for this edition: the organization of a Hackathon sponsored by LVMH Digital. The event will see teams composed of students from the greatest cosmetics and digital schools compete for the creation of new digital solutions. Fundamental and scientific research will also be put forward in an innovative way. Two animations are scheduled on issues related to cosmetopoeia and plasma, a cutting-edge scientific project aimed for the development of the first plasma device dedicated to cosmetics applications. Now, also with a view to match Research & Industry, this year, all conferences in the Research to Practice programme will be presented by a two-person team including a researcher and a manufacturer, whatever the issue at stake. A various offering, meetings and exchanges, an organization to welcome visitors as best as possible… the qualitative aspect prevails to the organizers, as can be seen in their communication and initiatives. ""We almost exclusively work on a profile of global top managers, and the show's trademark is also to gather major contractors, who are deeply involved in our event,"" Franckie Béchereau claims. As a matter of fact, the Chanel, Johnson & Johnson, L'Oréal, LVMH Research, and Shiseido groups have subscribed to Open Innovation this year. This service has always been part of the show: it makes it possible for major brands to select and meet people who have set up innovative global projects and pre-subscribed on a dedicated online platform: 250 projects were submitted this year. The Greentech-sponsored Business Contact Area will provide a privileged place to exchange for enhanced meetings. As the showcase for Made in France products and services, this year again, the show will host the WICCS, the international clusters summit on common cosmetics projects, as well as many international delegations from Taiwan, Japan, China, and, for the first time, companies representing South Korea and the United States. Lastly, the event will be punctuated with the Awards attributed for each Expert Route by a jury of professional press journalists and the Gala dinner organized at the Pavillon Cambon Capucines."
Digital beauty: Schwan Cosmetics forges ahead!,"Premium Beauty News - What happened in Berlin last July? Bernd Preuschoff - Our first ""BeautyThon"" took place from 23 to 24 July 2017 at the Mindspace and Rocket Tower in Berlin. The goal was to reflect on new digital business models in the beauty industry and offer participants their first platform. On the theme ""Beauty on the Run"", several teams consisting of startup experts, fashion and beauty bloggers, technology-savvy and employees of Schwan Cosmetics developed their ideas in different fields, like for example on the theme of mobility. In order to stimulate their pioneering spirit, participants first took part to highly focused workshops and debates. Premium Beauty News - Two intense days! Bernd Preuschoff - On the first day, teams of up to five participants were brought together and introduced to the subject, and they were also given a mission to help them find and develop their ideas. These missions must above all be centred on the user offering him a solution that he will adopt in his daily life. On the second day, with the help of coaches, the teams worked on a business model and an idea, and created their first prototype. They were also trained on the project pitching session. As part of an Open Pitch, the teams then presented their ideas to a jury including Dr. Karas, the CEO of Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics. At the end of the evening, a prize was awarded to the team who had presented the best digital solution. Members of the winning team will have the opportunity to develop their idea with the support of Schwan Cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - With your company now thoroughly involved in these subjects, what will be the next step? Bernd Preuschoff - The cosmetics industry is an exciting field which, compared to other industries, is still in the early stages of its digital development, which therefore leaves room for innovation. As a market leader and a leader in innovation, Schwan Cosmetics is well positioned to play a pioneering role in the sector. We want to make rapid progress in this area with our customers, partners and employees. In 2018, we also intend to broaden the circle of the BeautyThon participants to about a hundred (currently 40)"
Pennelli Faro: How an innovation is born,"What leads to the development of an innovation? Sara Zanafredi - Pennelli Faro has been on the market for almost fifty years. We are among the world's leading manufacturers of private label brushes and applicators. We started in the field of Fine Arts, where the combination of shape-hair-colour-technique in the brushes has always been very sophisticated and where the variables affecting the result are numerous, at least as many as in the field of cosmetic brushes. That allowed us to develop a sensitivity and technical precision making the difference. The daily direct contact with the production department, located close to the technical offices, allows us to control the production process at every step but, most important, to give wide space for creativity and innovation. We go from the original idea to real-time prototype with all the advantages of testing, modifying and finding the best and most performing solutions. The R&D and Marketing departments, constantly updated on application and technical specifications of cosmetic products, aim at combining technical performance and ease of use to meet the needs of the most advanced formulations. What are the strengths of Pennelli Faro in developing an innovating project? Sara Zanafredi - Shape, materials and the Made in Italy. Each project is designed considering the ease of use and functionality for the end user, not forgetting the aesthetic component: made in Italy is also recognized for this, for style, for detailing. That makes a difference. First of all, the shape. A cosmetic brush developed by Pennelli Faro is an ergonomic and functional tool becoming almost an extension of the hand, an invisible guide to rely on, because we are aware that people using it, whether expert or not, expect to see in the mirror, a perfect result. That's why functional design is so important and starts from the study of ergonomics of face, hand and gesture. The shapes have the purpose of making the brush an element in synergy with the formula of the makeup or skincare product it is used with, and allow the user to have an intuitive and immediate application experience. However, the shape and design of the brush are closely connected to the selection of materials. The company's investments are focused on the research and development of new dermatologically tested avant-garde fibres, perfectly meeting the needs of new consumer trends, with unique textures and finishes. The study of details and the possibilities of personalization, in terms of selection of materials and finishes, are so large that it is possible to make every brush a unique tool created specifically for each cosmetic brand. Last but not least, the production made in Italy. The manufacturing of Pennelli Faro brushes takes place at our headquarters. Proximity makes the passage of information very fast. This allows us to create the right project at the right time and not as standard product. Each brush is personalised and modifiable in the development and production phases, together with the client, in dedicated sessions. The team constantly innovates the production system and operates on controlled procedures that guarantee the best technical performance. The continuous interaction between R&D, Commercial, Marketing teams and our production department facilitate an exchange of information and feedbacks that the customer provides on every detail of the project, even those that are hardly describable on a technical document. Is it also a way to increase the confidence with the supplier? Sara Zanafredi - Of course it is! Pennelli Faro works with the most important national and multinational brands and remains under the company's policy behind the scenes of each project. Innovation is almost completely reserved and often patent-protected, and is shared with clients in a dedicated and direct way. What were the latest innovation projects that Pennelli Faro worked on? Sara Zanafredi - An excellent example of the very tight relationship between R&D and Production is one of the latest born lines, origami®, launched at Cosmoprof Bologna 2017. In the development of a brush like the origami® Prisma and Infinito ranges, the design, shape and line of the brush are functional to the ergonomic application of the cosmetic product because they are pre-shaped to perfectly follow the facial features. Thanks to multi-faceted shape, even the less experienced consumer can apply makeup professionally. To date we have focused on applying products to create the makeup base, but the origami® project is still evolving. Another example is Dermocura®, the most innovative synthetic fibre patented by Pennelli Faro. It is a unique fibre, dermatologically tested, constantly evolving and with endless potentialities and combinations. The study and control of the technical features of Dermocura® synthetic fibre allowed us to develop and make available to our clients the perfect imitations of natural hair. Similar in terms of aesthetic appearance and ability to respond well to the products they have to apply, but with significantly better characteristics, performance and durability. Also, I think of Soft & Full® synthetic fibre made with extremely silky and dense tips that guarantees 30% more density than a normal synthetic filament with the same volume. It is the most performing fibre to get extremely natural degradation effects and is very pleasant on the skin. Would you make some anticipations about the innovative projects you are working on? Sara Zanafredi - (She smiles.) No, it is all top secret…"
Vitamin C: Latest beauty trends,"This month, US department store Barneys unveiled its firstever exclusive Korean beauty launch in the form of Vitabrid C12, a hair and skincare line created using a brand-new proprietary Vitamin C complex called Vitabrid CG. The brand claims the new complex is capable of delivering active Vitamin C continuously for over 12 hours. The vitamin is absorbed deep into the skin and scalp to fully exploit its potential. One of the challenges beauty brands face is that pure Vitamin C naturally degrades when exposed to oxygen, rendering it difficult to develop products that deliver skincare benefits over a prolonged period of use. But earlier this year, Clinique introduced its innovative new 'Fresh Pressed' skincare system, which tackles the problem by offering individual sachets of Vitamin C cleanser in water-activated powder form to maintain freshness. The line also includes a 'Daily Booster' serum that comes in seven-day vials to safeguard against degradation. Tatcha's new 'Violet-C Radiance Mask' contains not one but two types of Vitamin C for extra impact — a water-soluble version that absorbs quickly into the skin and an oil-soluble kind that provides more longterm protection from UV damage. Japanese beautyberry, which is a Vitamin C stabilizer, also features on the ingredients list."
A Messenger chatbot well-versed with perfumes,"Now that the most popular social platforms (Facebook Messenger, Skype, Whatsapp, Telegram, WeChat...) have opened their doors to them, conversational robots (chatter robots, or chatbots), able to exchange with a human on a precise matter, are gradually becoming more familiar to the largest possible number of people. Main advantage: they are instantly accessible, from the messaging that most owners of smartphones use every day, without it being necessary to download any additional application. Sommelier du Parfum belongs to this new generation of tools much appreciated by millennials. Its objective: guide its users in the choice of a perfume, for oneself or to offer. ""It is actually the first question asked by the robot,"" explains Samuel Fillon, its creator. The chatbot then uses several other criteria to define the ""olfactory profile"" of the person for whom the perfume is intended: man or woman, other favourite perfumes, types of smells that we like (citrus, woody, etc.). ""The vocabulary used by the chatbot is very accessible, jargon-free. Everyone understands what a citrus note is, while it is not the case when talking about hesperidia notes,"" highlights Samuel Fillon, who started this project during his studies in Machine Learning at the University of Tokyo, as part of his training as a civil engineer (Ponts et Chaussées school). ""Before my departure for Japan, I found myself a bit lost when wanting to offer a perfume to my brother for his birthday. I knew he liked the smells of some of the shower gels he used, but that was of little help in the shop in front of the salesperson for whom my inquiry was obviously too vague."" In fact, the chatbot uses a database of more than 30,000 references of crowdsourced perfumes retrieved from data available on the web. Each of these 30,000 references is indexed according to its female/male positioning, its main olfactory notes, its retail price, its appreciation by perfume critics, its creator, etc. Knowledge definitely out of reach for ordinary human beings! Not to mention that, in the course of its conversation, the chatbot learns to better know the tastes of his interlocutor. Once the olfactory profile and the tastes of the recipient of the perfume are defined, the chatbot proposes a series of recommendations: ""for next summer, winter, for work or in the evening."" Detailed information is available for each proposal, and a store locator enables to spot the closest location to test the suggested products. Perfume experts will probably feel confused by the robot's proposals, but unquestionably, it brings an element of fun to the relation with the customer, and yet without breaking the human relationship because it facilitates access to the perfume market. A tool, which will appeal to both retailers and brands. It can be adapted to the specific needs of different players and also gives access to many consumption data. To note: The Sommelier du Parfum chatbot will be presented at the Fragrance Innovation Summit organized by Premium Beauty News next July 5th in Paris. Details: here."
Bon Parfumeur outsmarts the codes of perfumery,"""It is an approach for those that are more relaxed about perfumery. For those who, like me, have a lot of them and enjoy changing,"" Ludovic Bonneton announces straight away. The concept is based on 15 really varied fragrances classified in 10 olfactory families identifiable with a code. Every perfume is identified with a number composed of three figures and a colour. The first figure – the hundreds column – and the colour indicate the olfactory category. The 000 category is that of colognes, 100 represents floral perfumes, 200, fruity fragrances, and so on. The figures after the hundreds column refer to the order of appearance in each family. For example, the 601 perfume is the first created in the 600 family, that of woody fragrances. Most importantly, the three main notes in every perfume are clearly displayed. Not the top, middle, or back notes, but those the user will obviously recognize. As an example, the 601 fragrance announces 'pepper, cedar, patchouli.' ""People just love it. These three notes help start a conversation. They search for pepper, cedar, or patchouli, and they do recognize them. It arouses their interest,"" Ludovic Bonneton asserts. Now, that is an atypical approach to perfumes and consumers. Here, dreams and mystery are replaced by didactics, by another form of discovery that is direct, simple, and frank. ""We endeavour to be part of this wave that awakens things, this interest for a sense that has been forgotten, in a way, but in which everyone is actually interested. It is a bit like what was done with the 'bistronomy' or 'eating well' movements to which access was opened, and which did correspond to a certain curiosity or interest from people."" That is why Bon Parfumeur fragrances bank on affordability and logically boast an affordable price range: EUR35 for 30ml, for a brand that is still positioned on the niche perfumery segment. Juices are all composed by French perfume creators (Alexandra Monet, Benoît Lapouza, Corinne Cachen, Karine Dubreuil, Nathalie Koobus, and Philippe Romano), who share both sophistication in their compositions and the use of beautiful raw materials. ""I do not impose any limits on the perfume creator, I only ask them to search for what is best,"" Ludovic Bonneton assures. It seems this new perfume dimension has found an echo. Launched in June 2016, Bon Parfumeur opened their first wholly-owned store in late December, Rue des Francs Bourgeois, in the heart of the Parisian Marais Quarter - a Mecca for alternative perfumery. The brand is also present at the Bon Marché Department Store and in over 70 points of sale similar to concept stores, all around the world (Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Dubai…). ""We are trying to settle in pretty places, where people already have this sort of curiosity for innovative concepts."" New references are to be launched before summer, including a very sensual amber-based perfume, a solar floral, and a new fragrance in the ""special"" category. ""We are set for a long story,"" Ludovic Bonneton promises."
Chanel launches the first cream with camellia micro-droplets,"Following the launch of the Hydra Beauty Micro Serum in 2015, and Hydra Beauty Micro Gel Yeux in 2016, the launch of the Hydra Beauty Micro Crème marks a new step in microfluidics innovation by Chanel Research. ""This development met many formulation and manufacturing challenges. Adapting the micro-doplets technology from a liquid to a creamy texture, proved very difficult. Once again, technological limits have been pushed further back,"" Christian Mahé, General Manager of Chanel Research Beauty and Innovation, told Premium Beauty News. For this new development, Chanel Research teams have partnered with the French start-up Capsum. Capsum offered its expertise in microfluidics, Chanel its formulation know-how and its industrial expertise The first challenge: producing a microfluidic cream for packaging in jars. Since the droplets are delicate and evanescent, their resistance has been enhanced in comparison with serums in airless packaging, without losing their unique sensorial profile. The result: droplets do not burst when they are scooped out of the jar but only when the cream is applied to the face. The joint Chanel and Capsum team has managed to create gel droplets that are both evanescent and high-resistance, but also visible to the naked eye in a cream. The second challenge: producing a smooth texture through the microfluidic process. Hydra Beauty Micro Crème combines visible and invisible droplets stabilized by ""molecular velcro tapes"" for remarkable application comfort. The joint Chanel and Capsum team has managed to integrate a sensory cascade in this cream, where the fresh feeling of water is followed by the richness of the oil. The third challenge: blending delicate and evanescent droplets into the cream. To achieve this, a new manufacturing process had to be devised to blend the droplets into the cream without splitting them while ensuring homogenous distribution. Machines and production lines were thus tailor designed to manufacture Hydra Beauty Micro Crème. Microfluidics make it possible to manipulate fluids with high accuracy at a micrometric scale. At this scale, capillary forces prevail over gravity. Thanks to a system where the flow is controlled and high, it is possible to shape droplets one by one and control their size. This accurate calibration produces an emulsion whose structuration is more orderly than with conventional technologies. Droplet stability is secured by a complex coacervation process which combines two polymers interacting together in the manner of ""molecular velcro tapes"" to form an evanescent membrane. The result: droplets in which a new high value-added fat-soluble active ingredient is protected until application. These perfectly calibrated and stable droplets burst instantly upon application with outstanding moisturizing efficiency for the skin. As they burst on the skin without leaving any residue, these droplets create an unparalleled sensory experience unmatched in traditional emulsions, as well as a new aesthetic. ""This is an example of successful co-development between Chanel and a start-up,"" states Christian Mahé. ""This microfluidics innovation platform is capable of broadening the scope of possibilities (new technologies, new visuals, new textures…) to develop tomorrow's cosmetics"". A new innovation is already expected for 2018."
The best of make-up innovation in 2016,"Premium Beauty News - The sector is truly dynamic! Chantal Riols - We must of course thank all the industry professionals for having played the game so well but also all the jury members for their participation. A huge thanks to Florence Bernardin, Pauline Bonnafous, Serge German, Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, Gérald Martines, Jean-Louis Mathiez Luisa Oliva. And concerning industry professionals, we most really congratulate the Companies who were the most innovative and regularly took part to the contest. I am thinking in particular of Albéa, Alkos, Aircos, Cosmogen, Faber-Castell, Gotha Cosmetics, Intercos, Strand Cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - And among these two hundred new products can some emerging trends be identified? Chantal Riols - Certainly! Thus, pell-mell, we can note the predominance of the metal effect, of highly pigmented formulas for long-lasting colours. Note also sophisticated decorations, on all surfaces, like for example and for the first time around a lipstick tube and a sponge. Note also the development of versatile products for the complexion, the lips and ingenious applicators for lip glosses and liquid formulas. Natural ingredients are also increasingly present. New gestures for conventional packs such as compacts. Fine and very nice new powdery textures and innovative gels for the lips and perfumes also. The jury was impressed by these new brow tattoos and their innovative applicators to tint them and set them. As for packs, we saw the development of 4 in 1 applicators combining several accessories or formulas. Innovative changes were also noticed in baked powder based formulas. Finally, everyone could appreciate the makeup shade with fluorescent formulas for lips that are revealed in the dark. Premium Beauty News - And of course in 2017, you are continuing? Chantal Riols - Absolutely! And I would like to take the opportunity to announce that the first call for products will be launched as of January 15, 2017 for exhibitors to MakeUp in Seoul. Moreover, while competing products are actually tested by our international experts, all IT Products will receive a certificate for their selection."
'Diamond nails' the new Korean beauty trend made for NYE,"The latest Korean beauty export is an update on its predecessor, the 'shattered glass' nail, which involves placing individual pieces of cellophane onto the nail to create the illusion of broken glass. The diamond nail is thought to be the result of a similar technique, using glittery holographic 'shards' for an even more eye-catching, 3D result. Leading the trend is Seoul's Unistella Salon, owned by manicurist Eunkyung Park, whose Instagram feed offers plenty of inspiration for fans of the look. While Park's mesmerizing video shows off the concept to its full effect, users such as @son_unni and @hee_unistella have incorporated just one or two 'diamond' feature nails into black lacquered or pale pink manicures in a nod to the trend. Park has yet to reveal exactly how she created the diamond nail, but back in 2015 she shared her technique for the shattered glass nail with Teen Vogue, explaining that cutting up candy wrappers and setting with a gel polish was the secret to the look. It's a concept that can be easily adapted with holographic cellophane for a glittery New Year's Eve beauty look that will ensure all eyes are on you at midnight. Shine bright!"
Aroma Zone launches its own green nail varnish,"Given the growing insistence of its consumers for plant-derived makeup and well-controlled cosmetics compositions, the French brand, a naturalness and DIY standard, has designed a nail varnish range based on bio-sourced, plant-derived solvents and pigments. 100% vegan, the range also excludes all the components deemed problematic by the most uncompromising consumers: toluene, formaldehyde, phthalates, synthetic camphor, rosin, and xylene. Traditional solvents are replaced by a botanical base derived from potatoes, manioc, corn, and wheat. These components are transformed into alcohol by fermentation, and then into solvents with green chemistry processes. It is also the first nail varnish exclusively based on plant-derived pigments. For red and pinkish shades, synthetic and mineral pigments, and pigments derived from mealybugs are replaced by others extracted from red radish, pink sweet potato, and elderberries. Blue shades are obtained thanks to an extract from spirulina, a microscopic alga rich in phycocyanin and endowed with excellent antioxidant properties. Rich in seven 'standard' colours from Beige to Plum, and also featuring a base/top coat, the range should soon offer new colours. Entirely made in France, the products will be sold starting from January 2017 for the keen price of EUR 2.90 to EUR 3.50 for a 6ml bottle. Based on this innovation, Aroma Zone also offers the possibility to make our own plant-derived homemade nail varnish, with all the advantages of a personalized creation. As simple as ABC, the formula is made and combined in five minutes only, with the same plant-derived solvent and pigments, or even mineral pigments for sequined, pearly, or iridescent effects. All the elements are sold separately for a cost price of about 1.2 euro for one nail varnish bottle, but you will need a precision balance, a graduated pipette, a tiny whisk, and a bowl as well. Then, everyone needs to get motivated and show enough patience to compose naturally."
Le P'tit Sniff: towards a new approach to blotters?,"As an animation and promotional tool in points of sale or for launching new products, or even a training tool, ""Le P'tit Sniff"" offers a new olfactory experience and is positioned as an alternative to traditional testers and blotters. ""It has many advantages,"" explains Valérie Pasmanian, co-founder of the product, with Michel Pozzo, the inventor of the OlfaCom technology. ""It is clean and does not saturate the atmosphere, so that it considerably improves the quality of the ambient air in perfume stores. It is very easy to use, and it only takes a few seconds to replace a perfume cartridge, which makes it possible to test plenty of products. Its design and decoration can be personalized, so they can be adapted to any brand's codes."" The removable cartridges inserted in ""Le P'tit Sniff"" are developed based on perfume concentrates, so the result is just exemplary. The OlfaCom technology of ventilation on dry material diffuses perfume by only pressing the device's activating button with the finger. ""It is a playful instrument that is interesting for training activities or launching operations,"" adds Valérie Pasmanian. The diffuser was actually used by the Van Gogh & Sesame candle brand at the first edition of the Alternative Fragrance show, last June in Paris. ""At a show where we cannot light candles, 'Le P'tit Sniff' was an opportunity for the brand to offer visitors a very rich olfactory experience."" According to its creators, ""Le P'tit Sniff"" meets many different practical needs, and a lot of application solutions were examined, mainly in the professional field. The first industrial pre-series will be showcased at the Made in France show on November 18-20, 2016, in Paris. ""Its design was reviewed and its shape is more regular, so it is even easier to personalize. Other improvements were made: for example, the batteries were replaced by a rechargeable battery with a mere USB socket, which enhances its portability and ease of use,"" Valérie Pasmanian concludes."
Connected cosmetics: A manicure that doubles as your subway pass,"Fashion student Lucie Davis, a BA Jewellery Design undergrad at London's Central Saint Martins school, has come up with a way to do just that. Her 'Oyster Card Acrylic Nails' project features a stylish manicure that also doubles as an Oyster card - the travel pass used to get around the UK capital. The concept works thanks to an RFID chip taken from an Oyster card and hidden in one of the acrylic nails, allowing the wearer to simply touch their way in and out of the London Underground. The set of falsies, which are painted in the same blue and white pattern as the card, to drive the point home, can also be topped up in the same way as a traditional pass. Davis was inspired to create the nails for her final project about the way we engage with our daily surroundings, and immediately thought of her city commute. ""I was hoping that this idea would make everyone's next commute a little more thoughtful and enjoyable rather than our usual mindless ones,"" she told WAH Nails. ""I like to think of my work as a 21st century update to the traditional keepsake. It's about finding a fresh new perspective on things, providing more meaning in a world we may take for granted and (hopefully) changing the way we think in a positive light."" It might be conceptual for the moment, but this is one wearable tech trend we could really get behind."
Procos adapts its packaging offer to the new challenges of online shopping,"""Packaging is a key element of the purchase online experience,"" says Leander Kritokos, president and founder of Procos. ""Putting the packaging and its opening at the centre of the experience is a key factor of success,"" he adds. To maximize satisfaction during the online shopping experience, the high-end packaging manufacturer for luxury markets in fashion, perfumery cosmetics, decoration, jewellery, wine and spirits, is extending its highly customized product portfolio into packaging for online distribution. The moment at which the customer receives and opens a parcel allows a brand to differentiate itself from another and create a unique shopping experience for the customer. ""Luxurious companies have a strong relationship with their customers in retails stores. The firms invest in their employees, time and tremendous costs to create their unique brand look: The retail stores share a special atmosphere, in the way they are build, sound, smell, feel and how the shopping experience for their customer is enhanced. This special look makes this brand distinct from another brand. Shoppers accustomed with these in-store shopping rituals will expect the same high level of care given to their online orders,"" says the company. Providing consumers, when they receive the products they ordered online, the same sophistication than during shopping in brick-and-mortar stores is definitely an asset to retain very fickle customers. Every project is handled with special care to identify usage and possibilities in order to support the brands' corporate identity. Furthermore, in line with the company's practices, Procos also adapts to the new demanding distribution constraints like weight, carbon foot print, suitable for transportation, etc. In the case of the box developed for ""Ma Beauté Luxe"", the high-end beauty box service of the L'Oréal group, Procos devoted several years to design of a light box, easy to handle and able to contain variable size products and sealed with as adhesive pre-inserted in the packaging."
Manicure pens and fluorescent lipsticks: the latest innovations from MakeUp in Paris,"One of the main highlight of the show was the now famous ""Innovation Tree"", which unveiled 28 new products. These included ""Eyebrow Designer"" by Bomo Trendline, a system that allows users to dye their brows by combing them with a brush. The paraben-free colour lasts up to 24 hours and can be removed with a regular make-up remover. Additional makeup solutions also included ""Moonlight Kiss Fluo Lipsticks"" by Alkos, which provide lips with fluorescent brightness while protecting and moisturizing them with vitamin E, and the ""Spacy Art & French Pen"" by Bomo Trendline, a manicure pen containing more than 18 colours. Also noteworthy are the ""Fruity Lip Scrubs"" by Strand Cosmetics. These transparent scrub balms are formulated with vitamin E, bisabolol and grape seed oil, to gently exfoliate the lips and visibly embellish them. Again for the lips, the gel texture of the ""Jelly Baby Lipgloss"" line by Faber Castell Cosmetics offers a pure lips and glossy appearance. The clear and bright balm moisturizes the lips and the pen allows an easy and precise application. Innovative formulas also provided a talking point, with Gotha Cosmetics' ""Bi-Metallic Eyes & Face Color Veil"", a refreshing gel texture that creates a light veil over the eyes or face, and the intensity is variable like a stroboscope. The supplier's ""Color Igloo And Pearly Color Igloo"" product, a series of powders which stimulate the senses upon application and which come in four different shades, also featured on the Innovation Tree. For the nails, Polychromatic - Keystone showcased the ""Aphrodite Collection"", a complete beauty treatment formulated with a patented technique featuring lipid microspheres with encapsulated vitamins and biodegradable ingredients (vitamin E, keratin, Arginine and tea tree oil). In terms of packaging, future innovations could include the ""BeautiLock Airlight Compact"" by Eurovetrocap, a compact box with a patented sealing technology that ensures tightness efficient air with less than 1% weight loss for solvent based products and water, and ""Beaded Lipgloss Pack"" by Toly, designed for beaded lipgloss and featuring a pearl grinding pump."
"Attract One Expert, Cosmogen's new generation skincare applicator","A few months after the launch of Attract One, Cosmogen is presenting a new evolution of its patented applicator. As a matter of fact, Cosmogen has adapted its patented magnet and metal ball system on a tube with a valve. The new system allows the distribution of the formula and permitting the valve to open by pressure of the tube, while maintaining the attractive power of the magnet on the ball. Once the pressure on the tube is released, the valve resumes its position and ensures sealing, preserving the formula from risk of contamination, whether during application or during cleaning with water. The removable and washable Ø12mm ball-applicator provides a skin contact surface that is three times more than a conventional roll on applicator. A second patent protects this new technological challenge. ""Attract One Expert combines the precision of movement, the benefits of massage and the properties of the formula. It is fully customizable and could be like a jewel. It fully caters to the image of prestige care brands,"" says the company. Attract One Expert is particularly suitable for skincare application around the eyes or the mouth. It has been designed for an intuitive use by any kind of consumers. ""The ritual is to distribute the right amount of the formula and then apply it with circular movements on the areas to treat."" Cosmogen suggests that in the morning the applicator is passed under cold water - or kept in the refrigerator - the cold ball-applicator then tightens, tones and de-puffs the skin. ""In the evening and when passed under hot water, it facilitates penetration of the formula, contributes to cells oxygenation and regeneration, and relaxes the skin."" Technical features: – Tube Ø19mm ; Capacity: 7 to 20 ml – Sleeve: PE Mono or multi-layer, Alu-multifoil – Cap: PCTA – Holder PP – Magnet : Neomydium - Ball : Ø12mm, nickel free stainless steel. Patented distribution system. Decoration: Offset ; Silk screening ; Hot stamping ; Labelling ; Varnish ; Metallization ; Lacquering ; Metal overshell"
Lancaster broadens the spectrum of sunscreens,"Born under the sun of the French Riviera in 1946, Lancaster is celebrating its 70th birthday this year. On this occasion, the brand is raising the bar on sun protection with the introduction of Full Light Technology. In 2012, the brand had already completed the traditional protection against UVA and UVB by a protection against infrared radiation; a key factor of skin's premature aging. Lancaster - a brand of the Coty Group - is now addressing the entire solar spectrum. ""UV rays represent less than 10% of the sun's rays, while Infrared rays and visible light represent over 90% of the sun's radiation and can reach the deepest layers of the skin, accelerating premature aging. Despite this, traditional sunscreen's only offer UVA and UVB protection,"" explains the brand. According to Lancaster, each wavelength in the solar spectrum corresponds to perceptible damage to the skin: UVB rays are responsible for sunburn, UVA rays accelerate skin aging and disrupt proper cell balance, and infrared rays damage dermal collagen and elastin fibres, which in the long-term leads to a reduction in the skin's firmness and elasticity. As for visible light, for many years scientists thought that it did not have any harmful effect on the skin. However, Lancaster claims that years of scientific research have allowed lifting the veil on its real impact. ""A creator of free radicals, visible light causes cell dysfunction, which contributes to accelerated skin aging,"" says the brand. To address this issue, Lancaster's Full Light Technology targets 100% of the sun's spectrum by simultaneously absorbing, reflecting and neutralizing the different waves in the light spectrum, thus minimizing their harmful effects on the skin. Lancaster's Full Light Technology features a patented combination of UV filters to absorb UVB and UVA rays, along with the visible light in the solar spectrum, and a reflective complex, made of ruby powder and Bioactive Glass spheres, that reflects each wavelength and thus forms an invisible shield on the skin's surface. Eventually, Lancaster has selected powerful antioxidants (including green coffee, bitter orange bark, pongania and green tea extracts and sea buckthorn berries) able to neutralize the free radicals induced by the entire solar spectrum."
"""Data speed up the development process of perfumes"", Guillaume Bourdon - Quinten","If one aspect of perfumes still makes people dream, it is their creation process. Brands are definitely aware of this, so they put their perfumers in the spotlight, like authors in their own right. It is quite hard to imagine what part Big Data can play in this creative process; and yet, they are actually gaining importance, without devaluing the strength of creativity, according to Guillaume Bourdon. Quinten is already working with major cosmetics groups and three great perfumers of the industry. ""We contribute to perfumes' development and R&D by speeding up the development process, helping the perfumer focus on his own creativity and artistic direction,"" the Director explains. During the competition phase, the process developed by Quinten makes it possible for the composition house to meet brands' requirements by capitalizing on the work done by all its creative team over about two years. ""We work on a database provided by the company, which gathers data from the two previous years. It corresponds to more than 200 formulas, each of them containing 100 to 150 ingredients at various doses. Analyzing these anonymized, encrypted data enables to identify the two or three common ingredients which, if they are combined, can generate the same sensorial perception and optimum satisfaction,"" Guillaume Bourdon specifies. ""We just seek the best internal practices."" Thanks to its algorithms, Quinten finds the winning formula to develop products corresponding to market expectations. In addition, the company provides a smart tool to the trade expert in the form of an application to make it easier to exploit the bank of results. This very concrete dimension of the use of data has been gaining widespread acceptance among companies. ""Whether it be for various industries, insurance, the media, or cosmetics, our job is to work on an operational issue to generate value, by concretely enhancing the performance of the phenomenon of interest,"" Guillaume Bourdon comments. Indeed, three perfumes among the ten best sellers in the world were designed with the help of Quinten. Within the broader Big Data debate, the expert drums out the importance of determining three elements before collecting any data: the issues, the stakes, and the objectives. ""The idea is not to make information available at all costs, but to help a company implement the strategic changes induced by the data,"" he concludes."
Geka combines emotion and technology with new make-up applicators,"At the Cosmopack 2016 tradeshow, Geka showcased a series of innovative applicators conceived to match with the 2017 spring summer trends identified by the company. The new endlessSPHERE mascara brush promises ""impressive volume, fantastic lengthening and silky shine in black."" Thanks to the patented Hypno cut with three volume zones, plenty of mascara is absorbed and evenly applied to the lashes. The triangular shape of the brand-new EOSdelta fibre separates the hairs perfectly. The brush was presented in a new packaging in rosé-gold with a shiny bottle and a matte cap, thanks to a special additive in the master-batch. The other mascara brush launch is focusing on 3D volume effect. Thanks to Geka's patented sandwich technology, and the new lashLADY mascara brush precisely lifts lashes, while the transparent, super-fine bristles reach the finest lashes and encase them with the mascara. The packaging is gleaming metallic. The new lip gloss applicator softDEFINITION offers the possibility to achieve a sensuous shimmering finish. It allows the lips to gleam in an ""exquisitely soft pink."" The spatula evenly applies the creamy texture with the flattened side. Then the tapered applicator conjures up an ultra precise contour. The cap provides a nostalgic and futuristic look with its brand new individual marble effect master batch. Eventually, the smoothLEAF lip gloss applicator offers to create a shiny wet look. ""Super flexible and ergonomically formed, it fits perfectly to all lips. Thanks to the bi-injected 2K wiper with its hard material on the top and flexible material on the base, formulas are perfectly dosed while achieving a secure grip inside the bottle,"" explains Geka. The applicator is presented in a heavy-walled injection blow moulded squared bottle with metallic cap in matte rosé-gold. On the same occasion, Geka Accessories, a wholly owned division of the Geka Group, presented: a cosmetic bag made of polyester, tweezers in stainless steel that help to get eyebrows in shape thanks to their integrated comb, as well as a handy metal mirror with a fluted pattern on the reverse."
Expanscience diversifies its offering with a first slimming active ingredient,"Made from maca, a small plant known for its invigorating properties that grows on the Andean plateaus, Macaline combines three effects: it slims by shedding fat and limiting fibrosis in the fat cells; reduces puffiness by strengthening the blood vessels' structure and improving microcirculation; and firms the skin by restoring the dermal matrix. Clinical trials have been conducted on 33 women of normal BMI (Body Mass Index) to prove the active's efficacy. ""After the subjects used a cream formulated with Macaline for 56 days, we observed a 31 cm3 reduction in thigh circumference, a 44% increase in temperature consistency compared to the placebo, and firmer skin tissue,"" says Armelle Le Peniec, Director of Cosmetic Active Ingredients at Laboratoires Expanscience. Furthermore, Macaline is an eco-designed active ingredient. To produce it, Laboratoires Expanscience decided to give priority to endemic species by exclusively using maca leaves from the plant's area of origin - Latin America. As a result, Expanscience sources maca leaves from Peru and encourages respect for traditional farming practices: the land is cultivated for two years then left fallow for the next ten. It also helps producers with their economic and social development in conjunction with its local partner. The maca supply chain is overseen by the commitment standards of Laboratoires Expanscience's ""Responsible plant supply chains."" As part of this and our other supply chains, Expanscience's sourcing practices are subject to evaluation by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), of which Expanscience has been a member since 2011. With the launch of Macaline, Expanscience has rounded out its line of cosmetic active ingredients with a product devoted to body care. ""After developing the segment of active ingredients for the face, we wanted to revitalize the body and hair care segments,"" says Armelle Le Peniec. Launched in France during the Cosmetagora exhibition, Macaline has already attracted a number of customers, according to the company. ""To help customers make plans for this active ingredient, we also developed a ready-to-use formula made with Macaline that is designed to inspire their creativity,"" adds Armelle Le Peniec."
The big data revolution is well underway in the cosmetics industry,"Will it soon be possible to enhance, with the help of computers, the perfumer's expertise? Assist his nose to consistently design successful fragrances? In theory, the principle is simple: use huge databases (of raw materials, sensory perceptions, consumer preferences) and combine them, using powerful algorithms. Yet who could seriously imagine that the creator of the next Chanel No. 5 – or, in another area, that the author of the next Guernica - could be an algorithm? We must always be prepared for surprises with Google, who already creates paintings – sold up to 8,000 dollars – with the help of intelligent machines, but then, replacing artists by statisticians is another story... Nevertheless, massive data revolution is already well underway and the perfume-cosmetic sector is not lagging behind. ""The scope of application of big data is very vast, from banking to perfumery and it can address such matters as fraud risk or business growth, like for example the appeal to products,"" explained Patrick Zerbib, a zettafox co-founders, a start-up specialized in knowledge extraction from large amounts of data using machine learning technologies. With a background in management consulting, Patrick Zerbib is convinced that big data is ripe ""to move from being predictive to prescriptive."" The aim being to respond precisely to the strategic issues of companies. The analysis of massive databases has long been used for descriptive purposes (in national statistics, for example). With advances in IT and the over-abundance of data retrieved from new technologies, companies are increasingly seeking to predict consumer behaviour. And once reality has been well described and future scenarios anticipated, it is then very tempting to want to take action. ""Beyond prediction, the prescriptive dimension of big data is all the more interesting that the implementation of tracks identified with predictive analysis can concretely be materialized,"" emphasised Patrick Zerbib. His method consists in collecting large amounts of characterizing data, to best identify all the elements likely to influence consumer behaviour. ""We therefore never limit our analysis to our customers' internal data, we always integrate external data."" zettafox also conducted analyses in the perfume sector to maximize the sensory perception of a fragrance. ""For example, to maximize the clean smell effect delivered by the fragrance in a soap or a detergent or to optimize the technical impact of a general public fragrance. Our role is complementary to the one of 'noses' and their subjectivity, by bringing statistical objectivity."" For this, zettafox relies in particular on the data collected by fragrance houses during the consumer tests they have been consistently conducting for years. In such cases, we are far from the huge amount of data, usually associated with big data, we refer to it more as Smart Data - high value data but in small quantities. Algorithms must therefore be able to compensate for the relatively small amount of available data, which includes on top of it, a very large number of variables. ""Our algorithms will select variables in order to set up combinations, formulation scenarios, likely to maximize the desired sensory experience,"" detailed Patrick Zerbib. Scenarios that can also be tested. The algorithms developed by zettafox have also been used to optimize fragrance formulas. ""The aim in particular, is to compact the formula by reducing the number of ingredients used while maintaining the same impact."" Algorithms can target combinations that maximize the olfactory aim and remove ingredients that reduce or have no olfactory impact. With these scenarios we can then work on finding the most effective formulas from an economic point of view, the most cost effective or the easiest to implement. ""In the case of perfume formulas, the additional challenge is that we work blindly,"" added Patrick Zerbib. ""The composition of formulas is kept secret, which means ingredients are coded, we don't know their names. It is the customer who then decodes our results."" In theory data mining can be used in an unlimited number of areas. For instance, zettafox has applied its techniques to sampling distribution or to the transformation rate in duty free stores. One can very well imagine using specific algorithms to maximize the impact of a packaging, the texture or the sensory accuracy to a product. Provided the necessary data is available! But when companies specialized in this area are called upon it is often because companies have already started collecting data and - overwhelmed by the flows - they need to structure them. Arranging and processing all this amount of data obviously represents the bulk of the task. Especially since the very principle of big data is to integrate data, which at first seems totally unrelated. While, on the one hand, most companies and brands do not have the storage infrastructure nor, a fortiori, the appropriate processing technologies, they can still get help. On the other hand, companies must learn to increase their contacts with customers to collect as much data as possible. For manufacturers, the challenge is clearly not to leave this knowledge in the hands of distributors alone, who will not share it."
"Doe Eyes Brush, Albéa's new double-sided mascara brush debuts in Los Angeles","Doe Eyes Brush, the latest creation of the Albéa Tips Studio platform, is a plastic double-sided brush with an amazing design, specifically conceived to mimic the makeup artist's specific touch. The circular grooves on one half of the brush allow to load the lashes and to lock in curl, while the comb side distributes the product for intense volume and perfect design of the lashes The Doe Eyes Brush allows either to apply the mascara formula on top of lashes like a professional, or to opt for a more traditional makeup. Albéa's Doe Eyes brush acts as a lash tool and will be showcased for the first time on the West Coast during the MakeUp in Action event at the Quixote Studios in Los Angeles on 3-4 February 2016. The Tips Studio is the platform that brings together Albéa's expertise and experience in makeup applicators, from fibre or plastic mascara brushes to lipgloss, eyeliner and other beauty tips. Thanks to their own innovation and development methodologies, the Tips Studio teams get a perfect knowledge and understanding of women's needs and expectations as well as of the latest market trends. Rapid prototyping methods have also been deployed to enable the production of new brushes in reduced time. Every year, Albéa launches about 20 new applicator designs and prototypes. Albéa offers complete brush and bottles for mascaras and other makeup products through its global production facilities (US, Europe, China and Brazil) and integrated injection, assembly, decoration and surface treatment tools."
FrenchTech breaks the codes of cosmetic innovation,"Presented last October at the Cosmetic 360 show, I-feel Beauty won general approval for the Technological Innovation Award. The principle is based on the ""IoT-C"", the Internet of things applied to Cosmetics, which combines both technology and actives in the same box. The latter is composed of a four-product range – face and body care products with premium formulas highly concentrated in 82% natural ingredients – and of the Activ'feel device, which acts in synergy with the products by creating bipolar micro-currents and providing a LED photodynamic treatment. ""We wanted to find a safe way to get through the dermis and powerfully enhance our actives' efficacy,"" explains Christophe Bianchi, founder and CEO of parent company Feeligreen. The micro-currents stimulate the synthesis of fibroblasts, collagen, and elastin, and contribute to carrying more of the actives contained in the products into the upper layers of the epidermis. Activ'feel is connected via Bluetooth to the Feeligold application installed on a smartphone to control and supply the current strength depending on the information collected. ""This technology helps consumers enhance the efficacy of the treatment, customize it, since each protocol varies according to the skin type or the area covered, and obtain the data collected to develop a tailor-made skincare offering, if they allow for it,"" adds Christophe Bianchi. That is actually the point of the connection. After essential data have been collected via the application with each diagnosis, they can be used by consumers to meet their customization needs, or even by brands, which will be able to enhance the innovation process and provide targeted and personalized solutions by getting involved in the system. Stanislas Vandier and Jean-Roch Meunier, the co-founders of Wired Beauty, were also willing to place consumers at the core of the innovation process when they developed MAPO, the first tailor-made connected beauty mask. These unique silicone masks are based on a picture of the user and on the 3D vision of her face. They comprise cutting-edge sensors and mainly fulfil two functions: measuring hydration and the skin temperature – the data are transmitted to the application installed on the smartphone – and boosting the effect of the cream applied, whatever the brand. Again, the data collected belong to the users, who can choose to share them with a brand so as to have access to product references adapted to their profiles. ""We are paving the way for a new, completely personalized era in cosmetics routines,"" comments Stanislas Vandier. The Figure solution developed by start-up Romy, one of the sector's pioneers in these UFOs, adds something more to the possibility of establishing diagnoses via the application and customizing products: it shows a high yield of actives. Just like the Nespresso model, the Romy technology consists of a device (Figure) – a real home laboratory – two capsule collections, the bases for obtaining the right textures, and the actives, at a concentration of 0.2ml – and all this without any preservatives. The single-dose form of this technology patented in collaboration with Professor Gérard Redziniak makes it possible to use the ingredients at an exceptionally high concentration. Once the analysis of the personal data has been carried out in real time, the application recommends the most appropriate choice of actives, and Figure immediately takes care of preparing the skincare product. ""Romy foreshadows a new approach to the use of most sophisticated ingredients, making them available to consumers,"" explains Morgan Acas, who co-developed this innovation launched last September with Thomas Dauxerre, after five years working on R&D. If these innovations became available for presale a few months ago, they have already found their own public on the main French and global markets, despite a high entry-level price point: 350 euros for the I-feel Beauty box, 199 euros and 590 euros for MAPO mask and Figure pre-orders. ""We attract a certain profile of consumers, 30-45-year-old women with a high purchasing power who are receptive to technologies and seeking differentiation and personalization,"" specifies Morgan Acas. As they are all aware it will be crucial to organize an efficient distribution circuit and a well-adapted communication campaign, they have already been working on improving both technologies and products so they can be quickly available. No doubt this approach will soon become widespread."
Yves Rocher creates a complete range for the iconic Riche Crème,"This absolutely cult product is sold every five seconds in the world, so it deserved particular attention. ""We had to change it all, without changing anything. We wanted to preserve this loyalty relationship with our customers, but also make the range evolve to attract new women,"" explains Xavier Ormancey, Head of R&D at Yves Rocher. Riche Crème has become a complete range, as it now counts eight products, instead of only two before. The formula has been renewed in accordance with the Botanical Beauty® expertise and the latest Yves Rocher research on assimilation by bio-affinity with plants with the skin. The formula is still based on the complementarity of 30 precious vegetable oils with essential constituent fatty acids, but it now also integrates five new substitutes, including the Anatolian thousand-rose oil, which acts on cell renewal. The flagship anti-aging range promises to nourish, protect, and rejuvenate mature skins. It is composed of the 100% plant-derived Beauty Elixir, the Comforting Anti-Wrinkle Lotion, a Day Anti-Wrinkle cream and another night cream, the Intense Regenerating Care cream, the Regenerating Balm Intense Nutrition, the Comforting Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream, and the Regenerating Body Milk. The new design preserves the brown colour code brightened up with gold that is specific to the Riche Crème."
Aptar's Note revives the sensuality of perfume application,"In order to address the slowdown in the fragrance market, especially in mature markets, Aptar Beauty + Home relies on innovation. ""We need to entice, surprise and re-inspire through ideas that, above all, are focused on the consumer experience,"" explains the company. With Note, Aptar brings us a new way to experience fragrance, blending intimacy, elegance and sensuality. The dispensing expert has reinvented a timeless technique from an era when fragrance used to be applied to the skin with a delicate, simple finesse using a glass stopper. It is this delicate touch, which has all but vanished to give way to the spray but still lives on in the collective memory of brands and consumers alike, that Aptar Beauty + Home wants to revive. Note is a transparent applicator. Each time you open the cap, the applicator fills itself automatically, ready to apply the fragrance gradually through capillary action upon contact with the skin. Note offers a gentle and gradual application in all the right places. ""In this respect, it is also in line with modern trends, where the consumer is in control, choosing the dose and where to apply it,"" explains Sabine Bouillet Lubot, Strategic Marketing Manager Fragrance at AptarGroup. ""We especially recommend Note for highly concentrated fragrances, such as eaux de parfum, elixirs, absolutes, intense perfumes, and extracts,"" she adds. The applicator has been tested with consumers in four countries (France, China, Brazil and China). According to Aptar, it has always been highly appreciated. ""Including in Brazil, where consumers are used to apply perfumes very generously, Note is perceived as very suitable for night applications."" In order to ensure consumers can appreciate the full Note experience, Aptar Beauty + Home recommends including some application tips: Use Note to apply fragrance by dabbing it on the pulse points. For varying levels of seduction, apply behind the ears all the way down to the nape of the neck, your wrists, and your neckline. If you want to leave a thrilling scented trail with each and every movement you make, apply to the crook of the elbow and even behind the knee. To illustrate the extent of possible design options beyond the stock product, Aptar Beauty + Home worked with design agency Servaire & Co who studied five possible tracks: vegetal, writing, compact, key. Also illustrating the possibilities of this innovation, Note has already been chosen by Dior, one of the most prestigious French fragrance brands, it for its leading line. ""This unparalleled technique makes J'adore Touche de Parfum an absolute technological gem. We were blown away by this new system for applying fragrance and knew right away that it was a perfect fit for the product we were developing. We needed a new application method, something different than that of a traditional fragrance. In other words, a highly feminine and precise touch. On top of that, we were looking to make a bottle for women on the go, for them to carry in their purse and reapply at any time throughout the day,"" explained the team behind J'adore by Parfums Christian Dior."
Nails Inc. launches world's first spray-paint nail polish,"The Paint Can requires users to sweep a quick layer of basecoat over the nails before spraying the colour over the fingertips from a distance of 10-15cm, leaving the pigmentation to adhere to the basecoat. According to the brand, a quick rinse with warm, soapy water should then ensure that any excess colour is washed off from around the fingers and nail bed, leaving an even coating of polish. Nails Inc. is branding the product ""the World's fastest manicure"". ""After years in the making I am incredibly excited to be launching the Paint Can. Our customers have been screaming out for ways to reduce dry time and for quick, easy ways to apply colour when on the go,"" explains Nails Inc. Founder Thea Green on the brand's site. The invention is currently available to pre-order at nails.inc.com in two different shades - ""Shoreditch Lane"", a mid-grey hue, and ""Hoxton Market"", a deep pink. The retail price is £10 (approximately US$15 or EUR14)."
Aptar creates a new beauty gesture for facial skincare targeted applications,"""In response to the consumers' demand for more effective products, there has been a proliferation of smart applicators in recent years,"" said Sandra Martins Reis, Strategic Marketing Manager for Skincare & Make-up at AptarGroup. ""However, we were able to identify a series of recurring problems among the skincare pens currently available on the market: they require a two-stage use (to click or turn to release the product before applying it). Furthermore, they only deliver a standard dose, which cannot be modulated, often too important for an expert skincare,"" she adds. In order to solve these problems, Aptar has entirely revamped the pump's architecture thus allowing adjustable side actuation and continuous formula dispensing. This innovation is equipped with a soft and smooth membrane delivering a bespoke formula dose in one simple press. The more you press, the more you get. Skin Master is also equipped with three standard tips for three different types of application and three sensations on the skin. – Velvet touch, an elastomer applicator recreating the massaging effect of the finger. – Cool touch, made of zamak, for a cold sensation that helps to stimulate microcirculation. – Icy touch, a ceramic applicator producing a ice-cold sensation that is the ultimate ally of products targeting the eye contour area. All three applicators are flexible, allowing optimal control of the application. Thanks to its piston airless system, Skin Master guarantees a high rate of product delivery while ensuring maximum protection of the formula. Eventually, Skin Master can easily be customized by brands. Aptar offers brands the opportunity to create their own applicator designs in order to guarantee the relevance with their own formulas. Skin Master also provides numerous decorations for bespoke finishes: plastic or metal shell finishes and a range decoration options including anodization, colouration, silk screening and labelling."
Mimesis: Perfumes soon to scent salon ambiences,"In France, there are about 80,000 hair salons, half of which are independent. And although the barber shop trend has shown both a real potential for diversification and need for differentiation, perfumes are not sold on this gigantic network. ""Our objective is to manage to do with this channel what a few skincare brands did with pharmacies about thirty years ago: providing a new offering that will not eat into anybody's market share and will generate additional sales,"" Corentin Le Men explains. Within a harsh economic climate that particularly affects the stagnating hair market, it seems a daring challenge. But again, the Mimesis co-founder can see an opportunity here. ""To resist against the crisis and withstand the competition of discount brands, many salons are going for premiumization. And our offer is perfectly suited to this trend."" Especially since, from a marketing standpoint, perfumes seem to be an ideal complement to hair care products. If the latter are very technical and need a certain expertise, they are little aspirational. By contrast, perfumes tell stories and make people dream. Even the technique to sell them is different. ""A hair care product needs explanations and arguments. A perfume must be tested, and this does not require much talking, actually,"" Corentin Le Men adds. ""In a hair salon, where one often has to wait, it is very tempting to test a perfume if there is an opportunity to do so."" And what is more natural than encourage hairdressers to perfume their customers when they are over and done with their hair? Theoretically, these are ideal parameters. ""In fact, the main obstacle is the price,"" Marion Massiot explains. ""At a hairdresser's, one already has to pay for the haircut. So, we need to remain reasonable as far as spending is concerned. That is why we made the choice to present our perfumes in a 30ml format. Thanks to this small size, we can market high-end products for an affordable price: 34 euros."" To this day, the line counts four eaux de parfum (Le Matin du Monde, La Possibilité d'une Fleur, Le Lit à Baldaquin, Le Guépard), which can be applied both on the skin and hair. The four fragrances were created by Karine Dubreuil. They are presented in a standard bottle made by SGD and topped with a tailor-made zamak cap. To this are added two perfumed hair treatments: a Serum de Parfum to nourish, protect the hair, and give it some radiance, and a Brume de Parfum, a mist, to hydrate and protect it from the damages caused by UV rays. Both these products were designed by Catherine Taurin, an expert in hair formulation, who is also a professor at ISIPCA, the French high-profile international school of perfume. The brand was launched in early September in about forty points of sale in France and is due to open its online store at the end of the month. Mimesis aims to inaugurate about a hundred points of sale in autumn 2015, mainly in Paris and large cities across France, and to become a key brand within the next three years. The brand only targets independent salons, in particular those that have created a boudoir atmosphere or a warm, cosy ambience. Conversely, it also intends to become the number one hair brand of niche perfume shops. Outside the French market, Mimesis will mostly develop on English-speaking markets – the United Kingdom and the United States, to start with – where hair care is already very successful, and niche perfumery is booming."
"Axilone: A ""One Hand"" lipstick mechanism based on simplicity and low production costs","To provide a solution to the requirements of mass market brands generating large volumes and targeting young female consumers, Axilone has imagined a « One Hand » lipstick. Its originality: made on one piece, the base and the top connected by a hinge. The design has its advantages in terms of production costs. To use it, simply raise the top and turn the mechanism accessible through a window, all with one hand: a new, innovative and practical gesture. This one handed manipulation reflects a general trend in behaviour: doing several things at the same time! On the telephone, in the car, while walking, women check the way they look, put on make-up, mascara and perfume [1]. Re-doing lipstick is the task repeated most often. Made in Polypropylene (PP), the lipstick can be finished with a chape metal trimming in aluminium to satisfy the needs of more selective markets. « Controlling the feasibility of packaging techniques, finding the industrial solution internally, and remaining in touch with market needs, » is the credo of Jean-Paul Dénécé, the company's Head of Innovation. At Axilone, innovation is an essential feature of any industrial solution. An innovation supervisor appointed to each site and department means that approximately ten employees are directly involved. Each and everyone must submit ""astonishment reports"": remarks and notes on a fact, object, technique, wherever from and appealing to the packaging sector. These techniques are implemented in all the fields of expertise of the company specializing in stoppers and lipstick tubes. An industrial know-how that covers the whole process or plastic injection moulding and aluminium stamping (design, moulding, production, assembly) and all types of finishings and decorations (anodising, metal plating, lacquering, tampography pad printing, hot stamping, engraving...)."
MakeUp in Paris 2015: a colourful and record breaking edition,"The trend at MakeUp in Paris this year was for bold and colourful products. ""Whereas Seoul was very focused on innovation and technology, Paris is about bright colours and creativity,"" explains Show Manager and Co-Founder Sandra Maguarian. However, that isn't to say that the show was lacking in cutting-edge ideas - in fact it featured an installation called The Innovation Tree displaying 22 of the industry's leading products at the forefront of modernity. Highlights included the Cooling Stick Blusher by Thailand's S&J International, which uses aqua technology to cool the skin as it is applied, and the Petite Boite à Beauté by MKTG Industry - a re-usable 100% cardboard holder for products such as eyeshadows, bronzers or blushers which can be refilled to minimize the waste generated by packaging. Also featuring on the Innovation Tree was Lancôme's new Triangle Zone Brush, an innovation developed in partnership with French supplier Cosmogen and which allows users to adjust their desired foundation coverage by altering the length of the brush. Cushion Liner by Pascual Cosmetics is the latest version of the 'cushion' application trend, offering eyeliner in 'foam' form for a super sharp application. A new generation of 'Permanent eyeliners' are also on display courtesy of German company Bomo Trendline. As for formulation, ABC Texture highlighted its Matte Lipstick with a second skin and long lasting effect but free from volatile silicone and therefore not requiring a sealed pack. The Color Shine BB Lip Balm showcased by French company Alkos was another interesting innovation in lipstisck as it combined a SPF 20 and a non-sticky texture. Alkos also introduced its latest Jumbo Twist, an eyeshadow with a creamy texture ultra easy to blend, for up to 15h of longwearing, waterproof intense colour. This year's show featured 126 exhibitors, the largest number to date, and it also significantly outperformed its previous record in terms of visitors. Actually, more than 3,200 visitors visited the 6th edition of MakeUp in Paris, according to the organizers, compared to 2,804 last year. The various conferences and workshops organized this year on topics as diverse as connected beauty, emerging makeup trends or the particularities of makeup markets in Brazil and the United Kingdom have attracted a total of 1,200 participants. The ""MakeUp in"" shows will now head to New York on 09-10 September and Sao Paulo later on 08-09 December 2015."
Nocibé customers can now create their own personalized perfume online,"Web users can play perfumer to create wholly personalized feminine or masculine fragrances by first selecting a type of perfume among five categories available (""sporty"", ""glamour"", ""sensual"", ""natural"", and ""feminine"" for feminine fragrances, or ""sporty"", ""charismatic"", ""wild"", ""manly"", and ""dynamic"", for masculine fragrances) and a base note (""classic"", ""oriental""…), and then finalizing the personalization by adding up to six notes among a selection of 50. Unique Fragrance has developed an online, large scale version of the mix and match trend some brands have already been riding for a while. Unique perfumers have made sure the six notes selected match and create a true olfactory harmony. ""Our experts have developed all the ingredients to produce the perfect mixture with base, middle, and top notes. This way, our customers can easily manage to create their own perfume,"" the company explains. Once the fragrance has been finalized, web users can also choose among about fifteen different bottles (rectangle, square, or round-shaped, in transparent, black or red-coloured, or even gold glass, or inlaid with Swarovski crystals) that they can personalize with a message, a name, or even a picture. ""All in all, more than 150 billion unique compositions are possible,"" Nocibé affirms. Each fragrance is created by Unique perfumers in the Berlin or New York City laboratories. The tailor-made perfumes are available as from 69.90 euros for a 50ml eau de parfum. It takes between 5 and 7 working days to create and deliver them, and customers can have a free second try if they are not satisfied with the first fragrance, or they can be reimbursed."
Walgreens targets the multicultural market with exclusive colour cosmetics line,"Walgreens is launching an exclusive masstige colour cosmetics line that will be available in the dugstore chain top-selling beauty doors across all the U.S.A. as well as at walgreens.com and drugstore.com. Called Circa, the new beauty brand consists of premium makeup artist quality formulas for eyes, face and lips at accessible prices ranging from USD 8 to USD 15. Walgreens, the largest drugstore chain in the U.S.A. [1], said its aim is to ""increase accessibility to well-priced, diverse, specialty beauty offerings."" The Circa line, which includes 133 SKUs in total, has been designed to address the varied needs of the multicultural market. The various shades have been selected to ""work across the lightest and darkest of skin tones, through the use of high-performance formulations, rich pigments and innovative technologies"". In a demographic context where women currently considered as belonging to ethnic minorities will constitute the majority of the U.S. population within the next thirty years, Walgreens intends to offer a go-to brand for women of all ethnicities. So, it is not a coincidence if Latina actress Eva Mendes was chosen to help craft the new brand. ""As a Latin woman, it was important to me that we create a line of products that work for all women and is accessible without compromising quality,"" she said. Shoppers at Walgreens should be able to catch a glimpse of the screen diva as she is scheduled to make some in-store appearances to launch the first Circa collection. Much more than a Latin icon, Eva Mendes is also an incarnation of the timeless Hollywood glamour. With Circa, Walgreens also intends to celebrates nostalgia, romance and classic elegance and to tap into the professional makeup trend. Circa will thus cater to make-up artists, offering an online shop where they can buy products at a discounted rate. ""Our customers are continually searching for quality products at an affordable price, and we're thrilled to offer Circa as part of our ever-expanding portfolio,"" said Shannon Curtin, group vice president, Walgreens personal care and beauty. ""This collaborative cosmetics line is bringing Walgreens shopper the slice of luxury she's looking for at a price point she values."" The Circa line were developed for Walgreens by Maesa, a company that specializes in private label and exclusive cosmetic brands for retailers as well as packaging and turnkey products for beauty brands. ""Building Circa was incredibly rewarding, the ability to work with Eva Mendes along with our own team to build such amazing formulas and gorgeous packaging was a true privilege. I know that once people start using the products they will be amazed with the quality and become devoted to the brand,"" commented Renee Ryan, vice president of marketing at Maesa."
Sampling: Arcade launches Easylip,"Easylip is Arcade's new technology for the sampling of lipsticks. It is based on a Brazilian patent acquired by Arcade. According to Arcade, ""Easylip is a smart and economical way to present a product and advertise a brand."" In particular, the product can be applied without any applicator. Furthermore, Easylip can be printed in four different colours and two sizes: – Small, 55mm x 28mm – Large 55mm x 56 mm"
bareSkin: bareMinerals goes liquid,"""The powder or compact format is not adapted to all women. According to a usage and attitude study we conducted in the United States, 66% of women who wear foundation are liquid enthusiasts,"" explains Sophie Ifrah, Marketing Manager for France. ""We had no solution to offer until now, and we wanted to provide an alternative with what makes us strong and legitimate"". Here again, the new liquid formula of bareSkin™ is composed of mineral pigments coated with jojoba, the whole being in suspension in a base derived from coconut. It combines its coverage effect and brightening power in a mixture enriched with vitamin C and lilac stem cells. ""We really devoted ourselves to the formula to obtain a serum foundation with skincare and makeup properties available in 20 shades,"" Sophie Ifrah continues. BareSkin™ already seems to have convinced American consumers, who discovered the product in the first semester, as the first statistics ""clearly highlight the development of the complexion category"", according to the brand. BareSkin™ was launched in Europe in early September. It is sold alongside a patented applicator brush specially developed for this product in collaboration with Anisa International, the American company specialized in makeup brushes. It is fitted with a container which can collect a few drops of foundation for an even application and adjustable coverage. ""This way, customers can make this reassuring professional gesture and have the right tool for an optimum application,"" Sophie Ifrah confirms. BareMinerals has benefitted from an exclusive European partnership with Sephora since 2006, and intends to reinforce its presence both on the network and via its online store, the brand's showcase of expression."
Italian fragrance brand Pro Fumum Roma gets happy,"As it often happens in Italy, this is the story of a family. It began in a small southern village, where the Durante family has been passionately creating perfumes for 40 years. In 1996, their fragrances, which were just local and confidential creations, became a true brand, Pro Fumum, and settled to Rome. Then, the brand has been growing up at a small pace, as the family was eager to preserve its authenticity. The three brothers and one sister, Giuseppe Luciano, Felice and Maria, are managing it. In their laboratory, just behind the shop, they jointly create each fragrance, combining their four olfactory styles. They share a common philosophy: to rely each fragrance to life, to the emotions, the sensations and memories that characterize it. ""We like the simplicity that creates emotion, our scents must reach the heart,"" says Felice Durante. The family manufactures the products using a traditional method as well as finely selected ingredients, mostly from Italy.

Yves Saint Laurent intros ink-like foundation,"This summer, Yves Saint Laurent is promising nothing short of a makeup revolution. On August 26, the brand will launch Le Teint Encre de Peau, which it claims is different from any other long-wearing foundation on the market. Inspired by the architecture of ink, the new product combines a weightless texture with serious staying power. In contrast with other long-wearing foundations, which can sometimes feel heavy, Le Teint Encre de Peau claims a weightless liquid consistency. The formula is based on what the brand calls ""sensorial and volatile oils,"" said to quickly evaporate upon contact with the skin and transform from liquid into solid pigments. The product is also rich in active ingredients (both lipophilic and hydrophilic) which work to mattify and moisturize the skin and ensure the makeup stays in place, even when exposed to heat or humidity. Finally, the formula is enriched with tamanu oil, which contributes to its extremely comfortable feel by allowing it to melt into the skin. Known for its moisturizing properties, tamanu oil contains fatty acids that are similar to the skin's natural moisture and also contribute to the skin's luminosity. The result is moisturized skin with a matte finish and coverage that, with its ink-like staying power, remains in place all day long. For this new type of foundation, Yves Saint Laurent chose to introduce an unusual application method. In keeping with the ink theme, Le Teint Encre de Peau comes with an applicator inspired by a calligraphy brush. The delicate slanted tip retains the makeup for ultra-precise application: just dab the right amount of foundation on different parts of the face and then work in the makeup by hand or with a brush. Its practical, anti-drip system also prevents waste (and any potential stains on your shirt before heading out the door)."
OBO: a new way to use perfume?,"With OBO, the perfume can be worn, in every meaning of the word. OBO is a pearl, containing 3 ml of fragrance, worn on the wrist or on the chest as part of a bracelet or a necklace. Simply grasped with the fingertips, detached from its magnetized piece of jewellery and pressed across the skin, it slides on the body to release the perfume. It allows perfuming oneself at any time, up to 20-25 applications on the skin, that's the Fragrance Wear concept invented by the brand. For its launch, OBO is offering three fragrances created by Anne-Sophie Behaghel and Amélie Bourgeois, from the fragrance agency Flair. The three fragrances mark three times of day: Symmetry, Solar Epilogue, 23: 58. The bracelet with three pearls is sold 75 euros, the pendant with three pearls is sold 60 euros, and each pearl is sold 8 euros. Thanks to the relatively low cost of the pearl, the consumer can change the fragrances to suit its desires. This is a totally new way to use perfumes that could be created by this type of product. OBO is carried by a group of designers, engineers and perfumers, in partnership with EATS, a kind of garden centre for innovators integrated to the Aesthete agency, led by Thierry de Baschmakoff, who aims to support young designers. First challenge the OBO team: finding the necessary funding for the brand's development. As a first step, a crowdfunding campaign was launched through Indiegogo."
"Artist by Nocibé, a professional makeup line under a private label","""According to our concept of Beauté Libérée (liberated beauty), we position ourselves between prestige and a private label with Artist. We wanted professional but accessible makeup for all women in terms of understanding and price"", explains Maylis Grand, Private Label Manager at Nocibé. The range is presented on educational furniture, and structured around the three essential steps of professional makeup application: bases, colours and finish. Shades, changing colour effects, 3D effects… anything is possible for those who take pleasure in the art of makeup. ""Nocibé launched its own private label in 2012. Two years later, it now offers 1,200 references in bath products, skincare, accessories and makeup. We are turning towards developing more sophisticated products, such as Anti-aging or Artist by Nocibé for makeup, in addition to the essential, initial and more basic range,"" Maylis Grand explains. ""This range offers really good value for money, and to achieve this, we chose to work with an Italian supplier: products made in Italy are matchless in terms of makeup formulation,"" she adds. Special emphasis has been put on training sales consultants, who now learn about the art of professional makeup. Consulting and awareness-raising of customers will be relayed through tutorials on the website and social networks. Apart from its 465 sales outlets (almost 600 after Douglas's takeover), Nocibé also banks on Bellista by Nocibé, its future network exclusively dedicated to private labels, two stores of which are currently under test in Leers and Evry. This specific channel should spread out over the year, as the visual identity of Nocibé sales outlets is being redesigned and standardized. With this new professional makeup line, Nocibé intends to increase its store traffic. ""Nocibé is a perfume network above all, which means people come to visit us three times a year on average, therefore we still have many people to target"", Maylis Grand explains."
Axilone: From astonishment to innovation,"Under the management of Jean-Paul Dénécé, innovation at Axilone (turnover: 110 million euros in 2013, staff: 1,825) involves more or less everyone. An innovation supervisor appointed to each site and department means that approximately ten employees are directly involved. Each and everyone must submit ""astonishment reports"": remarks and notes on a fact, object, technique, wherever from and appealing to the packaging sector. ""This is the starting point for a project that will need to be investigated further, and which will require its substance to be enhanced. May be there will be no future for the idea, who minds,"" the company says. Jean-Paul Dénécé is eager for an open mind and a 360° inquisitiveness: ""if you stick to the trend, you will be doing like the others!"" However, there are some limits to this open-mindedness. First of all, it is important not to frighten customers away by being too offset from reality. Moreover, it is crucial to ensure the industrial solution is available. Regarding the latter, the fact that Axilone provides in-house tooling and electroplating facilities is a real asset. Vaposphere, one of the five patents registered by Axilone in 2013, is a perfect illustration of what this method can produce. At the outset of the development, there is an observation: considering packaging, the users in the 21st century are focused on ease of use and handling. With the cell-phone permanently held in one hand, one is always multi-tasking. The ""beauty"" efforts are typical of that. While phoning, one is adjusting one's make-up, freshness, or last minute appearance. Axilone creative teams are convinced that tomorrow's gesture will be single-handed. The answer? Vaposphere: a single-handed capping system. One just has to turn the locking ring with two fingers to open the sphere-shaped cap and activate the revealed measuring dispenser or spray. Closing it is as straightforward : one counter-rotation of the ring, and the container is locked. There is no risk of an accident. ""Vaposhere is suitable for make-up, care, or perfume products,"" concludes Axilone, which showcased this innovation at the latest MakeUp in Paris event, on June 12-13 at the Carrousel du Louvre, in Paris."
"TouchUps, Orlandi unveils a biodegradable lipstick sample","The sophisticated, single-use TouchUps® samples sacrifice neither the application, nor the colour. Patented in the United States, the mini format is a lipstick replica, and is wholly made out of biodegradable cellulose. It can be presented as a case available in different colours, also in cellulose, or cardboard. A world first on the sampling segment. Orlandi chose to present this innovation on the occasion of the FCE Cosmetique tradeshow, as a preview on the Brazilian market, where demand is very high. ""Up until now, Brazilian cosmetics brands were driven by growth and could develop without difficulty. Now the market has been getting more sophisticated, which implies they need to differentiate themselves and stand out. Therefore sampling is becoming a real strategy for them"", explains Sven Dobler, CEO of Orlandi. TouchUps® will also be showcased at MakeUp in New York next September."
"""Luxury Carrier Box"", the fusion between a box and a shopping bag","The German company, which produces nearly 20 million shopping bags and 5 million boxes every year, has unveiled its newest innovation on the occasion of the latest edition of the Pack & Gift tradeshow, which was held in Paris on 4-5 June 2014. The ""Luxury Carrier Box "" (patent pending) combines the practicality of a shopping bag with the sturdy protective qualities of a box. ""A true tow-in-one system,"" highlights Leander Kritokos, Procos' founder and president. Besides its elegant design, the ""Luxury Carrier Box"" offers, according to Procos, a wide range of practical advantages with a focus on the environment: – Space-saving: thanks to its folding system, – Cost reduction: thanks to its dual function - box and bag - allowing a reduction in confection costs compared with a separate production of a box and a bag, – Sustainability: thanks to a significant reduction of material consumption and wastage, – Second life : potential domestic storage unit for the consumer. ""We can save up to 50% materials, compared to a box and bag combination, and at a lower cost,"" says Leander Kritikos. The practicality of this coffret-in-a-bag was also carefully studied, both for transport, storage or assembly. Laid flat at delivery, it can be easily built thanks to the stickers or magnets provided for assembling the box. The bag's handle is fully customizable, including its material (cord or ribbon), its colour and type of fabrics, thus adapting to the customer's preferences (carried on shoulder or hand)."
Stradivarius enters makeup market,"The border between the fashion and the beauty industries is known to be thin. Stradivarius has decided to be the next to cross it and to launch its first cosmetic line with a collection focusing on makeup but also including some perfumes. Guaranteed paraben free, the new line includes luscious lip balms in different flavors (melon, tutti frutti, cherry, watermelon), lip glosses in vibrant colors (pink, orange and red), and nail polishes in around 20 shades. Spanish model Sheila Marquez was chosen as the face of this new Spring-Summer 2014 cosmetics collection. The new makeup items will be available in Stradivarius stores from June, at prices between 3.95 euros and 4.95 euros (around US$5.40 - US$6.80)."
Premium Beauty news launches Brazilian edition,"The dynamism of the Brazilian market should enable the country to quickly reach the first rank for most cosmetic product categories. According to Euromonitor, Brazil is already the world's largest market for deodorants and perfumes, and is second for hair products, bath products, men's grooming, and sun care, and ranks at the third place for makeup products.

Algotherm launches ocean-friendly sun care range,"According to Algotherm, almost 25,000 tons of sun cream are estimated to be spread across the Earth's oceans every year – about 0.8 litre per second. The problem is, some of the UV filters used to protect the skin from the sun's harmful rays are suspected of having a negative impact on marine biodiversity, and coral in particular. According to some studies, 10 % of the world's coral reefs may be threatened by the impact of sun creams. In light of this hypothesis, not only the disappearance of these corals is at stake, but the whole related ecosystem is in danger. For the launching of Algosun, its new and first sun care range for several years, Algotherm decided to deal with this problem firmly, and thus developed a non-ecotoxic formula. ""As a marine cosmetic brand, we are obviously one of the first concerned,"" explains Stéphanie Motier, Communication Manager. The new range is composed of three sun protection products, an SPF 50+ Age Protect Sun Cream, an SPF 30 Age Protect Sun Lotion and an SPF 20 Age Protect Sun Oil, as well as two after-sun care products, a Repair Moisturizing Fluid face & Body and a Repair Sublime Oil Body & Hair. At the core of the formulas lies a patented marine and plant complex which combines karanja vegetable oil derived from the Pongamia tree (pongamia pinnata) – an Indian tree renowned for its skin protecting and antibacterial properties – and red seaweed (porphyra umbilicalis) exhibiting anti-aging properties thanks to its natural protection against the harmful effects of sun rays. The complex also contributes to the anti-UVA and anti-UVB protection of the products. In order to ""limit the impacts on the marine ecosystem"", the Algosun range was formulated only with mineral filters – titanium dioxide and zinc oxide –, and no nanoparticles. The brand also chose not to use any parabens or phenoxyethanol. In addition, extensive research work was conducted to assess the safety of the formulations for the marine environment, and in particular for seaweed and coral. ""The products were subjected to a series of tests destined to verify their environmental impact,"" underlines Émilie Simon, R&D Manager at Algotherm. ""Among others, we followed the OECD assessment methods to evaluate the biodegradability or toxicity on seaweed, for instance, and adapted them to the marine environment,"" she adds. Thanks to the help of the Gelyma laboratory, which is specialized in the study of algae and marine environments, a specific test involving the creation of a marine microenvironment in an aquarium was even developed. In order to highlight and support their own efforts in terms of environmental protection, Algotherm has concluded a three-year partnership with French TV magazine Thalassa, which has been broadcast on the France 3 channel since 1975. A cardboard insert has been slipped into all the products destined for sale to raise public awareness of the problems related to sun care product toxicity for the marine environment, and to support the development of exclusive formulations."
Procter & Gamble gives hair care some volume,"Similarly to other hair dye manufacturers, the Wella Professionals R&D department has been working for several years on its formulas to significantly reduce allergy risks. As a result, the brand has just launched Koleston Perfect Innosense, a variant of their hair dye range Koleston Perfect which contains a different molecule, ME+, as a substitute for the PTD (para-toluenediamine) and PPD (para-phenylenediamine) incorporated in most hair dyes. Ammonia is often pointed out as an allergen but, according to P&G, the molecules responsible for most allergenic reactions are PTD and PPD, though they are inherent to the colouring action. By developing ME+, the Wella Professionals laboratory kept the original molecule that is essential for the colour to remain intense and last longer, but modified its shape, so that the T-cell receptors which trigger the allergy cannot attach to it that easily. This technological breakthrough was rewarded by the ECARF (European Centre for Allergy Research Foundation) quality label, and resulted in the creation of twenty shades, from raven black to platinum blond. This time, P&G Beauty has decided to tackle thin and sparse hair problems with the Nioxin range. The brand has thus developed Diaboost, a new no-rinsing hair care product which they affirm can penetrate deep in the heart of the hair fibre to make it thicker. The formula contains a combination of three actives: caffeine, to stimulate hair growth and increase the hydration rate, niacinamide (vitamin B3) and panthenol (provitamin B5), to reinforce the fibre. Diaboost is only available in hairdressing salons. It can be used as such, or as a complement to six Nioxin products: shampoos and conditioners, or additional solutions. Ultimately, Drynamic, the dry shampoo by Sebastian Professional, now doubles its action with an innovative technology. It is both a hair care and styling product, as it combines the Reset Foundation system, which contains starch and helps get rid of impurities and of the excess of sebum, and the Recharge technology, which relies on spherical powder particles to facilitate the spreading of the product, unlike the usual cubic particles. According to the brand, this makes hairdressing easier, gives volume, and enables the colour to last longer. It has been available in large and travel-size versions in registered salons since last January."
PR Service Graphique and PO Groupe print fragrances,"The two French companies and members of the Cosmetic Valley have presented the new process at the last edition of the PCD tradeshow, which was held in Paris on 5- 6 February 2014. ""This is unprecedented,"" emphasizes Petra Roth, founder and CEO of PR Service Graphique. ""This technique allows applying a fragrance directly on the CMYK colour printing, with a extremely accurate reproduction quality,"" she adds. This patented innovation now offered by PO Group opens new perspectives to olfactory marketing, including for perfume brands. Indeed, the fragrance can now be integrated directly onto brochures, greeting cards, business cards, printed fragrance blotters, coffrets, paper flowers … together with the printing. Several brands such as Dior and Lancôme, have already tested it in preview. For instance, Lancôme has entrusted PR Service Graphique the design of an embossed, carved, mobile and scented microfiber insert for ""La vie est belle"". Actually, in order to have a perfect compatibility, the fragrance is not mixed with the ink, but applied after printing. Thus, the paper is not impregnated. ""The technique enable us to limit undesirable odours, without requiring the fragrance micro-encapsulation,"" explains Petra Roth. According to PR Service Graphique, the process works with all types of papers and cardboards commonly used in high-end printing. However, preliminary tests are required for each fragrance to ensure its correct restitution. The fragrance suitable for the printing is made in France, but the printing itself can be localized in China, depending on the project's requirements."
An antiseptic mascara brush,"Premium Beauty News - Initially what goal did you have in mind? Dominique Bouvier - In fact, the aim was nothing more and nothing less than to develop an antimicrobial surface treatment on a mascara brush to ensure a better preservation of preparations during their periods of use and storage, to increase the shelf-life of mascara and reduce or eliminate the percentage of preservatives. This project was developed in collaboration with two complementary businesses, the IFTH (French Institute for Textile and Clothing) and a French manufacturer of mascara brushes. Premium Beauty News - What process did you use and what was its principle? Dominique Bouvier - It was of course the subject of a patent and of a registered name, Purcilon®. The development of this product needed to integrate, not only the characteristics of the formula, but also the ones of the formula's container and/or applicator. We know that the formula and container are inseparable to preserve the intrinsic qualities of a mascara and guarantee the product's safe use under normal and foreseeable conditions of use. Without going into the nitty-gritty chemical details of the system, let's say that the principle consists in depositing on the fibres of the mascara brush an insoluble salt composed of a broad spectrum preservative used as a cleaning solution for eye lenses with a good thermal stability and a large size sodium salt. The brush is then dipped in the cation/anion mixture. The brush is rinsed and dried going through a rotary drying system. To obtain a uniform and as homogeneous as possible deposit, several protocols were developed by varying the speed of reaction of reagents, the stirring rate, the drying time. The homogeneity of the deposit was of course monitored through scanning electron microscope (SEM). The nature of the fibres of a mascara brush and their shape has also been screened to identify which quality enabled an optimum adhesion of the treatment and with no release in the formula. The most appropriate fibre was found to be the smooth polyamide fibre (6.12 PA). In the end we observed that the insoluble salt bind to the filaments and that it was stable, did not disintegrate in contact with water, or in contact with the O/W mascara formula. Of course, we defined and objectified, through a series of microbiological studies the ideal quantity of treatment. We developed a specific protocol to demonstrate in a relevant way, the effects of this antiseptic treatment, on the germs usually used in the so-called ""challenge test"". Premium Beauty News - Conclusions? Dominique Bouvier - It is clear that this Purcilon® surface treatment opens new opportunities in mascara preservation, not only because it improves the preservation of the product after opening but because it also limits the concentration and the number of preservatives used in mascaras, thus reducing ocular intolerance. Moreover, it enables to offer wider ranges of shades, without increasing the preservative rate in the formula, some rich pigments are impacted by that, being themselves nourishing substrates for microorganisms; or to safely add nourishing actives in eyelash treatments for a use far removed from the first opening date."
Unilever launches first toothpaste for men only,"""Having a beautiful smile guarantees both professional and personal success."" At least this is one of the main arguments Unilever will put forward in campaigns advertising their latest innovation, White Now Men, a whitening toothpaste formula destined for men only. This is a world first which, according to the group, should contribute to the growth of a dynamic market driven by the increased value given to supply. In France, where White Now Men has been marketed by the Signal [1] brand since the beginning of January, the toothpaste market represents about €450 million, and its value grew by 5 % in 2013 (1 % in volume). White Now Men is based on the Blue Light technology developed and patented by Unilever, and offers instant, temporary whiteness. In practice, users just have to drop a blue pigment onto their tooth surface to neutralize the yellow colouring of teeth and make them visibly whiter after brushing, thanks to an optical effect. This technology already proved effective when the first White Now toothpaste was launched in 2008 as a product destined for the whole family. Then in 2013, a Gold version was added to the range, with higher levels of Blue Light pigments, but it was more specifically targeted at young women. ""We designed it as a real beauty product whose 50 ml travel size made it easy to slip into a handbag"", explains Alice Jactel, Manager of the Signal brand at Unilever. Unilever has thus decided to target men who, according to the group, have very specific needs in this respect: clinical studies conducted in the USA and the UK have shown that, on average, men's teeth are more stained and yellow than women's. And there is a particular reason to this, which is their life hygiene: they consume more tobacco, alcohol, especially red wine, and coffee. And Unilever has another argument: men have different, more pronounced tastes. According to Unilever, demand already exists. Indeed, a Harris Interactive omnibus survey conducted on 480 men in May 2013 revealed that more than 50 % of them already use their own toothpaste, while 29 % share it with the rest of the family. The same study showed ¼ of men would be interested in toothpaste whose taste would be adapted to their preferences. The new Signal White Now Men toothpaste is available in two references: Super Pure was specifically designed to fight against nicotine, coffee, wine and tea stains, and Deep Cool offers a very fresh, lasting taste. Unilever added green pigments to the Blue Light technology, so that teeth can get even whiter and less stained. The point is to guarantee an immediate effect on a sensitive issue since, according to a Signal/GMI study conducted on 420 individuals, men and women alike are convinced their smile is a key element in men's success. A ""cute smile"" would even be the first attractiveness criterion for 47 % of women, before humour, style, glibness or bank accounts. In addition, 86 % of the people polled think a man with white teeth is more attractive than others. Unilever is definitely ready to cash in on such demand and go on putting the toothpaste market forward, as it is greatly stimulated by innovation. The White Now range already holds 6 % of the whole French market, and 30 % of the whiteness sector. White Now Men should be sold between €3.50 and 3.60, about 5 % more than the other references of the range. ""We do think that, just like White Now Gold, it will contribute to driving the market up,"" concludes Alice Jactel."
Serum 7 Renew: is anti-ageing more mature?,"According to Boots, when women reach their fifties the anti-wrinkle problematic gradually turns into a global need to express their vitality. After Serum 7, designed for the first signs of ageing, and Serum 7 Lift for 40-year-old women, the four references in the new Renew range - serum, day cream, night cream and eye contour cream - are intended to reset youth genes with a more thorough action. The term is still pretty taboo in cosmetics; however menopause is perfectly well accepted in this campaign. Indeed when presenting the Serum 7 Renew range, Boots explains it targets post-menopausal women and the specific disruption on their skin caused by hormonal change. The decline in the level of oestrogens that follows slows down cell renewal, which increases skin dryness, brown spots and skin slackening. The protective anti-ageing complex of vitamins A and C, blackberry, ginseng, white lupin and lipopeptides is enriched with a restoring complex of brightening actives, amino-acids, hyaluronic acid and ceramides. The Boots Serum 7 Renew range has been tested on 1,000 women, and thus promises a ""real revolution for post-menopausal women"". The new product was launched at the same time everywhere in Europe, including 3,000 pharmacies in France, and the brand appears as a pioneer by targeting a category of women that have been awaiting adapted solutions. Let's not forget that there will be 1.3 billion people over 65 in the world by 2040."
"SGD, Alkos, Bioplan and Technicaps develop an ""anti jet-lag"" set","The development of travels, whether for leisure or business, means that travel retail is now an indispensable distribution network that offers strong growth and profitability. ""In the next year, the number of airline passengers will exceed 3 billion; for international and local brands, this translates into an equal number of potential buyers to conquer on the ground and in the air,"" says SGD. To illustrate the potentialities of glass in the market, the ""First Class Beauty Set"" developed by SGD and its partners features premium products whose formulas and glass packaging were designed for travelling. ""Small, convenient formats contain radiance and moisturization boosters that will travel with no restrictions."" The set, which was showcased at the latest edition of Luxe Pack Monaco, comprises three products: – ""Ready to Take Off"", a micellar water cleanser held in a protective, travel-proof, plastic-coated bottle, designed to be resistant to shock. In that case, the plastic coating developed with the expertise of SGD Pharmacy, is both a decorative technique and a way to protect the glass. ""Every kind of finish is possible: transparent, opaque, shiny, matte, sparkly, pearlescent or frosted. Screen printing can provide a finishing touch to the design,"" adds SGD. – ""Soft Landing"", a moisturising elixir serum designed for the rescue of tired skin after a long travel. The formula is packed in a travel-friendly roll-on decorated with a faded spraying that always allows seeing how much product is left. ""The 7 ml mini version of this moulded glass bottle lends itself to many applications for skincare, fragrance and make-up products. Paired with a roll-on ball or spray pump, it is perfect for trial kits and travel kits."" – ""Brilliance to Declare"", a creamy pearly eye shadow bursting with shimmering particles The pad printing on the base of the glass jar reveals the exact shade of the formula. ""SGD now offers metallic pad printing, so the colour of the make-up product perfectly matches the colour of the decoration,"" concludes the French glassmaker. ""The project was made entirely from standard containers. The aim was to highlight the benefit of small glass formats to achieve a more qualitative aspect to products developed for travel. More generally, small glass containers may be of interest to all high-end take away formats or products for beauty boxes,"" said Gaëlle Verjus, Marketing Manager at SGD. A development that could permanently reconcile travel, luxury and glass."
Promens' Slidissime: The airless jar combining protection and sensuality,"The increasing use of botanical actives that are sensitive to oxidation, combined with the trends pushing brands to limit or to eliminate preservatives in cosmetic products are making formulas more and more fragile. Furthermore, an increasing number of consumers (40% according to Promens) is reluctant with skin cream jars, which perceived as non-hygienic. While all existing standard airless jars currently on the market are equipped with a lateral or central actuator, standard dispenser or pushing membrane, thus requiring a pressure, Slidissime offers a real new experience. This new gesture, ""The Slide"", evokes both the traditional gesture of the hand collecting the cream on the surface of a jar, and the modern movement of fingers on the touch screens that surround us today. The airless jar Slidissime launched by Promens allows cosmetic creams to be released by a simple slide and to remain fully protected. The slide of the finger on Slidissime is similar to the natural gesture of a caress. Slidissime combines pleasurable beauty rituals with airless protection. The cream dose is obtained by a touch and slide movement. By a simple slide on the membrane, a dose is delivered by the system through its thin hole. Located at the extremity of the touch & slide pump, this hole closes after each dosage, avoiding any air-intake and drying of the formula. The formulation inside the jar has contact neither with air nor with fingers. Slidissime combines the airless pouch technology with a flexible touch & slide pump. Slidissime is an airless jar consisting of a collapsible pouch and an ergonomic flexible airless pump made of 4 parts. It is protected by two international patents. ""Conceived with materials compliant with Food Contact EC directive, Slidissime perfectly answers the needs of the cosmetic market and is compatible with most of the formulae,"" Promens says. Furthermore, Slidissim accepts a large scale of viscosity, from fluid to viscous creams. Slidissime is available in Promens' standard collection of premium cosmetic jars. Two references are available: Diamond 50 ml, a luxury jar with thick walls adapted for prestige skincare collections, and Quartz 50 ml, a compact jar adapted for more ordinary skin care ranges. The jar can be coloured, lacquered, metallized or decorated in-house with hot stamping, silk-screen or pad-printing. However, Slidissime is also a tailor-made solution. Actually, the airless jar technology (pouch and tactile pump) can be integrated specifically into any existing brand jar range. It can also be adapted to others sizes."
Aptar launches Serumony and breaks the rules of beauty serums,"Two years is the time it took to Aptar beauty + home to develop this airless stylus dedicated primarily for the most delicate and precious skin care formulas such as: beauty elixirs, radiance-boosting and youth serums. Furthermore, two big scale consumer tests were used to validate the relevance of the concept and development. Initially, there is a simple observation: serums, which require the precise application of very small product quantities, are usually presented in bottles and applied with pipettes that do not receive full consumer support. ""Consumers say they sometimes have difficulties for filling the pipette or get the correct dose and they also complain with the two hand gesture required to use these products as well as with a hardly optimal product restitution,"" Aptar says. The solution imagined by the manufacturer of dispensing systems takes make-up pens as a starting point and its design evokes the precision of surgical tools. The ergonomics of Serumony is very intuitive since just one press is enough to deliver the exact amount (70 micro litres) of product. Compact and light, it can be easily carried around and can be to place without risk in a handbag or a travel bag. Aptar also conceived Serumony as a genuine protective case serving as a barrier that protects the formula from oxidation and pollution, throughout its use. In addition to the optimum hygiene, the airless system offers and excellent product delivery and security against spills. Serumony is equipped with Aptar's alpha70 pump guaranteeing perfect formula/pack compatibility since there are no metal components in contact with the formula. All the industrial tools having been developed Serumony is ready for market launch. Various decoration options are available, for a full product customization."
How innovation drives makeup,"No less than five roundtables and thirty panellists have succeeded on both days of MakeUp in New York on 25 and 26 September 2013. An opportunity to address the issue of innovation in the makeup industry through avenues varied as ""The interaction between fashion and makeup"", ""Innovation and economic realities"", ""The collaboration between customer and supplier on packaging innovation"", ""Fast to market,"" or even ""The Innovation made in Korea."" For Philippe Jourdan, from research and consultancy firm Promise Consulting Associates Inc., understanding the drivers of innovation of different makeup brands first implies to clearly identify their different territories. According to him, three main categories can be clearly separated: fashion brands, beauty brands (coming from the skin care business), and finally pure makeup brands, often derived from the professional world. For each of these categories, consumer expectations diverge as well as the drivers of innovation. In this context, the influence of fashion is not the same for a brand like MAC, coming from the professional makeup world, and for a brand like Clinique, grown in the skincare field. In any cases, innovation has to face the challenges of reality, with costs coming first. To which, one must add ""time and, more and more often, testing"" says Marc-Andre Houx, President, Shya Hsin Packaging USA. According to him, time is the second key constraint after money. However, Anthony Heraud, Vice President Project & Development, Axilone USA, notes that ""better processes, better dosing are costly to develop but can also lower the costs in the end."" Another important factor, according to Nicole Masson, Vice President, Global Product Development, MAC, is globalisation, which is both an innovation driver, when brands need to address different needs, tastes or climates, and a constraint, when they have to comply with diverging regulations. So it is very important, during the innovation process, ""to focus on the best ideas and concepts and to concentrate investments on them,"" explains Thomas Krasser, Vice President Sales, Schwan Cosmetics, "" After having highlighted the many aspects that can take innovation, including the importance for the makeup sector, of application methods and system of formula protection, Stephanie Martins, Vice President Corporate Development & Packaging North America at L'Oreal, explained how the French cosmetics giant seeks to stimulate the creativity of its suppliers, particularly in the context of Cherry Pack, the event held annually in the group headquarters nearby Paris. For the first time this year, U.S. suppliers have been invited to participate in the event. For his part, John Butcher, Senior Vice President, New Product Support & Engineering at Revlon emphasized the important role of full-service providers when it comes to meet specific market needs or to respond quickly to an emerging trend. Speaking on behalf of suppliers, Charles Chang, CEO of Topline Products, nevertheless recalled that given the amount of money required to innovate, suppliers and customers need to cooperate, exchange information on consumer expectations and strive to limit financial risks. Eric Bone, Corporate Research and Innovation Manager at L'Oreal, said meanwhile that the philosophy of the group has always been to develop the brands it had acquired from the country from which they originated. A means, he said, to preserve the historical links with suppliers and also, of course, to maintain the spirit of the brand. All the panellists, whether brands representatives or their suppliers, also stressed that the time-to-market largely lost in importance when a genuine breakthrough innovation is at stake. ""The more innovative is a product, the more flexible the customer is with regard to delays,"" Thomas Weckerle, CEO of Weckerle Cosmetics, confirms. For Eric Bone, ""product safety and consumer satisfaction are the priority."" Because innovation involves not only a financial risk, it also carries a risk for the brands' image. Actually, brands cannot afford to disappoint their customers."
Unilever turns to crowdsourcing for shower of the future,"Considering that showering represents a major part of the environmental impact of its toilet products' life cycle (due to the quantity of water needed and of energy to heat that water), the Unilever group is asking creative individuals all over the world to submit their ideas and solutions for an environmentally friendly shower at eYeka.com. The winning submissions will be granted a cash prize and a trip to London to develop the idea. ""In-home use is responsible for a significant proportion of the carbon footprint of shower products and with water becoming evermore precious there is an identified need to develop the world's first commercially viable shower of the future,"" says the company. According to Phil Giesler, Vice President, New Businesses Unit for Unilever, the move is in line with taking increased responsibility for the way in which Unilever brands are consumed. The initiative comes after the announcement of a partnership between Unilever and co-creation community eYeka in order to further tap into its open creativity platform across Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Russia and South Africa. Actually, Unilever considers crowdsourcing (the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community) has the potential to help delivering coherent solutions to complex challenges. Through the partnership, eYeka's online community of over 250,000 creators will help developing ideas for a number of familiar Unilever brands. ""eYeka's mission is to leverage the world's creativity to enable organizations and people to create a better future together. This initiative is a tremendous opportunity for our community to have an impact on our environment,"" states François Pétavy, CEO, eYeka."
Avon reinvents mascara application,"Feedback from over 2,000 women is at the base of Avon's new volumizing mascara, which also required a long development period: six years in the making and 5,000 hours of science according to the company. Main change: the standard wand has been replaced with a multi-dimensional brush (the ""Wonderbrush"") that lifts top and bottom lashes from root to tip in a whole new way. The Wonderbrush fits the curve of eyes and can be used at 12 different angles ""for a corner to corner lash transformation"". According to Avon, the Wonderbrush allows to put 40 percent more mascara to lash, compared to the brand's traditional wire brush. Product application differs greatly from traditional mascaras. As the brush can be bent to the desired angle, application from root to tip is claimed ""super easy"". ""There hasn't been true innovation in mascara since the 1950s. We realized there was a need for an improved application process and Avon is changing history by introducing a breakthrough with ergonomics in mind that will change the mascara application experience,"" said Lisa Lamberty, Avon Executive Director of Colour Research & Development. The product is available in two shades: black and brown black."
"Korea, a champion in make-up innovation","With a turnover for the cosmetic market of EUR 9.7 billion, an increase of 10% per year, and more than 700 companies active in this area, Korea is THE country for who wishes to focus on this sector. ""The market is highly concentrated, driven by music, Internet sales, TV shopping where it is very easy with the remote control to select the desired product and have it delivered at home on the same day,"" said Forence Bernardin. Everything goes very quickly in this country where, according to Kim Eun-Hee, Global Vice President Sales & Marketing at Hwa Sung Cosmetics ""everyone is very busy, even stressed, but must nonetheless have a flawless look and a relaxed appearance."" Looks are essential. And for that, both women and men take great care of their looks. ""Young boys want to look gorgeous, look like actors playing in dramas (Korean serials where men appear very neat, even quite feminine),"" underlined Lee Eunim, Vice President makeup value division at Amore Pacific. ""Having a flawless look is a sign of politeness,"" added Damien Dufresne, makeup advisor for Amore Pacific. The recourse to cosmetic surgery is common practice in Korea and radiates to other markets. ""Korea is the 1st market in the world in terms of cosmetic surgery; operations to recover lower baby eyelids for example, the ""charming eye line"", are highly prized,"" according to Bernardin. Having a perfect complexion is very important and women do not hesitate to use between 15 and 17 different beauty products every day. ""The beauty routine of Korean women is one of the longest in the world with an average duration of 30 minutes and with 15 to 17 products applied,"" testified Bernardin. Colours used are retained, transparency, brightness are preserved. ""In Korea, women have a very sophisticated but discreet make-up, no detail is left aside, while in France, some specific areas will be preferred, like the lips or the eye area. Korean women do not associate to make-up the festive side that French women can see in it,"" complemented Dufresne. Foundation in sticks, mascaras with an ultra-fine brush, wet and oily textures, vibrating applicators, BB creams, CC creams: innovations abound on the Korean market, whether in terms of concepts, packages, applicators or textures and are exported overseas. China, Japan and the U.S. are their main partners. For example Air Cushion, the product proposed by Amore Pacific, consisting of a sponge soaked with a foundation that is picked up with another sponge, generates USD 5 million in sales. ""It is a phenomenal success both in Korea and abroad, this patent protected product provides a quick make-up with a light finish, a fresh feeling and good results in terms of skin hydration,"" explained Lee Eunim. ""The creativity of our teams is constant, we discuss and exchange a lot to improve existing products and launch new ones"" underlined JK Hwang the CEO of FS Korea. Quality requirements are also high and the service is impeccable. ""We have a great deal of responsiveness,"" added Cho Im Rae CEO of Cosmecca. Development times are short and in line with the constant products renewal. ""Korea is a technology-driven country, products are very quickly available and renewed,"" detailed Bernardin. In addition, Koreans have a more global vision of their business, which cannot be separated from service. ""Orders are delivered at home just a few hours after the order was placed, and if the client is not satisfied, a person is sent at his home to retrieve it, and this, whatever the day of the week,"" explained Dufresne. Korea is revealing itself to the cosmetic world as a land of inspiration and innovation where quality is synonymous with service. ""This country will turn out as the key supplier of future years, if it is not already of presently times,"" concluded Bernardin"
DuPont and Strand Cosmetics Europe looking for the best brush-formula couples kit,"This is the result of a partnership initiated a year ago that DuPont Filaments, inventor and manufacturer of Natrafil, Strand Cosmetics Europe, a French company specialising in the development in skin care and makeup products, and Louise Wittlich, a German born make-up artist and beauty coaching specialist, have presented on the occasion of the latest edition of MakeUp in Paris (June 20-21, 2013). Initially, their goal appeared quite simple: to find a better balance between the applicator and a makeup product for the face. However, in the end, thirty different textures were tested: primers and bases, foundations, concealers, blushes and powders. These tests gave rise to fifty-six different makeup/brush combinations. These combinations were evaluated based on numerous criteria, such as coverage, luminosity, wear, brush design, rigidity of the fibres, ease of pick-up and application of the makeup product. The project allowed adapting the composition of the fibres in function of the formulation, in order to achieve the desired powder pick-up or a particular makeup effect. Four top-performing combinations of brush/makeup product were selected to achieve a flawless, totally natural « nude » makeup effect: – Corrective base AQUAPERFECTION – IDEAL FINISH powder – MAGICIEN D'OSE CC cream – VOILE PRECIEUX powderly blush Anisa International, designer and brush producer, thus joined the project team by bringing their expertise in working the fibres to create brushes that respond to the requirements of the makeup artist. ""The innovative character of the four matches between brushes and makeup product has been achieved from the synergies between makeup experts who had the inspiration to share their competencies in order to create a unique database and optimize makeup results by creating a distinctive cosmetic tool,"" says DuPont."
New brushes and applicators by Cosmogen,"The five new brushes of the Silkness range were designed for specific applications: loose powder, foundation, concealer, eye shadow with a dual ""finish"", eyeliner. ""The high density tufts are composed of a fine synthetic fibre with a natural appearance and whose exceptional qualities enable it to adapt to any make-up formulas. Soft to the touch, brushes offers an incredible sensoriality and the result upon application is perfect. For a perfect hygiene, this high-quality fibre is also washable,"" says the French specialist of cosmetic brushes and applicators. Cosmogen is also launching Firm'Up, an original package designed for formulas that require a dual function applicator: – On the one side, its fine textured or smooth spatula (SEBS or PE) distributes applies and the formula on the area to be treated with ultimate precision. – On the other side, its 45° inclined zamac surface ensures the effectiveness of its application: It stimulates micro-circulation, tightens and smoothes the skin, lifts, and smoothes fine lines and facial micro-tensions. The dispensing of the formula is excellent and the cooling effect of zamac provides comfort and pleasure. According to Cosmogen, Firm'Up is ideal for skin care treatments in institutes, and suits perfectly to skincare treatments such as: eye contour, lip contour, anti-wrinkles treatment, spot or D-scar treatment, lip balm... The French company also offers a new addition to its Squeeze'N range consisting in a new application solution for hygiene and care products: Squeeze'N Clean. Its bi-injected and ergonomic top consists of a surface that is covered with flexible spikes, made of thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). It allows for a uniform application of the formula and then exfoliates and cleanses the face or body while respecting the skin, while providing a pleasant sense of well-being. Like for the whole range, Squeeze'N Clean features a patented open/close rotary head to prevent contamination and preserve the skincare or hygiene formula."
Mascaras: 20 years of innovation,"""Mascara is an area of intense innovation,"" announces right away Jean-Louis Mathiez, independent consulting engineer, President of Cinqpats, a company specializing in packaging innovation. According to Mathiez, who has been taking an interest in the mascara market since 1983, the number of patents in connection with the designing of mascara is simply stunning. ""As far as intellectual property is concerned, this business looks more like a minefield, which makes it quite complex but also very interesting,"" confirms Aurélie Émond, Albéa's creative marketing & innovation manager. In France, the L'Oréal Company with more than 300 patents on this product, with 1/3 of them coming from the inventor Jean-Louis Guéret, is regarded as the main patent filler in this area. But the French cosmetic giant is far from being the only active player in this market, there are actually more than 2,500 patents filled worldwide, be it for packaging, formulas or for new features, each one more innovative than the last, to apply mascara. All ideas have not been translated into a product, at least not yet. ""There are some patents on the use of airless packs for mascara, which have to date not been marketed but that meet requirements for maximum protection of fragile formulas,"" explains Mathiez. Even companies not directly involved in cosmetics sometimes file a patent on this product. ""Moulinex filed a patent in 1976 for a rotating mascara with a spring. Now, leading electronic manufacturers like Samsung or Matsushita have made their debut in the arena, with some patents on vibrating, heating or rotating systems,"" he adds. Competition is fierce and innovation windows are narrow but sufficient to continue to see new products emerging on the market. ""Patents from competitors are not necessarily a barrier to innovation, ideas can emerge from them too,"" says Mathiez. And it is true that researchers never run out of ideas to offer products that are attractive to women. Products launches carried out since the early 2000s enable to identify some major trends on the materials used for brushes. ""In 2000, L'Oréal proposed fibre brushes reworked with special treatments and cuts for the filaments. It was an immediate success and the group took hold of more than 50% of market shares. Coty, in turn, responded by launching a mascara in the form of a pen with a comb applicator under the brand name Rimmel with as a bonus a 16% market share. In 2002-2003, to challenge patents filed by various actors, particularly L'Oréal, on fibre brushes, appeared plastic elastomer injected brushes. In 2005-2006, dual mascaras swept the market with the possibility of achieving two effects with only one product: volume and well separated lashes, care and colour... As of the 2008s, it is the rise of mascara devices, like vibrating mascaras, launched by Lancôme (Oscillation), followed by vibrating mascaras from Bourjois and Dior… Several brands also developed heated mascaras (patents published) but have not marketed them so far... Today, we're back to the basics, with more product simplicity and a research focusing on consumers' core values: easy application and volume effect,"" recalls Mathiez. Last year, the market was equally divided between mascara brushes and injected fibre brushes. In addition, some patents on fibre brushes have fallen into the public domain, hence the scope of applications in this segment is opening up again. Launches in 2012 put huge emphasis on volume, but also on the active effects of mascaras. A volume multiplied by 8 with maximized claims for the mascara Volume Glamour from Bourjois who offers a maxi brush, a maxi pack, a maxi formula, maxi precision, a maxi black and volume activator actives. Mega Volume Collagène by L'Oréal, enriched in collagen biospheres and equipped with an extra large patented brush promises, too, a disproportionate volume and a 24h efficiency. But they are not the only ones to ride this trend. There is also Rimmel's Volume Accelerator with a brush equipped with spikes which are inserted in such a way that they sheathe the eyelashes. Volum'Express, The Colossal Cat Eyes by Gemey-maybelline is equipped with a brush shaped like a curved cat's tail making it possible to apply some product onto the outer corner of the eyelid thus ensuring a complete coverage of eyelashes. The Mascara Volume Curl & Shock by Biguine with its exclusive curved brush promises to ""insure a finish that will cut the breath out of the most perplexed women."" ""Volume effect unquestionably represents the biggest demand,"" testifies Pauline Starck, Make-Up Business Developer at IL Cosmetics. But according to Albéa's Aurélie Émond ""from one country to another, from one brand to another, the desired make-up result and associated with the term volume is not always the same. In the U.S., volume is associated with a very marked make-up result, eyelashes loaded with product while in Europe the volume will be more defined with amplified eyelashes."" All the sub-contractors who are active in the field of mascara are focused on this theme. Geka launched in spring 2012 a collection, King Size Collection for Eyes with three types of brushes: Super LASH™ with a very high density of polyamide fibres and a large diameter, lashSEDUCTION™ featuring wide spacing between each bundle of fibres for a maximum reservoir effect and flirtaciousEYES™ combining special cuts and innovative fibres. As for Albéa, it got itself talked about late 2011 with the launch of two elastomer-based references shorter than conventional brushes Nano Hollow™ et Nano Disco™ and with a tank in the middle to trap even more formula and ensure a generous application. Since then, this injected empty brush technology has been diversified into three new brushes, Venice™, Corset™ and Dolce Vita™ allowing in addition to the volume, to get either a better definition, more length, or a better curbing effect. But they are not the only ones and all of them, be they Mascara Plus, Ancorotti, Brivaplast, Luxcos IL Cosmetics agree on the fact that volume is a recurring request and that the synergy between the brush and the formula is essential to achieve the desired effects."
Shiseido's new washable base eliminates the need for makeup remover,"The new Fullmake Washable Base is the world's first makeup base [1] that allows makeup applied over the top to be washed off using only warm water, claims Shiseido. The product can be pre-purchased from Shiseido's website ""watashi+"" since December 12. It will be made available in usual Shiseido's retail stores in Japan from early March 2013 (1,050 yens, including tax). The Fullmake Washable Base is to be used after basic skincare steps and before applying makeup. When removing the makeup, it is enough to scrub the face with warm water and the makeup, along with the makeup base beneath, detaches and glide off the skin. No makeup remover is needed. ""Thanks to the total transformation of the makeup routine achieved by this product, users can feel more relaxed about wearing makeup, knowing that their skin can easily be restored to its natural state,"" says the company. While Japanese women have one of the longest daily beauty routine, applying many more products on their skin that any others in the world, they also have become more time conscious, desiring to use their time wisely and efficiently. ""This trend is apparent, for example, in increased interest in achieving optimum work-life balance or making effective use of the morning hours by getting up earlier, known as Asakatsu, or morning activities,"" Shiseido explains. A recent study has shown that Japanese women felt that removing their makeup at the end of the day was the most cumbersome step in their entire skincare routine. [2] Notably, more than 60% of female respondents in their 20s to 40s indicated that makeup removal was a step in their skincare routine they wanted to get done as quickly as possible. Also, more than 41% of female respondents had gone to bed at least once without removing their makeup, with as many as 21% of them doing so at least once a week. The Fullmake Washable Base uses a Shiseido's proprietary film-forming agent named Veil Action Polymer, a substance that is hydrophobic to cold water but hydrophilic to warm water. When blended with warm water, Veil Action Polymer works to detach the Fullmake Washable Base from the skin, allowing the foundation, along with eye and lip makeup, to be washed off. Of course, as a makeup base, the Fullmake Washable Base also helps smoothing out unevenness and fine wrinkles, helps foundation, eye colour, and lipstick adhering tightly to the skin and lips. Shiseido also claims the product spreads smoothly and comfortably on the skin, hydrating it and offering protection from dryness, in particular thanks to its hyaluronic acid content."
La Prairie complements its White Caviar Illuminating Système line,"In September 2010, La Prairie ushered in the age of enlightenment with the debut of the White Caviar Illuminating Système, a three-part collection of formulas targeting age spots, discoloration and pigmentation, perfectly consistent with its focus on Asian markets. As of January 2013, La Prairie expands the collection to include three new complementary items – White Caviar Spot Treatment, White Caviar Illuminating Hand Cream SPF 15 and White Caviar Illuminating Eye Cream – to target very specific discoloration in problem areas by brightening the skin before, during and after pigmentation problems arise. ""Before… by limiting and minimizing the trigger enzyme, tyrosinase, which starts pigmentation deep within the skin. During… through the use of the most innovative technology and approach to decrease and control excess melanin. After... existing spots fade and future ones are put on hold with our White Caviar Illuminating Système,"" claims the brand. These effect are powered by a series of ingredients such as Oligopeptide-68, a skin-lightening peptide encapsulated in a liposome vehicle, Swiss Garden Cress Sprout Extract, to fade existing spots and prevent future excess pigment formation, and Vitamin C and Licorice Root Extract, a combination which blocks tyrosinase thus inhibiting melanin production to help prevent new spots from forming. The formulas are rounded out with Golden Caviar Extracts, the regal ""signature"" of the White Caviar Illuminating Système, a source of marine DNA which offers firming and moisturizing qualities. ""The extracts, derived from carefully regulated, environmentally-conscious farmed sources, include Omega-3 fatty acids to help boost the anti-oxidant level of defense in the skin while also promoting firming aspects. Lastly, La Prairie's exclusive Cellular Complex of Glycoproteins, Horsetail and Ginseng Extracts helps stimulate the skin's natural renewal process, moisturizing and energizing with nutrients that encourage optimal functioning,"" adds the brand. The White Caviar Spot Treatment comes in a white pearlescent plastic pen (4 ml / 0.135 FL OZ) with doe foot-angled applicator and shiny silver caviar-like beads in a band around the top of the pen (suggested retail price: 116 Euro). The White Caviar Illuminating Hand Cream SPF 15 is designeed to fight discoloration and age spots and is offered in white pearlescent tubal (75 ml / 2.5 FL OZ.) with a white pearlescent cap (suggested retail price: 116 Euro). Eventually, the White Caviar Illuminating Eye Cream, which focuses on darkness in the eye area, caused by pigmentation and circulation issues under the eye by targeting the accumulation of melanin and cellular debris (also known as lipofuscin), is offered in white pearlescent jar (20 ml / 0.68 FL OZ) and cap with silver caviar-like beads in a band around the cap; also includes accompanying silver spatula with round caviar-design handle (suggested retail price: 278 Euro)."
Lush moves away from traditional make-up codes,"The Emotional Brilliance range consists of 30 products all of them ""vegan"": lipsticks and eyeshadows, two eyeliners, a mascara, a face powder and two primers. What strikes first is the packaging line. Lipsticks, eyeshadows, eyeliners, and even the mascara all come with the same glass vial with an identical black cap. Only the shape of the applicator fitted to the cap will vary depending of the type of product. At Lush we were explained that this choice was made intentionally in order to reduce the packaging's environmental impact. ""For the Emotional Brilliance collection, a packaging was necessary. However, a considerable effort was made to ensure that this range had a minimal impact on the planet"" Actually, everything is recyclable except the applicator, which can be removed to be discarded or reused by the customer. Aside from the fact that glass is one of the most easily recyclable materials in the world and that it can be washed and reused, Lush also explains this choice for practical reasons. Firstly the transparent glass vials make the choice of colour easier at the time of purchase, and then during the time of use, they enable to check the quantity of product left. Moreover, as these vials contain 8g of product - against usually a capacity of 2g for a liquid eyeliner - Lush underlines the economical aspect of these vials. The caps to which are attached the disposable applicators were designed by Lush. They are manufactured locally at Poole in Dorset (UK), where the company is also headquartered. They are recycled from the black jars used in the Lush skincare ranges. Finally, the list of ingredients appear on a ordinary label, which is maintained to the bottle with a elastic hair rubber band, that the consumer can use to retain her hair during make-up applications. Nothing is lost at Lush! Only the packagings used for the translucent face powder and the two primers differ because they are proposed in 20g jars (glass again), with a black cap. As far as formulas are concerned, both lipsticks and eyeliners come in a liquid form. Main advantage of this uniform presentation, the possibility to have standardized packagings, and for the user to be able to play with textures. But beyond their colour, Lush chose to emphasize on the skincare benefits of its products, all of which contain at least one active ingredient. The lipstick formula, with a pending patent application, uses the super emollient base of the Lush Superbalm, a moisturising balm consisting of a simple mixture of organic jojoba oil, candelilla wax and rose wax. As for the eyeshadow base, it consists of a soothing infusion of rose petals and softening almond and jojoba oils, of glycerin and cupuaçu butter, with emollient properties. Eyeliners are made of the same base used for the eyeshadows, with the exception of the two references Independent and Fantasy, developed to adhere faster and elaborated with an antiseptic and slightly astringent infusion made of eyebright, a plant with recognized virtues for the care of tired eyes. For mascara, the key ingredient is wheat grass, rich in vitamins and minerals. For the translucent powder it is jojoba oil, and for the primers, it is a mix of almond and jojoba oils, of cocoa butter and orange blossom. Finally, Lush is just as off-beat when it comes to marketing! The brand partnered with the hypnotherapist Lady Helen Kennedy, to develop a list of words "" that could affect mood and behaviour"" through their ""power of suggestion"". In practice, each Lush outlet is equipped with a colour wheel, inviting customers to choose three colours matching three words from a list presented to them. This is how, according to Lush, each women will make her choice according to her own state of mind, rather than because of a trend or fad chosen by someone else. For those who are not convinced, the colour wheel trick is not an obligation."
Omum wants to create the skincare segment for mums-to-be in selective retail,"The new brand offers for this, a small range of four products specially devised for pregnant women: le Cajoleur (a protecting and nourishing soap), le Bienfaiteur (a hydrating lotion for the body), la Surdouée (an anti-stretch marks oil) and la Confidente (a massage cream). Each reference, with an evocative name, corresponds to a specific ritual and a specific need of future mothers: the fight against dry skin associated with hormonal changes inherent in pregnancy, the prevention of stretch marks, the massage of the belly. As for the choice of soap, it is a response to the tendency of pregnant mothers-of being suspicious of shower gels, and return to soap. Enriched with shea butter, coconut oils and wheat germ, the soap is produced by cold saponification to preserve its rich glycerin content and remain perfectly gentle to the skin. Originating from a demanding process, all products are organic certified according to the Nature & Progrès standard which has a reputation of being the most stringent on the French market. The formulas do not contain essential oils. In addition, the three anhydrous products are preservative free. And to better meet the needs of mothers-to-be, the brand is advised by professionals of the maternity and child care. The range should see the addition late 2012-early 2013, of la Délicieuse, a milky infusion for the bath, inspired by the Japanese ritual of nuka. ""I wanted to create a different skincare brand, that would reintroduces emotion in motherhood and meet the needs of modern and vibrant pregnant women. I wanted to offer ourselves some pleasure and opportunities to cultivate a relationship full of tenderness and joy with baby (and dad!), with safe and effective skincare products,"" explained Marie-Pascale Ballet. Omum is already distributed in France, in some fifteen outlets, and in Italy in the perfumeries of the group la Gardenia. The brand will take part to the next edition of the Cosmeeting Beyond Beauty Paris trade show in September to find new partners."
Pascual creates a surprise with a transparent lipstick and a non-sticky gloss,"Pascual, a French subcontractor and private labeller, located in the East of Paris region, is a newcomer in the full service business for makeup products. However, its cosmetics division, founded in 2010, is already making a buzz. ""After several months of intensive and coordinated work between the R&D, technical department and a raw material supplier, we achieved the industrialization of both a transparent lipstick and a green gloss,"" explains Simon Pascual, owner and manager of the company. The transparent lipstick is available in several colours, can be with or without glitters, and with or without added fragrance. Pascual claims its product is highly moisturizing and has sun protection factor of 15. The product was showcased for the first time at the third edition of the MakeUp in Paris tradeshow,on June 21 and 22. So far, only a few transparent lipsticks have been marketed already, but Pascual's product enjoys the advantage of a particularly smooth texture, while being robust and difficult to break. In order to add a playful feature to the product, Pascual has inserted in the packaging a device illuminating the stick when used. ""The many people who tried it during their visit to our booth, including representatives from major brands, were unanimous in their comments. The product is considered as very pleasant, with a beautiful shine and a beautiful look,"" adds Simon Pascual. As a result, negotiations are already underway with several brands to put the product in the market. So, stay tuned! The other innovation presented by Pascual at the MakeUp in Paris show, was a so-called ""gloss green"" that has been very successful too. The product boasts a wet and moisturizing effect, but more importantly, it does not stick, unlike other glosses on the market. ""In short, that is the end of the unpleasantness of hair sticking to the lip. Once again, professional visitors who tested it, had the opportunity to get confirmation these claims are fully substantiated."" Icing on the cake: half of the ingredients in the product com from a natural origin. For two years, Pascual has been investing about 1 million euros in its equipment, with an annual capacity of 12 million lipsticks, and 5 million cups of heated and moulded products. The company does not intend to stop now and is launching a new nail polish filling business, which will be operational starting October 2012, with a capacity of 15 million products per year."
"Eisen, at the cutting edge of pencil sharpening!","It was displayed a little ""under the counter"" during the last MakeUp in New York trade show but the new pencil sharpener UpsideDown recently unveiled by its designer and manufacturer Eisen, was already on everyone's lips. ""It all started from a simple observation"", explained officials of the German firm. ""When a woman sharpens her cosmetic pencil with a conventional pencil sharpener, the only thing she can see is a heap of blackish pencil bits of no interest gradually building up on the blade. In addition, she doesn't even see the pencil lead she is sharpening."" The trick therefore was to design a pencil sharpener with a hole on the other side of its base, a hole sealed by a kind of small transparent window (which can be used as a ""magnifying glass"") and through which the user can clearly see the pencil lead being sharpened, while all the ""waste bits"" accumulate on the other side of the blade to fall into a specially designed compartment. No more waste then to keep women from seeing the pencil lead being sharpened, on the contrary they have gained excellent visibility and can control the exact size of the lead they have in mind. ""So simple ... but yet so terribly clever! "" In addition, Eisen engineers have developed a cleaning tongue that fits perfectly in the overall design of the pencil sharpener and which has the advantage of being perfectly prehensible with two fingers."
Boots Laboratories launches the first SPF 50 Dry Oil,"In the area of solar products, oils are now highly valued by users for their spreading, transparency and water resistance properties. Often seen as the product symbolizing the joys of sun, they had however the disadvantage of displaying a moderate protection against UVB radiations and a greasy finish. Launched last year by the laboratories of the Alliance Boots group, the Boots Laboratories Solei range could already boast being the first comprehensive broad-spectrum UVA + UVB and UVA protection range with an advanced UVA protection. It included at the time 15 references for the face and body, with a childcare and after-sun offering, and SPFs ranging from 15 to 50+. The range was already offering two versions of dry oils displaying SPFs of 15 and 30. In this area, it was Vichy, with Capital Solaire, who had managed to renew the offer during the year 2011 by proposing a product with an SPF 40, already offering at the time a high efficiency against UV radiations. But this year, Boots goes further by launching in early March on the French market The Solei dry oil sun spray with a very high SPF (50+), coupled to a five star protection against UVAs, that is to say with the highest achievable ratio to date. The formulation consisting of chemical filters, with an optimized dosing to meet the desired claims, features a blend of emollients coupled with alcohol to provide a non-greasy texture and ensure non-comedogenic properties to the product. A patented antioxidant complex consisting of vitamin C, grape seed extracts and Ginseng also helps strengthen the natural defences of the skin against the sun and reinforces protection against skin damage in the long term. Icing on the cake, the product is paraben free, hypoallergenic, and has a 100% transparent, easily spreadable texture guaranteeing an optimal comfortable application with no white streaks or greasy residue. Marketed in six European continental countries (France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Norway), Boots Laboratories is reinforcing its positioning as a pioneer brand in the solar market. Alliance Boots markets solar products since 1920. In 1996, the UK based group launched the very first SPF 50 in the world. A revolution for the time! The group also created the UVA five star system, which is now taken up by most brands of solar products in the UK and in many other countries."
Farevacolor offers a range of high tech natural colour cosmetics!,"Premium Beauty News - Which goes to show that you can combine ""naturalness"" with ""high tech""! Natacha Rossi - Quite true! Before I tell you more about this new range, a few words on the global market of natural cosmetics. Although this is still a niche market, this market remains buoyant and is expected to grow by about 50% by 2015. There are several reasons for this growth. Societal reasons first. Consumers concerned about preserving their health, are looking for healthier products. Many brands have understood that which explains the emergence of many new comers in recent years. Hence, distribution has had to adapt to this overwhelming offering. Initially highly specialized, it has expanded a lot allowing consumers an easier access to these products. In the wake of the Smoothie range which was introduced at the end of last year, we chose to add a technical dimension to the natural. With ""Nature ADVANCE++"" Our teams have developed a range of innovative products combining naturalness, sensoriality and high performance. Rich in objectified natural actives and carefully selected for their high-tech properties, each formula features the ""Dual Activ Technology"" that provides an immediate and long lasting dual efficiency. Moreover, during the creation of each product concept, we identified what were the main expectations of women and we targeted those needs. Premium Beauty News - How many products do you offer? Natacha Rossi - Six in all. Essential, must-have products, but also products which were designed outside the box. A multi-action mist first, ""Nature ADVANCE++ Lotion Mist,"" which provides an instant glow, refines the skin texture and sets make-up lastingly. Containing actives from black Russian tea and oil extracts of Asian bamboo, its fresh and light sprayable texture, dries quickly and moisturises the skin continuously. It can be used alone on the day cream under the foundation, or as a booster touch up during the day. Second product in the line, a natural light creator foundation, ""Nature ADVANCE++"", with intense nutritional properties. Enriched this time with actives originating from Russian black tea but also from Asian red herb, it helps smooth the skin surface for an enhanced light reflection providing an instant glow. Upon each application, the skin looks visibly more hydrated and its lines seem plumped up. Premium Beauty News - Then we truly enter the world of make-up with an eye shadow, a mascara, a lip balm and a lipstick. Natacha Rossi - I must emphasize on the fact that, like the multi-action mist and the foundation, all these products are formulated with 95% natural ingredients or of natural origin at the minimum. For some, we even reach 99%! Containing some actives from Ethiopian myrrh resin and Asian bamboo leaves, ""Nature ADVANCE++ Eyeshadow"", is a new generation creamy and fresh, eye shadow. Concentrated in pearled particles, it offers a colourful and very bright make-up result. In addition, a complex of specific actives provides a perfect adhesion of the film on the eyelids for an impeccable hold. Our lab has achieved a real performance because it is a technical feat to combine natural and long lasting! As for the mascara, which is enriched with the ""Lash Grow"" active and a combination of virgin sesame oil extracts from Ethiopia and of European linden buds, it is a genuine repairing concentrate. It not only provides a instant panoramic volume but it also stimulates the natural growth of eyelashes to make them denser, stronger, during the applications. With the skincare lipstick, apart from its colour intensity, its moisturising actives feature a maximum repair action and protection of skin cells. It contains the HydraMax active composed of amino acids of collagen fibres, cactus extracts from the United States and Colormax, a pigment dispersing agent, to boost colour. Finally, a word on our vegetable peeling, a balm that exfoliates lips while it refreshes them. The original presence of micro-particles of olive pits and of an applicator with a massaging tip help smooth the surface of the lips. LipoHydra, it's a naturally occurring active, which offers a hydro-retention phenomenon that increases along with the applications. Lips are perfectly prepared to further increase the performance of the lipstick. With these six products, Nature ADVANCE++ can claim being a complete range that will meet the requirements of most demanding consumers!"
Panasonic and Kanebo invent the digital make-up snapshot,"That's the latest innovation from Japan: instant make-up… without make-up! An original concept derived from the unique collaboration between Panasonic and Kanebo Cosmetics. Actually, it is a further evolution of the portrait retouch function already available on latest Panasonic's Lumix digital cameras. Once the photo is shot, the new Beauty Retouch Mode enables to add foundation, eye shadow, lipstick, and cheek makeup to the image. The shades are inspired from Kanebo's Coffret d'Or brand. ""By supervising the retouch effects of the new Lumix DMC-FX80 digital camera based on its decades of expertise with makeup, Kanebo Cosmetics has helped create a beautiful yet natural digital makeup finish with a rich gradation of eye shadows and foundation effects that add dimension to the complexion,"" says the Japanese cosmetics giant in a release. The new camera allows retouching the skin, eyes, lips and cheeks separately. In addition, the advanced Beauty Retouch Mode also provides four makeup patterns recommended by Coffret d'Or. By selecting one from the options of ""Sweet"", ""Cool"", ""Celebrity"" and ""Happy"", a single press of a button makes it possible to generate a coordinated, fully made-up image with eye shadow, lip rouge, and cheek blush. To mark the release of this new product Kanebo Cosmetics and Panasonic are carrying out a joint promotional campaign between February 16 and March 31 in Japan. Customers purchasing Coffret d'Or products will be offered to enter in a draw to win a Lumix DMC-FX80 camera (100 winners selected), while customers purchasing Lumix DMC-FX80 cameras will be entered in a draw to win the Coffret d'Or Recommended Make-Up Set (200 winners selected). A joint advertising campaign and a website are also scheduled."
"Lipstick, mascara: Guerlain is confirming its premium strategy","A jewel? A make-up case? Behind the unpretentious and eye catching Guerlain seal are kept a few ground-breaking secrets. Pull on the case and with a click, the hidden mirror is revealed. A simple twist and the brush appears. Easy to use, you just need to trust your intuition. Black G is a precious object, made mainly of zamak and consisting of no less than seventeen parts. A design signed by Jackel, LF Beauty's primary packaging division. ""This was a real technical challenge,"" admits Thomas Diezinger, CEO of Jackel France, ""because the design constraints were not that simple to overcome."" Seventeen parts to put together, the desire to achieve a sophisticated and stylish product with high quality parts, a tight closure, a comfortable gesture with the famous ""click"" at the close, a very sophisticated mechanism enabling a smooth opening of the part supporting the mirror... Yes, indeed quite a challenge! It will have taken no less than 18 months to the Jackel teams, supervised by Anne-Cécile Monet and Stéphane Bulle, to develop the object. The PP body was made by the German firm Geka, and the brush by the Italian company Ponzini. Icing on the cake, a clever system makes of Noir G a refillable mascara: by simply pulling on the hood the refill appears. You then simply need to trigger a click on the top of the hood to release it... ""Never change a winning team,"" says Daniel Saclier, Packaging Development Director, LVMH. ""The Lorenz Bäumer and Olivier Echaudemaison tandem has again designed a rare piece of technology with this high-end mascara. Clearly, this is a dream object. Rechargeability was obviously an important criterion, along with, of course, perfect tightness while enabling women to keep the same make-up gesture when using a mascara."""
Scentys pulls out its creator's cartridges,"Take two high school buddies who became engineers, one graduated in the Ponts & Chaussées and Sciences Po and the other in X-Telecom, philosophy and management. You train them the hard way, in engineering, strategy consulting or at the DGCCRF (General Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control), and you also let them develop a very natural inclination for oenology, perfume and technology. Then, just let them give free rein to their imagination. And off they go! In 2004, Scentys introduces a flat screen with a fragrance diffuser in tune with the pictures displayed on the screen. Bingo! Perfume brands love it, the wine and spirits industry follows suit. In 2006, the screen is sidelined giving way to the Scentys Box a professional modular diffuser, adaptable to POS advertising, outlets and other premises, which can diffuse up to four fragrances, with a fan blowing on a cartridges filled with polymer beads impregnated with concentrated perfume. It's clean, simple, and easy to use. Clément Jeanjean and David Suissa further improve their system with a wireless monitoring device, via a downloadable application from the Internet. Ideal for adding fragrant scents to events. In 2010, the project is miniaturized, with Scentys 1, an almost disposable little box concealed in a POS Material. And with always, this guarantee of a perfect restitution of the fragrance or aroma. In 2011, Scentys Pocket a nomadic diffuser, gives hotels, shops, spas and public places the possibility to diffuse a fragrance with a mini box that runs on batteries or mains, ideal for a space of 20m², and truly very efficient. Be it in a pocket size or a standard size, the system works splendidly, and Antoine Lie, a perfume creator (Takasago) and an olfactory consultant to this project has added little notes of its own, creating an exclusive collection of six fragrances, created in single copies (when a customer chooses one of the fragrances or aromas, it is then reserved for him, withdrawn from the offer, and immediately replaced by a different composition). ""With the diffuser, the aim is not to have a too aggressive or too discriminating fragrance, but on the contrary to provide a quality olfactory signature,"" explained Antoine Lie who bears in mind a very qualitative approach when selecting his raw materials: ""it takes very little... there is no price constraint"" His favourite raw materials are here, worked subtly, vetiver, incense, leather, iris, narcissus and rose, genuine compositions giving the place of honour to these various raw materials. You want them for your home. Just for your home."
L'Oréal goes a step further in its relationship with its suppliers,"For the second consecutive year, L'Oréal held on 23 and 24 November in one of its sites in St. Ouen, a sort of small-size in-house exhibition on packaging innovations, called ""Cherry Pack"". A format that matches, according to L'Oréal, an ambition to develop on the long term the group's relationships with its suppliers. After a pre-selection stage performed by an internal jury, composed of managers coming from such departments as ""Purchasing"", ""Packaging & Development"", ""Research"" and ""Prospective Marketing"", seven suppliers of primary (Jackel, Rexam, RPC, Yonwoo) and secondary packaging (RLC), of samples (Bioplan), or of finishing and decoration services (Pochet-Qualipac-Solev Group), had the opportunity to present their innovations to both the General and Marketing managers representing all the brands of the L'Oréal group. ""Innovation is at the heart of L'Oréal's strategy and the collaborative work undertaken with our packaging suppliers is an illustration of this. During these two days, the selected suppliers, briefed on our main expectations, presented to Marketing and General Management teams of all our brands, their ideas, particularly focusing on the way to deliver in the most performing way our new formulas, to offer new gestures and new aesthetic designs. Exchanges which have developed during these two days were a unique opportunity to share complementary expertises and imagine together tomorrow's products,"" explained Christophe Guesnet, General Manager of Procurement for L'Oréal. Indeed unlike the first edition, where participants were left to present the innovations of their choice, L'Oréal, this time, wanted to share more of its brands strategy by providing a clear brief detailing the different expectations expressed not only by the Group's Research & Innovation, but also by the Marketing teams of each brand. Participants, however, had free reins to spontaneously propose other types of innovations. Hence this second edition was a mix of both ""ready-to-launch"" packaging solutions responding in a very targeted manner to the needs expressed in the specifications of the project and of solutions of a more ""prospective"" nature. For L'Oréal, Cherry Pack is not only an additional step in building closer partnerships with suppliers, it is also a tool to accelerate the innovation process. A concern shared by world leaders in the field, as was observed with the launch earlier this year by the German firm Beiersdorf, of a web platform designed to offer the group's external partners a better integration in the innovation process. ""At L'Oréal, innovation is rooted in our DNA. In an increasingly competitive economic environment, we must offer our brands some innovations that meet their needs and the characteristics of their markets in an always more responsive dynamic and the partnerships with our suppliers help speed up packaging innovation,"" emphasised Philippe Thuvien, General Manager of Packaging & Development for L'Oréal. The initiative seems in any case to be a fruitful one, since the group has announced the launch, for the first quarter of 2012, of ""four major innovations"" derived from proposals of suppliers who had participated to the first edition of the Cherry Pack and therefore a direct result of the new co-development approach intended by L'Oréal."
Rexam brings the art of spraying in a new dimension,"This is not just another mere step in the improvement of spray performances that Rexam will be introducing at the next Luxe Pack, from 19 to 21 October 2011 in Monaco, but a real breakthrough. The new Panache spray introduces consumers to a whole new experience placing them in a real mist of perfume, with no feelings of wetness and no stain marks, with less dispersed finer particles, and with a new gesture too, thanks to a prolonged pump action and a longer output spray of 30 cm, with no equivalent on the market. ""Even the sound produced during actuation is different, explains Samira Chmiti, Product Manager at Rexam Beauty, it is more harmonious, more zen"". Rexam has even started collaboration with Mane the perfumer from Grasse, to assess the impact of its new technology on the diffusion of its fragrances. ""The first non-final results, show a top note emerging with much more clarity, more strength and faster"". Panache is the result of five years of research and development, to create a spray compatible with a wide variety of formulas enabling its use for perfumes of course, but also for deodorants or misters. Alcohol or aqueous based formulas, that can also be oil-based, on demand. ""It's an evolution of our Maximist spray, but at a level that offers entirely new opportunities bringing the spray into new dimensions"", emphasises Chmiti. Compared to other sprays offered by Rexam, Panache features totally new technical characteristics. The homogeneity and the reduction in the size of particles help create a light and airy spray. Panache generates a mist of particles varying in size from 30 to 60 µm, against 30 to 90 µm for Rexam's Maximist spray and 40 to 150 µm for a standard spray. As for the prolonged action of the pump it was brought to 0.6 seconds, against 0.2 and 0.1 respectively for the Maximist spray and a standard spray. Enough to make of Panache a credible alternative to aerosols for some applications, with the advantages of a simpler assembly process, of being propellant free, and because of the choice of the material used for the bottle. ""Maximist was already one of iconic luxury brands favourite, but now with Panache, we've pushed the art of spraying to its maximum"", boasts Christine Guichuki, Marketing and Communications Manager for Rexam. The Panache technology, which has already been launched in the perfume universe as a exclusivity for a French brand, will be available for all of Rexam's customers as of January 2012. For the fragrance market, Panache is developed on a specific version (with a modified engine and nozzle) of Rexam's XD11 pump. For other applications, the Panache technology uses a specific version of the SP22 pump. All the decorative elements of the XD11 and SP22 ranges being available for Panache. In the future, Rexam plans to push this technology even further, to meet this time the needs of the pharmaceutical market."
"Phyt's launches Liberty Cherry, a glamorous red organic lipstick","Like any other product in the Phyt's organic makeup range, the Liberty Cherry lipstick is composed entirely of natural ingredients. Furthermore, Laboratoires Phyt's announce for this product a proportion of ingredients from organic farming reaching 80%, i.e. all of the botanical ingredients. An achievement in itself. But the cherry red colour is what distinguishes most Liberty Cherry from the rest of the organically certified makeup line developed by the French company, in contrast with the softer and more ""nature"" colours featured in the rest of the range . ""It is likely to add value to the existing range, which was very well received by women yet, despite its very innovative characteristics,"" says Nadine Fabréga. Indeed it is no surprise that the demand is strong for this glamorous and seductive shade. ""It was a recurring demand from consumers, transmitted to us by the beauticians that distribute our line."" However, as far as makeup is concerned, formulating organic products remain a tour de force. On the one hand, the first organic makeup launches are relatively recent, when compared with toiletries or personal care products and, on the other hand, the range of natural colours that are currently available is much smaller that what the chemicals industry can offer. ""Natural makeup is mostly limited by the colours available in the mineral world,"" confirms the Scientific Director of the Jérodia group. In order to obtain a plain red shade, Laboratoires Phyt's have therefore turned to the red carmine pigment, a natural organic dye from South America, where it was already widely used by the Aztecs, before being imported into Europe at the end of 16th century. Obtained from the carminic acid produced by the female cochineal, it has long been used to dye clothes, before being replaced by synthetic dyes. However it is still widely used in cosmetics (referenced under CI 75470 in Europe, and Natural Red 4 in the U.S.) and in food (E 120 in Europe). While it does not present the same risk of impurities that require a strict control of mineral pigments, because of its organic origin carmine is more likely to trigger allergic reactions. The Laboratoires Phyt's were keen to take every precaution at this level. ""The extract we use is very well tolerated in the product where the concentration is limited. We noted no significant effect in the tests we have made,"" says Nadine Fabréga. ""It's a perfectly legitimate ingredient in organic product, it is authorized both by the Qualité France standard and by the new European-wide Cosmos standard. We had to find a balance between consumer demand for bright red and a sensitive ingredient to formulate. It was important that the range remains attractive; otherwise the consumers would switch back to conventional makeup. "" Actually, Liberty Cherry does not shine only through its colour. It is also a real lip care. In addition to the glossy effect, the presence of many organic vegetable oils (castor, sunflower, jojoba) helps protect the lips, so does a very large amount of shea butter that, according to Nadine Fabréga, represents a key step forward. ""It's an ingredient that was absent from previous Phyt's lipsticks. It provides essential nourishing elements as well as the physical characteristics of smoothness, melting ability, wealth, substantivity, and comfort to the lipstick."" Add to this, the effect of another novelty: the presence of antioxidants in synergy, from the rosemary and vitamin E that fight against free radicals and the effects of ageing on the lips. Not to mention the presence of natural waxes (beeswax, candelilla, and carnauba) that bring a good lasting to the whole product. The Phyt's Liberty Cherry lipstick will be available on in mid-October, in the beauty salons and department stores that already distribute the brand. Other new products are the pipe since the Laboratoires Phyt's carry on developing their organic range, including the creation of new product creations. The imminent release of a matifying compact powder is announced."
Grace and glamour for Faber-Castell's 250th anniversary,"Founded in 1761, Faber-Castell became in the mid-19th century into the world's premier manufacturer of wood-cased pencils, both graphite and colour. While this year marks its 250th anniversary, Faber-Castell is still a family-owned business. The production of pencils for the cosmetic industry began in 1978.

The formulae are enriched with precious ingredients like black onyx, amber and ruby. ""Their micronized particles play with the light, create a natural luminous finish and emphasize the colour,"" says the company in a release. The Grace and Glamour collection features an eyebrow formulated with fine amber powder, an eyeliner highly pigmented and enriched with vitamin E, and formulated with fine black onyx powder, as well as a lipstick formulated with fine jewel and ruby powder which interacts with the light and creates a deep rich colour with luminous finish. The pencils are decorated with digital transfer providing multi-coloured designs of almost photographic quality. The pencil caps are ennobled with a gold banderole."
The Body Shop boosts innovations with suppliers,"The Body Shop, the ethical and naturally inspired beauty brand, and part of the L'Oréal Group, is carrying on efforts to increase cooperation with its suppliers. Following the motto taken from the Suppliers Day, organised on the 24th February 2011, ""from cost efficiency to value creation through quality, time-to-market, innovations and eco friendly/natural products,"" the brand's new sourcing strategy is rolling out. Objective: to boost innovation and actively contribute to business development. The Body Shop has a strong position in the global market with more than 2,600 stores in over 60 markets. An ethical brand with a belief in business as a force for good based on its five core values: Against Animal Testing, Support Community Fair Trade, Activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights and Protect the Planet. The brand's aim through this workshop is to work with suppliers to increase creativity a key driver of the brand's success, alongside evaluating its suppliers' performance on quality, supply chain, sustainability and competitiveness. ""Innovations should not be seen as something we can only deliver from our laboratories. We also build on relationships with our key suppliers to identify and facilitate ideas for the benefit of our customers,"" points out Jason Matthews, Director of R&D at The Body Shop. The workshop held in London, has gathered seven selected suppliers: four from Europe, two from Asia and one from the U.S.A. ""Using a detailed brief for each product category, which we sent them a few weeks before the event, all the suppliers have designed their proposals with the aim to perfectly match with The Body Shop expectations,"" tells Jerome Courtaigne, Director of International Sourcing The suppliers did not only propose new concepts matching the expectations but also 'blue sky' ideas pushing boundaries but staying realistic to fit the brand's requirements. ""We want to build up our suppliers' relationship based on mutual understanding and strong intimacy to create value together. Innovation is a perfect example because it requires strategic alignment and is the fuel of our growth,"" adds Jerome Courtaigne. According to Sandra Weinheimer, Director of Technical Product Development, this event was only the first step to get tangible results. ""To innovate successfully, we need not only new ideas of formulas and packaging but also the best process and methods to make new concepts come to reality with quality, speed, and with respect for our values. We are now focussed on launching a few of them in the coming months,"" concludes Sandra."
"MakeUp in Paris, novelties, just novelties (Part 2)","On the occasion of MakeUp in Paris, BCM introduced a new encapsulation complex with hydrating properties, the PolyOzOme, combined with a silicone elastomer in a Blush ""Caresse Acidulée"" for a better holding power of the make-up, a velvety feel and a transparent shade. The ""Oh Dace Color"", with strong and flashy colours, with five other complexion products, ""Oscillation"" (a foundation with a gel texture for an improved gliding effect), a sublimating silky foam, and three other blushes, ""Pulpy Vitamin"", ""Cheek Sorbet"" (water formulated) and ""Shaker Blush"".

The company Pennelifaro is launching on the French market its Kubo Beauty line, a concept of professional brushes for make-up artists or consumers who want to buy them by the unit and whose delivery is guaranteed within 24hrs on the whole territory. This line is also intended for distributors for whom a specific POS was developed. It can include from six to over a hundred references. The company, very much committed towards sustainable development, a humanistic management and a tailor-made service, also unveiled a line of brushes for sensitive skins and a completely flat brush which is intended for applying make-up while virtually retaining no product at all. To note that the specificity of the Pennelifaro brushes lies in their assembly: worked from the base, they are not cut with scissors and the flag part of the bristles remains intact, imparting them with a very soft skin feel and a true density. Traditionally specialized in perfume sampling, Arcade Europe has showcased several novelties specifically developed for the make-up and skincare industry. MakeUp in Paris visitors were able to discover two worldwide launches : – Powdasilk is designed as a portable mini-powder puff, featuring upon opening the - already impregnated - applicator on one side and on the other side, the powder which enables to re-impregnate the applicator as many times as required to achieve a complete make-up. – ClearAdvantage can be positioned directly on the advertising medium and being a transparent clear re-sealable label, it merges with it. It is designed for magazines, direct sell and direct mail. BeautiPod, intended for skincare or make-up products, is a sachet which is heat-sealed on a paper medium, thus irremovable. The opening is performed by tearing off the upper part of the paper medium, the flow being controlled by a very narrow opening. It can be used in press media or through direct marketing. Two more technologies which were already marketed in the U.S., are now also being launched in France. Beautiseal Stand-Alone for foundations and lipsticks for which was conceived a dispensing sampler to affix within the brand's POS, Beautiseal multicavity to carry up to 12 different shades (a whole version of a chart for example). The Italian company B. Kolormakeup & Skincare has developed eight beauty and lifestyle themes for 2012. Among which, ""Cycle & Recycle"" that highlights sustainability and bio, ""Liquid and Ice"" that gives added-value to brand's innovative formulas, new emulsions and suspensions as well as to new pigments and pearls, 3D&HD, to combine the application effects of a product (a matte base with a glowing and shiny surface for example) and highlight both the accuracy of formulas and applicators including packaging which actually is a matter for high definition. Note, in short, the Pascual company who announced new investment and technical developments, including a new machine to produce transparent lipstick. At Vetronaviglio, the Cristal line (the best selling line of the company) has seen the addition of two new 15 and 30ml bottles and new wooden accessories were also launched, in particular for caps and closures. ""For every day and for all the day"" is the promise of Gotha's ""24/7"" line, a comprehensive range for the complexion (powder and foundation), eyes and lips (lipstick and gloss) with nourishing and long wear properties. All products are formulated without parabens and alcohol."
"MakeUp in Paris, novelties, just novelties (Part 1)","On the occasion of MakeUp in Paris, managers from Jackel have placed a particular emphasis on what they call ""instrumental beauty"" with the presentation of products like tweezers equipped with a built-in light (LED), but also a heated eyelash curler, a light mirror, a electric manicure kit equipped with various adaptors (file, polisher...), a cleaning brush for the face, an electric mister. With its water tank equipped with a piezo mechanism to turn water into nanoparticles, it avoids getting the wet look effect bringing freshness instead, but it can also be used to set make-up. Already marketed in Asia, this mister is being launched in Europe. To note also on their stand: the hinge-free Reverso case, with a 360° opening, equipped with magnetic brushes (which are therefore unlikely to fall) and provides four customizable areas, the Summer Pop collection, inspired by the Color Block trend, for a new soft and smooth, powder texture the surface of which does not flake. New packaging, new gestures and new results are the highlights of the products in Farevacolor's new Fast & Glam makeup collection: – the All in 1 Face Kit brings together in the same pack all the must-have to unify and sublimate the complexion, a tanning tinted cream, a concealer and corrector blush glow, – presented in a tube with a sponge tip, Blush Jelly is a fresh and frozen gelly that slightly colours cheekbones, with a guaranteed natural result, – the Velvet Kiss, a lipstick duo and a matching lip powder, allow modulating makeup at will. Its packaging features a lip brush and its cover features a mirror, – the Soft & Shine Lip Care Balm contains a subtly tinted balm and high-shine gloss to pamper and enhance one's lips all year round, – the Plastic Eyebrow, with its vinyl texture, easily and precisely sculpts eyebrows thanks to its wedge-shaped silicone applicator, – eventually, a never seen eye makeup kit, the Bling Bling Kit, the epitome of a fun product, which features a unique stencil that allows dressing the lids with glittering stars, and an eyeliner with a flocked and highly flexible applicator highlighting the look of a glamour line. Fun or glamour, there's also something for everyone, with Alkos' three 2011 collections. – Fruits'Délices, with an impulse buy positioning, is exclusively focused on lips with three perfumed glosses presented in three vials, five shades of slightly perfumed pencil-gloss with an organic creamy texture and an organic lipstick (three shades). – Summer Vibe targets teenagers or night-clubers with a look mainly electric blue or outrageously pink, wood or plastic eyeliner pencils, long-lasting cream or eye shadow pencils with a cooling effect, a gloss that changes colour depending of the pH of the mouth, glittering scented oils for the body and ten colours of water based felt markers for a novel French manicure. – Aloha taps into seduction. With a comprehensive line that includes an eyeliner (blue or saffron), an eyeshadow whose formula (two shades) is hidden in the caps at both ends of the pen, a foam blush with a fresh feel, a lipstick, a lacquered gloss, an all-over pen for the face, the arms and the neckline with a matte powdery texture and a glittering moisturising body oil. In addition to these three collections, Alkos has launched Glide, new textured, water-resistant and long-lasting eyeliners and kohls, in classic or trendy shades, ""So Wond"", lipsticks and lipglosses with a very bright and long lasting texture in two shades and vanilla perfumed, turquoise or brown body tattoos (with a 2 to 3 days hold). Because women never managed to use up all of their make-up products, Livcer has designed ""Color Kit"" a miniaturized pallet for foundations or complexion correctors. The small capacity of its ultra slim, sealed and resealable case, equipped with a sponge, designs it as an impulse purchase or to be used as a product for people on the go. If it is a smart product, ""Color Kit"" is also a green product because it is fully recyclable. The Italian company GI Picco's Cosmetics, which was granted in 2011 the ISO 9001 certification, presented the ""Sensitive Line"", formulated with no heavy metals, nickel-free, paraben-free and perfume-free, clinically ophthalmologically tested to minimize reactions on sensitive skins. It is a comprehensive range for the skin, the lips and the eyes. Several novelties and quite a lot of hard work achieved on textures by the French company ABC Texture: an silicone-free all-over the face product, a foundation that also offers a primer effect thanks to a denser, powdery texture, a silicone-free, cream corrector with a powdery finish, a compact foundation presented in a leak proof case because water-formulated, a water resistant, filled eyeliner, a liquid foundation and a blush. Coming in addition, six shades of eyeshadows and four new shades of primer. Taking full advantage of its experience in lipsticks, and in order to meet growing demand on transparent grapes, with nacres or glitters, embedded in a double or triple casting, Weckerle unveiled several novelties in this category: a new generation including three formulas or three colours in a single grape, the ""twin stick"", a two-in-one with a surlyn pump for a liquid formula combined with a pasty formula in a grape (which may also find some applications for complexion products), a nourishing lip butter with a Vinyl surface and very sensory feel with real a flexibility to the touch. Two novelties also for the eyes, a kohl and a retractable kajal enrich Weckerle's offer. To be continued..."
Innovation: Certified organic nail polishes by So'Bio étic,"The Léa Nature group, a French specialist in natural and organic cosmetic and health products, distributed in mass retail stores and pharmacies, has developed a line of organic nail polishes certified by Ecocert and labelled with the Cosmébio logo. This patented innovation is formulated without nitrocellulose, contrary to conventional nail polishes, but contains a natural gum and a minimum of 40% organic ingredients. A real progress for the environment, according to the brand. Launched at the end of April under the So'Bio étic brand, the range features five colours (rubbish red, raspberry, golden beige, pinkish brown, chocolate) and also boasts a beneficial effect for the health of nails. Each colour comes in a bi-phasic form that consumers must shake well before each use. The oily phase, based on organic safflower oil (Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil) concentrates most of the nail care action to ""strengthen and protect."" The colour, composed of mineral and natural pearls, is concentrated in the other phase. However, because of their composition, the So'Bio étic nail polishes are more adherent to the nail than classical varnishes and cleansing, possible with any type of solvent, requests more time. Nevertheless, since the launch of the varnishes, many consumers informed the brand about their difficulties for cleansing the product. Therefore, the Léa Nature group has decided to reformulate its product to solve this difficulty and ensure the maximum satisfaction of its customers. The products should be relaunched in September."
Oekabeauty: A whole series of novelties,"Needless to say there has been quite a creative unrest in recent month at Oekametall and its Oekabeauty division. ""We have brought new blood to the teams, and you can feel the difference!"" Gerald Oehlhorn, the CEO, said humorously. One after another, the firm based in Bamberg, an hour away from Nuremberg, is offering its customers in the beauty sector, several innovations in all its favourite segments, namely, lipstick, mascara and lip gloss. To start with, the ""Eco pack"" series for which the German company proposes a lip gloss, a mascara and a lipstick tube, using a single plastic material, polypropylene. ""This makes products perfectly and easily recyclable,"" emphasised Frank Bierkandt, Assistant to the general Management. ""In addition, added Bierkandt, in the case of the lipstick tube for which, in general, three different materials are at least required, the product is, by the very nature of the single material used, totally air-tight."" But it does not stop there... In the field of mascaras, engineers from the firm have come up with several new brushes including the ""Lash Explosion"" model, a very large brush that gives a ""super"" volume to lashes, not to mention a multilayer brush, ""Multilayer Brushes"" where stiffer fibres alternate with more flexible fibres, allowing both to load more mascara on the lashes (the central flexible fibres) and to distribute it efficiently (the rigid fibres located on each top and bottom side). To note also the ""Dual Flex"" pack which comprises both a mascara (on one end) and a lip gloss (at the other end). Actually, lip glosses are not outdone with a series of coloured applicators, ""Smashing color applicators,"" whose colours sparkle with a thousand points once coated with transparent lip gloss. To note, also, the release of a ""Mini Line"" which includes a tiny mascara and a lip gloss that can be used as samples or travel products, not to mention a new line of mascara, the ""Convex Line"" with extremely well-rounded shapes. Finally the company also offers a new decoration technique in the form of graduated shadings of coating to be applied on its packagings. ""There too... it's also a novelty!"" Frank Bierkandt announces. ""It was time for us to answer the expectations and needs of a number of customers, by offering them a catalogue of standard mascaras and lip glosses. Well, since this year, this is achieved too!"" If it's clever it also offers a great plus of course, in terms of costs - since the only remaining expense for the customer will concern the mould manufacturing - not to mention the flexibility offered in manufacturing and delivery processes. In fact, there are actually two catalogues, one for mascara brushes and lip gloss applicators and one for the packaging solutions themselves. With a total of thirty mascara brushes and twelve lip gloss applicators in the first one and forty different packaging solutions in the second one. Eventually, the Bamberg-headquartered firm also announced the creation of a white room and the setting up of a workshop entirely dedicated to diversification in the medical sector."
Quadpack to launch make-up and foam pump innovations,"Quadpack sources and develops customised packs through a strategic network of manufacturing partners. On the occasion of MakeUp in Paris (23 and 24 June, 2011), the international cosmetic packaging provider will unveil a new foamer manufactured by Apollo, designed for make-up removal. According to Quadpack, Apollo foam pumps use patented technology to achieve outstanding foam quality. Indeed, the manufacturer's new foamers avoid metal parts in the product path, thereby greatly reducing product compatibility issues. Exclusively from Yonwoo, Quadpack will also showcase at MakeUp in Paris the very latest airless make-up containers that protect products from external contamination and preserve their integrity. These will include the Dual 2-in-1 packs that marry foundation and concealer in a single tube or bottle; the glass-effect Crystal range; and an airless spot pen with brush applicator, offering clog-free precision dosage and targeted application of foundation. Besides foundation and make-up removal, lip colour will headline among the make-up innovations. Quadpack's airtight lipstick is designed to prevent the common inconvenience of the product drying out. ""The metal lip gloss roll-on gives a great cooling sensation, while a new small brush tube allows professional application of lip colour,"" said the company in a release. Quadpack will also display the latest range from lip-gloss and mascara specialist Brivaplast. Branded packs on display will include Beate Johnen's new face cream contained in an airtight Yonwoo compact, Klorane's well-pump cleansing water and Dr Schrammek's foundation and concealer pack. ""Quadpack brings a great deal of technical expertise in skin care packaging to the colour cosmetics market, particularly in terms of product preservation, dispensing innovation and luxury presentation,"" said Quadpack CEO Tim Eaves. ""Our stand will house a variety of solutions to show how creativity, technology, safety and ease of filling can combine to provide striking make-up packs that help build brands."""
Setalg to set foot in the retail market,"Setalg, the French specialist of cosmetic powders to serve the market of spas and beauty salons is taking an interested in the retail market and is adapting its offer to address the needs of brands in this channel. The company presented its new patent, Concept Twin Phase, at the last edition of In-Cosmetics, Milan. Quite a novelty for this third party manufacturer who is holding a leading position in the segment of cosmetic products based on marine ingredients meant for professional distribution channels: the new product is targeting this time the retail market! ""We usually propose powders for rinse off or peel off skin care products, marine muds, clays, scrubs, which are to be used in an aqueous phase in the beauty salon or the spa. It is important of course to know how to dose the mixture appropriately and actually such manipulations were holding back the development of our offer to individuals"", explained Yves Bleunven, in charge of the French Market for Setalg. The solution presented by Setalg allows mixing the powder and the aqueous solution in less than 30 seconds without having to worry about proportions. The end user just needs to squeeze the package and then knead the product through its packaging to obtain a ready to use the peel-off mask. How does it work? The two phases (20 grams of a powder and 40 grams of an aqueous solution) are packaged in a single package, and kept separated by a weld that only gives way when the user presses on both ends. Afterwards the user will just need to knead the package to mix the product thoroughly who will then ready for use! As usual, Setalg offers brands a customization of its innovation. Textures, active ingredients, colours and perfumes can be adapted to meet the specific needs of each market."
Make-up: Kosmoda unveils its morphing technology,"The Italian company created in March 2007 and specialised in the production of baked powders, presented a brand new powder at the latest Cosmoprof tradeshow. The production is based on the so-called ""Morphing Technology"", a process that allows transforming a selection of raw materials through specific manufacturing technics in order to deliver a product with an unexpected refined touch together with highly performing cosmetic features. Actually, the final product appears and feels like in-between a poured product and a powdered one, while retaining in itself the best features of both of the two forms. According to Kosmoda, the main characteristics are: – an unrivalled creamy and soft touch, – an extremely thin and adherent powder that is nevertheless very easy to blend, – an extremely long lasting colour effect without fading or streaking, – the use of different pearls to obtain high impact final effect ranging from satin to high frost finish, – a wet and dry use to play with colours and to improve intensity and colour wear. This new product allows high creativity and offers a broad palette of possible customizations ranging from mono to multiple shade products: – high flexibility in special effect combining up to 6 different shades with the use of one single pan (traditional or plastic), – domed and embossed patterns, – special technical drawings to suit customers requests."
Intercos pulls out the Prisma Shine card,"For the past two years, the 457 employees dedicated to innovation within the Intercos group have been actively working. From their work emerged Prisma Shine, a new generation of almost-revolutionary textures that blend pigments and lights for an exceptional colour rendition. A proprietary process that also allows three-dimensional shapes, volumes and drawings with amazing fineness. From this point of view, it's true, there is good side to every crisis! To get going again! This is certainly the motto that best characterizes this thirty nine year old Italian group which employs more than 3,000 people the world over, which is capable of producing about 6,800 tons of cosmetic products each year and over 1.6 billion units. A group that produces in the four corners of the globe, from the United States to China including of course, Italy and soon Brazil. ""This new factory with a production area of 8,000 sqm will be located near Sao Paulo, and will be operational in January 2012. With this new factory, we will be able to meet both local demand for product innovation and also demand from our key global clients who are in need locally of an industrial capacity,"" explains Ferrari. An international expansion coupled with a strategic commitment striving to always be ""the best"" not only in its traditional segments like colour, but also in markets where, traditionally, others seem to be more at the sharp end. ""Obviously, we have strong ambitions in the segment of plastic pencils, particularly in the U.S. where we will certainly invest in terms of manufacturing."" Ambitions are the same for the CEO of Intercos in the skin care segment where the Italian company, through its CRB subsidiary, created six months ago Vitalab, a company in joint venture with a biotechnology laboratory in Naples. Finally, high ambitions, too, in the segment of standard products where the company has just launched a collection called Smart Beauty intended to challenge ranges proposed by Asian groups. ""With that additional Italian Touch to it,"" insists Dario Ferrari. But the star attraction of the showroom, organized like every year at the headquarters in Agrate Brianza will have been this year the new textures developed by the Group's laboratories, Prisma Shine. ""This exclusive process and its unique texture combine to create a truly new generation of visual effects,"" says Ferrari. And it's true that the effect is startling. Thanks to the proprietary process developed by engineers at Intercos, colours, effects, gradations, and the fineness of motives are truly breath taking."
CEP Industry: a two piece-mascara!,"The project of this quite remarkable new mascara tube was initiated by The Estée Lauder Companies and designed by the French firm CEP Industrie. ""For the time being it consists of a standard sample with a 2 ml capacity,"" explained Stéphane Leonard, the Sales Director, ""but we can of course develop larger sizes."" Main tricks featured by the product, the wiper is embedded in the container and the stem holder is built into the cap. Hence, the whole product only consists of two parts instead of four usually (and therefore two moulds instead of four are required). Moreover, the whole system is supplied fully assembled ready to be filled and sealed from its base like a tube. For its launched, the mini mascara is filled by Socoplan-Flexpaq, a subsidiary of the Ileos group. A for the new ""Minicep"", tube, it is a single material breakable tube fully recyclable which empties completely and effortlessly with its flexible and deformable head. It is resealable. It only weighs 1.3 grams and claims to be as competitive as a sachet. CEP Industrie will present its innovative products during the PCD Congress, which will open its doors in Paris on the 8th and 9th of February 2011."
Innovation to increase one's market shares!,"Cinqpat's watchword, ""Beauty Applications"", is there to remind it: we are pragmatic people and we must remain pragmatic about innovation, ""this is especially true as innovation is only really useful when it helps to increase your market shares,"" insisted Mathiez. The first two years of Cinqpats, to which is associated Jean-Luc Perrier (former Risdon/AMS) have been for the least, tonic, ""as one might have imagined them!"" Jean-Louis Mathiez insisted. ""Fortunately during this period of time, we received valuable support from many players in the world of cosmetics, such as Jacques Gerbron (former Coty/Lancaster)."" However, the initial intuition was confirmed quite soon: the need for innovation was there, but mainly for an innovation conceived with product feasibility always in mind. ""We don't sell ideas, we don't sell products, we just help brands and their suppliers achieve full projects. The feasibility is measured according to such performance criteria as quality, cost, deadlines and intellectual property. Five criteria, like Cinqpats, [1]"" emphasised Mathiez. Medium and large companies will quickly become the core targets of Cinqpats. As he stresses: ""The relevant companies are the ones wanting to increase their market share through innovation."" These needs do not concern packaging alone, but more product as a whole: ""This is why our offer always includes a part on the content, a part on distribution and a part on the product application."" Among our early customers and partners we can name Coty, LVMH, Selva Oekametall, Coslab, EuroCosmeticAsia, E-Scent, Cosnova ... The Cinqpats team which now comprises five people, including Isabelle Maurouard (former Bourjois and Coty), Sophie Robbe (former Coty) and Mark Lebeau (3D designer), has several hobbyhorses like mascara of course, but also airless and soon to come lipstick, not to mention ... bulb atomizers. Jean-Louis Mathiez explained: ""It is true that during these early years we have earned our reputation on mascara and airless, but we are also working on other concepts."" On the airless side it may be recalled that Cinqpats offers several innovations based on technological inputs coming from such companies as Gaplast in Germany and Tirrit in China. The design of the pump itself allows the contained formula to be dispensed with little filler waste: thus, it can suck up high-viscosity formulas or tacky textures, or even reasonably heterogeneous products. The process implemented for the design of the ""co-extruded"" bottle (patented by Gasplast), keeps the inner pouch attached to the top and bottom of the bottle so that the pouch contracts itself avoiding product blockage. This conception guarantees a evacuation rate close to 100% with constant dosage from beginning to end. Cinqpats latest innovation to date is on the brink of seeing the light of day: a dual-compartment airless that will deliver high-end toothpaste ... An application hiding in fact many others ... in cosmetics. As for mascaras, Jean-Louis Mathiez's position is clear: ""the product is featuring a lot too many unnecessary gadgets. In addition, all these vibrating or heating electric motors don't really seem in line with environmental concepts. On the other hand, it is possible to develop new functionalities, but ... without the help of engines!"" Obviously segments concerning lipstick and the distribution of free-powder with bulb atomizers, are of great interest to the market ... and, ""of course we are also very interested!"" admitted Mathiez. But the CEO of Cinqpats also said that ""regarding lipstick, we are working on a turnkey concept, with the help of Oséo Innovation, which should emerge fairly quickly. As for the bulb atomizer, it is meeting a strong demand on the market which can only but intensify itself in the coming months. It is a vector which was abandoned at the start of the 20th century but it is now resurfacing. Powder can be used to convey a skincare treatment, perfumes ... The trick of course, is to manage to control the spray and the dosage at the same time. But we are working on it!"""
