French parliament backs bill against hair discrimination affecting black women,"Olivier Serva, an independent National Assembly deputy for the French overseas territory of Guadeloupe and the bill's sponsor, said it would penalise any workplace discrimination based on ""hair style, colour, length or texture"". Similar laws exist in around 20 US states which have identified hair discrimination as an expression of racism. In Britain, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has issued guidelines against hair discrimination in schools. Serva, who is black, said women ""of African descent"" were often encouraged before job interviews to change their style of hair. Backers also say that men who wear their hair in styles like dreadlocks are also affected. The bill was approved in the lower house National Assembly with 44 votes in favour and two against. It will now head to the upper Senate where the right has the majority and the vote's outcome is much less certain. Serva, who also included discrimination suffered by blondes, redheads and bald men in his proposal, points to an American study stating that a quarter of black women polled said they had been ruled out for jobs because of how they wore their hair at the job interview. Such statistics are hard to come by in France, which bans the compilation of personal data that mention a person's race or ethnic background on the basis of the French Republic's ""universalist"" principles. The draft law does not, in fact, contain the term ""racism"", noted Daphne Bedinade, a social anthropologist, saying the omission was problematic. ""To make this only about hair discrimination is to mask the problems of people whose hair makes them a target of discrimination, mostly black women,"" she told Le Monde daily. A black Air France air crew member in 2022 won a 10-year legal battle for the right to work with braided hair on flights after a decision by France's highest appeals court. While statistics are difficult to come by, high-profile people have faced online harassment because of their hairstyle. In the political sphere they include former government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye, and Audrey Pulvar, a deputy mayor of Paris, whose Afro look has attracted much negative comment online. The bill's critics say it is unnecessary, as discrimination based on looks is already banned by law. ""There is no legal void here,"" said Eric Rocheblave, a lawyer specialising in labour law. Calling any future law ""symbolic"", Rocheblave said it would not be of much practical help when it came to proving discrimination in court. Kenza Bel Kenadil, an influencer and self-proclaimed ""activist against hair discrimination"", said a law would still send an important message. ""It would tell everybody that the law protects you in every way and lets you style your hair any way you want,"" she said. The influencer, who has 256,000 followers on Instagram, said she herself had been ""forced"" to tie her hair in a bun when she was working as a receptionist. Her employers were ""very clear"", she said. ""It was, either you go home and fix your hair or you don't come here to work"". During the parliamentary debate deputy Fanta Berete, originally from Guinea, said she, too, had been told in the past to straighten her hair in job interviews. Aurore Bergé, minister in charge of gender equality, said the government was ""looking kindly"" on the initiative which she said was useful in drawing attention to this form of discrimination. Some right-wing deputies rejected the bill, with Republicans deputy Xavier Breton saying it was the outcome of an ""activist ideology"" that he said was aimed at ""dividing our society"" by establishing ""a hierarchy"" of discriminatory acts."
Niche perfumery: the top trends spotted at Esxence 2024,"White flowers were in full bloom at this 2024 edition of Esxence. The trend blossomed at the end of the health crisis and reached its peak this year. Tuberose, jasmine, orange blossom... If we had to choose just one bouquet of white flowers, it would be Un Bel Amour d'Été by Parfum d'Empire. A hymn to carefreeness, bursting with gardenia, magnolia and champaca, created by Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, with this well-known material, qualitative and carnal signature. Gourmandise finds new inspiration. Moving away from praline and caramel notes, the gourmet palette is exploring other olfactory territories. Like the popcorn note, somewhere between peanut and caramel, in God Bless Cola, the Versatile brand's latest addition. The gourmand style is also evolving, with creamy effects recalling the texture of a pastry in the mouth. Nicolaï's three new creations are a good illustration of this. Pavlova, Saint-Honoré, and Macaron Bourbon are three fragrances inspired by desserts, whose mellow texture is tantalisingly realistic. This 14th edition of Esxence also gave pride of place to fruity notes: banana, passion fruit, pear, peach... Beyond their presence, it is how the note is treated that attracts attention. The fruity accords are more refined, with a more subtle, naturalist style. Of particular note is the beautiful, velvety peach-skin effect of Rue de la Paix, a floral bouquet celebrating 100 years of the Isabey brand. While over the last two years, sandalwood was the dominant scent, since last year it has been replaced by vanilla, a new comforting ingredient. Among the pods that spread their bewitching, regressive notes in the aisles of the show were Orchid K by Ella K. A vanilla with powdery accents, enhanced by a hint of incense, by Sonia Constant. In the same gentle vein, musks are still very much in evidence, prized for their intimate sensuality. Like the latest launch of L'Orchestre Parfum, Mono Cachemire, by Nathalie Feisthauer. An airy, enveloping veil, imagined as a second skin. Although not dominant, green facets were used in many combinations. They give formulas a more natural touch or revamp a classic theme. The best example is undoubtedly Cèdre Figalia by Atelier Materi. A fig, green, woody accord, in which perfumer Céline Perdriel chiselled a crumpled fig leaf effect, using spinach absolute. All in all, this 14th edition gave pride of place to a joyful, hedonistic niche perfumery. This cheerfulness drew on white floral notes, fruit, and gourmandise. This atmosphere can also be seen in the design of the stands, which were extremely colourful this year. Rather than being seductive, the new products are part of a quest for well-being and inner balance. Much like the many smaller brands that populated the show, all of them pursuing a soothing approach."
"Shady bleaching jabs fuel health fears, scams in West Africa","The young woman is one of a growing number of customers across West Africa who seek to reduce the melanin in their skin because being fair is associated with higher status, privilege and beauty. The global market value for bleaching treatments is projected to jump from an estimated $10 billion in 2021 to $16 billion in 2030, Dozens of Facebook pages in Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Niger and Senegal promise ""uniform whitening"" thanks to various creams or injections. It is a gateway to a huge web of scams. A lab analysis requested by AFP of one popular product in Ivory Coast showed it contained no whitening agents. Experts also warn that the trend is far from harmless, with the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2023 calling it a ""global health problem that needs urgent attention"". Although creams still dominate the market, injectable liquids are proving increasingly popular with young people. The effect is thought to be ""faster"" and ""more uniform"", according to Marcellin Doh, the president of a civil society collective in Ivory Coast fighting the skin-whitening fad. While the risks of creams are well documented — some cause premature ageing or contain carcinogenic substances –- the dangers of injections are less well known. Specialists confirm there is little oversight regarding the ingredients or manufacturing process. Some jabs contain strong anti-inflammatories, according to dermatologist Sarah Kourouma of the Treichville University Hospital in Ivory Coast. ""Given their side effects, we assume that they are steroids,"" she told AFP, adding that prolonged use in high doses can cause depigmentation, diabetes and hypertension. Wealthier women, meanwhile, turn to expensive injections of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant, which can be prescribed in the treatment of cancer and Parkinson's. ""Young, educated women aged between 25 and 30 (inject themselves) every week, sometimes every second day,"" Kourouma said. They risk developing ""skin pathologies such as acne and conditions that leave scars and black spots that are very hard to treat"". Her observations were echoed by Grace Nkoro, a dermatologist at the Gynaeco-Obstetric Hospital in Cameroon. Nkoro said she had seen several patients develop skin problems and even kidney failure after ""buying these injections on the internet"". Neighbouring Ghana issued a public health alert in 2021, warning that glutathione injections ""pose a significant health risk"" with ""toxic side effects for the liver, kidneys and nervous system"". There are also concerns over the way in which these products are being administered. In many cases, merchants at a market or in a store will provide the jab — an ""illegal practice"", according to the Ivorian Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authority. In other instances, people inject themselves at home. The lack of medical supervision can lead to the spread of communicable diseases like hepatitis, experts caution. ""If you don't clean the equipment properly, you could potentially inject bacteria into the bloodstream and risk total body infection"", Kourouma said. Although Ivorian authorities outlawed certain whitening products in 2015, the ban did not directly target those containing glutathione. As a result, they are still widely available in markets and online. The manager of an Abidjan-based online store, who wished to remain anonymous, said she imported ""good-quality"" products from Southeast Asia, Italy and Switzerland. According to her, the jabs were ""basically medicine"". AFP contacted another vendor on social media claiming to sell glutathione injections in Abidjan and purchased a batch of 16 vials and powders produced by Dermedical Skin Sciences for 75,000 CFA francs ($124). A lab analysis by a Paris-based hospital showed the vials contained vitamins, proteins and sugar — but no glutathione. Attempts to contact Dermedical Skin Sciences proved futile. The company website lists a lab in the Italian city of Milan but Google Maps only shows a municipal swimming pool and golf course at the given address. There is also no company registered under the name ""Dermedical Skin Sciences"" with the Italian Chamber of Commerce. An Ivorian trader promoting a brand named Glutax told AFP that a wholesaler in Manila was behind the products. The capital of the Philippines is home to a dizzying number of retailers supplying the African market with skin-whitening products. Further online searches showed the existence of a Manila-based firm called Glutax. Contacted by AFP, the company confirmed it was headquartered in the capital and was a global distributor of bleaching treatments. Glutathione-based injectables are banned for use in the Philippines because of their ""potential danger or harm to health"". Despite the risks and scams, WHO figures show that skin-whitening practices remain widely used in Asia and Africa. Zimbabwean researcher Shingirai Mtero of the Nordic Africa Institute said these beauty standards were ""inherited from the colonial period"". ""African countries emerged from colonisation... But that does not mean that they emancipated themselves from the realities and prejudices that were imposed on them."""
"Trend: 'looksmaxxers', these men ready to do anything to look their best","Fans of 'looksmaxxing' are said to be ready to use all possible means — sometimes even the most dangerous — to improve their physical appearance in order to appear more attractive to others, especially women. According to Urban Dictionary, the term was initially used by ""incels"", in other words, involuntarily celibate and often masculinist men. It would have originated on incel discussion forums and in the manosphere before becoming a broader trend on social networks. Since then, younger generations have embraced the practice and made looksmaxxing a trend on social media. On social media, countless videos are posted with the #looksmaxxing hashtag, showcasing comprehensive and demanding beauty routines that aspire to a certain beauty ideal. However, 'looksmaxxing' isn't just about cosmetics — although social media users might have you believe so — it's a much broader process, encompassing fashion, sport and even food. ""The past year has been me taking things girls have been doing to look better and telling guys to do the same,"" explains Dillon Latham, now followed by over 1.4 million users on TikTok, speaking to the New York Times. His TikTok account is filed with videos aimed at advising those who wish to improve their appearance — or at least who aspire to a certain idea of beauty. How to get abs, how to smell good, what clothes to wear and what not to wear, how to get rid of acne, how to make your features more attractive, or even how to improve the symmetry of your face, are among the tips shared by the social media user. On the whole, it's a relatively basic, harmless beauty routine that involves relatively standard practices and techniques, such as going to the hairdresser, waxing, teeth whitening, exercising, following an optimal skincare routine, taking up facial yoga, or even indulging in 'mewing' — tongue posture exercises to achieve a squarer jawline, get rid of a double chin, or make the face look more balanced. These are relatively common practices known as 'softmaxxing,' and are they're very similar to the kinds of things women have been doing for years. But more extreme — and controversial – practices, known as 'hardmaxxing,' also appear on social networks. This could involve cosmetic surgery, particularly implants, as well as skin whitening and extreme diets. One such practice, 'bone smashing', recently went viral. This involves breaking the bones of the jaw to make it squarer, a sign of virility according to some. Still, despite going viral online, this dangerous trend is actually (and fortunately) far from gaining a huge following in real life, even among 'lookmaxxers.' One thing is sure, the community of men keen to improve their appearance continues to grow, reflecting a willingness to embrace certain norms and imperatives of what masculinity looks like."
French exports of perfumes and cosmetic products continue to soar,"With an increase of +10.8% in 2023, French exports of cosmetic products hit a new record at EUR 21.3 billion, compared to EUR 19.3 billion in 2022. This is the third consecutive year of double-digit increase (+18.8% in 2022 and +22.5% in 2021), after the accident linked to the pandemic in 2020 (-11.8% ). ""Crossing the 20 billion euros mark is a clear symbol of the vitality of our industry. Despite the pandemic and the logistical hurdles that followed, our exports have doubled in 10 years,"" Emmanuel Guichard, General Delegate of FEBEA, told Premium Beauty News. Among the categories driving the growth of French exports, perfumes appear as the powerhouse of the sector. In 2023, sales outside France jumped by +10.5% to reach 7.1 billion euros, a figure that has doubled since 2019. Makeup products and skin care products for the face also showed a good performance with an increase of +9.9% (EUR 11 billion), while hair products recorded the strongest growth (+15.8%). ""One of the many assets of our sector is to be strong in most beauty categories,"" emphasizes Emmanuel Guichard. The year 2023 was marked by a sharp slowdown in two key markets for the French beauty industry: the United States and China. Exports to the United States, the world's leading buyer of cosmetics made in France, increased by +2.8% in 2023, compared to +26.7% in 2022. While one in five French perfume products is exported to the United States, exports in this category only grew by +1.9% (to reach 1.2 billion euros) in 2023. Exports of makeup and care of the face, growing by +5.3%, reached 1.1 billion euros in 2023. China, which in 2020 became the number one customer for French beauty brands, continued its slow-down. In 2023, French exports to China increased by +1.7% to reach 1.99 billion euros. In this context, the countries of the European Union have served as growth relays for the French cosmetics industry. The area represents 40.2% (EUR 8.6 billion) of total French exports in 2023, a figure up +20.8% compared to 2022. In the Middle East, exports of French cosmetic products decreased by -2.9% due in particular to a sharp drop in exports to Saudi Arabia (-19%), partly offset by growth in the United Arab Emirates (+6%). ""The strong increase in our exports to the European Union is a good surprise compared to the trend of previous years. This shows that French companies are able to find new growth drivers and to reposition on new markets when the global context evolves,"" added Emmanuel Guichard. In total, more than 60% of French cosmetics production is exported. In 2023, the sector was the second contributor to the trade balance, behind aeronautics and ahead of wines and spirits. France remains the world's leading exporter of cosmetic products."
Trade shows: Three beauty trends spotted at Cosme Tokyo 2024,"With almost 34,000 visitors across all six shows, the halls at Tokyo Big Sight Expo centre were busy throughout the entire three days of the fair. Besides Japan, the biggest exhibiting country this year was Korea, with K-beauty brands dominating the Cosme Tokyo hall in particular. This highly visible presence of Korean cosmetics at the show reflects the changing dynamics of the Japanese cosmetics market. Indeed, during the last few years, Japan's beauty retail market has seen a massive influx of Korean beauty brands which are now widely sold in drugstores, convenience stores and variety stores/beauty specialist retailers. As far as beauty trends are concerned, Cosme Tokyo was all about ingredients this year. In a market with highly educated and informed consumers, skin science and other dermatological approaches of beauty are more than ever a key factor of success in Japan. Exosomes were undoubtedly among the most prominent active ingredients showcased at Cosme Tokyo 2024. Frequently, exosomes were combined with anti-ageing ingredients already highly popular in the Japanese beauty market, such as stem cells, PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide), NMN (Nicotinamide mononucleotide) or placenta, as well as classic actives from the Korean beauty industry that have become popular in Japanese skin care in recent years, such as cica (centella asiatica), bakuchiol or niacinamide. For example, Japanese salon beauty manufacturer Wave Corporation reformulated several products in its existing Spa Treatment HAS line with exosome technology and re-named the entire line – the Exosomes range now includes sheet masks, undereye masks and a highly-concentrated exosome serum. Lady Bio's Dualvie Clocell Therapy cream features both bakuchiol and exosomes. Korean brand Nine Tails launched three new exosome-based products, including the Exo Collagen Serum which contains exosomes, collagen and niacinamide. And Korean-Japanese brand Precime ecently introduced Exosome Mineral UV Protective Cream, a liquid tinted face cream with SPF34 PA+++ formulated with exosomes and cica-derived madecassoside and asiaticoside. NMN was another very popular and highly visible ingredient at Cosme Tokyo 2024, not just in skin care but also in nutritional supplements and functional foods/beverages. When applied topically, nicotinamide mononucleotide is said to help increase skin elasticity and minimise fine lines and wrinkles. Femcare beauty brand Seins Mous' new Champagne Carbon face and neck serum cream does not just include human stem cells but also NMN to further boost hydration and improve skin elasticity. Japanese skin care brand Aderay's new Aderay Warp Mask is an all-over eye sheet mask. The mask material is infused with nano-sized NMN and hyaluronic acid which quickly melt into the skin, deeply hydrating and redensifying it. Eventually, Japanese newcomer brand Tokka Labo's most recent supplement includes NMN from fermented broccoli florets and broccoli seed powder as well as willow orchid extracts. The importance of active ingredients was also visible in the many functional anti-ageing beauty launches at the show, especially from the Korean exhibitors. Retinol, cica, niacinamide, ceramides et. al. were very much in evidence, as were highly-concentrated serum, ampoule and essence products. For example, the Dr. Rosa range, introduced by Korea's Cosmax, featured three new functional serums. The Dr. Rosa Cica Exo Calming IV ampoule is based on 83% centella asiatica extract and promises to soothe sensitive and barrier-impaired skin. And Korean makeup brand tFit recently launched two new functional face care line, including the 4-sku Pluvipoe pore care range which offers two different pore-refining serums and a pore-cleansing pudding mask. The active ingredient in Korean newcomer brand Vegetology's 6-sku face care range is antioxidant-rich grape flower stem cell extract which is cultivated in a bio reactor in the brand's own production facility. A different approach to anti-ageing – albeit still ingredients-focused – came from Japanese newcomer beauty brand Rupika which presented a truly innovative beauty product. Rupika Beauty Tooth Gel is packed with glutathione, colloidal gold and tiger grass extract as well as various anti-bacterial ingredients. The dental beauty essence utilises the superior ingredients absorption powers of the mucosal membranes: The mint flavoured gel formula is massaged into the gums – as an additional benefit, gum massage relieves muscular tensions in the jaw and neck area – so the active ingredients are absorbed much more quickly into the body than via topical application. Minimalist, gender-free and vegan beauty was also visible at the show, albeit more amongst the younger beauty brands. Japanese newcomer brand Borderfree offers a compact 3-sku product range of cleansing foam, facial essence and facial cream. With a strong clean beauty vibe and minimalist packaging, this is a classic GenZ/Millennial beauty brand. Korean functional beauty brand Geekko offers a similar brand experience: With 5 highly functional face care products packaged in eye-catching heavy glass flacons, fabric labels and concrete-gray cardboard boxes. With colourful, simple packaging and a distinct unisex slant, Korean indie brand Shupong is also focused on the GenZ/Millennials demographic. The newcomer brand's line-up comprises six products including an innovative pimple patch dispenser reminiscent of an adhesive tape roller which is launching very soon. Finally, Hong Kong-based face care brand Pretti5 focuses on TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) plant extracts in classic clean beauty formulations. Manufactured in Japan, the brand's line-up offers 14 face care products plus the most recent launch, a body cream."
"U.S. prestige beauty grew 14% to $31.7 billion in 2023, Circana reports","The growth streak has continued for the US beauty industry in 2023, said Circana. Sales of prestige beauty industry grew by 14% in value, year over year, to reach $31.7 billion in 2023. In comparison, mass market beauty sales experienced a year-over-year dollar increase of 6%, says the market research firm. In the prestige channel, which includes department stores and beauty specialty retailers, makeup was the fastest-growing category based on dollar sales, while skincare captured the top spot as the fastest-growing category based on units sold. In the mass market, makeup and skincare were the only two categories to grow based on units sold. Within prestige makeup, lip makeup was the strongest performer, growing at twice the rate of the overall category, up 31%, led primarily by products such as tinted lip oils and balms. Looking at prestige skincare trends, face serums and creams, body sprays, body lotions and creams, and body cleansers were among the top performers in the category. Prestige fragrance sales also concluded the year on a high note, found Circana. Looking at product trends, growth is happening on opposite ends of the spectrum. Higher fragrance concentrations including eau de parfums and parfums, which are also higher priced, gained three share points in 2023. On the other hand, lower-priced products, including mini/travel sizes and body sprays, gained traction. Unit sales for mini women's fragrances grew at five times the rate of other sizes, and the size of the body spray market nearly tripled since 2022. The mini trend also manifested itself in gift sets, which was the fastest-growing segment of the fragrance market in 2023. Across prestige hair products, hair styling was the fastest grower, with dollar sales up 24%. This growth was to a large degree powered by innovation: Hair launch volume more than doubled versus 2022. Hair was also the only beauty category to capture more of its sales online, with e-commerce accounting for 52% of the volume. ""The beauty industry is strong and the outlook remains positive for both the mass and prestige sides of the business in 2024,"" said Larissa Jensen, global beauty industry advisor at Circana. ""This performance is remarkable given the phenomenal growth it has experienced for the past two years, but the industry should not rest on its laurels. Consumers continue to cope with economic pressures, and being in tune with their shifting mindset is a must. Flexibility, creative thinking, and effectively harnessing high consumer engagement are all part of the winning formula to drive continued growth."""
"From 'clean girl' to 'glass skin,' skincare is the new star of beauty routines","Influencers and beauty content creators seem to be (re)discovering the art of skincare, and now swear only by makeup removers, cleansers, serums, exfoliants, masks, moisturizers and other products designed to care for the skin. In the launches from major cosmetics brands or on social networks, the emphasis today is clearly on skincare: there are countless techniques and hacks designed to help people get a fresh, luminous, yet natural complexion. According to a report published by Circana last July, more than half of American makeup users (53%) are looking for hybrid makeup and skincare products, up six points on the previous year. This could involve nourishig skin while evening out skin tone with tinted serums and CC creams, moisturizing lips while coloring them with tinted lip balms, smoothing fine lines with anti-aging creams that are also tinted, or nourishing lashes while lengthening them with mascaras enriched with various active ingredients. These hybrid, or two-in-one skincare products have seen unprecedented growth in recent months. On TikTok — a hotbed of beauty trends — the hashtag #hybridskincare has already generated over eight million views, and that's just the beginning. Beyond the time-saving benefits of these products, these new beauty routines reflect a desire to take care of skin without ditching makeup completely. And this inevitably brings Korean skincare, often based on dual-purpose concepts, firmly back into the spotlight. This is supported by a report by the Fresha platform, which says that Google searches for ""Korean skincare"" rose to an all-time high over the past five years, by 258% [1]. On TikTok, the #koreanskincare has notched up over 7.5 billion views, further demonstrating the popularity of such products. Today, the crave for 'perfect' skin is reflected in a surge in beauty trends that that focus on this coveted fresh, luminous, but not overdone look. According to data provided by Fresha, searches for products designed to achieve a 'glass skin' effect, characterized by a naturally fresh, dewy complexion, have increased by 202% over the last five years, while the aesthetic has accumulated over four billion views on TikTok. In the same vein, online searches for 'glowy skin' have soared by 178% globally in the last seven days, driven by internationally renowned influencers including Hailey Bieber, with a hashtag nearing four billion views on TikTok. All these trends — which are converging towards lighter, more natural makeup, without ditching it completely — seem to fall under the banner of the ""clean girl,"" the queen of fresh, natural aesthetics, originating sometime in 2022. It's a phenomenon that has slowly taken hold, and which now seems destined to last and to shake up certain beauty habits. ""The 'clean girl' aesthetic is here to stay and is gaining more and more popularity due to its healthy glowing skin look. With celebrities such as Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber joining in on the trend, fans are also feeling influenced to also achieve the look,"" commented a spokesperson for Fresha. The trend is also seen in the 'high maintenance to be low maintenance' routine, which is based on undergoing demanding and costly treatments from time to time in order to limit the time spent in the bathroom each morning. Add to that a strong interest in foods and supplements designed to nourish the skin from within, as well as in practices designed to enhance well-being, and we're well on the way to a whole a new vision of beauty, based on a holistic approach encompassing aesthetics, as well as physicality and mental well-being."
Trends: How climate change will transform cosmetics,"Climate change is accelerating and becoming part of our daily lives. And while the beauty industry – brands and suppliers alike – is taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint, it is also looking at the practical consequences of the inevitable rise in temperatures. ""Climate goes beyond sustainable development,"" says Pascale Brousse, founder of Trend Sourcing. ""It is important to look at the damage to health and skin, the implications for beauty, and how the industry will respond with skincare, makeup, and perfume"", she adds. According to Pascale Brousse, global warming is creating an ecosystem of consequences for the skin, leading to the emergence of a new climate-related dermatology. ""We are going to be subject to an intense climate upheaval. Droughts, floods, heat peaks combined with humidity, and above all, pollution, will have an impact on the skin. There are more and more allergies, and they last longer because seasons are less marked. Dermatologists have observed a rise in cases of dermatitis, acne and skins damaged by pollution and climate, be it in Asia, South and North America, or Europe"", she continues. More intense exposure to pollution and UV rays also intensifies skin ageing, and all these factors require developing new skincare products tailored to the skin's needs. Given these changes, the new generation of skincare products will be more responsive to the environment, she announces. ""Contextualization will be developed for consumers who will be more receptive. We already have a few examples of these 'Climate-Tracking Cosmetics', including a limited edition by Clinique associated with an application that forecasts the weather and environmental factors. Likewise, Prose partnered with a climate tech company to set up an air quality index"". ""Following the example of the Japanese, maintaining the body's thermoregulation – a sign of good health, vascularized skin, and therefore, of better complexion – will become an objective"", she continues. What's more, climate stress affects more and more people, leading to a growing interest in holistic beauty routines combining body and mind care. ""We are going to want products increasingly related to emotional experience, like perfumes that act on our state of mind. Tomorrow's cosmetics will be based on scents, colours, sounds, and sensations to create synesthesia. We will have multidimensional routines to treat both the body and mind. Skincare products and perfumes will be the new shrinks"", promises Pascale Brousse. Lastly, the shortage of certain natural ingredients due to extreme weather conditions likely to affect harvests may force us to make new choices. Securing supplies is emerging as a key issue. What will be the ingredients of tomorrow? Which natural ingredients are the most resilient? What can we already observe in crops? The consultant has devoted an entire chapter to helping brands with ecodesign and the rise of resilient skincare. Her analysis focuses in particular on smart sourcing in the face of climate change, which has become reality, thanks to biotechnologies, among others. Climate is changing, and beauty is adapting. In this new study, Pascale Brousse takes stock of the key issues to address and outlines a number of avenues for the future."
The age of thrill: five key beauty trends for 2024 and beyond,"As technology and science become integral facets of our always-evolving lifestyles, a growing demand exists for elevated and indulgent experiences. Consumers are newly energized by radical innovations that deliver extraordinary sensations and take performance to new heights. This thrill-seeking culture will impact our vision of beauty, awakening a more pluriversal mindset and establishing next-level expectations, propelling beauty in a Protopian trajectory. ""In an era marked by uncertainties and polycrisis, there is a growing demand for emotionally compelling and exhilarating physical experiences, especially with our ever-evolving lifestyles. Consumers are now invigorated by groundbreaking innovations that offer extra-ordinary sensations while elevating performance to unprecedented levels. This trend of seeking thrills is set to influence our perception of beauty, giving rise to a more individual mindset, and establishing elevated expectations, propelling beauty into an Elysian [1] trajectory,"" explains Leila Rochet, Chief Inspiration Officer of Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation. In the future, all experiences will be hybrid and product innovation will be committed to maximizing performance. New technologies and scientific discoveries, fore fronted by Artificial Intelligence, will transform consumers' expectations, taking results-focused beauty to even higher levels. In the summer of 2023, Ulta Beauty partnered with Haut AI to bring personalized skincare diagnostics to the in-store experience. Following the launch, Haut AI developed SkinGPT - a skincare platform that uses generative AI to visually simulate the effects of products over time, based on a combination of a personalized quiz, uploaded images and clinical data. AI-powered bots will become a familiar feature outside of the professional salon space, meeting the demand for faster and budget-friendly options. Clockwork's $10 mani-bot is rapidly spreading across the US, targeting residential complexes and airports strategically. In beauty, a mindset rooted in science and focused on solutions is making waves and is being embraced by consumers driven by tangible outcomes. Amorepacific's latest innovation, the Lipcure Beam (CES Innovation Award 2024 – Korea) employs precision sensor and diagnostic technology to deliver next-level care. In the Future, Beauty will go far beyond beautification to meet the needs of consumers driven by tangible outcomes and by the need to optimize their daily performance. Beauty adapts to always-on-the-move lifestyles, as the thirst for leisure and the rising nomad economy drive innovation. The travel surge (and of ""bleisure"" – business & leisure) calls for refreshed routines, adaptive textures, and re-engineering of packaging, modifying the practical nature of beauty products. At PFW SS24, (September 2023 - France) Miu Miu presented a collection inspired by the future omni-traveler. Workwear was mixed with beachwear, sportswear was paired with eveningwear, as the brand played with the concept of ""prototypical fashion"", reflecting the growing eclecticism of people's daily lives. Climatic changes will also continue to impact choices and behaviors, calling for new climate-adaptive textures and packaging. Like the After Sun Gel from cult suncare brand Vacation (April 2023), which is primed to cool and soothe the skin after sun exposure. Demand for intelligent SPF hybrids will also rise as daily defense becomes central to the preparation for a better future. Combining a cooling sensation with SPF 50+, the TIRTIR Off The Sun Air Mousse SPF 50+ (April 2023 - Korea) features 2% Zero-Cooling Complex which is proven to reduce skin temperature by -4.8 degrees Celsius. In the future, beauty will need to take an adaptive approach and prime innovations for both the physical and emotional demands of on-the-go lifestyles. Utu is a skincare brand that has been specifically developed to adapt to outdoor lifestyles. Its philosophy is to protect, nourish and rejuvenate both the skin and the planet. Consumers are turning to lavish indulgences and grandiose gestures as a riposte to the daily grind of the recession. A new cohort of thrill-seekers are maxing out on experiences and eschewing convention to party through the permacrisis. The monumental economic success of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour underscores the cultural craving for escapism and consumer readiness to indulge. Beyoncé's Renaissance tour also sparked social media frenzy (#renaissancetour: 3.9B TikTok views), inspiring countless copycat looks. In Korea, crystal nose-bridge embellishments have become a new way to wear face gems, thanks to fans spotting them on K-pop idols Jennie and Rosé from Blackpink during their Coachella performance. The new era of decadence is being shaped by the rediscovery of nightlife, which catapults lavish looks to center stage. This extravagant energy is encapsulated by Lisa from Blackpink's showgirl-esque performance at Paris' Crazy Horse cabaret, where she took up residency in September 2023. Unseen Beauty (UK) is one brand that is driven to deliver extra-ordinary experiences, bringing unexpectedly luxe finishes to makeup. The SPECTRA Eye Colour contains glass microspheres, half-coated with aluminum to transform the product into a bright, reflective silver under a phone camera's flash. Making it the ideal accompaniment to a night out. For beauty, the desire for extra-vagance will call for an abundance of celebratory styles and the innovation of spectacular finishes, and the reclaiming of evening beautification. Value is being rapidly redefined by consumers who are demanding greater environmental responsibility, driving brands to consider the future implications of products. As the climate crisis continues to unfold, innovation will come to the foreground of beauty as consumers look for solutions to increasingly prominent issues caused by environmental deterioration. Waste solutions will continue to rise, and will be encircled into new retail concepts, such as Greez (February 2023 - France) - a resale platform for unsold cosmetics. And as secondhand continues to thrive in fashion, some beauty retailers are also finding there is value in ""perfectly imperfect"" products like This is Beauty (June 2023 – US). A better future calls for a symbiotic approach, blending science, technology, and nature to deliver bold and ambitious products that benefit both people and the planet. The acceleration of vertical farming (employed to great success by Ulé and Caudalie), opens up new territories of tech-driven sustainable sourcing. German brand Gezeiten worked with marine biologists and biotechnologists to study over a hundred compounds to develop Earth Marine CellTech Complex® - a combination of patented marine extracts and a mineral-rich submarine water concentrate. Plastic free solutions will continue to rise with packaging companies like Verity (US) proposing metal as a solution for beauty, or Notpla (UK) which is exploring the potential of regenerative packaging(UK). In beauty, a more holistic approach to innovation must emerge, privileging a more global life cycle approach and scrutiny in sourcing. As stress levels continue to rise in this period of permacrisis (61% of Americans say their stress is at an all-time high, while 89% of Chinese adults are actively seeking ways to reduce stress), emotional-bonding becomes essential in daily behavior. In beauty, this manifests in the rise of comfort-boosting textures and new psychodermatological narratives, which are propelled by TikTok. The issue of skin sensitivity and barrier protection presents a new opportunity for brands to innovate from a perspective of emotional care. The success of Rare Beauty (expected to exceed $300 million in sales in 2023 according to Fast Company), opens the path to more emotion-infused beauty products. In this next phase, brands must consider the emotional implications of products, as consumers look to integrate new levels of care into their daily beauty routine - from the first touch to the finished look - while addressing the biological processes that take place under the surface. In this context, circadian beauty will continue to flourish. Complimentary skincare and supplement brand You're Looking Well (UK) has developed the Night Pill & Night Cream (August 2023) to help users optimize their sleep. In beauty, brands will double down on emotionally-bonding facets - texture, color, scent, packaging - to provide consumers with uniquely sensorial moments. New territories of emotional satisfaction proven by science will also emerge as 70% of US consumers express interest in beauty and personal care products with mood-boosting qualities (Mintel 2024 Global Beauty and Personal Care Trends).

"The state of UK beauty retail: ""We are inundated with brands"" – experts","Last November, beauty brands, investors and consultancy firms met at Beauty Independent's two-day debut Dealmaker Summit EU/UK in London, UK. Amongst the plethora of trends discussed during event, the future of beauty retail was spotlighted. ""For many brands, retail is very, very important,"" said Nader Naeymi-Rad, founder and publisher of Beauty Independent. ""...For many, retailers are, especially now, that key accelerant to get them to the next level. D2C [direct-to-consumer] is great but it can only get you so far. At some point, you need that retail to access those Sephora members, Douglas members etc.,"" Naeymi-Rad told attendees. But, he said retail landscape had been through ""a lot of changes"" in recent years. What was once a very simple divide between mass supermarkets and pharmacies and prestige department stores, travel retail locations and salons had now become a diverse array of stores and marketplaces, from curated multi-brand online platforms like Feelunique to specialist beauty stores like Sephora and mass online majors like Amazon. Clare Horner, group beauty director at UK luxury department store Harvey Nichols, said competition for shelf space was fiercer than ever today due to the ""abundance of brands"" in beauty. ""There has been a massive shift; we are inundated with brands now. The selectivity is really the main challenge,"" Horner said. And a lot of this, she said, was linked to lower barriers of entry for brands and the boom of innovative founder-led brands. Whilst Harvey Nichols still stocked many established beauty brands, she said the teams were now also increasingly on the look out for innovative new offerings, particularly via founder-led brands with stories to tell. ""It's definitely a challenge now for brands. There has been this abundance of new brands and now the retail landscape is on the move again,"" she said. ""We lost Debenhams just before COVID, and that really affected that middle-ground of department stores, and then there's the whole pure-play rise. And retailers like Cult Beauty were very strong in launching new indie brands to market; they really took the space that Space NK used to be in with indie brands, and now it's on the move again. I think it is very challenging for brands to find the right foothold."" Part of this challenge, she said, was also linked to the costs associated with entering retail. ""Trading in retail is an expensive operation and you can't come into it with little or low budgets. At Harvey Nichols, we still do give new startup brands an opportunity if we believe in them, but there has to be a strong level of investment in the product they're bringing to market, even if the brand doesn't have super deep pockets."" Nigel Lawmon, VP of global merchandising for hair care at beauty retail major Sephora UK, agreed, stating brands today had to be investing around 30% in retail and marketing to succeed in the market. Discussing what Sephora looked for in brands, Lawmon said: ""We definitely want to see a brand have had some success in their first market from a D2C perspective. If they have that, that takes them up another notch because they've proven themselves and they've got some money behind them. If they're doing £5 million in their D2C, that's good. ""...We need the brand to help drive their own awareness and then Sephora adds that credibility to the purchase for the consumer,"" he said. Detailing how Harvey Nichols worked with beauty brands, Horner said it centered around creating in-store experiences. ""We don't even classify ourselves as a department store; we classify ourselves as a large boutique for fashion, beauty and food. For beauty brands that work with us, there is a formula and a way of working in our store environment and it's all about the experience and the expertise. Smaller brands, for example, sit within a space called 'Beyond Beauty' and we have our own team trained by brands in that space. But beyond that, we really encourage brands to come in and get involved in beauty masterclasses – connecting with our customer,"" she said. Asked how Amazon had impacted and would continue to impact beauty retail, Horner described the model as ""fascinating"" but said it had not yet to made significant headwinds in luxury beauty. ""The luxury brands don't want to play there (…) because they don't like how their brands are represented. And Amazon are clearly working hard at that and trying to onboard those brands but, so far, they haven't managed to do it."" Irrespective of this, she said Amazon wasn't the easiest route to market for any type or size of brand, because of this brand representation issue but also the struggle in standing out from the crowd. ""I just think: try and build your brand with your own DNA, get it to a certain level, build awareness, and then think laterally about what retail options you pursue. I think Amazon is just so big, you can get lost in that landscape."" Lawmon agreed, stating Amazon was not necessarily the platform that offered most opportunity for beauty brands. ""Amazon are a great logistics company and they shift a significant amount of volume, and we co-exist with them and they haven't ruined our business like they dominated books and DVDs. They took those over and destroyed the high street. But with beauty, you're building brands and also offering high levels of customer service and you're bringing experience through stores, as well as loyalty schemes. These are all the aspects brick and mortar have on a much higher level than the transactional level that Amazon has."""
These three celebrities had the most influence on fashion and beauty in 2023,"These days trends come thick and fast on social media, but there's no doubt that celebrities still have the power to make certain ones go ultra-viral. Some can even boast of turning everything they touch — or promote — into a genuine fashion phenomenon. This year, that was the case for these three celebrities who left their mark on the fashion and beauty history books, at least for the year 2023. Even if you didn't go to the cinema to see the ""Barbie"" movie, you've at least heard of it as it was impossible to miss this phenomenon, the year's highest-grossing feature film, which also meant a neverending series of pink outfits worn by one of the film's stars, Margot Robbie. Not content with showing off her exceptional outfits, including numerous dresses by Chanel (of which she is a spokesmodel) at screenings of the Greta Gerwig-directed comedy, Margot Robbie also shone on the red carpets of multiple fashion events. From the Oscars, where she caused a sensation in a long black sequinned dress by Armani Privé, to the Met Gala, where she wore a vintage creation by Chanel, to the Chanel Cruise 2024 fashion show in Los Angeles, where she stood out in jeans and visible lingerie, Margot Robbie was clearly in the spotlight this year. On TikTok, which has become a true incubator for fashion and beauty trends, not only does the #barbiecore hashtag now boast over a billion views, but #margotrobbie has tallied almost 14.5 billion views, including 340 million dedicated to the #margotrobbiebarbie hashtag. It wasn't on a catwalk that the platinum-album-selling American singer made her mark this year, but on stage. On the occasion of her ""Renaissance World Tour,"" Queen Bey treated showgoers to a veritable wardrobe marathon, with hundreds of outfits custom-designed by top fashion designers and couture houses. In total, this series of concerts enabled her to put on no fewer than 56 musical ""fashion shows,"" a record for the ""Break My Soul"" performer, who has over 319 million followers on Instagram. Among the multitude of outfits in which Beyoncé appeared on stage were clothes and accessories specially designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, Balmain, Schiaparelli, Mugler, Jacquemus, Marine Serre, Paco Rabanne, Loewe, Alexander McQueen and many others. This sartorial showcase also enabled these labels and designers to gain — even more — visibility. It's an image that shouldn't have caused such a stir — why point the finger at a woman who doesn't wear makeup? — but it did propel Pamela Anderson to the top of this year's beauty trends. And not just any beauty trend, since it's the 'no makeup' trend that the Canadian-American star catapulted into the spotlight, an aesthetic choice that prompted even more questioning of societal beauty norms. This despite the fact that Pamela Anderson confided to Elle magazine that she abandoned her beauty routine after the death of her makeup artist, Alexis Vogel. This flash of attention dates back to last fall, during Paris Fashion Week, where the 2024 spring-summer collections were on show. While Pamela Anderson has been starring in a moving, candid documentary on Netflix since January 2023, she made several appearances without a trace of make-up at the fashion event of the year, causing a sensation in mainstream media and on social networks. And this was no 'one shot' move: the actress repeated this tour de force in early December at the Fashion Awards 2023. An ""act of courage and rebellion,"" as Jamie Lee Curtis described it on her Instagram account. ""The natural beauty revolution has officially begun,"" the American actress enthused. A revolution for something that should no longer require a revolution, but one that is helping to shatter a few more of the expectations made of women's appearances."
What were the main beauty trends on TikTok in 2023?,"TikTok is nothing short of a trend incubator and in just a few years has become a leading destination for users seeking inspiration in fashion and beauty. Not content with causing tips and products to go viral in these fields, TikTok is also a reliable barometer for assessing the just how widespread a trend is. So, with the end of the year fast approaching, we highlight the key makeup trends revealed on the platform over the course of 2023, based on the number of views per hashtag. And the results bring some surprises: makeup inspiration from the series ""Euphoria"" is among the most popular, despite the fact that the last season was broadcast on HBO at the beginning of... 2022. On TikTok, the hashtag #Euphoriamakeup generated no less than 2.6 billion views, with a host of tutorials and inspirations to boot. It's worth noting, however, that these figures aren't exclusively linked to the year 2023, but they do testify to a definite craze for beauty looks from the hit HBO series. On the other hand, 'strawberry makeup,' one of summer's key trends, seems to have made its mark in 2023, with some 530 million views. And it's model Hailey Bieber who's behind this look, tested and approved by a host of beauty enthusiasts. Also wildly successful was 'latte makeup,' another must-have for 2023, which is slowly but surely approaching 500 million views (495 million to date, to be exact). The beauty look is essentially defined by warm, almost caramelized tones, giving off the effect of a light tan. In other words, three of the most popular makeup effects of the year. And indeed, the trend has given rise to numerous variations on the theme, such as 'espresso makeup' and 'pumpkin spice latte makeup,' the autumnal variant. Both have already exceeded 60 million and 70 million views respectively. Among the other major beauty inspirations of 2023, 'passport makeup,' which translates into beauty looks designed for passport photos, stands out with over 400 million views. The same goes for 'glazed donut nails,' which generated more than 380 million views, thanks — once again — to Hailey Bieber, whose influence in the world of beauty is unquestionable."
"Cosmoprof India 2023 wraps up on a high note with over 9,000 visitors","""We are excited about the success of Cosmoprof India. For three incredible days, over 9,000 attendees from 55 countries ‐ suppliers, brands, retailers, distributors, and professionals ‐ had the chance to meet each other, explore the cutting‐edge trends and product launches, and get inspired by new tools and solutions,"" said Enrico Zannini, General manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. The B2B show, dedicated to the fast‐growing Indian beauty market hosted over 450 exhibitors from 19 countries. Held from 7 to 9 December 2023 at the Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai, the event welcomed 9,000 visitors from 55 countries, a 20% growth compared to the previous edition.

Cosmoprof India 2023 provided a strategic overview to both the development of the local industry and international trends and brand‐new solutions, owing to the presence of five country pavilions: Australia, Korea, Italy, Taiwan, and UK. Cosmoprof India is set to return at the Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai from 5 to 7 December 2024."
"Make-up: On Tiktok, a quest for fuller lips","The quest in more varied beauty styles is reflected in the fall in interest in injections that modify the natural shape of the lips or the rest of the face, and a much greater craze for makeup techniques that promptly help achieve prominent cheekbones, smoother skin or fuller lips. At the same time, there's also a renewed focus on more demanding beauty routines, in terms of skincare, waxing, eyelash extensions or hair treatments. This kind of time-consuming process is seen as an investment that helps streamline routines to save time in the bathroom every morning. In short, beauty can swing either way right now, from ""less is more"" to ""more is less,"" and that seems to suit most people just fine. In this quest to find the most ingenious tricks to replace less natural beauty procedures, such as injections, social network users are turning en masse to professional makeup artists. And it's Mary Phillips, who does make-up for celebrities such as Sydney Sweeney, Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner and Dua Lipa, who attracted the most attention whe it comes to boost the volume of lips, making them look fuller than ever, without the need for fillers. To achieve this goal a simple lip pencil is all you need. In a video viewed over three million times, Mary Phillips gives a complete tutorial on this makeup technique. All those interested need is a lip pencil slightly darker than their lip colour (but not too dark). Then, they just have to draw a line starting at the outer corners. The makeup artist recommends following the natural lip line, then continuing outside this line when approaching Cupid's bow. For the lower lip, on the other hand, it is recommended to stick to the natural line, extending a little with a slightly more prominent line in the centre. Once this step is completed, one's just has to subtly blend everything with a brush, and apply a touch of concealer to camouflage any pencil that may have overrun, then to fill in the lips with gloss or lipstick, depending on the desired effect. As a result, lips look plumped, but without having lost their natural shape. This trick is reminiscent of a technique shared in 2021 by Mario Dedivanovic, Kim Kardashian's favorite makeup artist. Mario's technique involves drawing quite a thick line on the upper lip, overlining the lip on the Cupid's bow, before bringing the liner in along the lip line as you work down to the corners. Then, again, overline the bottom lip in the center only, then follow the natural line of the lip up to the corners. Finally, fill in with a lipstick of the same shade, or a lighter shade, for optimal effect. A subtly different method, but one that proves that a simple lip liner can be all you need to achieve full lips as 'naturally' as possible. A series of solutions in line with the growing rejection of invasive aesthetic procedures, such as hyaluronic acid injections or similar filling techniques."
"Beyond 'clean beauty', US consumers increasingly seek sustainable products","When people talk about sustainability, it might mean different things to different people. Some may choose to use reusable bags at the grocery store or limit their water consumption while others support fair trade brands. Most associate sustainability more with environmental impact than social causes. According to a NielsenIQ survey, 61% of U.S. consumers associate sustainability with benefiting the planet, 57% with preserving natural resources, and 54% with reducing pollution. Only 33% associate it with better conditions for workers and 26% with societal contributions. While definitions of sustainability may vary, it is becoming more important to consumers. 62% stated that sustainability is more important to them than it was two years ago. It's prevalence in the news and visible real-world effects are propelling this awareness into purchasing action. ""Initially focused on eliminating perceived 'harmful' ingredients, consumers now seek products that not only meet clean Beauty standards but also minimize environmental impact,"" explained NielsenIQ. According to the market research firm, sustainable segments across beauty, are experiencing substantial dollar growth, with compostable products growing by 30.9%, cruelty free products up 18.1%, and plastic free products up 12.2%. Thus, U.S. consumers are transitioning from an ingredient-focused clean beauty 1.0 — with claims like 'paraben-free' or 'sulfate-free' — towards a clean beauty 2.0 that also encompasses environmental concerns, before perhaps also amalgamating the societal issues. Consequently, consumers are paying more attention to packaging waste, with a significant +64% increase in searches for refillable options. ""Consumers are letting us know that sustainability is important to them, and it is a trend we can expect to continue to see in the beauty category. Brands must communicate clear messages about their sustainability efforts to cater to consumers seeking products that align with their sustainability goals,"" concludes NielsenIQ."
"Soft, sensual and contemporary, 'Peach Fuzz' is set to be the color of 2024","Everyone was banking on red, but it's a ""velvety"" and ""gentle"" shade of peach that the global experts at the Pantone Color Institute have chosen as the color of the year for 2024. It's a shade imbued with positive qualities, conveying warmth and comfort and symbolizing community, which undoubtedly reflects a need for nurturing and empathy as well as an air of calm and a feeling of sanctuary. Announced simultaneously on Pantone's website and Instagram account, the color of 2024 is also synonymous with soft sophistication and sensuality. ""A warm and cozy shade highlighting our desire for togetherness with others and the feelings this creates ....Subtly sensual, [it) is a heartfelt peach hue bringing a feeling of tenderness and communicating a message of caring and sharing, community and collaboration,"" Pantone explains on its Instagram account. Adding, ""Highly suggestive of good taste ... Peach Fuzz is a gift to the senses, creating a symbiotic relationship between our sense of taste, sight, touch, and scent."" The economic, social and environmental crises, as well as geopolitical instability, have no doubt contributed to the choice of this soft, poetic and light hue. As Laurie Pressman, vice-president of the Pantone Color Institute, points out: ""At a time of turmoil in many aspects of our lives, our need for nurturing, empathy and compassion grows ever stronger as does our imaginings of a more peaceful future ...in a world which often emphasizes productivity and external achievements, it is critical we recognize the importance of fostering our inner selves and find moments of respite, creativity, and human connection amid the hustle and bustle of modern life."" ""Peach Fuzz 13-1023,"" its full name, succeeds ""Viva Magenta 18-1750,"" a hue between red, violet and pink, again evoking positive values, but more focused on strength, dynamism and energy."
'High maintenance ': the beauty trend shaving minutes off morning routines,"The 'high maintenance to be low maintenance' tend, which has already scored over 50 million views on TikTok, encourages women to invest in more demanding, more costly but more long-lasting services – most of them being carried out by professionals – in order to free up time day to day. This new beauty routine (1.4 million views for #highmaintenanceroutine) is all about getting more sleep, and waking up (almost) ready to leave the house. Actually, 'high maintenance to be low maintenance' may already be firmly entrenched in women's daily habits, with tricks like permanent hair removal, which has been popular for several years now, eliminating the need for daily care. It's an undeniable time-saver, with the added bonus of avoiding ongoing maintenance that can be both restrictive and costly in the long term. On TikTok, it's now customary to share your 'high maintenance routine' and show how it saves you time from the moment you wake up. While laser hair removal is undoubtedly the most popular beauty service, it's far from the only one. In fact, the new routine can be tailored to individual needs and budgets, since there are no strict rules. Salon services include eyelash extensions, brow lamination sessions for full, perfectly defined and neat eyebrows, eyelash lifts for naturally curled lashes, keratin treatments for permanently silky hair, gel manicures (which can also be done at home) or nail extensions, plus microblading for semi-permanent eyebrow redesign and restructuring, and Brazilian hair straightening. There are many other services and techniques that can be carried out by a professional, but these are among the most popular with social media users. Botox is also cited as a way of avoiding multiple facial treatments. But those who don't have the budget for these services can be inventive at home. For hair, a blow-out can hold several days, for example, just as numerous tricks spotted on the social platform can get you perfectly defined curls in record time. These include using socks and the 'ponytail blowout'. But an intense, optimal haircare routine, carried out at least once a week, also means less time spent in the bathroom every day. On the makeup front, tantouring seems to be a top hack for many people. This involves creating permanent, or almost permanent, contouring using a self-tan products. These are just some of the tips that can help streamline a morning beauty routine to gain you a few extra minutes of sleep without having to neglect your appearance."
Trade show report: Three beauty trends spotted at Cosmoprof Asia 2023,"As usual, Cosmoprof Asia took place in two venues - Cosmopack (supply chain / packaging) at AsiaWorld Expo, and Cosmoprof (finished products) at the Hong Kong Conference and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) in Wan Chai – with overlapping opening days (14th to 16th November for Cosmopack, 15th to 17th November for Cosmoprof). Cosmoprof Asia's usual features were also back this year, including the Cosmotalks series of lectures and panels, Cosmo on Stage (workshops and product demonstrations) and the annual Cosmoprof Asia Awards. The event attracted 65,582 visitors from 119 countries. This marked a remarkable 64% increase compared to the previous edition held in Hong Kong in 2019 (which was impacted by the protests), and brought the visitor numbers close to the levels achieved in 2018. Strolling the aisles of the event, Premium Beauty News spotted three key trends: One of the most visible trends at the trade show were active ingredients-led face and body care launches, featuring ingredients such as niacinamide, peptides and retinol. Retinol proved to be particularly popular amongst new Asian launches, especially Korean and Japanese brands while cica (centella asiatica) continues to be a standard ingredient in Korean cosmetics. Korean face care brand Dr. Oracle new three-sku RetinoTightening range contains 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone retinoate, 0.04% adenosine and 2% niacinamide to help improve wrinkles on face and neck. The line-up includes a cream cleanser, ampoule (serum) and moisturiser. Japanese beauty manufacturer Cogit took the basic formula from its best-selling Cica Method range and added retinol in its brand new Cica Retinol Body Lotion. Several face care products featuring the same combination of cica and retinol are set to launch within the next few months. Korean brand Dermafirm introduced two launches this September: The Cica AC range comprises five face care products for problem skin formulated with centella asiatica extract while The Peptide is a more anti-ageing focused range and features a moisturising cream, serum and cream mask formulated with 22 different types of peptides. Microbiome-focused beauty has been a global trend for several years now, and the word ""biome"" was visible in a number of new brand launches at Cosmoprof Asia. Russian natural cosmetics brand Natura Siberica extended its Biome range, which was launched last year, and added more than 20 segmented face care products to the line-up. All products are formulated with fermented ingredients and pre-/probiotic actives. Bulgarian organic beauty brand Alteya Organics also focused on biome protection in the launch of its new Rose Hydrobiome range which contains rose water, marine ingredients and fermented extracts to moisturise the skin. And Dr. Oracle's new 4-sku CentellaBiome line, which contains 7 different types of cica extracts (cica root extract, cica leaf extract, madecassoide, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, asiatic acid and cica extract), was formulated specifically to protect and boost the microbiome of sensitive and troubled skin. Another major trend were aromatherapeutical/functional fragrance and wellness-focused products launches, especially in the home fragrance category. The related category of sleep beauty/sleep tech (a category which includes digital devices, functional foods and beverages, supplements and beauty products designed to improve sleep quality) was also visible at Cosmoprof Asia 2023, particularly amongst the Asian exhibitors. Driven by the pandemic, the global market for sleep tech reached almost 17m USD in 2022 and is forecast to grow by almost 18% CAGR until 2028. In Japan, the sleep tech market doubled during the pandemic, according to Asahi Shimbun newspaper whilst Korean company MediC&C has organised an annual Sleep Tech expo in Seoul's COEX expo center since 2020. Unsurprisingly, a lot of new aromatherapy/sleep beauty launches came from Korean and Japanese brands. Korean functional fragrance brand Arth was launched in summer 2022 and offers a wide range of scented candles, bath/body care, scented multibalms, solid perfumes, room diffusers, and EDT perfume sprays. All fragrances are unisex and formulated with essential oils to help boost emotional health, offering aromatherapeutical benefits such as improving sleep quality and boosting emotional health. Aromang, another Korean indie brand, combines aromatherapy with colour therapy. Aromang launched in 2019 with a product line-up including sleep-enhancing pillow sprays, body oils, face oils and guasha massage tools. The brand's offline POS – there are three stores across Seoul that retail Aromang products – offer colour therapy to guide customers unsure about which fragrance they should choose. Japanese personal care manufacturer NatureLab recently brought out new range of wellness-focused fabric softeners in its Laundrin range - aromatherapeutically-scented household cleansing products, especially laundry detergents, fabric softeners and fabric sprays. The Laundrin Tea collection range comprises four tea scented variants (darjeeling lemon, white tea, earl grey tea and oolong tea) that offer a soothing and uplifting at-home fragrance experience. On the sleep side, Naturelab's launched a sleep-enhancing night-time range. The line-up of Lavons to the Moon line includes room diffusers, fabric softener, fabric spray and scented wardrobe sachets available in two relaxing fragrances. Japanese body care brand John's Blend recently introduced an aromatherapeutical bath and body care range available in three fragrances: yuzu, Japanese cypress and spearmint. Each fragrance sub-range is available as fizzing bath tablets, room spray, hand cream and bath oil, with the aim to achieve a relaxing at-home experience even in small living spaces. Anti-ageing high-tech products and devices are a staple at any Asian beauty trade show, and Cosmoprof Asia 2023 was no exception. The Asian exhibitors in particular were quite innovative in this category. Chinese beautytech brand Nicemay, for example, introduced a new at-home LED mask equipped with options for red light (said to stimulate collagen production) and blue light (to refine pores and improve skin texture). Amongst its more high-tech face mask launches, Chinese beauty manufacturer NBC Nox Bellcow presented an EMS (electric muscle stimulation) sheet mask with integrated electrodes. Once the mask is activated, a very low electric current transmitted through the electrode patches will tone the muscles and tighten the contours of the face. On the low-tech beauty side of things, sheet masks are traditionally a huge category in the Asian facial skin care market and there were plenty of new launches in this sector. NBC's new Nano Instant Tightening Mask is a sheet mask that leaves a creamy/foamy serum layer on the skin once it is peeled off. Thanks to the nano-sized ingredients which include hyaluronic acid and collagen, the serum layers disappears into the skin extra quickly. Korean sheet mask manufacturer Adwin's recent sheet mask innovations didn't just include a new skin-brightening knee mask (flower shaped for easier application on the knees) but also two hydrogel masks with ingredients targeting specific facial areas. The Purederm Multi Area Only Gel Masks feature a different-coloured hydrogel strip across the eye area. This strip contains ingredients especially selected to hydrate the delicate eye area whilst the rest of the face benefits from more active ingredients. Another new Adwin launch was the exfoliating Purederm Sebum Melting Clear Mask formulated with AHA and BHA acids. This isn't a typical sheet mask but rather a half moon-shaped mask sheet was designed to be placed over the nose and the surrounding areas to soften sebum plugs in the nose pores. Unlike pore strips which are torn off and can damage the delicate nose skin, the sebum mask sheet can be easily removed and the blackheads/clogs extracted by hand or with an extraction tool. In 2024, Cosmoprof Asia will take place from 12th to 15th November (12th to 14th November for Cosmopack, 13th to 15th November for Cosmoprof)."
Euromonitor International unveils top six global consumer trends for 2024,"Artificial intelligence, sustainability and social, economic and political factors will determine global consumer trends in 2024, according to the latest report from Euromonitor International. Simultaneously, in a context of economic uncertainties, shoppers will continue to hunt down deals and brands are urged to enhance incentives and innovate around affordability. The report further highlights a notable consumer trend: an increasing focus on health and wellbeing. Thus, according to Euromonitor, the top Global Consumer Trends in 2024 are: Ask AI - New tools are evolving into co-creators for consumers, influencing their decisions and reshaping their expectations of brand engagement. As more than 40% of consumers said they would be comfortable with voice assistants offering personalised recommendations, these platforms will become increasingly integrated into consumers' daily lives. According to Euromonitor, businesses should utilise generative AI to enhance personalisation and improve the overall customer experience. Delightful Distractions - Consumers seek an escape from daily stress and anxieties to break away from the mundane. Some 29% of consumers would be comfortable with brands tracking their emotions and personalising experiences to their moods. Greenwashed Out - Environmental concerns remain top of mind. More than 60% of consumers tried to have a positive impact on the environment in 2023. While consumers are attempting to live more sustainably, they question whether companies and governments are fully utilising available resources to create a meaningful impact. They want organisations to step up and show proof of their eco pledges. Progressively Polarised - Political and social issues are at the core of personal identities. These belief systems influence perspectives, values and attitudes. In 2024, consumers will not refrain from expressing their convictions, found Euromonitor. Social responsibility, political affiliation and sustainability initiatives will motivate spending. Value Hackers - With the ongoing cost-of-living crisis consumers are adjusting their financial mindset and 44% of consumers planned to save more money in 2023. They are employing increasingly clever strategies to get the very best deals. Wellness Pragmatists - Consumers are seeking fast and effective solutions to improve both their physical and mental wellbeing. Demonstrated effectiveness will play a significant role in their purchasing decisions: 85% of consumers would be willing to pay more for beauty products with proven efficacy or benefits. In a context where consumer preferences are closely linked to the sustainability agenda, technological progress and the impact of sociopolitical issues, ""companies should handle sensitive subjects with caution while staying true to their brand's core values,"" commented Alison Angus, Head of Innovation at Euromonitor International."
Men and women in the U.S. are more comfortable with the idea of aging,"In a society that idolizes youth, growing older can feel like a shameful malediction. However, a rising trend of folks are embracing their silver strands. This is supported by the findings of new research conducted by the beauty and wellness booking platform StyleSeat, which polled over 2,000 Americans about their perceptions and experience of aging [1]. But if the overall U.S. population is more comfortable with the idea of aging, social pressure makes it much more complex for women. While 70% of men say they have no problem with aging, only 57% of women say the same. The survey findings show that Americans, men and women alike, are generally accepting of the process of aging and the changes associated with it. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (63%) agree with this statement, and almost three-quarters (73%) even consider older people to be comparable in beauty to their younger counterparts. Surprisingly, younger generations are more prone to say that ""beauty is ageless"": the Gen Z leads the charge with 84%, trailed closely by millennials (73%), Gen X (72%), and boomers at 67%. Here again, however, there are gender disparities, with 81% of women having no trouble equating old age with beauty, compared to only 65% of men. Looking more closely at the changes that aging brings, it seems — in theory at least — that Americans are all for a natural approach. More than half (54%) say they prefer authenticity to camouflaging the signs of aging. Baby Boomers (68%) lead the way in embracing their natural skin, followed by Generation X (62%) and Millennials (53%). Younger people, who nevertheless consider beauty to be ageless, are much less inclined to accept showing signs of age, at least in the future (only 22% chose authenticity). Here again, there's a gulf between men and women. Only 35% of American women are likely to keep things au naturel as they age, compared with 73% of men. If gray hair cannot be associated with age alone, it is undoubtedly one of its symbols. In the United States, only two in five of those concerned say they accept going gray and forego coloring their hair to hide it. But this is — again — more the case for men (54%) than for women (25%). The survey also reveals that one in five Americans opt to change their hairstyle to look younger, including 24% of women and 17% of men. After asking respondents a series of questions, the authors of the study ranked the US states most inclined to accept age-related changes. With a score of around 91/100, Iowa came out on top of the list of states most accepting of aging, ahead of Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota and Kansas. Conversely, with a score of 75/100, Michigan is the worst performer, followed by Maine, Alabama, Florida and Nevada."
Pharma-Recharge Consortium: A successful pharmacy bulk test,"Eight cosmetic brands – Mustela (Laboratoires Expanscience), Garancia, La Rosée Cosmétiques, Bioderma (NAOS), A-Derma, Ducray, Eluday, and Klorane (Laboratoires Pierre Fabre) – united for the first time to set up a shared ecoresponsible project and offer 15 of their products in bulk at physical stores, so they can be purchased as refills in 500-ml glass-based pump bottles. Supported by (Re)Set, a consulting agency specialized in economic and environmental transition, the Pharma-Recharge Consortium launched the experience at the Carré Opéra pilot pharmacy on June 22nd, with a simple, easy-to-use concept compliant with hygiene standards. ""63% of French people would like to buy their usual packed products in bulk [1]"", says Antoine Maret, Open Innovation Director of Laboratoires Expanscience for the Mustela brand, ""but there is no real solution in points of sale. To understand and respond to consumer behaviours, we are now entering a cooperation era. A triple win, economic, ecological, and ecoresponsible cooperation"", he adds. The system takes the form of a piece of furniture shared by the 15 fountains of products and designed by Mobil Wood, an expert in ecodesigned furniture made from wood of French origin. The fountains were designed by Jean Bouteille, a pioneer company specialized in bulk and reuse solutions. The user follows the steps on the control module to fill in their bottle. The latter is to be fixed to the fountain selected, so a predefined dose is automatically poured, and then a label with the batch number and instructions is immediately issued to be affixed on the bottle. Then, the user washes the bottle, takes it back following the instructions given, and refills it for a price inferior to 15% to 20% to the initial price. The washing instructions are provided on the regulatory label automatically printed by the module and are also displayed on the piece of furniture, in the pharmacy. The first time, the bottle costs €1.99, and the number of reuses is counted every time the bottle is refilled. The items selected by the brands are daily products with a high sales volume. They are also chosen for their compatibility with the fountains, in particular in terms of viscosity. They are usually hygiene products like shower gels, shampoos, or micellar water: an oat-based shampoo by Klorane, the Bioderma Atoderm Cleansing Oil, La Rosée's Makeup Remover Micellar Gel, the Mustela Organic Cleansing Gel, Garancia's Pschitt Magique Micropeeling... Driven by two main reasons for buying refilled products, i.e. reduced plastic waste and cheaper price, the pilot experience seems to have appealed to both consumers and the pharmacy staff. After four months, a survey of 150 users revealed that 90% of them were satisfied of the experience, and that 99% supported reuse for hygiene and beauty products. These encouraging results led the consortium to deploy its common project further in various regions. The furniture will be installed in four other pharmacies this November: two in Eastern France, one in the South-West, and one East of Paris. The experience will span six months, until May 2024, so a first assessment can be carried out, but the consortium has announced that several additional brands are already in line to be integrated to the project."
TikTok slated to disrupt the beauty retail space in the U.S.,"TikTok Shop US brings shoppable videos and live stream sessions across the country, thus giving brands, merchants, and creators new tools to sell directly through the app. According to Nielsen IQ, 85% of total TikTok Shop sales during its September launch in the US where in the health and beauty category. Within that category, the top-selling products were: facial skin care, vitamins & supplements, fragrance, teeth whitening kits, lip cosmetics. ""It's not surprising to see facial skin care and lip cosmetics (products that qualify as beauty impulse purchases) rising to the top of the list, but categories like Vitamins & Supplements and Teeth Whitening Kits generally aren't considered impulse categories. TikTok Shop is already driving an interesting new retail dynamic,"" commented the market research firm in a press release. Nielsen IQ also reports that in September, TikTok Shop ranked twentieth in health and beauty sales among e-commerce retailers in the U.S. In view of this meteoric growth, Nielsen IQ thinks TikTok is poised to disrupt the retail space, especially in the beauty category, where social media profoundly influences purchasing decisions. ""The visually appealing nature of beauty products lends itself to the medium of social media, enabling the creation of compelling ads and organic content that resonate with audiences,"" said Nielsen IQ. Of course, influencers a have also played a pivotal role in attracting consumers and driving sales within this ecosystem. In this context, Nielsen IQ announces the launch of a new measurement tool and data tracking service for TikTok sales. ""TikTok Shop is a rapidly growing platform, and brands and retailers need to understand how their products are performing on it. Our new measurement will provide them with the insights they need to make informed decisions about their TikTok Shop strategies,"" explained John Busardo, Senior Vice President and Beauty & OTC Vertical Lead, Nielsen IQ. Please note: The way TikTok is disrupting traditional perfume code will be on of the topics discussed during the next edition of the Fragrance Innovation Summit, which will be held in Paris on October 30, 2023.

Textured hair in France: in the spotlights like never before,"Over 565% growth in 2022 for Les Secrets de Loly, four openings in less than four years for Baraboucle, the latest of which is coming soon in Lille, brands from the United States and the UK, such as Carol's Daughter and Bouclème: the French market for natural care products for textured hair is booming! The term ""textured hair"" is actually quite recent. It covers all hair types that are not straight, including wavy, curly, frizzy and kinky hair. ""Not so long ago, the term ""ethnic hair"" was still used. We've come a long way! We made our debut in Carrefour hypermarkets in the 2000s with what was known as a ""tropical"" operation, and for a long time we remained in the ""products of the world"" section before moving into the hair care section much later,"" recalls Jean-Claude Cheffre, Head of the Activilong brand, part of the Labomai Group (Laboratoires Miss Antilles International), which was created in 1953 by his mother, Yannick Cheffre [1]. ""For a long time in mainland France, textured hair was almost totally excluded from retail shelves and even among hairdressers, who didn't know how to style this type of hair,"" points out Camille Scouarnec, Product Manager at Énergie Fruit. From the mid-1970s onwards, French nationals from French overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM) began to move to mainland France. It was at this time that the first specialised salons appeared. Unlike today's salons, techniques in vogue at the time included texture modification, with the inevitable hair straightening, artificial curls made popular in the United States by Michael Jackson, and chemical colouring... ""These denaturing looks were everywhere: on French television, in the beauty pages of magazines, and were gradually becoming familiar to people. So when we leave our hair natural or braid it, it's as if our hair hadn't been done,"" explains Josiane Ologbi, founder of the minimalist brand Iwalewa. ""In the United States and now in Europe, we're gradually moving away from these preconceived ideas, and that's fantastic! It's still hard in some African countries, such as Senegal, which I visit regularly. It's difficult to get rid of beauty standards that have been ingrained for decades, but it's happening,"" she says with a smile. In addition to the pressure arising from aesthetic - or even social - standards opposed to the nature of our hair, straightening practices and other texture modifications are proving to be very aggressive and raise health issues: burnt, broken, ultra-sensitised hair. A recently conducted American study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) even showed a link between the use of straightening products and the development of uterine cancer. ""When I created Les Secrets de Loly in 2009, the range of products for textured hair in France was fairly limited, but there was already a backlash against silicone-laden products and a pressing need for hair care products with natural ingredients,"" recalls Kelly Massol, founder of the Les Secret de Loly brand, which now sells a product every eight seconds in France! As for Michele Scott-Lynch, founder of the British brand Bouclème, which has been gradually entering the French market since the beginning of the year, she explains that it was when her daughter asked her to straighten her hair that things clicked. ""I spent all my teens and twenties fighting against my hair, trying to change its appearance and straighten it, and damaging it as a result. There was no question of history repeating itself"". This is why, in 2014, she launched a brand to care for every type of hair curl with tailored routines to cleanse, condition and define them. ""What's important to understand is that the curlier the hair, the drier the lengths and the greater the need for hydration,"" stresses Camille Scouarnec. This is because sebum accumulates at the roots, slowed down by the hair's surface, leaving lengths and ends dehydrated. ""At Énergie Fruit, our motto is to offer clean, transparent products for all, without compromising on pleasure or efficiency. Since the brand was created in 2012, we've been offering a shampoo and mask for curly hair under the name ""Coco Curl."" By talking to our online community, we realised that the routine wasn't comprehensive enough. That's why this year we've launched a styling gel and an anti-split end and anti-crease sublimating oil. What's more, we've also launched the Nutri-Intense range, with three products: a shampoo, a mask and a styling milk, for curly to frizzy hair,"" specifies Camille Scouarnec. ""With the proliferation of products on offer, retailers are now paying very close attention to the textured hair segment,"" says Jean-Claude Cheffre with a smile. Until now, French people with curly and frizzy hair had little choice but to order products from the other side of the world or buy them at high prices from only a few distributors, who were often only to be found in large cities. ""With Les Secrets de Loly, my ambition has always been, on the one hand, to offer a range of natural products for maintaining curly hair and, on the other, to make this brand accessible to everyone! That's why, with my sales manager, we're working hard on our distribution network. We're present in Monoprix, thousands of chemists, health and beauty stores, hairdressers and, since 18 September, we're available at Sephora,"" explains Kelly Massol [2]. The brand has also done remarkable work on its social networks, growing from 20,000 followers at the end of 2017 to more than 250,000 in September 2023, thanks in particular to the creation of Christmas boxes with influencers such as La Petite Gaby, Babyatoutprix, Kaaymbl, Crazy Sally... The brand has even ventured to broadcast its first TV advertising campaign in November 2020, in the midst of confinement, on the channels of the TF1 Group. The ad will be viewed by 2.5 million people. A true stroke of genius on the part of Secrets de Loly, whose claims are to dare - at last - wear one's hair naturally. During this time of return to basics, the ""natural beauty"" trend took off, both in haircare and skincare. Morgane Brisson, founder of the Baraboucle hairdressing salons, says that there really has been ""a ""pre"" and an ""post"" confinement period in the move to natural curls. I believe that people realised how good it felt for their hair not to be straightened and tied up all the time."" After three openings in Paris between 2020 and 2023, Baraboucle will soon open its fourth salon in Lille in November, providing an opportunity to target Belgium, where demand is strong, and to meet the needs of people in Lille who used to travel back and forth to Paris just to get their hair done and seek advice. It takes an average of six weeks to get an appointment at one of the brand's three current salons, which shows the need to democratise the range of treatments on offer, but also to increase the number of places where hair curls can be taken care of. Since the start of the new academic year, a certification programme devoted entirely to curly, frizzy and kinky hair is available in five accredited pilot centres (in the Île-de-France, Hérault, Southern France, Moselle and Normandy regions), with other establishments set to join the list shortly. The programme, which will last 217 hours (31 days), will be made up of 8 modules. ""The implementation of this certification is a real step forward for the industry, and the hype around it is a good thing, showing that there are real skill gaps in terms of hairdressing and styling textured hair. On the other hand, it's going to take years to develop, and it only concerns people who are still at school,"" stresses Kelly Massol. ""The truth today is that there are fewer than two hundred hairdressing salons in France that know how to handle this type of hair. It's an issue that Les Secret de Loly has been drawing attention to for quite some time now, particularly with the increasing cross-breeding in our country. We don't realise how many white mothers take their frizzy-haired daughters to their usual hairdresser for the first time and find themselves facing a wall. There are thousands of them,"" she explains. That's why the founder of Secrets de Loly has decided to open her hair academy specialising in textured hair in the first quarter of 2024, in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. The centre will be dedicated solely to training existing hair professionals. At the same time, in 2019, L'Oréal organised, alongside industry professionals, a reflection on the way to upgrade the hairdressing sector, which led the French group to create Real Campus. ""It is part hairdressing school, part entrepreneurial school, and awards a bachelor's degree. It's the highest qualification you can get in hairdressing. At Real Campus, curly, frizzy and kinky hair bootcamps are organised, teaching participants the different techniques involved in hair care rituals, massages, styling and haircuts,"" concludes Margarida Condado, International Development Deputy Managing Director of L'Oréal's Consumer Products Division."
Are noticeable cosmetic surgery procedures going out of fashion?,"Cardi B had her butt injections removed. Courteney Cox, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cameron Diaz and many others have either scaled back on facial injections or stopped getting them in order to move away from the ultra-smooth, mask-like effect... Even the Kardashian clan is said to be taking a step back with reports suggesting that Kim and Khloe have removed their butt implants (although neither has publicly admitted to having the operation), and Kylie Jenner deflating her lip volume. Lip fillers, Brazilian butt lifts (BBL for short), breast implants... these types of noticeable cosmetic operations are fading from the spotlight. The aesthetic trending on social media no longer is one of ultra-plumped lips, dramatic cheekbones, XXL buttocks and breasts. The famous hourglass shapes that have been a staple on social networks for years are gradually being replaced by more natural looks. The result, on TikTok, is a host of young women going to their surgeons to ask for reversals. It's largely a matter of removing implants and fillers to get back one's former appearance. Fran, a 24-year-old flight attendant who spoke to Refinery29, had spent over £5,000 (or over US$6,000) in 2018 to get ""Instagram Face,"" but found that influencers were going back to more natural looks. ""'I've had Botox, dermal filler, weight loss injections, microblading, microneedling, and facial contouring,"" she explains. But when she realized that this aesthetic was going out of fashion among her friends and influencers she follows, she regretted her operations. ""I felt like a bit of a clown when people started going natural, wearing tinted concealer and doing the soap brows, while mine were tattooed on. I was still giving Bratz Doll."" In 2023, the silhouette that is trending is the slim figure of the early 2000s. As a result, many of those individuals who have gone under the knife want to have their implants or fillers removed. On TikTok, hashtags linked to lip reductions total millions of views: #lipdissolving has almost 87 million, #lipfillerdissolved over 44 million. The #breastreduction hashtag totals 1.5 billion views. In the United States, plastic surgeons are seeing an increase in requests for breast reduction with such procedures increasing in frequency by 54% between 2019 and 2022, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Meanwhile some very specific operations have nearly disappeared. The ""fox eye"" style for example. This operation, also known as ""cat eyes,"" involves raising the eyebrows and eyelids to obtain almond-shaped eyes. ""Fox eye thread lift procedures were a trend that was very popular last year, but now fortunately seems to be going out of fashion,"" Dr. Elizabeth Hawkes told Refinery29. According to her, the hype was probably due to filters and apps that alter the shape and size of the eyes. ""But it's a very unnatural look based on a social media trend and generally looks awful."" But can we really call this trend a return to a truly natural look? After all, the current trend towards cosmetic reversals does not mean the end of interventions. And of course, there always seems to be a multitude of new beauty trends flourishing on social networks. But the trend now is to take away more than add. Particularly when it comes to facial procedures. Just look at the craze surrounding ""chin lipo"" or ""buccal fat removal,"" which involves removing or reducing mouth fat."
Southeast Asia and India slated to be next luxury beauty growth drivers,"Global consultancy Kearney and Luxasia, one of the largest distributors of luxury beauty in Asia Pacific, recently released a whitepaper titled ""Unlocking hyper-growth in Asia's luxury beauty landscape"". According to the report, Southeast Asia and India are poised to witness the next ""gold rush"" in luxury beauty, reaching a market potential of USD 7.6 billion by 2026, almost tripling in size within 10 years, with a projected 11% CAGR between 2021 and 2031 [1] (figure 1). The research also reveals that Southeast Asia and India are nearing an inflection point and are poised to enjoy a decade of double-digit growth in luxury beauty (figure 2). In contrast to China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea, other markets in Southeast Asia and India are relatively unsaturated, with limited presence of both international luxury beauty brands and compelling local ones. As these economies mature, the upper- and middle-classes are projected to surpass 1 billion people in 2026 [2], with more consumers expected to trade up from mass to luxury. These market conditions trigger the proliferation of local beauty brands, which tend to play in the masstige category, leaving the luxury beauty segment as an opportunity for international brands. ""This presents a limited but golden window of opportunity for luxury beauty brands to enter now and flourish,"" said Luxasia in a statement. However, harnessing growth remains tricky, due to diverse market ecosystems in Southeast Asia and India. Luxury brands today face six major challenges in this fragmented region, which include: multidimensional omni-retail networks; heterogeneous local product preferences; divergent marketing approaches; challenging regulatory frameworks; costly and idiosyncratic supply chain landscapes; and partner selection amid information asymmetry. Thus, there is no longer a Southeast Asian consumer or an Indian consumer, highlight the authors of the report. ""Each consumer is now 'glocal' and is likely aware of a brand's messaging in the US, Europe, and North Asia markets but also deeply rooted in local preferences. It's crucial to represent brands globally in an integrated manner and react locally to global trends."" Correspondingly, the report outlines six execution imperatives to effectively tackle these challenges. These include optimizing the retail footprint to create multi-touchpoint experience hubs; harnessing continued e-commerce growth unique to each market; forging capabilities to ride social commerce acceleration; building deep local consumer understanding through data aggregation and analytics; leveraging logistics partners to build a robust and flexible network; and winning with the right omnichannel brand-building partners. Since the beginning of the year, many international luxury players have announced their entry into India, or into Southeast Asian markets, with Shiseido and Nars being the latest examples. The impressive growth of the Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN trade show, launched just one year ago, also illustrates the dynamism of the region."

Skincare: Performance remains the #1 priority for consumers in the USA,"Premium Beauty News - What does ""Transformative Beauty"" mean? Leïla Rochet - This is a time of huge transition in the US - socially, politically, economically, environmentally - and these macro shifts are having a significant impact on how people relate to Beauty. Change is in the air, and it is being fast-tracked by new technologies that are quite literally transforming the Beauty landscape in front of our eyes. Transformative Beauty highlights the need for brands to look at innovation through the lens of progression and transformation as people strive to meet radical wellness ambitions, achieve self-determined levels of perfection and adapt their regimes to their transient lifestyles. Transformative Beauty is both an aesthetic and emotional aspiration. Premium Beauty News - What are the main lessons from the report? Leïla Rochet - Performance continues to be the #1 priority for consumers - derma-brands are dominating Google searches and the SkinTok conversation. When you match these expectations with new ambitions of longevity (linked to anti-aging) and the emergence of new technologies then you have the prospect of Amplified Skin. This is a universe of biohacking, AI-optimization and ultra-precise solutions. There are some really interesting new narratives opening up in this space. At the other end of the spectrum we have a universe that is much more grounded in lifestyle: Flex Care encompasses the impact of increased travel, soaring temperatures, increased time spent outdoors, remote working… These are becoming really powerful influences on skincare, driving brands to prioritize climate adaptable formulas, cooling sensations, and portable formats. And it is impossible to ignore the influence of Hailey Bieber on Gen Z skincare trends - in Just Dew It we get into the roots of the latest desire for an ultra-hydrated complexion which can be traced back to her viral social media posts. But this is also about the fetishization of wellness. What does this look and feel like in skincare? What are the new techniques and textures that elevate the daily moisturizing ritual? Premium Beauty News - What effect is the normalization of aesthetic procedures having on the skincare category? Leïla Rochet - Gen Z has really taken the taboo out of procedures, thanks to TikTok. The platform has become the go-to space for people to share their transformation journey, and the culture of creativity has helped spawn a whole new vocabulary for tweakments which are now commonly used in clinical settings. Skincare brands should be inspired by Gen Z's open and candid approach. In terms of innovation, there is now a huge opportunity to develop new categories for products that replace, replicate or prolong the effects of treatments. For example, we are tracking a big surge in at-home acid peels. And the market for aftercare is set to grow exponentially as more and more people opt for cosmetic procedures. Premium Beauty News - How is the rise of AI aiding transformation? What are the implications for brands? Leïla Rochet - We can not escape the influence of AI. It is having - and will continue to have - a seismic impact on the industry as a whole. In skincare, this is quickly shifting from AI-powered skin-health quizzes to mega-personalized biohacking tools- such as Skin Dossier's Precision Skin Health Advisor which aggregates a cross section of data (blood and urine samples, geolocation) to develop the most accurate product, supplement and medspa treatments. AI is also powering the incredibly nuanced analysis of ingredients, which will allow labs to optimize formulations for absolute potency and personalization. As consumers become more comfortable and familiar with AI, their expectations of its capabilities, applications and end-benefits will increase. Brands will have to keep pace, but we see huge potential for AI to support a truly intersectional beauty space. Transformative Beauty: Skincare & Wellness Inspiration from the US was released Early October 2023. Also available at the agency, Transformative Beauty: Makeup report released summer 2023.

Mintel: Three trends set to transform beauty in 2024,"According to Mintel's new report [1], beauty consumers place more significance on value, driving the importance of quality and proven ingredients; consumers also prioritise wellness and accelerate the power of the mind-body connection; in parallel AI transforms the industry through efficiency, innovation and inclusivity. Consumers are prioritising wellness to feel better in body and mind, said Mintel. And the next chapter of the market will be ""mind-body beauty"", where mental well-being and physical appearance are interconnected. Practices like psychodermatology (exploring the relationship between psychological well-being and skin health) and neurocosmetics (which focuses on the mind-skin connection), for instance, will gain traction with consumers around the world. ""The mind-body connection is critical in elevating beauty's role in overall wellbeing,"" said Sarah Jindal, Senior Director, Beauty, Personal Care and Household Research, Americas. ""Brands will look to offer a comprehensive approach to beauty, improving external appearances and enhancing mental and emotional well-being through technology integration, partnerships, inclusivity and personalisation. Advanced data analytics, DNA testing and personalised algorithms will enable brands to innovate customised beauty products and regimens tailored to individual mental and physical needs."" According to Mintel, artificial intelligence will permeate the beauty industry in the form of personalised recommendations, virtual try-on experiences and data-driven insights. AI will transform the beauty industry by making it more personalised, efficient and effective, but transparency and good governance will be critical to growth. ""By analysing data, learning patterns and generating insights, AI is addressing ethical concerns and speeding up new product development. Brands should leverage information, like customer feedback on social media, to identify gaps and create innovative products tailored to specific needs. Going forward, expect to see AI enabling highly tailored beauty experiences based on individual preferences, genetics, environments and lifestyles as well as assisting with precise skin analysis, personalised product recommendations and real-time wellness monitoring,"" added Jindal. The beauty industry will experience a paradigm shift as consumers prioritise efficacy and functionality over extravagant packaging and flashy marketing campaigns. ""Today's consumers are looking for transparency; they are more inclined to seek justification for premium pricing based on tangible results rather than superficial factors. Research, clinical studies or certifications to substantiate their claims of effectiveness will gain credibility and trust. We are seeing a new wave of 'new-age minimalism' and 'coded luxury' as consumer focus shifts away from amassing an extensive collection of products to curating a carefully selected range of high-quality essentials. Expect to see companies invest in advanced formulations, cutting-edge ingredients and technologies for targeted solutions,"" concluded Jindal."
"Show report: Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN 2023, the rise of a major regional event","""The exhibition attracted +78% attendance compared to last year, mainly coming from Thailand and ASEAN countries. In two-year time Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN has become a reference destination for stakeholders from all over the world,"" said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere Group. Indeed, the show that was launched last year with some 500+ exhibitors has already doubled in size compared with its first edition. Cosmoprof CBE Asean 2023 took place from 14th to 16th September 2023 at Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre, with around 1,000 exhibitors and 13,255 visitors from 69 countries. Just like for Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna or Cosmoprof Asia, exhibitors at the fair came from different sectors of the beauty industry, including suppliers (contract manufacturers, packaging and ingredients suppliers), and brands and finished products marketers. However, unlike Bologna and Hong Kong, supply chain exhibitors were the majority at the fair, with only around 1/3 of the exhibition space dedicated to retail beauty. China was the country with the largest number of exhibitors at the show with a presence almost exclusively in the supply chain part of the fair. Thailand was next, with a majority of exhibitors from the supply chain area although some of the country's biggest domestic retail beauty brands, such as Mistine or Karmart, had prominent booths near the main entrance. Korea followed with exhibitors primarily from the finished beauty sector. Japan had a significant exhibition presence as well, while Italy was the only European country with a collective pavilion. According to the National News Bureau of Thailand, the ASEAN region [1] recorded an average economic growth of 5% from 2000-2022. With a combined population of around 672 million in 2022, ASEAN accounts for around 9% of the world's total population and contributed 6.4% to global GDP. With beauty and personal care sales expected to reach USD 29.97 billion in 2023, the ASEAN is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 3.56% from 2023 to 2027 (source: Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN). However, as far as demographic, economic, political and social development is concerned, there are major differences amongst the ASEAN countries making it a highly complex region. Almost all ASEAN countries have their own B2B beauty trade shows, some of which have been taking place for many years, such as: Beauty Expo Malaysia, the Cosmobeauté shows in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam; Beauty Connect Expo in Cambodia and Myanmar, Vietbeauty or Philbeauty. However, these are usually small and very domestic events, with only a handful of non-Asian exhibitors or visitors. Up until recently, there was no major pan-ASEAN beauty trade show. Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN is set to fill that space! Mistine is probably the most famous Thai beauty brand and its exhibition booth at Cosmopof CBE ASEAN was constantly surrounded by visitors throughout the three days of the show. The company showcased at least a dozen new makeup launches, including new cushion foundations, both for its international markets and the domestic sector (the brand has product ranges with specific textures and packaging for its global markets that are different from the Mistine ranges developed for the Thai market), a range of lip-creams flavoured with Thai tea aroma, new pressed powders and blushes as well as lipsticks and glosses. Browit by Nongchat was launched in 2017 by Karmart in collaboration with makeup artist Chatchai Peangapichart (Nongchat). Although Nongchat has since extended his brand into other makeup categories and skin care, its focus remains the brow and lash category. At the trade show, Browit by Nongchat presented half a dozen new eyeliners, mascaras and brow pencils. During the pandemic, the eye and brow product category grew strongly in Thailand and the segment is set to continue on its upwards trajectory – even in September 2023, many Thai still wear protective face masks. The company also presented two other new beauty ranges which were both launched in collaboration with famous Thai influencers. The 3-sku Intimi range – spearheaded by influencer @nn.ladarpha, includes a brightening toner for underarms, elbows and other body areas, a women's intimate wash and a men's intimate wash. Lip colour range Lip It was developed together with mega influencer @nisamanee_nutt. The new line offers a clear SPF15 lip balm, two waxy lip mask sticks and two creamy tinted twist-up lip creams. Cathydoll is another hugely successful Karmart-owned brand, offering makeup, face and body care and, most recently, perfumed body lotions and sprays. The personal fragrance and aromatherapy categories in Thailand are growing in line with the domestic home fragrances sector – anything that helps with relieving stress is popular with local consumers. In the face cosmetics category, one of the newest Cathydoll launches was an SPF 50 mist specifically created for touch-ups during the day. Ultra Light Sun Mist is scented with a fresh, light herbal-citrus fragrance and can be sprayed over makeup. Considering how many cannabis shops and cafés have opened up in Thai cities over the past twelve months – the government abolished its hitherto very strict anti-cannabis legislation in summer 2022, supporting the domestic hemp industry in a bid to bolster the pandemic-affected Thai economy – the lack of CBD beauty exhibitors was striking. There was only one CBD exhibitor with a significant retail range at the show. Dr. CBD launched its Earthlab beauty and supplements brand in 2022. It's latest launch is a sleep-boosting supplement. With 19 million Thai suffering from insomnia in 2019 (a number which is likely to have gone up significantly since then), sleep tech/care is booming in Thailand just as strongly as in other Asian (and European) markets. Earthlab's Dé Leep contains CBD as well as GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), vitamin B complex, l-theanine and turmeric to help improve sleep quality and duration. The Earthlab products are widely retailed in Thailand both online and offline, including trend perfumeries like Eve & Boy and Sephora. Spa beauty is a major category in the Thai beauty market and a few smal domestic spa brands were present at the show. Giffarine's Pattrena range, for example, was extended with six face care products based on Jasmine rice as a key ingredient. The line-up includes a cleansing milk and cleansing foam, cream scrub, moisturising cream, face serum and cream gel. Karmart's Reunrom home fragrance brand offers a wide range of room fragrances inspired by iconic places in Thailand, such as various well-known Bangkok neighbourhoods. Amongst the newest Reunrom launches is the Song Wat range of scented aroma oil and room diffuser - Song Wat is an historic road in Bangkok's Samphanthawong neighbourhood. And Saraburi, another new launch of aromatic oil and room diffuser, is inspired by the eponymous city in central Thailand. The Reunrom brand has grown considerably over the last few years, and its product ranges are available both in perfumeries and drugstores as well as branded stores and shop counters in luxury malls and department stores. And in August 2023, Mistine launched scented candle and home spa range Amorn Apothecary to commemorate the brand's founder Amornthep Derojanawong. The new line offers three scented candles, a body scrub and a body oil formulated with three types of Thai rice (white jasmine rice, red jasmine rice and black glutinous rice). Launched in 2020 during the pandemic, Taiwanese brand Oooh offers hand sanitisers and liquid hand lotions that come in stylish refillable packaging. The brand recently launched a range of sophisticated unisex EDTs. The formulations contain antibacterial persimmon-derived tannin extract which helps to destroy the odour bacteria in sweat, so the fragrance can be applied on sweaty or humid skin and still stay true to its scent notes. A few clean and/or natural beauty launches were also visible at the show, although primarily from Korean exhibitors. Ecobe, for example, was launched in March 2023 specifically for distribution outside Korea. The brand offers clean and vegan face care products packaged in simple, stylish glass bottles. And clean beauty brand Lalaits launched in 2020 with a natural-positioned range of face and body care formulated with marine ingredients such as algae and lava sea water sourced from Korea's famous Jeju island. Thai indie brand Varenn was launched in 2021 and has already achieved a solid online and offline distribution. At the show, Varenn presented two new oil-based products which will be launched in the next couple of months: the aromatherapeutical Intensive Night Revival Body Treatment Oil is a moisturising plant oil blend scented with a relaxing, sleep-promoting fragrance. And Day to Night Lip Serum Oil is a rich oil-based lip balm cream which can be used as an over-night lip treatment or to soothe dry and cracked lips during the day. Functional anti-ageing face care was primarily the purview of the Korean beauty brands, like Trimay. For instance, the Korean brand was launched in 2018 and offers around 120 face and body care SKUs. Spicules Tox, one of the brand latest anti-ageing launch, features active ingredients manufactured as tiny spikes (or spicules) that create a micro-needling effect when the cream is massaged into the skin. Next year's Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN is set to take place from 13th to 15th June 2024 at Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre in Bangkok. ""The new dates will better reflect the season trends and habits influencing business activities in the region,"" said the organizers."
"U.S. makeup market to proceed with resilience despite headwinds, finds Mintel","After rebounding with 9% growth in retail sales in 2022, the color cosmetics market continues to exhibit strong growth; however, inflation accounts for much of this. By the end of 2023, total retail sales of the US color cosmetics market are estimated to increase by 10% and exceed USD 13.6 million. With many consumers returning to pre-pandemic, in-person activities, demand for innovation—especially in the facial and lip cosmetic segments—is expected to boost total market sales this year. However, according to Mintel, the market is expected to level off over the next five years, growing 9% to reach USD14.9 million by 2028. [1] ""In today's cost-conscious environment, value is the name of the game. Persistently low consumer confidence continues to drive cost-conscious shopping behaviors, including the popularity of dupes, with social media playing a big role. This is especially true among younger consumer groups, which are more likely to be influenced by and take inspiration from social media,"" said Joan Li, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. According to Mintel, three-quarters (74%) of makeup users agree that affordable makeup products work just as well as premium ones, suggesting a makeup culture favorable toward 'dupes.' Indeed, a third of makeup consumers ages 18-24 (33%) and 25-34 (35%) say they have purchased a makeup 'dupe' because of something they saw on social media. However, the 'lipstick effect'—in which color cosmetics are viewed as an affordable luxury during times of financial uncertainty — protected the category from high inflation's threat to discretionary spending, so far. Nevertheless, looking ahead, the color cosmetics market is expected to level off. ""Our research forecasts that growth will slow due to headwinds from continued trade-down behaviors, the mainstay of work-from-home and hybrid lifestyles, and competing growth in beauty-adjacent categories like ingestibles and skincare,"" highlighted Li. Makeup consumption is all the more likely to slow down as interest in this category seems to be waning. Mintel data reveals that 35% of makeup users are applying less makeup than a year ago compared to 25% who are using more makeup, indicating an overall decline in engagement in the category. The most popular reason for decreased usage is fewer out-of-home occasions (37%), followed by loss of interest (32%). Breaking down these reasons by age, however, it becomes clear that reasons for wearing makeup less frequently are overwhelmingly driven by older individuals, particularly women 55+. Interestingly, men represent the primary growth behind those who are applying makeup more often, as 43% of men ages 18-44 say they are using makeup more often than a year ago. ""Our research shows that men's appearance concerns are focused on complexion and blemishes, which leads them to prefer facial cosmetics over other segments,"" said Li. As far as younger consumers are concerned, Mintel found that two in five (42%) women ages 18-34 who use makeup products say they wear makeup less often than last year due to skin health concerns. The following top reason for wearing makeup less often is having less time (39%). However, 67% of makeup users ages 18-34 say they are paying more attention to ingredients used in makeup products than a year ago. ""Given that there were fewer out-of-home occasions to inspire color cosmetics use, 18-34-year-old Americans may continue the habit of using makeup on an every-other-day or weekly basis, demonstrating a 'flexitarian' approach that is perceived to be more convenient and healthier for the skin. As the health and wellness industry expands to include emotional well-being and skin health, consumers will increasingly challenge beauty brands to clearly communicate the roles brands play within the evolving industry,"" concluded Li."
A third of the population rates their well-being as the lowest ever,"Almost a billion people worldwide were affected by a mental disorder in 2019, just before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to data published by the World Health Organization (WHO). Social and economic inequalities, as well as war and the climate crisis are among the factors contributing to a degraded well-being of the world's population, in addition to the health crisis. In 2022, the WHO estimated that depression and anxiety had risen by more than 25% in the first year of the pandemic. But it would seem that the malaise runs much deeper, as people's morale has not improved with the ""return to normal,"" as a new global study reveals. Carried out by Edelman Data & Intelligence for sportwear brand lululemon, this third edition of the Global Well-being Report surveyed respondents in 14 countries, including the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, Japan, Singapore, China and New Zealand, with 1,000 people per market, for a total of 14,000 participants [1]. The findings underline the importance of taking into account people's mental health, and taking actions to bring about change. Something called for by the WHO just a year ago. The authors of the report selected three criteria — physical well-being, mental well-being and social well-being — to reflect the balance that enables people to feel good. The survey results show that well-being is now considered a priority for over two-thirds of the world's population (67%), including 80% of Spaniards and 72% of Singaporeans and Thais, and, by contrast, just 44% of Japanese and 62% of South Koreans. In France, 68% of the population consider well-being to be a priority, but 40% consider it impossible to achieve. This figure rises to 44% worldwide, and even 48% in Thailand, Singapore and South Korea. Another fact to bear in mind: only 12% of those surveyed worldwide believe that their well-being is where it should be. On the global scale, more than one in three people say their well-being is the lowest it's ever been (34%). This sentiment is pronounced in Thailand (48%), Singapore (40%), and South Korea (39%), but much less so in Japan (20%), mainland China (28%) and France (29%). The current state of the world, all issues considered and the foreseeable future are sources of worry, as 41% of the world's population say they are discouraged when they think about it. Nevertheless, some populations are optimistic about the future: this is the case in China, where 67% are optimistic, compared with a global average of just 42%. Looking at what's standing in the way of respondents enjoying a higher level of well-being, be it mental, physical or social, climate change is cited as a key concern. More than four out of ten people surveyed worldwide (41%) stated that it heightens their feelings of anxiety, compared with 59% of respondents in Thailand, 58% in South Korea and 44% in Hong Kong. Environmental issues are less of a source of anxiety for Germans (34%), Australians (34%), Canadians (35%) and New Zealanders (36%). Global media coverage also plays a role in how anxious individuals feel. One in two of those surveyed say that certain topics in the news have an impact on their personal well-being, inflation being one of them. More than half the world's population (56%) say they are worried about how they will meet their needs in the face of ever-rising living costs, and 54% are alarmed about how their finances will be managed in the current year. It's worth noting that the Spaniards and the French are the ones who feel most affected by certain issues raised by the media, at 57%, while respondents in China (44%), Japan (46%), Canada (48%) and Singapore (48%) appear less so. Societal expectations of all kinds also influence levels of well-being around the world. Internationally, nearly four out of ten respondents (39%) consider that the pressure to conform to societal norms has a negative impact on their mental well-being. In Thailand, more than half the population suffers from this pressure. And it's a vicious circle, since such norms also play a role in whether individuals feel that they can speak freely about mental health. Worldwide, more than four out of ten people (42%) say they feel obliged to feign happiness even when they're down. More than one in two respondents (55%) feel that ""society is judgmental towards those who have lower mental well-being."" Lack of time, lack of financial resources and the taboos surrounding mental health are all obstacles that get in the way of people taking care of their well-being or seeking out help. Respondents also signaled a lack of infrastructure, support or services dedicated to mental health. Nearly three quarters of those surveyed (74%) consider that institutions do not do enough to facilitate the well-being of society, and seven out of ten employees even feel that their employer has a responsibility to improve well-being. And the level of well-being has consequences, both professionally and personally. On average, individuals miss five days of work a year due to low well-being, compared to nine days in Germany and three in Japan. Internationally, employees also say they are less committed (48%) and less likely to accept responsibility (37%) when their well-being is low. And this would even have an impact on their role as a parent, since more than four out of ten respondents (44%) feel they are ""not the parent their children need them to be"" when their well-being is low worldwide. But individuals are seeking out solutions for feeling better. These include physical activity, setting limits in one's professional and personal life, focusing on positive things, taking time for oneself, and simply expressing one's needs freely to those closest to them."
Make-up trends: Brown lipstick is on its way back,"Down, but not out! After being shunned during the Covid-19 pandemic, lipstick has managed to make its way back into people's makeup kits, even daring to get a little bit wild during the summer season. But now the focus is on fall and its warm, rich colours, with the return of a trend straight out of the 1990s: brown lipstick. The shade is winning over the younger generation on social networks, as well as at New York Fashion Week. For several weeks, and especially as fall approaches, brown lipstick has been spreading at speed on social networks, to the point where the hashtags #brownlipliner, #brownlips and #brownlipstick have reached over 156 millions, 90 million and nearly 85 million views respectively on TikTok. The result is a host of tutorials celebrating this key trend of the 1990s, reminiscent of Rachel Green's iconic beauty looks in the hit show ""Friends."" By turns matte, glossy, dark, light, sophisticated or natural, warm or icy, brown lipstick can be worn in almost any way. Users all seem to agree on two points: the need to use a pencil to define the lip line and enhance the colour, and the need to keep face and eyes simple to avoid a makeup overload. But social media users aren't the only ones to have embraced this trend. The celebrities present at New York Fashion Week also seem to have jumped on the brown lipstick look. Avril Lavigne, Julia Fox, Paloma Elsesser, Emily Ratajkowski and Elsa Hosk all flaunted the color on the fringes of the spring-summer 2024 shows held in the Big Apple, while many designers swapped red and pink for brown hues on the catwalks. This was the case at Sergio Hudson and PriscaVera, among others. In recent months, all signs have been pointing to the return of brown lipstick. It started back in 2022 with ""brownie glazed lips,"" which brought controversy for Hailey Bieber, the star who helped popularize the look. More recently, the ""Cherry Cola lips"" trend celebrates a brown shade reminiscent of the famous soda, albeit with a cherry red tint. Then there's ""espresso makeup,"" which gives pride of place to warm, deep brown shades. Although the comeback is still in its infancy, brown lipstick could shape up to become one of the major inspirations of fall 2023."
Exports of French cosmetic products remain on double-digit trend,"Driven by demand from the main European markets and the United States, French exports of cosmetic products continue their impressive growth. According to the Federation for Beauty Companies (FEBEA), the country exported a value of 8.6 billion euros of products over the first five months of 2023, an increase of 15.6% compared to 7.4 billion euros over the same period last year. Hence, French cosmetic products continue to win over consumers around the world! After an increase of 18.8% in 2022, this mid-year report for 2023 confirms the dynamism of the two most successful categories of French beauty, ""Perfumes"" and ""Make-up and face skin care"", which respectively grew by 16.7% and 16%. Alone, these two categories account for nearly 86% of French exports. But ""all categories of cosmetic products recorded good results,"" said the FEBEA. Although international demand remains strong, China has ceased to play the leading role and the European Union and the United States have taken over. With 3.4 billion euros exported between January and May 2023 (+26.1% compared to 2022), the European Union remains the leading export market for French cosmetics; the region accounts for more than a third of total exports. Germany, the largest European beauty market, is also the main importer of French cosmetics. Export to this country grew by 22.2% in the first five months of 2023. Exports to Spain grew by 22.6%, confirming the country's position as the second largest market in Europe for the sector. Italy, with an increase of 21.3%, consolidates its third position. As far as the US market is concerned, French exports grew by 15.4% during the period. The United States remain the first buyer of French cosmetic products. To date, one in five perfume products is exported to the USA. On the contrary, exports to China, which increased by 1.1% over the first five months of the year (compared to the same period in 2022), are a bit disappointing for the French industry, despite an increase of 5.9% of the ""Makeup and face skin care"" category. The Chinese economy is struggling to restart and this is impacting the entire Asia region where exports only grew by 6.7%. For its part, the Middle East has not picked up the slack and recorded a slight decline in performance at the start of the year, with a drop in exports of 0.4%. According to FEBEA, this figure is mainly explained by the sharp decrease in sales to Saudi Arabia (-25.4%), while the United Arab Emirates continued to show strong growth (+14.5%). ""These disparities do not prevent the French cosmetics industry from continuing, overall, its remarkable export growth,"" commented Emmanuel Guichard, general delegate of FEBEA. ""The sector contributes significantly to the improvement of the French trade balance, despite current economic and geopolitical uncertainties. These performances reflect the sector's capacity for innovation, and in particular that of SMEs and VSEs which represent more than 80% of companies in the sector. Their dynamism and creativity contribute to increase, year after year, the attractiveness of French cosmetics around the world."" In total, more than 60% of the total production of the French cosmetics industry is exported."
"Social media increasingly influence purchasing decisions, says Klarna","Advertisements, TV shows, magazines... where do you look for inspiration when it comes to new trends, or even future purchases? While these sources of influence have been around for decades, we now have to add social media to the mix, as a space where brands, retailers and other influencers share their picks and new products, particularly in the sectors of fashion, beauty and gastronomy. And it would seem that these digital channels are particularly effective in winning over potential buyers, to the point of transforming their consumption habits and purchasing behavior. At least, that's what Klarna's latest Shopping Pulse report, carried out in collaboration with Nepa in 18 countries worldwide, including France, the USA, Norway and the UK, suggests [1]. Nearly six out of 10 American consumers (58%) say they have already purchased a product after seeing it on social networks (in the month preceding the survey). This figure rises to 70% among American Generation Z consumers and 96% among millennials. In just a few years, social platforms have become powerful influencers for the younger generations — at least those of purchasing age. ""The shopping discovery path is shaped in different patterns across countries and generations but one common unifying factor is the tendency to rely on digital channels to an increasing extent,"" the study reads. However, when it comes to social media influence, retailers have a higher impact than influencers in most countries. The Netherlands, Belgium and Poland being the only exceptions. Influencers have a bigger impact than retailers on Gen Z, and the opposite is true for older generations. Facebook comes out on top, with 62%, as the preferred social platform for shopping in the US. The social network created by Mark Zuckerberg is a bit ahead of YouTube (55%), Instagram (42%), TikTok (40%), Snapchat (29%) and Pinterest (23%). This ranking is based on the responses of all the American respondents, across all generations, but changes somewhat according to each generation. Those in Generation Z, for example, turn to Instagram to make purchases (49%), followed closely by TikTok (48%), YouTube (40%), Facebook (43%), Snapchat (35%) and Pinterest (15%). While American consumers are particularly keen to use social networks to find inspiration, and even to purchase products online, the 58% of those who have already done so is followed by Australians with 54%, 44% of Britons, 43% of Greeks, 42% of Spaniards, and 41% of Portuguese and New Zealanders. The phenomenon is therefore not confined to North America, even if some nations are (for the time being) more reluctant to transform a purchase thanks to social platforms. This is particularly true of the Czech Republic (28%) and Finland (29%)."
"Canadian beauty industry sales rise 19% in the first half, Circana reports","All beauty categories registered double digit growth in value and makeup was the fastest-growing category, with sales revenue up 25% in the first half, contributing over 40% of total beauty industry gains during this period. Face makeup sales grew by 33%, led by blush, bronzing and highlighting products, and setting sprays. ""In Canada there is a heightened focus on complexion and healthy skin,"" said Circana. This trend aligns with skincare being the largest category in Canada and growing – with sales revenue up 16% in the first half – and the ongoing 'skinification' trend, as makeup products with skincare benefits continue to sell well. The 'skinification' trend is also playing out when looking at the evolution of lip makeup sales. Lip was the fastest growing segment in makeup, with sales up 42% in the first half, according to Circana. While lip color performed well, the strongest growth came from other lip makeup, predominantly hybrid products such as lip oils and balms. Collectively, these products, which are primarily intended to hydrate and moisturize with a tint of color, represent only one-quarter of lip makeup sales but contributed over 40% of the sales revenue gains in the first half. The hair product market in Canada is also growing at a healthy clip. Hair category sales revenue posted a 17% increase in the first half of 2023. Hair styling products grew the fastest, followed by hair care including shampoos, conditioners, and masks, as consumers prep to go out while also continuing their at-home treatments and rituals. ""Amidst pricing pressures and financial uncertainty, Canadian consumers remain focused on health, wellness, and an overall investment in themselves, and they continue to see beauty products as an important component of these priorities,"" said Alecsandra Hancas, Canadian beauty industry analyst at Circana. ""Every beauty category is growing in terms of both revenue and units sold in 2023. The highest pricing increase came from fragrance, which is also telling of the consumer mindset and the high value they place on emotionally driven purchases."" Looking at channel performance, consumers returned to in-store purchasing and continue to spend more, on average, especially when shopping for makeup and fragrances. In-store sales outpaced the online channel, with sales up 20% in the first half, versus last year, and accounted for 75% of sales. Online sales, which remain elevated but have stabilized since pre-pandemic 2019 levels, grew across every category in the first half. Similar purchase patterns are happening online and in-store, with the strongest growth coming from the makeup segment, led by lip and face makeup. A similar market momentum was recorded in Canada's southern neighbor. According to Circana, U.S. prestige beauty sales grew by 15% in the first half of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, with makeup ending the first half of 2023 as the fastest growing category."
"National beauty brands are quickly gaining ground in China, finds Dynvibe","""When it comes to beauty, Chinese consumers are increasingly turning to local brands. The growing nationalism of society and the pride vis-à-vis made in China goods only partly explain this phenomenon, which is also fuelled by the increase in the quality delivered by local brands"", explains Anne-Cécile Guillemot , co-founder and Consumer Insight Director of the social intelligence agency Dynvibe at Premium Beauty News. In statistics, international brands continue to dominate the Chinese cosmetics market, especially in the premium and luxury segments. Today, four of the top five cosmetics brands sold in China still come from overseas, but international dominance is less clear in the top 10, which has recently entered several local players. However, most Chinese brands remain focused on the mid-range and low-end segments. To bridge the technological gap that still separates them from the best international standards, Chinese brands are investing massively in R&D and do not hesitate to buy foreign laboratories, such as Yatsen, with Galénic and Eve Lom, or S' Young International, with Pier Augé and EviDenS de Beauté. With some success, according to a recent note from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), which assures that the innovation cycle of Chinese cosmetics brands generally takes three to six months, while the R&D time of international brands is more than twice as long! And that's not all, according to Anne-Cécile Guillemot. ""Chinese brands are offering higher quality formulas in increasingly attractive packaging. But they also have a better understanding of consumer expectations. In the mass market, they now offer quality equivalent to their international competitors with better price positioning,"" she underlines. For the co-founder of Dynvibe, not only do local brands perfectly understand Chinese culture and codes, but they are carefully monitoring trends emerging on social networks. Their agility allows them to respond very quickly to specific expectations and emerging market trends such as high performance skincare, well-being and scientific claims. ""We can cite the case of brands like Out of Office or Into You and its now famous Lip Mud,"" she says. Very attentive to their audience, Chinese brands are also very reactive when it comes to responding to international trends such as the blurring of boundaries between the well-being and beauty categories. ""Well-being and mindfulness are a major global trend that is also visible in China, where consumers seek to relieve the stress of their hectic daily lives through skin and body care rituals,"" explains Anne-Cécile Guillemot. ""Consumers therefore appreciate brands that are able to establish with them a real emotional connection on these subjects."" For instance, in order to go beyond skincare, Proya has launched campaigns aimed at raising public awareness and encouraging discussion on social issues, in particular the mental health of young people. Users are highly interested in the videos the brand uploads on these topics because they express their frustrations and address issues they don't dare address in public. The brand also invites medical professionals to discuss youth mental health and provides free online therapy support for those who need to be heard. Young users massively comment on Proya's publications and seize the opportunity to share their emotions in public. Enough to create strong emotional bonds!"
Make-up drives sales of mass and prestige beauty products in the U.S.,"U.S. prestige beauty industry sales amounted to USD 14 billion in the first half of 2023, a 15% increase versus the same period in 2022. In comparison, the mass beauty market generated USD 28 billion and grew 9%, according to Circana, formerly IRI and The NPD Group. ""Beauty continues to be the darling of retail through the first half of 2023, maintaining its position as the only industry to grow based on units sold across the general merchandise and consumer packaged goods categories Circana tracks,"" said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at Circana. ""The beauty industry is hitting the right notes, meeting consumers' emotional needs through new and existing products, which is especially welcomed at a time when spending power continues to be squeezed."" Makeup ended the first half of 2023 as the fastest growing category within the prestige market, with sales revenue up 18%, and outpaced sales at mass merchants by growing at twice the rate. Within the category, lip makeup was the fastest-growing segment, and inclusive of both prestige outlets and mass merchants. These results come during a time when makeup usage is also on the rise. According to Circana's 2023 Makeup Consumer Report, makeup usage increased by 3 percentage points in the past year and has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Face serum, body spray, and facial cleansers were the top gainers in the prestige skincare market for the first half of the year. Fueled by new launch activity, clinical brands brought in the majority of the prestige skincare sales gains. Overall facial skincare usage in the U.S. remains flat compared to last year, according to Circana's 2023 Facial Skincare Consumer Report. While usage remains consistent, product preferences are shifting. Consumers are increasingly turning to hybrid products that together address skin concerns and provide makeup coverage. In addition, more channel blending is taking place as 67% of consumers feel that skincare brands at drug stores or mass merchandisers are as good as higher priced department store brands, a sentiment which is up from last year. Gift sets, higher concentration fragrances, and mini sizes are outperforming the overall prestige fragrance market. Sales of fragrance gift sets grew by 26%, or twice the rate of the market. Eau de parfums and parfums were the only formats to experience a year over year increase in units sold. Minis, or fragrance sizes under one ounce (28 ml), accounted for 38% of total fragrance juices sold. Although sales revenue is significantly higher in the mass market, hair product sales continue to grow at a faster clip in the prestige business, with online capturing about half of the sales. Furthermore, hair is the category with the highest average price increase in the prestige beauty market, growing at three-times the rate of the overall industry. Styling was the fastest-growing segment in prestige hair for the first half of the year."
"The 'honey lips' makeup trend marks the return of luscious, shimmering lips","On social networks, honey is now being embraced by beauty enthusiasts — and, more specifically, makeup fans — whose latest obsession is 'honey lips,' a lip colour and finish inspired by the characteristics of the product, channelling shine and shimmer, with a rich, luscious effect that sets it apart. The idea here isn't to use honey directly — despite its many benefits for the skin — but to try to reproduce the shine and luster of the sweet substance on the lips. It's an idea that's become a viral hit on social networks, with the #honeylips hashtag scoring no less than 3.2 million views in just a few weeks on TikTok. It's the beauty content creator, Eva Larosa, who is behind one of the most-viewed videos on the subject. And that's without counting those for her 'honey girl makeup' tutorial, which shows viewers how to create a complete makeup look inspired by the sparkling amber hues of honey. So how do you get 'honey lips'? As we've seen, you don't need to go digging around in your pantry to recreate this beauty trend. A lip liner, gloss and eyeshadow are more than enough to get to work. To begin with — and as for any lip look — dead skin should be exfoliated to ensure you're working with a smooth, even surface. Next, apply gold eyeshadow at the cupid's bow and in the center of the lower lip, line the lips with a pencil in the same shade as the lips or slightly darker, and finish with a high-shine gloss. And that's it. 'Honey lips' are part of a wider trend that has been seen for several weeks in the beauty world, which involves drawing inspiration from food, drinks and other sweet treats to perfect summer makeup looks. Examples include 'syrup nails', espresso makeup, with its coffee-inspired hues, and strawberry makeup for a healthy ""sun-kissed"" glow. We should also mention the ""tantouring"" trend, which also marks the return of audacity in make-up!"
More and more men are taking the Botox plunge,"Male demand for aesthetic procedures has been on the rise. On TikTok, hundreds of videos show men getting Botox injections. And the phenomenon is gaining momentum on the social network, with the hashtag 'Brotox' racking up 17 million views. Patients and practitioners alike are multiplying the number of videos showing men getting the injections. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Botox injections are the most popular minimally invasive cosmetic procedure for men. In 2020, some 265,000 men in the US underwent the procedure, an increase of 182% since 2000. In fact, men account for 6% of Botox injections in the United States. Liana Sahakyan, a nurse and co-founder of Lauréate Aesthetics in Los Angeles, is only too familiar with this rise in male demand. About 20% of her clients are men, she tells the NY Post. ""We've observed a steady increase in male patients seeking various cosmetic treatments over the past few years. While Botox is the frontrunner, procedures like dermal fillers and laser treatments are also gaining traction among our male clientele,"" she told the US media outlet. This demand has become all the more apparent since the Covid-19 pandemic. Plastic surgeons and dermatologists have experienced overwhelming demand for their services in the wake of the pandemic. This is due in particular to the ""Zoom boom,"" and the ubiquity of videoconferencing. And that's not to mention social networking, which has changed the way we perceive ourselves. The advent of selfies, for example, has set new standards for beauty, and is at the root of cosmetic procedures such as rhinoplasty and bichectomy. This is particularly true of Generation Z. Shelly Woods, an advanced aesthetics practitioner and founder of Skin Techniques, sheds light on how aesthetic modifications have moved into the mainstream: ""For Gen Z, Botox has become another way to personalize the way they look — it's now treated like a haircut or hair colour,"" she told Metro UK. ""As the trends change, young people are the ones leading those trends on platforms like TikTok and influencing the new standard."" In addition, the specialist told Metro UK that Gen Z males are ""more aware now than ever"" of their aesthetic image. This booming business is being fueled by beauty ideals and standards imposed on men, which make aging a taboo. Shelly Woods points out that men are now under ""huge pressure to stay healthy and fresh,"" and as a result seek, to convey a certain ideal ""that they see on celebrities, influencers, films and on their social media pages."" Like what women have been experiencing for a very long time. Among male celebrities, cosmetic procedures are becoming an increasingly accepted and uninhibited subject. In 2021, Joe Jonas, singer and member of the Jonas Brothers, admitted to having had Xeomin injections, an injectable treatment similar to Botox commonly used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. He had also advertised it on the Instagram page of Xeomin Aesthetics. And that's without taking into account the influence of Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" movie, and the Ken character played by Ryan Gosling, who, against all odds, has become a new beauty icon that some men aspire to. In fact, with the Kencore trend, men now want to look just like Barbie's longtime companion."
The worrying 'anti-sunscreen' misinformation circulating on social networks,"Sunscreens are essential products to reduce the risk of sunburn and, by extension, skin cancer. While some people inadvertently forget to make this a habit, others are now announcing that they are voluntarily renouncing it. Over on TikTok, some internet users have declared themselves to be ""anti-sunscreen"". According to them, sunscreen is packed with harmful ingredients that prevent the sun's healing rays from reaching the skin. Although some of the content linked to the #antisunscreen hashtag has been removed or delisted, it has still managed to rack up 1.7 million views on the favourite social network of younger generations. One user promoting the risky trend is Shannon Fairweatherr, who claims to have banned sunscreen from her cupboard. She declares in a video: ""I refuse to block my skin from the healing rays of the sun."" She goes on to talk about more natural alternatives to protect her skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet rays, and in particular claims to use coconut oil, which she says ""works about 30% as well as sunscreen does, except you're not slathering yourself in chemicals."" It's a similar story for user shesnatural0, who also claims to be ""anti-sunscreen"" in a video: ""Surprised at the amount of people absolutely appalled that I don't apply sunscreen when it blocks all the nourishing benefits of the life giver of our planet that regulates our bodily processes..."" A British fitness coach by the name of James Middleton has tweeted montages, in which he touts the importance of vitamin D and suggests that sunscreen blocks it. The user, who is not a medical professional, asserts that ""high levels of vitamin D make it almost impossible to develop an autoimmune disease. This would put pharmaceutical companies & the healthcare industry out of business. Think about it for a moment. They need you to believe the sun is bad."" Quite close to anti-vaccine speeches, these false assertions, which are not supported by any scientific study, seem to circulate in the same circles. Faced with this phenomenon, specialists are voicing their concern. Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose, dermatologist at New York's Laser and Skin Surgery Center, tells the publication Nylon that short periods of sun exposure (10-15 minutes a day) can be helpful for convert vitamin D to its active form in the body and improving one's mood, but emphasizes that overexposure has negative effects on our skin health and cosmetic appearance. To which she adds: ""All skin types should wear sunscreen, and everyone should avoid jumping on these trends."" The expert also points out that certain skin types that are more sensitive to the sun — such as people with fairer skin or skin cancer in their family medical history, need to take extra precautions. Dr Paul Banwell, cosmetic surgeon and skin cancer expert, warns of all the dangers of not applying sunscreen: ""It's not just the risk of melanoma ..., but all skin cancers that need to be protected against. The main types of which are melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). CC is the most common type of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide,"" he tells Glamour UK. Fortunately, there are other content creators who are encouraging people to protect their skin from the sun's harmful effects. One example is Mary Odusami, known as GlowingWithMary on TikTok, who advocates the application of sun protection, especially among black people. In her video, she explains that skin cancer affects everyone, regardless of skin colour, so everyone should wear SPF, responding to a user's message that black people don't need to wear sunscreen. According to France's Ligue contre le Cancer, the risk of developing skin cancer is 1 in 100. Among their recommendations: avoid exposure during the hottest hours of the day, use appropriate protection products and reapply every two hours."
'Tantouring': Another sign of the return to bolder makeup trends?,"Popularized by several world-famous influencers, such as Kim Kardashian, contouring took a back seat to more natural makeup styles during the Covid-19 pandemic and its various periods of lockdown. But that hasn't stopped it from racking up over 2 billion views on TikTok. Its new spinoff, ""tantouring,"" has a way to go to get to this level, but it has already generated almost 20 million views in just a few weeks. A figure that testifies to the popularity of this new makeup technique, which combines the two basic elements for success — it's simple and effective. The method simply involves swapping usual contouring products for a self-tanner. The idea is to apply the product to the areas you wish to sculpt — the bridge of the nose, cheekbones, jawline or hairline — playing with light and shadow effects, as you would with classic contouring. But the result won't be the same: not only will your complexion be slightly tanned, like after a tanning session on the beach, but it will also last for several days. In short, a kind of long-lasting makeup that guarantees a healthy glow both in the morning and at bedtime. Beware, however, that the amount of self-tanning products applied to the skin, to avoid having to deal with an unattractive orange complexion. The requires some delicacy and vigilance. Like 'shower makeup', the 'espresso makeup', or the 'slept in smoky eye' trend, 'tantouring' could be another sign of the come-back to more boldness in makeup."
'Latte' and 'espresso makeup': the warm coffee-inspired summer beauty trends,"'Latte makeup', the inspiration that has been taking social networks by storm since the start of summer, with more than 203 million views to date, evokes the hot, creamy beverage, with its radiant, amber, almost caramelized shimmer. 'Espresso makeup' (11 million views) is a more intense and bolder version of the latter. Two trends that show the interest of users for a subtly tanned, back-from-the-beach complexion, during the North hemisphere summer season. Also, like many beauty inspirations, 'latte makeup' has been spreading like wildfire to other parts of the face and body, starting with eyes and nails. On social networks, there are therefore countless inspirations of this kind, from 'matcha latte manicures' to 'cherry cola lips.' On TikTok, the 'latte makeup' trend was brought into the limelight by Rachel Rigler, who described it as ""warm, bronzy, milky and effortless."" Revealing her secrets for recreating the beauty look, makeup artist Tanielle Jai explains it's important to choose products based on yellow shades, rather than those with red undertones, in order to get the warm, caramelized effect. 'Espresso makeup,' the latest inspo to date, appears as a grungy take on the latte look. The new version seeks to create a more bronzed complexion and a much more intense eye makeup. While 'latte makeup' appears to be the perfect beauty look for summer days, its relative is a more robust version that users consider as much more suited to evening. The trend has already spawned a host of videos and posts, but it's undoubtedly content creator Danielle Marcan who has seen the greatest success with the looks. Her one-minute video has already been viewed over a million times. In it, she introduces the beauty look — which she herself describes as ""the grunge sister of the latte makeup"" — and then offers a tutorial on how to make it your own. As you can see, the complexion gets more attention, with more bronzing powder and contouring products, the idea being to get the look of tanned skin, but it's above all the eyes that are the focus. For a perfect 'espresso makeup' look, the caramel and bronze shades of the 'latte makeup' look are swapped out for pencils and eyeshadows in deep brown, even cocoa, and there's no skimping either on black eyeliner or mascara. It's a detail that makes all the difference. All that's left now is to wait for the next coffee-machine-influenced beauty inspiration to hit..."
Millennials and Generation Z are a driving force in the luxury goods market,"According to the True-Luxury Global Consumer Insight 2023 report from BCG and The Altagamma Foundation [1], Millennials and Generation Z are playing an increasingly important role in the luxury goods industry. By 2022, they already accounted for almost EUR 200 billion of the market, double the 2016 figure, and this is forecast to almost double again by 2026. What's more, younger generations spend 15% more than other age groups, making a significant contribution to the sector's growth. Millennials and Generation Z are also driving another emerging trend in the luxury market: the resale and rental of luxury goods. In 2022, a third of consumers surveyed had bought second-hand luxury goods, an increase of 7 points on 2020, and 22% opted to rent luxury goods, an increase of 4 points in two years. Both trends are particularly strong among younger consumers, with 35% of Millennials and Generation Z having purchased second-hand luxury goods and 26% having rented luxury goods over the past year. Despite their growing appetite for luxury goods, younger shoppers can be picky when it comes to the customer experience. Luxury brands have made considerable efforts to improve the in-store shopping experience. However, less than 50% of consumers surveyed said they were truly satisfied with their experience, and 11% even said they were underwhelmed. This is mainly due to low satisfaction levels regarding online ceremonies. According to the report, few luxury brands have succeeded in recreating online the emotional factors experienced during an in-store purchase. This 'digital disconnect' is particularly noticeable among Generation Z and in Europe, where one in five young people consider their online shopping experience disappointing, compared with one in ten baby-boomers. These new demands are prompting luxury brands to rethink their approach to attracting and retaining young consumers. According to Joël Hazan, managing director at BCG and luxury sector expert, cutting-edge technologies such as generative AI and Web3 can enable brands to offer ultra-personalized, immersive customer experiences. These tools can play a crucial role in meeting the expectations of a diverse, digital-native audience. This approach has borne fruit in China, where technologies in this field are more advanced. In fact, only 13% of luxury buyers report being underwhelmed by their online purchasing experience, while around half (46%) of domestic purchases are made online. The international luxury goods market is showing solid growth worldwide and has recovered to pre-covid levels. It is expected to be worth some EUR 1,300 billion by 2026, with an annual growth rate of 6% between 2022 and 2026, according to the base scenario chosen by BCG and Altagamma. Despite a slowdown in the overall demand, China and th U.S should remain the main growth drivers of the global luxury market. Beside these two giant markets, Saudi Arabia appears as a key alternative market with an untapped potential. Luxury sales are expected to double in the Kingdom during the period from 2022 to 2030, growing from EUR 3 billion to 6 billion."
"Huge opportunities in Middle East and Africa, says Cosmoprof panel session","According to Euromonitor International, huge growth opportunities for beauty brands are hidden in emerging or still underexploited markets, which are characterized by a strong demographic push, growing urbanization and an average increase in purchasing power. The main driving categories are hair care (with a value of 7.9 billion dollars), fragrances (6.3 billion dollars) and skin care products (5.5 billion dollars). By 2027, the region will reach a revenue of 47 billion dollars, with an average annual growth of 12%. The Middle East is witnessing significant expansion due to the growing purchasing power of local consumers. Fuelled by digitalisation, the region, especially the Gulf countries, offer ample opportunities for growth, owing in large part to untapped per-capital potential. Rising disposable incomes and overall rising wealth, particularly among the younger urban middle class, also bring opportunities for value-added beauty products that emphasize health and well-being. ""Beauty is not just about appearance but has a psychological component that is connected to being part of a community. Euromonitor has identified 'wellness' as a megatrend, which means it's a trend that is here to stay,"" said Mehr Shafiei, Senior Analyst at Euromonitor International, who spoke at the round table. ""The theme of wellness has emerged predominantly during the pandemic as a result of greater attention to health, but also because of better communication via social media."" For Nazih Hamad, Founder of Nazih Group, digitization and social media are strategic tools. ""It is not important what brands tell consumers, but what consumers share, and their satisfaction,"" he said. The talk highlighted the fundamental role of the Middle East for the cosmetics industry: it is a rapidly growing market, with a high per capita income and local authorities have enacted policies to prevent counterfeiting and illegal trade. Another key element is the young average age of the population: 50% are under the age of 35-40, meaning that young and well-educated consumers are playing a distinctive role. Tourism is also growing, and the area is a strategic market for purchases, as prices are lower in Dubai than in Europe. However, attention must be paid to the differences within the area. The Middle East is not a homogeneous market: Saudi Arabia is the region with the most demanding consumers, Lebanon is the country that pays the greatest attention to innovation, Dubai is the trendiest metropolis, and Bahrain registers the highest purchase power. ""The region is a melting pot with huge differences: understanding its specific needs is essential,"" said Della Pass, General Manager of AKI BinSina (UAE). ""There are many local indie brands, which respond more effectively to local needs with their products. They are more flexible than international brands, which have more difficulty proposing customized products. The Middle East is the land of diversity: Western stereotypes are almost disappearing. New standards of beauty, new images and above all the use of Arabic instead of English are fundamental for a brand doing business in the region."" Abdul Majid Madi, Founder and CEO of District General Trading Company Kuwait, highlighted how the value of sustainability is growing in the region. ""In the Middle East, consumers acquire information on ingredients, new technologies and sustainable innovations through social media or during their travels, and once in their country they expect new launches that respect the same values."" According to the latest analyses by statista.com, in 2023 the beauty market on the African continent reached a value of 7.89 billion USD, and an average annual growth rate of 8.79% is expected over the next 5 years. 87% of consumption is attributable to mass- market products distributed in retail channels. Growth is driven by the demography. By 2050 it is estimated that the African population will account for 25% of the world's population, while this share will reach 40% by 2100. ""The cosmetics and beauty market is growing steadily in Africa, following demographic growth, urbanization, and the increase in incomes of the middle class. This type of consumer goods is highly appreciated, and the expense for these products is constantly growing. Among the most interesting markets, there are South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya, but the trend is generally increasing throughout the continent,"" explained Francesco Gastaldon, Partner and Country Manager Italy of Kili Partners, an advisory, business and project development firm that assists clients to access growth opportunities and markets across Africa. However, accessing the African cosmetic market is not easy. The needs of local consumers are very different from those of Western customers: different types of hair, skin and bodies and an extreme climate with heat picks are a challenge for many brands. Currently, the market particularly rewards local brands, however, new technologies and growing digitization offer new data and tools to multinationals, especially in sub-Saharan regions. The very low average age of the population, with three-quarters of the population under the age of 30, is a further factor that helps the growth of global products, together with growing urbanization and the development of the middle class. The most strategic markets today are South Africa and Nigeria, the most populous state on the continent with over 220 million people, but Cameroon, Tanzania, Ghana, Ethiopia and Kenya are also promising areas. However, as for the Middle East, it is important to keep in mind that the African continent is a multifaceted territory with cultural, religious, political, social and economic differences making it a real kaleidoscope. The e-commerce channel, which continues to grow in all regions, can help significantly boost sales. At the end of 2022, online sales reached a value of 859,300 USD, with an annual growth rate forecast to 12.39% over the next 5 years, leading to a total turnover of 1.3 million dollars in 2027."
The slept-in smoky eye takes the classic look to another level,"While the neat, colorful aesthetics of Barbie and the Clean Girl were big news in 2022, it seems that grunge is slowly but surely making its way into women's closets — and their bathrooms. The 'succubus chic' trend became all the rage at the start of the year, followed this spring by the 'rockstar girlfriend' look, with hundreds of millions of views on social networks. Inspired by grunge, underground and gothic styles, this aesthetic is based around leather, fishnet, rock band T-shirts and combat boots as well as extreme smoky eyes — almost panda eyes. This is where the slept-in smoky eye comes in — the latest beauty craze for grunge fans, as well as those with a lazier approach to life. As you might have guessed, the idea is to apply eye makeup as if you hadn't removed it the day before — something that beauty purists might not even want to think about. Wednesday Addams, heroine of the hit Netflix show which landed at the end of 2022, is an obvious poster girl for this new trend, but it also brings grunge icons from the 1990s and 2000s back into the spotlight, starting with Kate Moss. ""Slept-in smoky eyes are grungy and imperfect. That's what makes it cool. It's unapologetic and a little scary. It's refreshing to try a different approach to your makeup. To think, 'How can I make this look weirder and less perfect?',"" the head makeup artist for ""Euphoria"" and Half-Magic Beauty cofounder, Doniella Davy, told the beauty website Byrdie. The trend has already flooded social networks, and is gradually making inroads on catwalks and red carpets, led by the likes of Dua Lipa, Emma Chamberlain and Cara Delevingne. To create a slept-in smoky eye, simply intensify a smoky eye and take it to the extreme by replacing powdery textures with liquid or creamy products. And don't restrict yourself to the upper eyelid. On the contrary, to get the look, it's imperative to go all around the eye, applying product flush to the lashes. Despite what the name might suggest, the idea is not to end up with an actual panda eye effect."
MakeUp in Paris: The challenge of eco-designed high-performance innovations,"Packaging-wise, recycled, recyclable and refillable solutions abounded, and emerging trends were noted in each category. Brivaplast took up the challenge of creating a refillable mascara! Probably one of the most difficult products to deal with when it comes to packaging reduction, because refilling involves replacing the entire product, i.e. the formula / wand / wiper / brush combination. At MakeUp in Paris, the Italian company showcased a tube that can be moulded from recycled materials and is fitted with a removable, flexible inner refill. The formula is created by Ancorotti. In terms of weight and components, the final product more or less equals two standard mascaras, but it still saves 25% in CO2 emissions when it is refilled. The innovation also lies in the security of the refill opening mechanism, which needs to be inserted into the case to be able to remove the brush, so the refill cannot be used on its own. ""There is a huge demand from brands for mascara refills. They expect solutions,"" says Marco Roda, Business Development Manager at Brivaplast. Although it is still tricky to actually recycle mascara and most other makeup products due to their size, smaller than the requirements of sorting processes, the innovation approach focused on recyclable mono-material products anticipates future regulations. Other mascara innovations included Pibiplast's DUE tube, which is made up of two parts instead of four. The neck of the bottle acts as a wiper, and the cap and wand are moulded in one part. The whole product is made of PP to make recycling easier. Libo Cosmetics created a Venus lipstick 100% made from aluminium, including the mechanism and refill, making it theoretically 100% recyclable. As for Aptar, they also banked on a mono-material product with a new refillable lipstick tube made exclusively from polypropylene (PP). The manufacturer also showcased a new version of its refillable lipstick Private Refill, now endowed with enhanced decoration. It is secured with a unique, customisable key, so the brand ensures the exclusive use of its refills. As for compact cases, Metapack aimed to refocus desirability on the object itself, with a premium, refillable, 100% Zamak version developed for Fara Homidi. The supplier is also behind the plastic-free cap developed for La Bouche Rouge perfumes, in partnership with Pujolasos for the cork insert. Among the many solutions presented by HCP was the refillable Dial Compact case, made exclusively from recyclable PET. The gesture of this patented solution makes it possible to insert the refill in a twist, from the bottom. Livcer has increased the performance of its 83% paper-based thermoforming solutions for a greater capacity. Moreover, the company now offers a range of samples for pressed powders. Alongside packaging suppliers and application solutions, formula manufacturers were largely represented at the show. They revealed an intensive quest for new textures and enhanced performance with high naturalness levels. MS BeautiLab won an IT Award in the formulation category for its Super Nova Green injection powders formulated with 99% of ingredients of natural origin and Cosmos Natural-certified raw materials. These creamy powders are free from microplastics, talc, silicones, and film-forming agents. MS BeautiLab's Skin Fusion innovation is also worth noting: particular attention was paid to the formula/packaging combination. The right dose of an anhydrous formula made up of 99% of ingredients of natural origin is laid down on technical paper for one serum or eye contour application. Once delivered and applied, the transformation formula melts into the skin. Skin Fusion boasts a sustainable approach, both for its formula and fully recyclable paper packaging. The on-the-go solution enables to customize routines with a targeted choice of actives. Aircos, a company of the Anjac Health & Beauty group, received the jury's ""Coup de cœur"" award for its Hypnotic Very Noir eyeshadow, which features a creamy powder texture and a metallic black-gold effect to shade or mix colours. Fiabila presented its Do Not Disturb odourless formulas. ""To achieve this result, over 45% of the formula was modified,"" explains CEO Pierre Miasnik. The entire solvent formula and the dispersion were reviewed to minimise the product's smell on application, while maintaining ease of application, excellent coverage, shine, and long wear. Another advantage is that the varnish can be scented for an even better customer experience. This innovation obviously targets customers who do not like the smell of nail varnish, particularly in Asia. The nail specialist also highlighted reactive varnish which lasts for eight days thanks to polymerisation involving the addition of a reagent to varnish based on oligomers. The application gesture is exactly the same as for traditional varnish and top coats. IL Cosmetics developed the new Demi Matt Plumper, a lip gloss with natural pungent actives for a plumping effect, as well as the Lip Gloss Nails Manicure concept in line with the glow boom in nail care. New, deeper shades are given added shine with the application of two top coats which can be powered with skincare actives. Also among the manufacturer's many new products was the Naturally Tubing mascara, which can be removed with lukewarm water and is made from over 80% of ingredients of natural origin. In the skincare category, Technature showcased travel-size, waterless freeze-dried make-up-removing beads containing a prebiotic, as well as a collection of skincare products in the form of sticks: a mask, an eye contour, a foaming cleanser, a two-phase emulsion stick and a non-oily oil-stick."
Indonesia entrepreneurs cash in on TikTok live selling spree,"Southeast Asia is a bright spot for TikTok, owned by Chinese tech firm ByteDance. The company's CEO Shou Zi Chew announced plans last week to invest billions of dollars in the region, where it counts 325 million users, of whom 125 million are in Indonesia. Shopping on TikTok is booming in Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, where consumers spent more on the app than any other country in the region last year. As TikTok Shop grows in popularity, with Indonesians buying more than a third of goods sold in Southeast Asia over the past year, entrepreneurs are flocking to the platform to promote a range of tech, fashion and homemade products. They are drawn to TikTok's e-commerce features that allow them to sell through livestreams or open online stores. Monomolly, a 20-strong online retail employer, reported a 30 percent increase in revenue since kicking off a TikTok livestream drive last year, according to spokesperson Nadya Paramitha. The platform's algorithm has jumpstarted the company's business, according to employees. It has allowed sellers to ""reach new markets randomly"" instead of relying on interest-based search results on rival apps, said TikTok sales manager Chelvyana Onggo Winata. It isn't just companies that are using the platform. DIY home streamers Panji Made Agung and his wife Astari Gita used to rely on their families to survive. But they now sell as many as 1,000 cookie jars a month through TikTok livestreams, making 25 million rupiah ($1,700). Their viewers and sales ramped up because of their personalities, said Gita, who often flirts with her husband and makes him feel uncomfortable on camera. ""We discovered selling products alone would not work. It has to touch people's emotions. It has to be entertaining,"" Gita said. ""They like our real-life humour as a couple and Agung being awkward."" TikTok Shop has capitalised on the Indonesian market, amassing more than two million sellers since it launched in 2021. It takes one percent commission and a charge of 20,000 rupiah (USD 1.33) for every item sold, building a growing market share against more established and bigger rivals. Indonesia represented 42 percent of TikTok's USD 4.4 billion regional gross merchandise value (GMV) last year, according to Singapore-based consultancy Momentum Works. Online shopper Aldi Alfarabi said he wasn't looking to spend money while scrolling through TikTok livestreams, but he often stumbled on items that took his fancy, such as a dinosaur backpack he recently bought. ""There is an engaging interaction through the virtual conversation,"" said the 29-year-old from Jakarta. ""You can see exactly what you are buying."" Experts say TikTok's Indonesia strategy is catching on with shifting shopping habits as younger customers demand more engaging experiences to open their wallets. ""Indonesia's digital market is dominated by Generation Z,"" said Bhima Yudhistira, an analyst from Jakarta's Center of Economic and Law Studies. ""As they are more adaptive to new things, the market patterns change swiftly."" So Southeast Asian online shopping — pulled along by Indonesia — is only going one way, he said, growing into what is predicted to become a $35 billion market next year."
K-Beauty: Four key trends spotted at CosmoBeauty Seoul 2023,"High tech anti-ageing beauty is always an important product category at any Asian trade show, and perhaps especially so at a K-beauty show. At CosmoBeauty Seoul 2023, Korean exhibitors presented a wide range of beauty tech and functional face care products designed to address the concerns of ageing skin. Korean mass market brand Banobagi's newest face care launch is a serum and cream duo formulated with alpha-arbutin to help brighten skin tone and tackle hyperpigmentation and dark skin patches. Indie brand Soroci's new Vita Tangerine Fit Mask is a two-step sheet mask set which consists of a vitamin C toner-soaked peeling pad that is used to gently exfoliate the skin and a hydrating and skin-brightening sheet mask to be applied afterwards. Eldeen, which brand name is ""needle"" spelled backwards, was launched in 2022 and offers self-dissolving microneedle patches in different shapes for specific skin areas. Salon brand Puraxel presented its new at-home fractional laser tool which gently perforates the skin for a microneedle-like effect so active ingredients can more easily penetrate the epidermal layer, while fellow salon brand Reclar's best-selling face massager uses different vibration frequencies to help apply beauty products more effectively. There are different settings for watery/liquid and thicker/creamier products. On the other hand, Barulab's big CosmoBeauty innovation is surprisingly low-tech but claims to deliver superior skin care results. SteamSheet Moisture Shield is a dual face mask which consists of a serum sheet mask that is placed on the face first, and a thin top mask made from vinyl. The brand says that the heat generated by the additional plastic layer opens the face's pores and allows the active ingredients to better penetrate the skin. The international microbiome trend was also very visible at CosmoBeauty Seoul this year, with the newer Korean indie brands in particular focusing on barrier care and/or the demands of sensitive skin. For instance, Korean beauty brand Abiy, which was launched in 2022, offers a duo of microbiome-focused face care products formulated with peptides. K-beauty brand Herbloom's Kombucha Plant Biome face care range has been a bestseller since the brand was launched in 2021 whilst O'Clearien another newcomer brand from Korea, offers five face care products formulated with trehalose and centella asiatica extract for sensitive skin. Doctob, another K-beauty brand launched in 2022, offers ten vegan biome-focused face and body care items and so does Age Zero, a new microbiome beauty brand introduced by Korean manufacturer Fascy. The Age Zero line-up focuses on anti-ageing beauty for customers aged 40+. And indie brand Orgahue has just brought out the Mela Barrier Cream in its product range. The product is based on mountain yam, yuzu and centella asiatica extract to help protect the skin barrier's natural function. ""Vegan"" was definitely one of the biggest product claims at CosmoBeauty Seoul 2023, closely followed by that other GenZ favourite: ""clean beauty"". It was noticeable, however, that the vegan seal in particular was almost exclusively associated with the younger indie brands that exhibited at the show, and frequently combined with a gender-free and/or minimalistic angle. There were over a dozen beauty brands at the show that were launched during or since the pandemic, almost all of them aimed at the GenZ and Millennials market. Claps is a good example of this new generation of brands. The label was introduced a few months ago and offers gender-free and vegan beauty with a focus on skin barrier health. Young indie brand Hamel, that launched in 2022, offers a vegan makeup and skin care with gender-neutral packaging and trending product textures, including a dual-phase hydrating toner and an ampoule (serum) in stick form. Equlib is another stylish gender-neutral range that was launched this year. With French-inspired product names, the brand offers five face care items for skin aged 30+. Simplica, which was launched earlier this year, describes itself a conscious, clean and vegan beauty brand believing that less is more in skin care. For its part, Aroutine, launched in 2021, is yet another vegan, gender-neutral beauty range offering five face care products formulated with plant extracts. Aroutine's newest product is a hydrating sheet mask which contains white rose extract. Herbal ingredients have always played an important role in Korean beauty, from the anti-ageing ginseng popular with luxury beauty brands over domestic citrus variants like the vitamin-rich yuja fruit which is a traditional mainstay of Korean beauty ranges. And with the increasing popularity of vegan products, it is not surprising that many exhibitors at CosmoBeauty Seoul 2023 focused on plant-based ingredients as their key active. A good example is Korean indie brand Marinavi's new Marinabee Intense Vitamin C Cream which contains 25% citrus-derived vitamin C and nutritious kelp extract. Vegan newcomer brand Deardot uses the dangyuja fruit extract as a key ingredient to help protect this plant species. Salon brand Fau's Shiny Pumpkin range, on the other hand, contains pumpkin extract as a lead botanical. For instance, the brand's Shiny Pumpkin Amino Therapy is a hydrating toner which is based on 85% pumpkin fruit extract. Niche brand Midha's products are based on a very high percentage of nutritious rice water and contain the brand's Rice 8 Complex which is manufactured from a premium rice grown in Gochang prefecture. Newcomer brand Ginger6 uses concentrated ginger water as a base for its six face care products. Salon brand Awy's most recent launch is a duo of serums, including the Vitamin Tree Brightening Serum is based on 78% sea buckthorn extract. Eventually, beauty brand A by B.O.M presented its single ingredient toner range The One. Each liquid toner in this line contains over 90% of a single plant extract, usually traditional medicinal herbs."

Why is spatula the latest must-have for applying foundation?,"In order to achieve a flawless complexion (which definitely seems to be the holy grail in beauty), several TikTok users have recently set their sights on metal spatulas that could soon oust brushes or beauty blenders. These cosmetic or beauty spatulas — also known as a makeup or foundation spatulas — are smaller and are said to be more suitable for applying the products that form a daily beauty routine. Straight out of Korea, this tool is not only a hit with users of the GenZ's favourite social network, but also with many makeup experts, including the content creator and influencer @glowwithava, who has more than 1.7 million followers. On TikTok, the #spatula hashtag already has over 300 million views, although some are about the actual kitchen utensil, while the hashtag #koreanspatula (this time leaving little doubt) already has almost nine million views, reflecting a craze for this beauty technique. On the social network, it's first and foremost the result obtained with the spatula that is a hit, the tool facilitating the application of foundation while offering a smooth, radiant complexion, without any visible imperfections, and a glassy, almost transparent appearance- a trend inspired by Korean skincare routines. But that's not the only merit touted by TikTokers, who also see this as a way of embracing a more minimalist makeup routine. In fact, the spatula allows you to apply a smaller amount of foundation without worrying about the excess being absorbed by a sponge or the bristles of a brush. This saving is not without interest for followers of the trend. But it's the question of hygiene that could definitively propel the spatula to the top of the list of must-have beauty tools. Unlike sponges and brushes — or even hands — which can be veritable breeding grounds for bacteria without regular, thorough cleaning, spatulas are more often than not made of stainless steel, a material renowned for its ease of maintenance and hygienic properties. A benefit that extends far beyond the application of foundation and also concerns skin care."
"""Beauty is on an upward trajectory across all categories,"" finds McKinsey","""Today, beauty is on an upward trajectory across all categories,"" says McKinsey & Company in recently released report The State of Fashion: Beauty. In 2022, the beauty market — defined as skincare, fragrance, makeup, and haircare — generated approximately USD 430 billion in revenue, and is expected to reach approximately USD 580 billion by 2027, growing by a projected 6 percent a year. This is in line with or slightly higher than other consumer segments such as apparel, footwear, eyewear, pet care, and food and beverages. However, the consulting firm expects the premium beauty tier to grow at an annual rate of 8 percent (compared with 5 percent in mass beauty) between 2022 and 2027, as consumers trade up and increase their spending. The fragrance and make-up categories are forecast to be the most impacted by this trend toward premiumization. According to McKinsey, another growth opportunity across geographies will be products and services in the top tier of the pricing pyramid: the luxury and ultraluxury beauty market has the potential to double, from around USD 20 billion today to around USD 40 billion by 2027. Despite the dynamism of the beauty landscape, McKinsey identifies a series of market transformations likely to increase competition among industry players. In particular, the consulting firm mentions: the emergence of independent players seeking to gain market share, the growth of e-commerce, and the slowdown in Chinese growth. If China and the United States will remain mighty forces for the industry, with the beauty market expected to reach USD 96 billion in China and USD 114 billion in North America by 2027, McKinsey says geographic diversification will become more essential than ever, with regions — including the Middle East and India — that are ready to step into the limelight, offering distinct potential for specific categories and price tiers. Eventually, the consulting firm identifies five key dynamics that are likely to transform the beauty landscape: – The redrawing of the growth map, with a slowdown in China resulting in the growing importance of the US market, along with the Middle East over the same period, and India in the longer term. – The rise of wellness, with consumers increasingly engaging with beauty products and services to not only look good but also feel good. – The influence of Gen Zers, who scrutinize brands as part of their search for value. – The imperative to scale for indie beauty brands. – The recalibration of M&A, with dealmaking not being the same as when cost of capital was low.

Anti-aging products remain highly popular among US women,"Eighty-two percent of female consumers polled in TBC's latest consumer study [1] said that a woman should be proud to look her true age. What's more, consumers are generally at peace with the natural aging process (53% don't mind looking their age). Still, 67% admit to being self-conscious about how they look as they grow older, and 96% just adore it when people think they are younger than their real age! While the term ""anti-aging"" itself is aging, it's still the top choice when communicating a product's benefit, TBC explains. Indeed, 54% of the women surveyed prefer the terms ""anti-aging"" to alternatives such as ""Aging gracefully"" (46%), ""Age-defying"" (45%), ""Your best you, at any age"" (45%), ""Timeless skin"" (40%). Furthermore, 70% of women surveyed say they purchase and/or use anti-aging products; and 55% own at least three products labeled as anti-aging. And they are mostly seeking anti-aging benefits: reducing/eliminating fine lines and wrinkles (77%); firming (72%); deep hydration (61%); improving skin elasticity (57%); sun protection (51%). More surprisingly, the survey found that women are starting to purchase anti-aging products earlier than past generations: Millennials and older started purchasing these products around age 35, while Gen Z purchasers began buying at age 23. While women are looking for products providing efficient anti-aging benefits, they require brands to provide authentic communication. According to TBC: 81% US women want communication to show real, age-appropriate women for whom the product is intended; 78% want brands do not photoshop models; 73% want brands do not use spokespeople whose look cannot be achieved with a skincare product (but had surgery, tillers or Botox). Furthermore, women need proof from Independent research studies that a product works and that its claims are backed by science. Perhaps because they have already been disappointed by the alleged-effectiveness of the products. Indeed, if 75% of surveyed women would spend more money on products that deliver on promises, many say certain of their anti-aging expectations are not met by their current products: anti-aging facial skincare needs (58%), fine lines/wrinkle reduction (53%), firming (51%), improved elasticity (41%), lifting (40%), dark spots/age spots/lightening (37%). There are therefore many opportunities for skincare brands, provided they find a way to meet high expectations in terms of transparency and efficiency. Read the full TBC's infographics here."
"Black is the most popular nail polish shade globally, finds new report","The popularity of nail colours has grown rapidly over the past few years, and the global nail beauty market is expected to grow at around 8% over the next decade, according to Transparency Market Research (TMR). As consumers embrace nail care and nail colour as a key aspect of their beauty routines, Perfect Corp. tried to identify the emerging trends in nail colours and textures using data sourced from their YouCam Nails app. [1] The app features thousands of AR-powered filters that allows users to virtually try-on nail colour and nail art effects in real time. According to Perfect Corp., the YouCam Nails app cumulates over 7 million virtual nail colour try-ons per year. According to Perfect Corp., globally and across many markets, neutral nail colours have emerged as the most popular and most-frequently tried-on shades. Furthermore, the company's data revealed a trend towards edgier neutral tones, with black nail polish taking the top spot as the most frequently tried-on shade globally. This bold and versatile tone began to rise in popularity over the past year as celebrities stepped out at award shows and on red carpets wearing this striking nail colour in both high-shine and matte finishes. The trend toward neutrals observed in the big data continued with Pearl White and Sand also emerging as some of the most popular nail colour shades globally. Black nail polish and light neutral shades were also confirmed to be top trending nail colours in regional data observed for the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Brazil, France, Japan, China and Mexico. Red nails, such as Cherry, Crimson and Sparkle Red were also among the most popular nail colour shades globally. These tones emerged as top shades across all regions analysed, with a significant trending popularity toward red shades and bright tones across the Middle East regions including UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman. High shine, metallic and chrome tones such as Metallic Rose Gold, Foil Gold, and Foil Silver were also observed among the top 10 most tried-on nail colours globally. These tones trended in all key markets analysed, with a significant preference observed in China, Mexico, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. As far as textures are concerned, cream nail polish was the top tried-on texture across all global markets, followed by jelly, matte, and sheer nail colour formulas, confirming the recent dramatic transformations in this area, with new and innovative finishes taking the beauty world by storm.

"Trends: On TikTok, blush takes on bright colours","As one of the must-have beauty products of 2022, blush could reach new heights this year. And for good reason, since it is regularly the focus of trends, inspirations and even beauty hacks on social networks. This has been seen in recent months with ""douyin blush"", which involves making a 'v' shape on several parts of the face, ""under-eye blush"", to hide dark circles, and even white blush to sculpt and brighten the face. The latest in the list, ""purple blush"" promises to be much more effective than classic blush shades for a good-looking effect. ""Bold"" is the adjective most used on TikTok to qualify this new makeup trick, which is clearly proving popular. The craze is such that the hashtag #purpleblush already has more than 60 million views, and that's without counting its derivatives, which are multiplying at speed. On TikTok, many famous influencers have already experimented with this new trend, starting with American users Mikayla Nogueira, Sarah Wolak and Aidette Cancino, who have largely contributed to its success. The advantage of this trick lies in its simplicity, since it does not require any particular skill or technique, other than knowing how to apply blush. As you can see, only the shade of the product changes, and consumers will only need to invest in a new purple, lavender, lilac, mauve, eggplant or possibly plum blush, before getting to work. As for the effect, not surprisingly, it's the striking boldness of purple blush that is the main advantage, but it's not the only one, according to users of the social network. They claim that purple blush gives a healthy glow effect that's even more effective than with classic blush shades. Another important boon is that it's suitable for all skin tones. However, it is important to choose the right shade of purple for the desired effect — as a general rule, go lighter for lighter skin tones. The only downside, albeit marginal, is that while some TikTokers are happy to take credit for bringing to light this beauty trend, it's not actually all that ground-breaking. Some celebrities, like Rihanna, have been using this trick for many years. At a time when Gen Z is reconnecting with makeup, it is above all a sign of a return to bright colours in the world of beauty."
India: a promised land for beauty and luxury brands?,"L'Oréal has been gaining market shares and reviving the Lancôme brand through the Sephora sales channel. Les Galeries Lafayette are planning to open two department stores, in New Delhi and Mumbai. And Estée Lauder is launching the Beauty & You India programme with Indian company Nykaa to support young Indian beauty brands: following the example of major fashion names, beauty luxury brands have been getting ready to conquer the Indian market, just like they did in China. Over the past decades, the country has actually experienced a significant demographic growth, with a population of 1.4 billion people that is about to become the largest in the world, along with an economic growth that has resulted in the wealthiest classes enjoying increased buying power. According to the 2023 Forbes richest people ranking, India counts 169 billionaires in dollars, compared to 140, in 2021, and the number of millionaires keeps increasing, mainly in the city of Mumbai, which counts 60,000. These dynamics have been fuelling the development of a luxury product offering, which reminds of the boom observed in China. ""India is often cited as reference when it comes to numbers, because its population is about to become larger than China's, but the comparison ends there,"" tempers Florence Bernardin, founder and Director of Asia Cosme Lab, a marketing watch agency specializing in beauty products for Asia. ""The number of millionaires is rising, but the truth is, 90% of the economy remains non-official, and the average income is still very low. Only 10% of Indian people earn more than 280 euros per month. Of course, out of 1.4 billion, it makes 140 million people – twice the French population – but it is not the same as China, where the GDP per capita reaches 12,000 dollars. In India, it peaks at 200. So, it IS a huge, developing market, but with a very low price level. Luxury will only reach a very small part of the population"", she adds. Wealth is unequally shared from one region to another, and it is mainly concentrated in cities, which shelter an increasing number of start-ups in the field of technological innovation. Meanwhile, distribution channels have been expanding, in particular online, driven by Indian giant Nykaa and direct selling. Makeup brand Sugar, founded by Vineeta Singh, has become one of the biggest players on the D2C segment (Direct to Consumer) in India, and it also counts 150 stores. The Body Shop has reached the threshold of 200 stores opened in 2023. The brand is present in more than 65 cities in India. ""What is changing is that many indie brands have been emerging. The market is dynamic, now: it is driven by technologies, social media, online sales, lifestyle changes, the media, and influencers. All these brands are riding the current global trends, i.e. naturalness, men's grooming, inclusivity, and Ayurveda, of course"", observes Florence Bernardin. For example, 82°E, actress Deepika Padukone's minimalist skincare brand, uses plants from the traditional Indian pharmacopoeia. Launched online in November 2022, she received a flood of negative feedback from her fans due to the selling prices, from EUR 20 (USD 22) to EUR 30 (USD 33): much too high for the Indian market. The successful indie brands whose sales prices range between EUR 1.5 (USD 1.65) and EUR 18 (USD 19.75) include Juicy Chemistry, an Ecocert/Cosmos-certified nutricosmetics and skin, hair, and body care brand, Neemli Naturals, which combines science and naturalness with prices between EUR 1.6 and EUR 18, MamaEarth, of the Godrej group, and Dr Sheth's for Indian Skin, for a dermatological and Ayurvedic approach. ""These brands can definitely export to Europe, because they offer quality products, or they can enter markets that do not have the same revenues as we do. For example, they can compete with China on African markets, or with South Korea in South-East Asia"", adds Florence Bernardin. Even for brands with moderate prices, the future depends on macro-economic politics that support growth. ""Contrary to China, the problem with India is that there is too little investment in health and education. Only 3% of young people have access to high positions. There are good universities, but not enough places. And it is actually for this population segment that luxury is developing. There is a huge potential, but at the current pace, it will take several generations to take advantage of it"", says the expert, adding that 40% of the population is under 25 in India. The median age is 28 years old – it is 39 in China. ""I think the role of all these luxury players entering the Indian market consists in investing in education, by setting up schools or educating women. So they are not just a showcase"", suggests Florence Bernardin, to conclude."
Spain : The perfumery and cosmetics sector grew by 11.3% in 2022,"After an increase of 11.3% in 2022, the perfumes and cosmetics sector has reached a historic peak in Spain, with a sales volume of 9,250 million euros, well beyond the 8,460 million euros that previously marked the peak of the historical series. Per capita consumption of beauty and personal care products is approaching 185 euros per person per year, significantly above the 170 euros reached in 2019. [1] All beauty categories have been growing during 2022; in particular colour cosmetics (+29.4%), with the restart of iconic categories such as lipsticks, still slightly below the 2019 levels. The perfume category (+19.8%) also saw significant growth, while skin care (+9%) is approaching 3,000 million euros in sales. According to Stanpa, the various distribution channels have evolved just as dynamically, with double-digit growth in virtually all categories. For instance, the mass market channel posted a +13% growth, while the pharmacy channel grew by +6.3%, and the selective channel by +18.2%, to name only the three most dynamic ones. As far as international trade is concerned, the sector achieved 6,515 million euros in exports in 2022, i.e. 21% more than in 2021 and 25% more than in 2019. Perfumery (+27%) remains the first component of Spain's beauty exports (40% of the total), even if all categories are rising compared to 2021: +22% for make-up, +20% skin care +21% for toiletries and almost +14% for hair care. Spain has posted a positive commercial balance since 2006, with a surplus of about 1,900 million euros in 2022, and is among the 10 main world exporters of perfumery and cosmetics products. It is also the world's second largest exporter of perfumes, just behind France and ahead of Germany and the United States."
The latest olfactive trends in niche perfumery at Esxcence 2023,"Since the health crisis, floral notes are all the rage. Brands are banking on their cheerful tones to make us see life in pink. White flowers in particular, whose sunny glow is an antidote to moroseness. A trend that is still very much in vogue, with many launches highlighting jasmine at the show. Like Jasmin de Toscane, signed by Jean-Christophe Hérault for Jacques Fath, with rounded, sensual, almondy notes and a twist of hazelnut. Jasmine is also showcased at The Different Company, in a new perfume whose name has yet to be revealed, announced as a tribute to this tiny white flower, whose scent becomes more intoxicating as night falls. White flowers (ylang-ylang, jasmine) also outline the gardenia accord in Blanc de Chine, signed by Patrice Revillard for Parfumeurs du Monde, to be released in the coming months. With their comforting whiff, trails with musky, sandalwood and milky notes, that emerged after the health crisis, are still very popular. Like the delicate and airy Musc Pallas, the new Jovoy, which takes shape amidst the powdery softness of ambrette and iris and the roundness of tonka bean, on a background of vaporous musk. Creamy, milky nuances, which have become inevitable, can be found as a thread in many launches, texturing a coffee accord (Fanfarone Italiano, by Karine Dubreuil-Sereni for State of Mind), or outlining coconut facets (Un été, by Meabh McCurtin for the Obvious brand). They also blend with matcha accords and other tea notes to conjure up chai latte effects. Tea accords seem to be an emerging trend, reflecting both a quest for well-being and the growth of the Asian market. The matcha accord is at the heart of Un été for Obvious. Isabelle Larignon's Milky Dragon is infused with Oolong tea, combined with milky, fruity and spicy notes. At Olfactive Studio, Lapsang Souchong tea is featured in the Sepia collection with Smoky Soul. Signed by Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, the juice is enhanced by osmanthus, jasmine sambac, patchouli and seaweed absolute. Osmanthus also made its presence felt at the show. In addition to Smoky Soul, this tiny Chinese flower with apricot and leathery accents, inspired Osmanthe Liu Yuan, by Le Jardin Retrouvé. A delicate composition, where the flower's fruity tones are enhanced by mandarin, softened by iris, on a base of suede and musk. Another ingredient that reflects the interest of niche perfumery towards China. In recent years, gourmand notes have evolved towards less overtly ""sweet"" tasty grounds. Still very much in vogue, coffee accords take on an unctuous appearance, textured with amber and liqueur-like notes at State Of Mind with Fanfarone Italiano. For Nicolaï, coffee embraces woody, ambery and dry tones in an equally dense, but darker tone, with Caravansérail Intense. Perfumers also continue to explore new tasty accords around cereals, rice, or peanuts. Like Frapin's brand new Attendre et Espérer, where vetiver meets peanut notes, refreshed with ginger, to blow hot and cold. Another example is Zazen by Robert Piguet, a highly faceted creation based on a ""rice steam"" accord. Overall, the launches spotted since last year at Esxence tend to be less focused, and polarising, to adopt a more comfortable feel-good register. The brands' origins are also diversifying with creations from Singapore, Ukraine, Romania, Croatia, Japan… Finally, it should be noted that while ecological issues are still very much present, new labels are trying to establish their identity with a sustainable approach. One example is Nissaba, created by Sébastien Tissot, who worked for a long time with Dominique Roques for the responsible sourcing of natural ingredients at Firmenich. The brand is very much involved in supporting young people from perfume-producing communities. It also promotes their know-how by giving pride of place in its juices, to the olfactory terroirs of the countries that produce perfume ingredients. Each of the brand's perfumes is composed of the iconic ingredients of a region, to recreate its olfactory atmosphere. Indeed, an original brief for perfumers. Like the global perfume market, the world of niche perfumery continues to open up and diversify. See you next year at Esxence."
"After the pandemic skincare boom, Gen Z is getting back into makeup","The first Covid lockdown proved fatal for makeup. Once restrictions eased, venturing out involved a face mask — sometimes mandatory — once again disputing the beauty habits of people who did not seem to have the heart nor the time to get made up, only to end up hiding the result behind a face covering. Surveys and cosmetics sales reports were soon unanimous: women had abandoned makeup, especially lipstick, to embrace a more natural, authentic approach to beauty. A phenomenon also driven by the body positive movement and the drive for self-acceptance, with celebrities like Alicia Keys leading the way by shunning all things fake and focusing more intently on skincare. This desire to take care of our skin, to protect it from external factors and the damaging effects of aging has resulted in a skincare boom that's been going on for months, even years, with much interest in new, more natural formulas, and the rise of holistic beauty. This was seen on social networks, with the multiplication of new techniques, like 'glass skin', 'jello skin' or 'status skin,' intended to achieve a flawless, glowing finish. If this trend is far from being obsolete today, it seems that Gen Zers in particular want to reconnect with their pre-pandemic ways — in other words, with makeup. The latest Piper Sandler Companies semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens survey [1], conducted among 5,690 US teens, averaging 16.2 years of age, reveals that for the first time in three years, teens spent more on makeup products than on skincare. Makeup is once again the top beauty priority for teens, with an estimated annual spend of USD 123, compared to less than USD 120 on skincare. A figure that actually reflects a certain balance between the two segments, although spending on cosmetics products has increased considerably in one year, to the tune of +32%, compared to +11% for skincare. This renewed interest in cosmetics has also been seen on social networks, where members of Gen Z are constantly sharing tips and tricks of all kinds. From mascara cocktailing to hot glue gun makeup and diamond lips, the latest beauty inspirations going viral on TikTok have mostly been makeup techniques, often featuring eye-catching or eccentric beauty looks. This doesn't take anything away from young people's desire to aspire to a more natural kind of beauty, often with cleaner and more sustainable products. So while the #nomakeup hashtag has more than five billion views on the social network, there's also a need for singularity, extravagance and fun. According to Piper Sandler Companies. Originating during the pandemic, the 'no makeup' trend could be running out of steam.], almost half of teenagers (45%) say they wear makeup every day, which is more than double the number in 2021, a year still marked by the pandemic and then by the return to 'normal' life. Evidently, each period has its own beauty habits, but it seems that in the spring of 2023, teenagers have decided to forget this long and gloomy era to well and truly get back to 'normal' life."
'Mascara cocktailing' is the latest makeup trend taking over TikTok,"'Mascara cocktailing,' the latest beauty trend to come thick and fast on TikTok, has scored more than two million views in just a few weeks. However, this trend – which is inspired by traditional layering methods –does not seem to a breakthrough innovation. Yet, videos are multiplying at pace on social media, lauding the merits of this trick that promises long, full and voluminous lashes. This trend is rooted in the simple assumption that the perfect mascara does not exist. It is impossible, say TikTokers, to find a mascara that does a perfect job of making lashes both long and voluminous. Inevitably, they felt it necessary to develop a technique to overcome this. And the result is 'mascara cocktailing,' promising a look worthy of false eyelashes in no time. The advantage of this method lies in its accessibility, but also in its affordability. As well as being very easy to recreate alone in front of the mirror, it does not require an unlimited budget. Before starting, however, you need to do a little shopping to find the perfect mascaras to optimize your beauty routine. The goal is to get a mascara formulated for volume, a mascara formulated for length, and maybe even a third one to serve as a primer. One in the bathroom, 'mascara cocktailing' involves applying a primer, a lash care product, or even a clear mascara designed to naturally lengthen lashes, then switching to, say, a mascara that's supposed to make them fuller and more voluminous. But that's not all. 'Mascara cocktailing' consists precisely in adding a third layer, a mascara formulated for XXL lashes, to get a look worthy of the most sophisticated red carpets. Just like many recent hits on TikTok –- 'coquette makeup' or 'shower makeup' trends, for example — 'mascara cocktailing' seems to go against the trend for the more natural looks, which seemed ubiquitous since the Covid-19 pandemic."
Five key trends spotted at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2023,"Brands catering to younger consumers cover a whole range of trends such as vegan, clean or organic and gender-neutrality; and this year at Cosmoprof Woldwide Bologna, there were a number of recently launched beauty brands that were firmly aimed at customers in their 20s and 30s. Savaip from Lithuania, for example, was introduced in October 2022. The brand's packaging has a strong 1970s vibe. Savaip is designed to appeal to GenZ consumer and younger Millennials by offering nine gender-free clean beauty face and body care with a seasonal slant for sensitive and post-acne skin. One Trick Ponies from Sweden was launched during the trade show with a very similar concept. The six gender-free face and body care products for customers in their late teens and early 20s are each built around a key active which is communicated clearly on the packaging in a 1970s style bubble lettering. Naples-based 2SQM was introduced a few months ago and features nine certified organic and gender-free face and body care products. The brand's background is firmly rooted in the Italian seaside city's thriving clubbing, art and design subculture. 2SQM was developed in collaboration with a collective of local performance artists, designers and creators. Certified organic Danish-Swiss brand Astalou also launched at Cosmoprof. The company's stylishly packaged face and body care products focus on organic, high-end luxury and are designed to appeal to a discerning, urban (and well-off) Millennials clientele. The localism trend continues to exert a major influence on the beauty industry, as new beauty brands build on transparency in terms of ingredients, product development and packaging. And highlighting the geographical origins or heritage of key actives adds up to the story-telling. The founders of Italian newcomer Amarey, for example, are from the famous Illy coffee dynasty and the brand's three face care products are formulated with coffee extract, caffeine and other ingredients that come from food waste. Upcycled coffee ingredients also play a major role in the brand's packaging: 50% of Amarey's outer (cardboard) packaging is made from coffee silver skin. The origin of the main ingredients in Japanese bath and body care brand Toyama Quality Water are indicated by the brand name: the Toyama prefecture on Honshu island is famous for the spectacular scenery of the Northern Japanese Alps as well as one of the deepest sea bays in Japan. The brand's two sub-ranges, Altitude 3000 and Depth 1000, are based on glacier water and deep sea water respectively. Recently launched indie brand Lorj is from the Brittany region of France. The key ingredient in Lorj's three products is organic barley extract manufactured by brand founder Pascal Drouet in the small town of Ploeuc L'Hermitage. Finnish beauty brand Nobe is slated to launch later this year. With packaging design and product formulations heavily inspired by the Polar landscape and traditional Finnish/Nordic ingredients, the portfolio comprises three skin care ranges that focus on protecting the skin's microbiome. Sensitive skin care brand Skin Sapiens from the UK launched in 2020 and currently offers 12 face and body care products that are fragrance-free, certfied organic and vegan. The company is also taking transparency to the next level: Skin Sapiens is listing the precise percentages of the different packaging materials on the actual packaging to make recycling easier for consumers. The European nutritional supplements market has been thriving recently, driven by the increased consumer interest in health matters that were generated by the pandemic as well as a growing focus on gut health as the key to physical and emotional well-being. Unsurprisingly, inner beauty was very visible at Cosmoprof Bologna 2023, too. French nutritional supplements brand D-Lab Nutricosmetics has been manufacturing inner beauty capsules and tablets since 2010. Its latest launch is a 3-sku range of powder supplements with marine-based collagen and elastine oligopeptides that can be blended with liquid or creamy drinks and foods. Danish company Vild Nord was launched in 2019 and their speciality is marine collagen which is manufactured from wild-caught cod from sustainable fisheries. In the brand's collagen powder blends, the fish collagen is combined with various plant ingredients, such as Scottish algae, acerola, wild blueberries, blackcurrant or wild mushrooms. The company's newest launch are three probiotic supplements to boost immune health. German vitamin gummy brand Ivybears's newest product launch are Protein Boost gummy bears which also mark the brand's first foray into the fitness/sports supplements sector: Each fruit-flavoured gummy bear contains 5 gr of proteins, amino acids, creatine and caffeine. High-tech continue to be a major trend in the global beauty industry. Brands tapping into this trend develop innovative devices linked to an AI or base their formulas on innovative ingredients or formats. Swiss indie brand Lycaste was introduced in 2023, offering its customers AI-powered face analysis (through a smartphone or laptop camera) and product recommendations. The brand's range comprises six face creams with different textures and formulations and six boosters (actives) which can be mixed and matched to create a personalised skin care solution. Lycaste also offers four nutritional supplements as part of its anti-ageing face care range for a holistic inner and outer beauty experience. Amongst new launches of Chinese TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) manufacturer Yunnan Baiyao was a customisable skin care range consisting of three components: lyophilised actives in powder form, a liquid serum and an essence booster. Clients select their favourite of each category (there are six different powders, six serums and four boosters to choose from) and then blend the three components prior to use. Korean high-tech beauty face care brand Franz' latest sun protection launch is a true innovation: The Naked SunShield Peptide Patch set contains two ultra-thin patches and a moisturising peptide solution. The peptide solution is applied to the patches and these are then placed on the face wherever additional sun protection is necessary, like the cheekbones or the forehead. The patches are barely visible on the skin and water-resistant (it is even possible to apply makeup on top of them) and the brand claims that they filter out 95.8% of UVA and 99.9% of UVB radiation. Also launched during Cosmoprof, Oxygen Revolution from Italy offers 11 face care products developed in collaboration with various Italian universities and research institutes and contain ozone which is said to help detoxify the skin and improve skin health. Aspects like functionality and gender-neutrality are also playing an increasing role in new fragrance launches. Simultaneously, fragrance layering, which allows customers to create new scent experiences, is becoming ubiquitous. Milan-based fragrance brand Essenza will launch in September 2023. The company's 6-sku unisex and vegan fragrance range is divided into three fragrance pairs that are built around two key notes each. Although the scents can be worn individually, Essenza's brand concept was designed to allow customers to freely combine them. French mass market fragrance brand Margot + Tita was launched in 2018 and named after the founder's two grandmothers. There are around 40 fragrances which are divided into two sections, Margot and Tita, and each Margot fragrance can be combined with Tita or vice versa to create a third, new scent. French aromatherapy perfume brand Solinotes offers plant-inspired and mood-lifting fragrances built around a key scent accord. Amongst the brand's newest launches are the fresh floral Zen Meadow and the green tea-inspired fragrance Thé Matcha. French natural perfumery brand 100Bon latest launches from 2022 are two functional fragrances: Lâcher prise, a blend of ten essential oils including bergamot, magnolia and santal amyris to help deal with stress; and Doux Rêves, which contains nine essential oils such as orange blossom and petitgrain to improve sleep quality and help when feeling overwhelmed."
India's 'brown beauty' make-up influencers go global,"Under the glow of a ring light in the spare bedroom of a Mumbai high-rise apartment, Indian make-up maven Debasree Banerjee has found fans across the world with a simple philosophy: ""brown is beautiful"". Banerjee's audience includes women from as far afield as the Middle East and United States who also have a deeper complexion but have historically been overlooked by the cosmetics industry. ""I actually have a lot of followers who are outside India, and I feel like it's probably because our skin tones match,"" Banerjee told AFP. ""They can see how the product looks like on my skin tone, how the lipstick applies on my skin tone, and just have that sense of belongingness."" Banerjee, 34, began experimenting with make-up videos in her spare time a decade ago, after graduating from university and moving to Mumbai to work in sales. She is now a full-time beauty and lifestyle influencer, teaching more than half a million followers how to beautify themselves on Instagram and YouTube. Early inspirations included British beauty content creators Tanya Burr and Fleur DeForce — both white and with millions of followers between them. But Banerjee said she had found no role models who resembled her. She credits Rihanna for the seismic shift towards greater inclusiveness in the cosmetics industry. In 2017, the pop superstar launched her make-up line Fenty Beauty, in partnership with the LVMH group, which offered 40 shades of foundation and turned her into a billionaire. ""Fenty Beauty really, really changed the game,"" Banerjee said. ""I think that's when people knew that this is important."" While other international brands have tried to keep up, many still have ""miles and miles to go"" before they can be considered truly inclusive, she added. ""I still see products being launched in three shades, in four shades, calling them 'universal'. And it's just ridiculous,"" Banerjee said. ""In India, everywhere you go... you see our features changing, our language changing, our skin colour changing. So it's very, very important to have more inclusive make-up."" Cheap internet data, rising income levels and the world's largest population of young people have fuelled an explosion in India's beauty and personal care market. The industry is now worth USD 15 billion nationally each year, with Euromonitor projecting that figure will double by 2030. Homegrown e-commerce platform Nykaa — which helped make global cosmetic brands easily available to Indians for the first time — was one of India's most-anticipated IPOs in 2021. ""People thought brown skin is not pretty,"" Faby, another beauty influencer living in Mumbai, told AFP. ""But now we've started learning to love ourselves."" Faby has nearly 900,000 Instagram followers and has established herself as one of India's top cosmetic stylists, recently teaming up with top Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone to promote a skincare line. Almost her entire apartment has been refashioned into a studio with professional lights, camera equipment and retractable backdrops to stylise her regular online tutorials. The work can be taxing, with some daylong shoots lasting until well after midnight, but the money Faby makes from brand collaborations is enough to comfortably support both herself and her mother. ""It has been difficult, but now I can have my own Dior bag, I can have whatever I want,"" said Faby. ""It's all because of the followers who are watching."" India's government belatedly recognised the explosive growth of online content creation last year, announcing a 10 percent tax on promotional gifts worth over 20,000 rupees ($244). That move brought part of the country's USD 120 million influencer market under the tax net — chiefly those advertising products beyond the purchasing power of the vast majority of Indians. Actually, a single lipstick by a prominent international brand can cost around 2,000 rupees (USD 24) locally — more than what half of India's households pay for their weekly groceries, according to market research firm Kantar. But the gap between material desires and means has proven to be fertile ground for other Indian influencers showing their audiences how to keep on-trend without breaking the bank. ""There are many people who cannot afford expensive products, so my DIY shows them how to look more beautiful,"" Kavita Jadon, 34, told AFP. From her home a couple of hours' drive from the capital New Delhi, the housewife and mother-of-two makes videos showing how to make ersatz concealers out of moisturiser and coffee grinds, at a fraction of the cost of name-brand products. Despite filming from a cheap phone, editing with free software, and lacking Banerjee and Faby's elaborate studio setups, Jadon has amassed more than 169,000 followers on Facebook. Many of her homemade product ideas are the result of painstaking trial and error, with her audience eagerly sharing their own ideas or petitioning her with requests. ""Using products from big brands is not essential — it's possible to use local products and create beauty products at home too,"" she said. ""That's why my page has grown so significantly."""
Italy's cosmetics industry driven by exports,"According to preliminary data unveiled by Cosmetica Italia at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2023, the cosmetics industry in Italy achieved a turnover of EUR 13.3 billion in 2022, an increase of 12.1% compared to the previous year. As expected, the cumulative growth of 2021 and 2022 brought the industry to levels exceeding (by 10.5%) the level reached in 2019, before the pandemic. Looking to 2023, Cosmetica Italia forecasts a growth of 7.7% that should bring the total turnover of the industry to EUR 14.4 billion. In 2022, the growth of the Italian cosmetics industry was driven mainly by exports, which reached 5.9 billion euros, representing a growth of 18.5% compared to 2021. Exports, which represent 40% of the total turnover of the Italian industry, should continue to drive the growth of the sector in 2023, with an expected increase of 10%. The top 3 destination countries for Italian cosmetics in 2022 were the United States, ahead of France and Germany. Non-European countries represent 38% of total exports. Note, within the top 10, the impressive growth of the United Arab Emirates: +60.7% in 2022 compared to 2021. ""If questions persist about the availability and cost of raw materials or the increase in energy prices; the sector is solid, mature and competitive,"" commented Benedetto Lavino, President of Cosmetica Italia. The trend was positive for the Italian market too, where sales exceeded 11.5 billion euros in 2022, an increase of 8.1% compared to 2021. Mass market remains the predominant circuit (approximately 42% market share), while perfumeries strengthen their second position (19.3%), followed by pharmacies (17%). E-commerce, thanks to the strong acceleration resulting from the lockdowns, has almost doubled in size since 2019, reaching 8.6% of the total Italian cosmetics consumption in 2022. Next come hairdressing (5.1%), herbal medicine (3.3%), direct sales (3%) and aesthetics (1.9%). ""The data shows a full recovery and an overshoot of pre-pandemic numbers. At the same time, data are outlining new buying habits, increasingly multi-channel oriented,"" analyses Gian Andrea Positano, head of the Centre for Studies at Cosmetica Italia. In the consumer basket, face care (16.4%) and body care (15.3%) products, as well as alcoholic perfumery (13.6%) remain the main categories of the Italian market. The changes in demand between 2022 and 2021 show strong demand for lip care products (+21.4%), face make-up (+18%), alcoholic perfumery (+16.3%) and eye make-up (+11.7%). Further confirmation, according to Cosmetica Italia, of a return to normal sociality after the restrictions imposed by the pandemic."
Toothpaste and shampoo on tap: refill shops are multiplying across the US,"At Mason & Greens in Washington, the lack of packaging is the point — the small shop selling household goods and groceries is among dozens of zero-waste refill stores sprouting up in US cities from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Customers bring their own containers — from used jars to Tupperware, to fill with bulk items. The store even has ""had people bring in the sleeves that their newspapers come in,"" owner Anna Marino, 34, told AFP. Such stores are emblematic of what experts say is a necessary culture shift in one of the world's largest consumer economies, where the average person generates 4.9 pounds of waste per day, according to government statistics. Marino says the aim is to help anyone from novices to experts on their journey towards less waste, citing paper towels as a personal catalyst. ""Quitting paper towels was one of the first things that my family did and it was a significant reduction in the waste that we were creating on a weekly basis,"" said Marino, who co-founded the store with her husband. Reusable ""paper"" towels made of cloth are just one of the products she now sells at her store, where beans and oats fill wall-mounted dispensers, metal containers hold vinegar and olive oil, and shelves are stocked with package-free artisanal bread, veggies and vegan food. For bulk items, customers pay by weight, Marino's aim being to avoid any ""obnoxiously outrageous price"" and to keep things ""accessible."" Reusable containers, such as mason jars, can be purchased if needed. Upstairs, shampoo bars and toothpaste tablets that are chewed until becoming paste are among the store's many unpackaged hygiene products. Less than a third of US municipal solid waste was recovered for recycling or composting in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and only about nine percent of plastic material was recycled. Statistics such as these are why Marino asks suppliers to send shipments in compostable, or minimal packaging. ""We can't recycle our way out of the plastics crisis,"" says Jenny Gitlitz of the advocacy group Beyond Plastics. She points to toxins in plastic that can be carcinogenic or cause genetic mutations, as well as to endocrine disruptors. On top of that, tiny particles called microplastics have been discovered in virtually every environment, from the Mariana Trench to Mount Everest, as well as in the human body including the lungs and blood. Unlike aluminum and glass, plastic can only be recycled a few times before its polymers break down. And many types are not widely recyclable in the first place. ""If all else fails, then recycle,"" sums up professor Shelie Miller at the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan. ""I think folks often skip straight to the recycle and forget to reduce, reuse,"" she told AFP. Miller cautions that the issue of plastic waste will not be solved simply by individuals changing the way they consume — as exemplified in places like Mason & Greens. Creating a sustainable future ""really is a complete shared responsibility model"" involving corporations, governments and waste handlers, she said. In the meantime, though, Rini Saha — the co-owner of the FullFillery, another Washington-area refill shop in the suburb of Takoma Park, Maryland — hopes to make a difference from the ground up. ""We want you to reuse as much as we can, because recycling is still a huge carbon footprint,"" the 46-year-old told AFP. Saha and colleagues make a number of body care and cleaning products on-site, for refill or purchase in a returnable container. On a recent Wednesday morning, fellow co-owner Emoke Gaidosch, a chemist by training, poured liquid soap she had made into a large receptacle. Aside from the lack of packaging, Miller says bulk sales could yield even bigger environmental benefits by helping consumers buy only what they need. That, ultimately, can help eliminate the impacts from a product's entire lifecycle, from the energy and resources used to create it, to things like methane released when unused organic waste decays in landfalls. Over three years of existence, the FullFillery has morphed from a farmer's market stall to a large store lined with environmentally friendly products and extremely limited packaging. Similarly, Mason & Greens' Washington location, which only opened in September, was an expansion after the success of its first location in another suburb. The model is ""profitable,"" Saha told AFP. ""I don't think it's as profitable as a disposable business. But I think that inevitably, there's no choice. This is the way that business has to go."""
"Upcycling: How ""waste"" is getting a second life in the beauty sector","From tomato skins and olive pomace to cacao pods, coffee grounds and clementine peelings, the beauty industry is reinventing as it seeks to make something new out of something previously unwanted. Many cosmetics brands are starting to delve into our garbage cans or, more specifically, those of the food industry (even if manufacturers would most likely mention ""by-products"" rather than waste), to concoct the cleansers, creams, serums and makeup removers of tomorrow. Actually, this new interest in waste is also linked to the need for beauty industry companies to reduce their environmental footprint, and to try to meet the new expectations of consumers, who are increasingly in search of ecological commitments. This is something that the My Skin Feels brand is tackling head on, to the point of making waste a core part of its DNA. Born on the beaches of Brighton, on England's south coast, this beauty brand focuses primarily on organic ingredients from the food and drink industries that would otherwise have been thrown in the trash. And this helps makes each product — currently a moisturizer and a facial cleanser — unique, and sometimes even out of the ordinary. For its two flagship products, the brand used mandarin fruit juice waste, stating that eight kilos of waste give rise to one liter of ingredients, and specifying that it does not add water to its products. But that's not all, as My Skin Feels also incorporated Italian tomato skins from ketchup waste, packed with antioxidants, as well as oat waste, known for its soothing properties, and waste from olive oil manufacturing, again hailed for its antioxidant properties. It looks like a bold move at first glance, but it's one that should inspire many cosmetics companies, as the potential of waste seems to be virtually unlimited. The United Kingdom seems to be well ahead of the curve when it comes to turning waste into new resources, as another British brand, UpCircle Beauty, is embracing ingredients destined for the trash. Here, blueberry juice waste, date pits, chamomile stems, discarded spices, or even olive pits make up some or all of the ingredients in its signature products. The brand was founded well before the pandemic, in 2016, and now offers dozens of products. Meanwhile, in France, the Cultiv brand upcycles waste products from French and organic agriculture, particularly the famous ugly vegetables that nobody — or almost nobody — wants to buy. Rooted in French agricultural cooperatives, as the brand explains on its website, Cultiv develops cosmetics based on beets, spinach, wild chicory, flax or rye, in the aim of respecting human health and the planet. But facial and body care products aren't the only cosmetics looking to the virtues of agri-food waste, since the perfume industry is taking a close interest in the concept. The family group TechnicoFlor, for example, specializes in the creation and manufacture of aromatic compositions, and has developed a collection of eight upcycled fragrances. White wine lees recovered from the deposits generated in wine barrels during the aging process, as well as woodworking waste, clementine peels, cocoa pods or even strawberry waste are all used in the composition of these fragrances, which are developed using leftovers from the food industry. Most recently, French luxury beauty label La Bouche Rouche launched its first line of perfumes: a range of five fragrances containing 30% upcycled ingredients. While Les Fleurs du Déchet, I Am Trash by État Libre d'Orange (2018) was an upcycling pioneer in perfumery."
Social media is elevating the shower to a spa-like anti-stress ritual,"On social media, the shower has become much more than a daily act of hygiene. TikTokers are aiming to make the shower into a ritual that helps liberate the mind. Between fruits, vegetables and detailed body-care practices, TikTokers are rivalling one another with ingenious ways to make a shower more than just a shower. One idea that recently went viral on TikTok, is the Shower Orange, which has accumulated over 4.5 million views. The concept is simple: it consists of eating an orange in the shower in order to benefit from the scent of the citrus fruit in a kind of natural aromatherapy rite. TikToker Makenzy Smith explains the process in a video: ""So when you get in the shower, and you peel an orange, essentially you're getting all of that delicious aromatic orange citrusy peel. When you mix that in with hot steam, it makes your shower smell amazing."" According to its fans, this spa-like practice helps them release pressure and reduce stress, while as a bonus you don't have any sticky fingers to deal with. Other TikTok users have shared videos of showering with plants. According to devotees of this practice, taking a shower with aromatic plants suspended in the shower, such as eucalyptus, not only allow you to enjoy the scent, but can also help you breathe better by clearing the airways thanks to the steam of the hot water and the decongestant properties of the plant. Proponents note the spa-like experience and stress relief, and even the sensation of peace. At the beginning of the year, many influencers were touting the benefits of the so-called Everything Shower. As its name suggests, it's about making a shower an all-in-one experience: body scrub, hair mask, shaving, any and every self-care task is on the list. These intensive showers provide a feeling of being at the spa. The goal is to feel completely clean from head to toe. Although this kind of shower takes time and energy, it's a very satisfying experience for many of those who undertake such a ritual. One TikToker, named Jenna.Grwm, shows her entire ritual in a video, from hair mask to facial exfoliation to nail care. Despite the lengthy process, she feels it's valuable. ""The work is so worth it in the end because you feel so much better,"" she explains. These shower rituals may not be new to everyone, but their exposure on TikTok means more are trying them out in a desire to reduce anxiety and daily stress. In fact, a Canadian study published in 2022 established a link between cleaning oneself and stress reduction. To reach this conclusion, researchers from the University of Toronto showed an anxiety-provoking video to more than a thousand adults. After viewing the video, the panel was divided into three distinct groups. The first group watched another instructional video on hand-washing, the second group watched a video on how to draw a circle, and the third group watched a video on how to peel an egg. The group that watched the hand-washing video subsequently showed lower levels of anxiety than the others. ""Daily cleaning behaviour may facilitate coping with stressors like physical risks and psychological threats to the self,"" the researchers concluded."
Men and women would spend one sixth of their lives making themelves beautiful,"While some people may claim to spend only a few minutes primping each day, it appears that the amount of time spent caring for or improving one's physical appearance is actually much greater. An international group of scientists set out to find out just how much time by analysing data from 93,158 people aged 18 to over 90, from 93 countries, focusing on specific behaviours such as body hygiene, use of makeup or other cosmetic products, hair care, clothing style, physical exercise, and diet. All actions undertaken with the main purpose of improving one's physical appearance (i.e., not mainly for health reasons). And what they found may surprise you. Published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, this research reveals that 99% of participants spend at least ten minutes a day on all types of behaviours aimed at improving their physical appearance. But in actuality we spend much longer. According to the researchers, women spend an average of nearly four hours a day primping, while men spend 3.6 hours a day on average. Not only does the study demonstrate that these behaviors are universal, but it also shows that they are not necessarily exclusively the domain of women, although they spend some 40 more minutes on their physical appearance on a daily basis. However, the researchers did find disparities according to age, especially among women. Middle-aged women, including those in their 40s and 50s, spend the least time on their appearance. On average, women aged 18 spend 63 minutes more per day on their appearance than women aged 44, while women aged 60 spend 30 minutes more than women aged 44. But age is far from the only predictive factor to consider when looking at these behaviours. The fact of not being in a serious relationship, of having high self-esteem – or on the contrary of not having a positive self-image, or of having a higher socio-economic status, are associated with a higher amount of time spent on improving one's physical appearance. According to the researchers, the two most revealing factors, however, are the time spent watching television, and even more, so the time spent on social media. ""Most researchers agree that the media often conveys unrealistic physical ideals, that are also often unattainable for the average person. Confronting one's body with the photo-retouched silhouettes of models may trigger many negative feelings and behaviours, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, body dissatisfaction and eating disorders,"" the study authors explain. These findings corroborate the results of a previous study, published in February 2023 in the journal Psychology of Popular Media, revealing that young people feel better about themselves when they stay away from social networks. Conducted by scientists from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute in Canada, this study showed that limiting social networking to 60 minutes per day among 17-25 year olds improved their perception of their weight and general appearance compared to unrestricted use."
Fillers and lip lift procedures are on the rise for selfie-oriented youngsters,"Every year the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS) pulls back the curtain on the latest trends in cosmetic medicine and surgery. With more than 2,200 members — facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons — the academy took the pulse on what might be driving patients to get particular procedures. After having embraced injections in order to be able to put forth more wrinkle-free faces during video-conferences, patients of all genders are now keen on touching up their faces with the goal of taking beautiful selfies. Similar to 2021, the number of cosmetic treatments and facial plastic surgery procedures carried out increased in 2022 across all age categories. According to the report, 58% of AAFPRS members reported a rise in bookings and treatments over the past year, with more than three-quarters reporting an increase of more than 10% in demand for these types of procedures. Practitioners surveyed reported that for 16 of the 18 procedures surveyed, with the exception of hair transplants and otoplasty (surgery to diminish ear prominence), most of their patients were women. Another finding is that patients are now increasingly turning to non-invasive procedures, in 82% of cases, and more specifically to neurotoxin injections, such as Botox, dermal fillers, and topical products, such as chemical peels. Preventing or fighting the signs of aging is a priority for patients. When it comes to surgical procedures, facelifts, blepharoplasties (which removes excess skin above the eyelid to avoid the hooded look) and rhinoplasties are the most popular. Rhinoplasty remains the most requested surgical procedure for patients under the age of 34. While the term 'Snapchat dysmorphia' is often used to explain the boom in certain treatments among younger generations, it's not backed up by the data. ""Gen Z's influence in the aesthetic marketplace is not yet generating leaps in facial plastic surgery procedure numbers (and that's probably a good thing),"" the report's authors say. Still, nearly three-quarters of the plastic surgeons surveyed cite an increase in the number of patients under the age of 30 for cosmetic surgery procedures and injectables. However, these are essentially preventive procedures to avoid the need for more extensive procedures in the future. It's for the age group of 35- 55 that ""surgical procedure activity sees significant increase,"" according to this year's survey. ""In 2022, our members continued to see the impact of the 'Zoom Boom,' with 79% of respondents naming the 'Zoom Effect' as a major contributing factor in patients' desire to seek treatment,"" says Theda Kontis, MD, president of AAFPRS. However, the increase in procedures is also due to an unexpected factor. Dr. Kontis points to the money saved during the pandemic, which is now being used to pay for cosmetic procedures. In addition to the 'Zoom Boom,' selfie culture is also believed to be at the origin of the increase of certain treatments and procedures. More than three quarters of facial plastic surgeons say that looking better in selfies is clearly a growing trend. A finding that has benefited the upper lip lift, performed by at least 73% of AAFPRS members, up 3% from 2021. But also to blepharoplasty, designed to correct drooping eyelids, which is the second most requested procedure in 2022, just behind rhinoplasty. The fashion and beauty revival of the 1990s and 2000s is also having an impact on the choice of certain aesthetic procedures. The craze for refined and sculpted features, prominent cheekbones, and angular faces has boosted the demand for 'buccal fat removal,' which consists in removing or reducing the Bichat's fat pads, located in the center of the cheek. No less than 15% of the surgeons surveyed reported an increase in this procedure which is definitive. It's a trend that is in contrast to what many surgeons are used to performing as they have long been injecting fat in this area to allow middle-aged women to have fuller cheeks. ""Buccal fat surgery is not reversible–so while you may love the look in your 20s and 30s, as you age, your face naturally loses fat, and therefore volume,"" warns Dr Kontis."
"Powders, a trendy galenic form building up a real ecosystem","After decades of disuse, hygiene and care products in the form of powder are making a comeback. Now that solid products are widespread, this galenic form is booming. Products can be used as such or, increasingly, and extemporaneously, in formulas to be reconstituted. Several young Clean Beauty brands have already seized on the concept, highlighting the naturalness of the formulas and the benefits of reduced packaging. Let's take the example of Neo By Nature, which was launched last fall. The young brand has developed a shower gel to be reconstituted in a stainless steel pump bottle using compacted powder tablets. The organic-certified formula is composed of 99 % of ingredients of natural origin, and the sleek bottle is infinitely refillable. ""For us, the customer benefit is not ecoresponsibility: that is our mission! The benefit should be to have the best possible shower gel. To this aim, we use high-quality natural actives, including a biosaccharide with moisturizing and anti-ageing properties. It's not a mere shower gel, it is a super shower gel"", says Hector Sentilhes, co-founder of the brand. To achieve the level of efficacy and sensoriality required to compete with conventional liquid formulas, the two founders turned to the expertise of their partner, Fareva, an expert in cosmetics outsourcing. The collaboration resulted in 18 months of development and helped find the right balance in terms of formulas and manufacturing, despite specific constraints. Fareva has 42 production sites, including Le Laboratoire du Bain in France, a site originally dedicated to effervescent powders and bath pebbles. ""This business was slowing down because people no longer have baths regularly, but we wanted to showcase our expertise in powder manufacturing and compacting, with formulas that have real functionality. We work with direct-use powders and powders for dilution"", explains Antoine Dubrana, Marketing and Communication Director of the Fareva group. For both solutions, the manufacturer uses his expertise to address identified issues specific to this type of product. ""It's a completely different approach. We use a dry process, so the actives, the surfactants, and everything that makes the formula efficient must be in powder form. It considerably reduces the range of ingredients, which must also generally be of natural, or even organic origin. The same goes for perfumes, oils and colouring agents, which need to be worked on differently, because they are liquid ingredients"", says the expert. ""Compaction is complicated with formulas which are not completely dry: we had 1% of perfume added at the time of mixing"", adds Hector Sentilhes. Another important criterion is the powder's sufficient castability, which helps obtain free flow in the different canals, without sticky effects. ""This is one of the most complex and technical points in powder formulation"", says Antoine Dubrana. Powders compressed into tablets to be diluted by consumers involve additional challenges related to the use scenarios. ""We need to find the right balance to ensure the powder is well compacted, and dissolution is not too slow for users, since the dilution time is generally of 6 to 8 hours for large sizes, and 3 to 4 hours for pill sizes"", explains Antoine Dubrana. The same remarks were made by Lessonia, an ingredient and cosmetics designer and manufacturer. Already specialized in powder masks to be reconstituted, the laboratory has equipped itself with an industrial tool adapted to powder production, packaging, and compression. It also offers a range of customized products to rehydrate, including shampoos, shower gels, micellar water, and shaving foam in the form of powder, granules and tablets. ""We use technologies that take into account powders' rheology, particle size distribution, behaviour, and flow. Our know-how is based on our ability to mix them, screen them, make them fluid, and package them"", says Charles Henri Morice, Director of Innovation. ""Tablets to be rehydrated are getting increasingly popular, because the process is easier for consumers, but they need to dissolve easily, so it's a real development challenge. Last year, we made an industrial investment to package powders in bottles. More recently, we purchased a tablet press machine, and we've been investing in a granulation machine"", adds Lessonia's Innovation Director. Granules, i.e. powders with a larger grain size, have several advantages, according to the specialist. ""With granules, we can solve the issue of fine and volatile powders that might be inhaled. The flow is more fluid, packaging is easier, and the granules are more easily soluble and easier to work with, because there are fewer problems of particle mixture or segregation, which can change the initial composition"", he says. Although the development of powders of any form is still mainly reserved for young independent brands, the approach has many advantages as regards ecodesign. According to a life cycle study conducted by Lessonia, powder shampoo saves half the water, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions of a liquid shampoo. Available in three fragrances – sweet almond, lavender-rosemary-lemon, and bamboo-hemp – the Neo By Nature shower gel is currently distributed on the brand's website, in 90 Nature & Découverte outlets in France, in some 15 pharmacies, and in several independent stores. A recent fundraising of one million euros will help develop four new products. ""They will be bathroom products to be diluted, with a strong focus on innovation. Two of them are concepts never seen before"", says Hector Sentilhes. Fareva has announced a powder deodorant to be rehydrated in a refillable roll-on container for spring. ""Major brands have not really focused on this issue yet, because the ecosystem needs to develop, particularly in terms of ingredients providing naturalness and sensoriality. The concept also puts a lot of power in the hands of consumers: they are responsible for the dilution and proper cleaning of the container, and there can be a fear of misuse that backfires on the brand. The implementation of the French no-waste AGEC law, or of the cosmetic eco-score will most certainly accelerate the growth of this form"", concludes Antoine Dubrana."
Trends: Are new male beauty icons smashing skincare stereotypes?,"In order to determine which are the male celebrities that influence men's beauty routines the most, Humanery's experts screened a hundred of them, via Google data analysis [1]. As a result, according to the men's skincare e-commerce platform, two different men with two different styles from two different generations, made the grade as world-class skinfluencers: Paul Rudd and Harry Styles. Paul Rudd clearly stands out, taking first place in the ranking, with no less than 8,400 annual searches associating the American actor born in 1969 with the term 'skincare'. The Humanery ranking suggests that it is a more multifaceted and inclusive form of masculinity — whether in terms of age, body type, or origin — that appeals to the public today. In second place comes Harry Styles (8,400 searches), who, for the past three years, has been breaking down many preconceived ideas in the fashion industry, and has even launched his own gender-neutral beauty brand. He is followed by the British-American actor Andrew Garfield (4,800 searches) and the British actor Idris Elba, who just turned 50. David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, John Legend and Brad Pitt complete the ranking, which is testament to a certain diversity when it comes to skinfluence. ""Our Google study shows that, apart from having great skin, there isn't one preferred 'type' of male celebrity skinfluencer. There is a real mix of ages, skin colors and professions, all encouraging men to up their skincare game. This can only be a good thing, as for years now, more men have needed to take better care of their skin, and if it's celebrities helping to make that happen, then we're here for it,"" explains Thomas Watson, a skincare expert at Humanery. Otherwise, the study reveals that searches for 'men's skin care' have jumped by 124% in the last three months. In recent years, several personalities have tried to build on the evolution of masculinity codes of by launching their own beauty brands: Harry Styles, of course, with his a gender-neutral cosmetics brand called Pleasing, which includes skincare and makeup, Machine Gun Kelly with a nail polish brand called UN/DN LAQR, and Tyler, The Creator with his Golf Le Fleur line of nail polish and fragrances."
"In the US, menopause finally gets its due","Of course, some of those same celebrities have sought to cash in on an as yet untapped gold mine by offering a range of new products aimed at middle-aged women seeking relief. Naomi Watts, Gwyneth Paltrow and Oprah Winfrey have all recently gone on the record about the symptoms they have experienced. Michelle Obama tackled menopause on her podcast in 2020. ""Over the course of my career as an actor, I've outrun tsunamis and come face-to-face with 'King Kong.' But nothing prepared me for early menopause,"" writes the 54-year-old Watts, explaining that she began noticing physiological changes at age 36. Winfrey, the 69-year-old talk show queen, said her heart palpitations in her late 40s were so severe that she thought she was ""going to die every single night."" ""I went to five different doctors — nobody ever once suggested that it could be menopause,"" Winfrey says, calling for more public discourse to warn women about what is to come, and also to make doctors more aware of the need for better care. Some doctors appear to be woefully unversed on the topic, or simply embrace the old-fashioned notion that it's a phase to be dealt with and nothing more. Menopause, which marks the one-year point after a woman's final menstrual period, is actually the end point of a much longer cycle. Perimenopause is the final phase of a woman's reproductive cycle and is the time when many of the most troublesome symptoms are noticed — from night sweats and hot flashes to insomnia, hair loss, anxiety, heavy bleeding, skin dryness and low sex drive. For some women, this phase can last for up to a decade — hence the need for better awareness, care and consideration. Studies suggest a vast majority of women will experience at least one menopausal symptom in their lifetime. Wen Shen, an associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the co-director of its Women's Wellness and Healthy Aging Program, says 20 percent of women with symptoms have ""really severe"" issues. Those experiences during perimenopause can ""basically ruin their lives, ruin their ability to focus at work, to concentrate, ruin their relationships,"" Shen told AFP. She is in favor of the movement by showbiz power players to destigmatize the condition especially as, in her view, ""unfortunately, many doctors are not well versed."" ""Traditionally it has been such a taboo. And women were afraid to admit they were in menopause, because it's sometimes shameful. And it was associated with aging,"" Shen said. ""So I think having glamorous movie stars bringing it out and being honest about it is a good thing."" In 2012, Shen's team did a survey of all OB GYN residents in the United States and found that the majority of graduating residents ""did not feel comfortable dealing with menopause."" Some respondents had one lecture about the condition, as opposed to months of training about infertility and gynecological cancers. Shen says textbooks have been improved in the last decade, but still says there is ""not enough emphasis"" on teaching the next generation of doctors about an essential phase of a woman's life. Alongside the need for better medical treatment, investment firms are pouring oodles of cash into products aimed at middle aged women in the various phases of menopause. In October, Watts launched Stripes, which offers ""menopause solutions from scalp to vag."" On offer are lubricants for vaginal dryness, densifying hair masks and probiotic supplements. For years, Oscar winner Paltrow has sold ""Madame Ovary"" — a supplement cocktail of herbs, vitamins and phytonutrients to ""help smooth the menopausal transition."" A month's supply goes for USD 90 on her Goop website. And retired tennis superstar Serena Williams, 41, recently invested in vegan menopause supplement brand Wile, saying it was ""changing the game for women over 40."" One of the standard treatments for menopause is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which replaces the estrogen that a woman's body stops making as she ages, addressing key symptoms such as hot flashes and protecting against osteoporosis. Once prescribed regularly, the treatment all but dropped off the map in the United States 20 years ago — the result of a flawed scientific study that sparked panic by suggesting high health risks to women. Shen says better research over the past two decades and assessment of the risks has markedly improved understanding of HRT, leading to its increased use, but she worries about companies offering the drugs over the phone. ""Some of them do advise other forms of treatments that are not evidence-based, have not been researched adequately, that may actually be harmful,"" she warns. Shen suggests that women experiencing serious symptoms ask their doctor to be sent to someone specializing in menopause care, who would be able to prescribe the proper treatment, including HRT."
Is de-influencing the new trend in the fight against over-consumption?,"Are the days of influencers telling us what to buy, what to wear, what to watch and who to follow coming to an end? Since the beginning of the year, the TikTok community, and more particularly Generation Z, has been indicating that they're fed up with influencers, a communal sentiment that has given rise to the hashtag #deinfluencing. This term currently totals more than 150 million views on the platform. It's proving particularly popular in the beauty and lifestyle communities, where it reportedly got its start. According to a 2020 Kantar study relayed by Marketing Dive, more than a quarter of the general population has made a purchase based on a recommendation from an influencer. A rate that rises to 44% for Gen Z. However, followers are now more aware of influencers' marketing strategies. Better informed, they are becoming increasingly vocal about taking steps to no longer be duped. A new wave of videos on TikTok criticize influencers. These videos urge users to carefully consider their purchases and even to refrain from buying and save their money. Their aim is to help other users not fall for a scam or even an over-hyped product that just doesn't live up to the attention. These videos have given rise to the term ""de-influence."" In a series of videos, TikToker Michelleskildelsky, a self-described former compulsive shopper, lists some of the ""useless"" products that influencers recommend acquiring: Apple AirPods Max, 25 different perfumes, Ugg slippers, a multitude of beauty products... Her videos have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. In the comments, some users suggest cheaper alternatives, while others recognize that they have been guilty of falling for such unnecessary purchases. And there are many videos in this vein. Some people even make a project out of buying products recommended by influencers and setting out to critique them and deconstruct their lack of utility, no holding back. For Kahlea Nicole Wade, a brand collaboration coach and content creator, de-influencing is about trust and reclaiming their power, especially for Gen Z, she told Today. And indeed in certain recent well-publicized cases, some influencers have been called out for being untrustworthy. Such as the ""MascaraGate"" incident involving an influencer being accused of wearing false eyelashes while promoting the virtues of a mascara from L'Oréal. In response to such critiques, some influencers are calling for everyone to take responsibility for themselves and their purchases. France-based Coline, who counts nearly 400,000 followers on her Instagram page, is among them. In one of her recent videos, she argues that followers are all responsible for their own purchasing decisions, and that influencers are ""strangers"" who recommend products so people need to make up their own minds and take their own needs and tastes into account when buying something. Some detractors of this new trend on TikTok point out that not all the messages are not necessarily aimed at reducing users' consumption generally. Some de-influencers criticize over-hyped products and encourage their followers to buy cheaper ones, as in this video from @alyssastephanie. One thing is certain, however, naivety and ingenuity in the face of social networks are declining a little more."
Record levels for French cosmetics exports,"After 2021, marked by the post-pandemic recovery, the French cosmetics industry maintained its momentum and confirmed the exceptional results recorded in the first months of 2022. With a growth of about 3 billion euros in 2022, exports of made-in-France cosmetics will exceed for the first time the EUR 19.2 billion mark [1] (against EUR 16.2 billion in 2021). According to the French trade association representing cosmetic manufacturers (FEBEA), this +18.8% jump over 2021 will enable France to consolidate its position as the world leader in the sector. In total, almost 2/3 of the French production of perfumes and cosmetics is exported. With a positive balance of EUR 15.6 billion (after deducting imports), the French cosmetics industry is the third largest contributor to foreign trade, after aeronautics (EUR 23 billion) and wines and spirits (EUR 16 billion). The US market was particularly dynamic in 2022, regaining first place on the podium of French cosmetics importing countries, which had been claimed by China last year. French exports to the United States increased by 28% in 2022, to reach EUR 2.3 billion, i.e. an increase of 48.2% over the 2019/2022 period! With a 37% share, EU countries remain however the first export destination for made-in-France cosmetics (+24.2% compared to 2021). In this area, Germany remains the main market: it imports 1.9 billion euros worth of French cosmetics, a figure that is up by 21% compared to 2021. Also worth noting is the very strong growth of the Middle East market (+33.8% compared to 2021). This performance is mainly due to the progression of exports to the United Arab Emirates (+41.8%) and Saudi Arabia (+20.4%). Conversely, China, which totals EUR 1.954 billion in French cosmetics imports, is experiencing a slowdown (+3.1%), due in particular to the health restrictions that struck the country in 2022. With an 8.8% increase compared to the previous year, French cosmetics exports to Asia reached EUR 5.179 billion in 2022, which nevertheless represents an increase of 32% over the 2019/2022 period. According to the FEBEA, perfume, make-up and skincare categories are the main drivers of French exports, accounting for more than 85% of total export sales, i.e. more than EUR 16.5 billion in 2022. The perfumery category posted a staggering growth of 30.2% in 2022. All the other categories also performed well: ""Personal care and hygiene"" products grew by 36.7%, even though they only represent 3.3% of French exports. Emmanuel Guichard, General Delegate of the FEBEA, believes that these good results can be explained by the ability of manufacturers to reinvent themselves to meet the new expectations of consumers, particularly by offering more natural and eco-friendly products. ""This ability to anticipate changes and to constantly innovate is the reason why the sector continues to improve its performance. This is something our federation is very proud of, as it should be for France where, paradoxically, our cosmetic companies, especially our SMEs and MSEs, have to face many difficulties, especially in the mass market channel,"" he concluded."
"Canadian prestige beauty sales rise 25% in 2022, according to NPD","In line with the U.S. sales trends, the prestige beauty industry in Canada ended 2022 as one of the country's top-performing sectors, according to The NPD Group. Total sales reached CAD 3.4 billion for the year, growing 25%, compared to 2021. With overall market prices continuing to rise, the average price of beauty products rose by 1%, inclusive of promotions, according to NPD. ""With a highly anticipated recovery, the Canadian beauty industry performed impressively last year,"" said Alecsandra Hancas, Canadian beauty industry analyst at NPD. ""Even in the face of higher prices and overall economic uncertainties, consumers were unfaltering. Consumer demand for prestige beauty products remained high. These results are a testament to the importance of beauty products and their important role in making consumers feel good."" With the end of restrictions and social life fully resuming, the makeup category made a strong and highly anticipated comeback, with sales revenue growing 38%, year over year, which is the highest growth of any prestige beauty category. Fragrance sales increased by 24%, and skincare was up 17%. The hair category continued to show strong growth of 27%. The fastest-growing segments were fragrance eau de parfums – marking yet another year of strong consecutive growth as consumers invested in more potent fragrance concentrations – as well as hair products and makeup foundation. Combined, these three segments contributed close to one-quarter of total beauty industry sales revenue gains in 2022. When it came to their makeup purchases, Canadian's were skin-focused: luminous and natural foundation finishes were among the top share gainers in the makeup category. At the channel level, year-over-year online sales continued to grow in 2022, but brick-and-mortar store sales was the big story. Canadians' return to in-store shopping was clear, as store sales grew by 34% and accounted for most of the industry's gains last year. ""Looking ahead, we anticipate another year of growth for the Canadian beauty market in 2023, led by increased demand, product innovation, and experiential retail,"" said Hancas. ""Canadians are excited to get back into stores to interact with brands and touch, feel, and test products. They are also getting out more again, which means putting their best face forward."""
Three beauty trends spotted at Cosme Tokyo 2023,"The 2023 edition of Cosme Tokyo took place from 11th to 13th January and although the show was smaller than usual – as is the case with many international trade shows at the moment, in particular in Asia – the Tokyo Big Sight Expo Centre was very busy indeed, with 29,500 visitors attending the whole Cosme Week 2023. Here are the three key beauty trends spotted by Premium Beauty News at the event: Japanese consumers are discerning, sophisticated, and well-educated about ingredients and beauty tech, and Asian brands exhibiting at Cosme Tokyo presented the very latest in science-driven cosmetic products. Japanese salon brand Lady Bio introduced its new AI Mist, a water-based multipurpose spray developed in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, which can be used on dry or acne-afflicted skin or troublesome scalps. Jokari presented a face care range formulated with electrolysed reduced water (alkaline ionized water) which is claimed to have detoxifying and antioxidant properties. Korean brand Sam-u showcased its PH Sensitive face care range – each product in the line-up has been formulated with different pH values to most efficiently achieve the desired cosmetic result. US-Japanese skin care brand Shunly's face care range offers products packed with active ingredients such as Q10, fruit acids, niacinamide, and vitamins. Japanese prestige skin care brand Seleia is leveraging microneedle tech in its up-coming Scalp Luxe ST launch. This is a treatment serum for itchy and sensitive scalps, packaged in a pen-shaped tube. The applicator top is covered with tiny, thin, sharp needles that very lightly pierce the top layer of the skin so that the serum can more easily penetrate into the scalp. Salon brand Spa Treatment has also been introducing microneedle cosmetic tech, such as the HAS Micro Patch, an under eye patch saturated with a serum containing self-dissolving microneedle spicules. The market for cannabidiol products (including both supplements and beauty products) is finally starting to take off in Japan. There were at least a dozen domestic CBD brands at the show, with many other Japanese beauty companies also offering CBD products in their portfolio. CBD beauty is still a small category at the moment, as cultural aversion to marijuana remains quite strong in Japan – cannabis has been a prohibited substance for many decades and is viewed as a dangerous drug by many Japanese, especially the older and more rural demographics. However, for younger Japanese living in urban areas, using CBD products has become popular in recent years, particularly amongst consumers in search of stress relief and relaxation. At the time of writing, cultivating hemp and distilling/manufacturing CBD is still heavily restricted in Japan, so domestic cannabis brands usually import their CBD from Europe or the US. However, this situation is set to change soon as it is expected that the Japanese Ministry of Health will review current cannabis legislation this year, making it easier for domestic companies to import and manufacture CBD products. Functional foods and beverages are highly popular in Japan, so many of the CBD products shown at the fair were supplements such as oils, drinks or gummies, positioned as aiding sleep and promoting relaxation. Sikame was launched in April 2022 and offers CBD gummies and various flavoured and unflavoured oils. CBD newcomer brand Pillow sells CBD-enhanced drinks and gummies that are positioned as helping to improve sleep and aid relaxation while Migoto's Sugoy has just introduced a Botanical Roll-on scented with essential oils to relax and comfort, while Maritime's portfolio includes five different CBD oil and CBD-infused water. However, there were also a number of CBD brands presenting face, body, and hair care. Chill Moon, for example, offers a CBD-enhanced hair oil, while Maritime's sister brand Mariélan focuses on CBD face care. Ritto's recently launched CBD face and body range is packaged in bright, attractive colours. Another product trend that dominated new product launches at Cosme Tokyo was femtech and femcare, an emerging category with a big potential. At Cosme Tokyo 2023, around half a dozen indie and newcomer brands presented nutritional supplements and CBD products specifically formulated to enhance female well-being while others focused on female-positioned lubricants, intimate washes and lotions. The term femtech usually refers to products and services that focus on all aspects of women's health, from menstruation products over reproductive healthcare and pregnancy care to menopausal products but also including female sex toys and other well-being products. In Japan, femtech only became a generally recognized concept a few years ago, when period product retailer Fermata first launched its online store in 2019. Fermata's period wear, sex toys and other female-positioned products became so popular that the company began selling offline in 2020, offering its curated product range in a new design and lifestyle retail space, New Stand Tokyo, which is located in Tokyo's upmarket Roppongi district. And in 2022, Cosme Tokyo's organizers RX Japan launched the first-ever femtech-focused trade fair, Femtech Tokyo. While it is still highly unusual to find period wear, menstrual cups, vibrators and similar female-focused products in offline retailers, things are starting to change: Matsumoto Kiyoshi, one of the largest drugstore retailers in Japan, rolled out a new retail format in 2015. Matsukiyo Lab is a chain of health, wellness, and beauty focused drugstores that offer products and services aimed at single households. Currently, there are around 30 Matsukiyo Lab stores in Japan – mostly in high-footfall, urban areas – and in 2021, a number of Matsukiyo Labs began selling the female sex toys and intimate care products of Japanese femtech brand Iroha. Femcare brands at the trade show included newcomer brand FI ME KA which manufactures period wear, plant-based intimate hygiene washes and lotions as well as flavoured CBD supplements. One of the brand's most recent products is a luxurious CBD-based body care cream scented with invigorating notes of bergamot and rosemary. Indie brand Micocochi specializes in CBD products for women, with a product range including a nutritional supplement and two CBD-infused body care products whilst Sex & Beauty's product range features kegel balls and three intimate serums/lotions designed to make kegel ball exercises for effective and pleasurable. Women's care manufacturer Hanamisui was at the trade fair with its entire product portfolio, including the recently launched Femiosis range of fermented herbal supplements specifically created to boost women's health. Another striking Hanamisui launch was the company's 7-sku colourfully packaged Rainbow23 line of female lubricants, which features different flavours and functional ingredients."
Cold remains one of beauty's hottest trends,"Since at least 2021, the benefits of cold for the skin have been among the most discussed topics on social networks, with beauty influencers sharing their ice-cold tips that combine the effects of cold with those of well-known skincare ingredients like aloe vera or cucumber. Benefits of cold are well known in the beauty industry. Cold would help burn fat and eliminate toxins, and would also improve blood circulation. On top of that, cold could also act as a decongestant, making it an ideal ally in the fight against puffiness and dark circles. At first, it was a matter of putting creams, masks and other cosmetics in the refrigerator for a few minutes to boost their benefits, but this has now given way to the emergence of new beauty tips and tricks that have propelled ice cubes to the rank of must-have beauty essentials. There are now dozens and dozens of hashtags related to these beauty hacks, totalling several hundred million views on TikTok. Some tips are shared by dermatologists, who also highlight some of the limitations of using ice, especially in terms of skin sensitivity and dryness. On TikTok, skin-icing, which simply involves applying an ice cube to the face, is the most widespread practice, and the most popular (23 million views). But there are now many variations on this theme, such as frozen cucumber, which involves applying frozen cucumber to the face (39 million views), frozen lipstick, which is the same as skin-icing but using an empty lipstick tube (400,000 views), or the frozen beauty blender, which promises to facilitate the application of foundation (9.7 million views). A more recent viral craze is frozen aloe vera, consisting this time of making aloe vera ice cubes to combine the effects of cold with the moisturizing properties of the plant (3.2 million views). So many ideas that have become popular go-to tricks, and which have not escaped the attention of the beauty industry. While it's always possible to put cosmetics – serums, creams, masks, make-up removers and other products – in the refrigerator to enhance their properties, brands have gone even further in the last few months by offering tools directly inspired by cryotherapy, to be used at home. This started with ice globes at the beginning of 2022, a tool that takes the form of water-filled spheres that are placed in the refrigerator or freezer and then applied to skin. The aim is to soothe the skin and reduce dark circles and inflammation. One year after first gaining popularity, these accessories seem to have a host of fans, with no less than 60 million views on TikTok. But, more simply, massage tools like a jade roller, a Gua Sha or a quartz roller can also be placed in the refrigerator to obtain the same results. And to combine the virtues of cold with other properties, brands now offer cooling masks, roll-ons and cooling-effect sticks, for an even more optimal result. Examples include Charlotte Tilbury's Cryo Recovery Mask, the Dr. Jart+ Cryo Rubber mask, the Cryo-Freshening stick by Holidermie, the Cryo Anti-Puffiness roll-on from Sothys Paris, or the Akane Skincare Ice Therapy Kit. To combine beauty, pleasure and travel experience, there are now many wellness getaways that focus on the virtues of the cold, whether in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, or France. In Finland, ice swimming – or avanto ('hole in the ice' in Finnish) – is a traditional ritual known for its benefits for the skin as well as for health, and even for busting stress and generally promoting well-being. On social networks, there are more and more daring influencers that simply get into their swimsuit and slip into one of the country's countless lakes and rivers for a refreshing blast!"
"Sales of U.S. prestige beauty products grew by 15% in 2022, says NPD","Proving resistant to economic uncertainties, the U.S. prestige beauty market jumped by an impressive 15% in 2022, compared to last year. Beauty products overall experienced consistent revenue growth across both the mass and prestige markets, up 11% when combined; however, only prestige unit demand remained strong. The U.S. prestige beauty market also experienced a greater shift back to stores in 2022, with year-over-year brick-and-mortar retail share growing, while online sales share increased in the mass market. All prestige beauty categories grew by double digits but makeup products (+18%) contributed the most sales revenue gains of the overall prestige beauty market. Lip products was the fastest-growing segment in makeup, with sales surpassing pre-pandemic 2019 levels by double-digits. Lip gloss outperformed lipstick, compared to both 2021 and 2019. Fragrance (+11%) was a standout category in its own right. Building on stellar performance as the industry's fastest-growing category in 2021, the fragrance market not only maintained this elevated level but continued to grow, led by both higher fragrance concentrations such as eau de parfums and parfums, and higher-end artisanal fragrance juices. In skincare (+12%), body products grew at more than three-times the rate of facial products. Hair (+22%) was the smallest, yet fastest-growing, prestige beauty category, led by masks and targeted treatments. Interestingly, hair care ranked among the fastest-growing segments in the prestige beauty market based on dollar sales growth, whereas hair products like shampoo, conditioner, and hair color landed among the top decliners in the mass channel, based on unit sales. According to NPD, the factors supporting prestige beauty growth — including increased spending from higher income consumers, the redefinition of wellness emphasizing mental health, and an increase in socialization — will continue to fuel positive performance this year. ""Looking at the industry holistically, inclusive of the prestige and mass markets, the future outlook for overall beauty is a positive one,"" said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. ""In an industry steeped in emotion, consumers have demonstrated they are willing to continue to spend on beauty products. Beauty brings joy, which is a universal aspiration and will drive our industry's resiliency in 2023."""
Beauty tech gradually expands in the male grooming market,"The rise in online shopping since the first Covid lockdown has pushed many beauty brands to reinvent, and to multiply services available quickly and remotely. This has been seen, from back in 2020, with the rise in virtual makeup testing services and the emergence of virtual sales advisor, both enhanced by artificial intelligence, on a mission to improve the shopping experience online... and in store. Because brands have understood that, while digital technology is obviously essential online, it now appears to be becoming essential in store for a more seamless, and above all personalized experience. Simultaneously, innovations in beauty tech are now landing thick and fast, offering consumers customized experiences accessible in just a few clicks. While these innovations were initially focused on the female beauty market, they are now extending to men's beauty. It's a men's skincare label, Bulldog, that is now innovating in the field of personalization. In the UK, the brand has just unveiled its Skin Advisor, an artificial intelligence-based tool that allows men to get bespoke skincare recommendations. Accessible on the brand's website, this new tool is easy to use. All you have to do is register online and answer a series of questions about your needs, your skin type, and add a location to take environmental factors into account. Last but not least, a selfie allows the user to perform a complete skin diagnosis remotely. Once all the parameters have been taken into account, users not only get information about their skin, but also a customized skincare routine. This technology is not new, but for the first time, it stands out for its focus on addressing men's needs, while reflecting the growing interest in skincare for men. For its part, Philips is continuing the global roll-out of GroomTribe, an application for beard care, which allows users to test different styles and obtain shaving advice. A Brazilian version of the app is now available. Finally, Biotherm announces the upcoming launch of a version adapted to men of their virtual skin diagnostic tool Skin Diag. According to a report by Persistence Market Research, demand for men's skincare products grew by 5.7% between 2017 and 2022 worldwide, and is expected to continue to rise by 2033, with an annual growth rate of approximately 7.5%."
"South Korea make-up market to renew with growth, finds GlobalData","The South Korean make-up market is set to expand at a healthy pace in the coming years, spurred by increasing public outdoor mobility, high product innovation, and rising online sales. Moreover, a strong celebrity culture is contributing to the expansion of the consumer base, and encouraging South Korean men to embrace makeup in their beauty routines. Against this backdrop, the South Korean make-up market is projected to rise to KRW2,827.8 million (USD 2.5 billion) by 2026, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% over 2021-2026, says GlobalData. According to a recent report [2] by the a data and analytics company, the face make-up category will register the fastest growth over the forecast period, followed by the lip make-up category. ""Spurred by Korean pop music, movie, and TV celebrity endorsements, and the availability of innovative Korean Beauty (K-Beauty) products, South Korean men are spending more on make-up products. With the authorities easing the COVID-19 restrictions in 2022, consumers began leaving their homes more often for work, studies, leisure, socializing, shopping, and other activities, thereby giving rise to more occasions for applying make-up. Moreover, the increased penetration of online beauty retailers bolstered sales of cosmetics,"" said Suneera Joseph, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData, in a statement. The per capita expenditure (PCE) on make-up in South Korea increased from USD 9.6 in 2016 to USD 18.1 in 2021, surpassing the regional average of USD 2.4, and the global average of USD 3.9. GlobalData forecasts South Korea's PCE on make-up to surge to USD 23.9 by 2026. Amorepacific Corporation, LG Corp, and The Estée Lauder Companies were the top three companies in the South Korean make-up market in value terms in 2021, while The Face Shop and Sulwhasoo were the leading brands. E-retail was the leading distribution channel, followed by health & beauty stores, and direct sellers. ""Going forward, the rising consumer interest in clean beauty will bolster demand for make-up products containing natural and organic ingredients that are perceived to be gentle and more effective than harsh chemicals. As a result, domestic and multinational manufacturers are expected to roll out innovative products with natural and sustainable ingredients with the effectiveness of regular chemical formulations. However, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and rising inflation can derail the recovery of the South Korean make-up market in the immediate future,"" concludes Suneera Joseph."
Euromonitor reveals top 10 global consumer trends in 2023,"The global market research company notes that consumers spending responsibly but emotionally, the role of digitization in purchasing processes, female equality demands, and a disruptive Gen Z, are some of the factors that will define global consumer trends in 2023. The rise of the cost-of-living and the environmental crisis appear as two key drivers of consumer behaviours. Budgeteers and Eco Economic – two of Euromonitor's top 10 global consumer trends in 2023 – are a direct result of this double evolution. The 10 key trends that Euromonitor outlines in its Global Consumer Trends 2023 report are: – Authentic Automation : Humans and machines need to be in sync to deliver meaningful solutions. Emotional connections are not to be underestimated, and tech benefits should outweigh the need for personal interactions to create a seamless experience. – Budgeteers : Cost of living crisis is undermining purchasing power for consumers. Saving money is top of mind. In 2022, 75% of consumers did not plan to increase overall spending. – Control the Scroll : People are still wed to their devices, but screen time is more selective. Consumers want an efficient and curated digital experience. – Eco Economic : Consumption behaviours are less about acquisition and more about reduction, which positively impacts the planet. 43% of consumers reduced their energy consumption last year. – Game On : Gaming has become an entertainment leader and has transcended the generational divide. This once-niche segment is now a mass-market opportunity. – Here and Now : Flexible solutions are expanding purchasing power and relieving cost pressures to help consumers spend on happiness. In the short-term, 'joy' is a purchase motivator. In 2022, buy now pay later reached US$156 bn lending value. – Revived Routines : 'Post-pandemic' is here. Consumers are eager to rediscover the world, despite uncertainties ahead. 39% of consumers said more of their everyday activities will be in person over the next five years. – She Rises : Consumers refuse to remain silent on gender inequality. Fair representation, equity, and inclusivity are at the forefront of women's purchase decisions. – The Thrivers : Fatigue is setting in as consumers navigate a chaotic world with exhaustion at an all-time high; they are putting personal needs above all else. 53% of consumers had a strict boundary between work or school and personal life in 2022. – Young and Disrupted : Gen Z stand up for their beliefs and put themselves out there. These consumers are immune to traditional advertising. Authenticity and social impact make a difference. ""The past few years have been anything but ordinary, and 2023 will be no exception"", says Alison Angus, Head of Innovation Practice at Euromonitor International. ""Companies should expect quite divergent behaviour as consumers cope with ongoing challenges while getting back in their stride."""
Clean beauty: A nebulous concept in search of a definition,"Originating well before the Covid-19 pandemic, the ""clean beauty"" movement has boomed with the consumer craze for natural and organic cosmetics, that would be respectful of health and of the environment. Both brands and retailers stand for this reassuring notion, which is also a possible way to win the favour of increasingly committed and uncompromising younger generations. Actually, the concept is promising at a time when the public is particularly attentive to what they apply to their bodies, and what they throw (or don't throw) in the trash, seeking out more natural ingredients, eco-responsible packaging, and transparency. The important fact remains that clean beauty is not yet defined. The notion appears to have come about in the 1990s, while the specific term emerged in the 2000s, at the same time as certain cosmetic brands became references in the field, such as Tata Harper, Drunk Elephant, and Goop, and specialised retailers such as Credo Beauty or The Detox Market. On the model of ""Clean Eating"", the concept tended to refer to cosmetics free from harmful or controversial ingredients, at a time when many American consumers – driven by public action groups such as the Environmental Working Group (EWG) – were wondering whether certain ingredients banned in Europe could be used in the United States. Indeed, the European regulation on cosmetic products [1] — usually presented as the strictest in the world – contains in its Annex 2 a list of prohibited ingredients and substances as long as your arm. Which is far from being the case in the United States. However, even in Europe, ingredients authorized by regulations are sometimes criticized. And to reassure consumers, some brands voluntarily blacklisting them from their formulas and those who claim to go the furthest in this direction then say they are ""clean"". And as everyone is confused, digital solutions such as Beautylitic and Clear Formula are helping brands and retailers to see things more clearly! And as we're still far from the total transparency much sought after, shoppers are also turning to digital apps. From Yuka to INCI Beauty to QuelCosmetic or Clean Beauty, there are countless solutions designed to analyse and evaluate the content of creams, scrubs, serums, makeup removers and the likes. But the apps themselves are struggling to keep up! Indeed, adding up complexity to the concept, Clean Beauty gradually took on a green hue… especially in Europe! As a result, more and more brands are now paying particular attention to the use of natural — sometimes organic — ingredients, and to the reduction of excess packaging. Solid cosmetics, refills and bulk buying, not to mention holistic beauty, are all trends that gravitate around the clean beauty concept. Despite this vagueness (or thanks to it), Clean Beauty has captivated people all over the world. It's clear that the pandemic has reinforced the appeal of natural and organic cosmetics, with a boom in green skincare. On Instagram, the term ""clean beauty"" has already resulted in nearly 6 million posts to date, while it has generated no less than a billion views on TikTok — not counting the many associated hashtags. This interest has already sparked many beauty trends, like the ""Clean Girl"" aesthetic, celebrating a minimalist routine, but also ""clean"" makeup. Today, there are few new skincare brands that do not claim to be clean, and clean perfumery is also taking off. As for heritage brands, they are slowly but surely reinventing their formulations to adapt to this demand. If a few private seals try to emerge, it is unlikely that the notion of Clean Beauty will ever be truly clarified. Actually let's not forget that ""to be unambiguous can only be to one's own detriment!"""
"Asia, the new promised land of alternative perfumery?","""Today, Asia is a bit like Russia in the 2000s, when By Kilian was a huge success. Similarly, this strong potential for niche brands can be found there, even if the market is not as accessible,"" explains David Frossard, the founder of Liquides and Différentes Latitudes. It is estimated that 2.5% of people wear perfume in China, a figure to be put in perspective with a population exceeding 1.4 billion people in 2022. ""It is a fast-growing market, with huge growth potential. Asia now accounts for 50% of global luxury sales. If China remains a key but still complex market, South Korea on the contrary is a captivating country, a trendsetter, with high purchasing power,"" explains Jean-Baptiste Roux, President, and co-founder of J.U.S, which opened its first corner store in the Lotte department store, in Seoul, last March. ""With a strong craze for beauty, Korea is a key market to access Asia,"" says Benoît Verdier, co-founder of Ex Nihilo. The brand is also present in Taiwan, with five POS and its own store. ""It's a more mature country, where prestige perfumes are appreciated, with a sophisticated clientele that travels a lot and has a very good standard of living,"" says the founder. He believes that Korea and Taiwan are two strategic countries for expanding in Asia, because ""Chinese people pay a lot of attention to them."" The Chinese market, of course, remains more coveted. Far from stereotypes, China has a fresh look on niche perfumery, with ""enthusiastic consumers, curious and fond of novelties"", explains Florence Bernardin, founder and manager of Asia Cosme Lab. Less aware of brand hierarchies, Chinese consumers are less ""formatted"", an opportunity for designers who can enjoy real freedom of tone. Apart from novelty, Ex Nihilo is focusing on authenticity, service and personalization to appeal to Chinese consumers. ""Consumers are ready to pay the price to have a rare and exclusive product. It's a younger consumer base, with more purchasing power than their elders, who want to assert themselves by breaking the codes,"" explains Sylvie Loday, co-founder and CEO of the brand. ""Even if China's appeal for perfume were to remain a niche, it would still be four times greater than other markets,"" says Philippe Solas, co-founder of Une Nuit Nomade. ""At a time when Russian, American, and European markets are experiencing difficulties, and the Middle East is a bit saturated, the Asian continent is synonymous with power and stability,"" he continues. Less difficult to penetrate than China, South Korea also suffered from strict confinement measures for two years. ""In this country, duty-free sales used to be very strong, but this trend was stopped along with Covid, and the end of tourist stops, while this practice represented 70% of brands' sales. The question is whether this ecosystem will return to normal or evolve into a new form,"" points out Sylvie Loday. ""But it is also one of the richest countries in the world, where there are no cultural barriers, and where a curious public enjoys consuming and exposing itself,"" explains David Frossard. A perfect setting for establishing the concept of Liquides in Seoul. Located in the golden triangle of Cheongdam, near the Dior and Vuitton boutiques, the ""perfume bar"" was created thanks to a partnership with the Hyundaï Group. It is also available in the form of seven shop-in-shop concepts in the Group's department stores and distributes brands such as BDK, Frapin, Obvious, and Carine Roitfeld. Meanwhile, China is increasing the number of obstacles to accessing its market. ""One of the main barriers to setting up a business is the registration formalities, which are costly and tedious,"" notes Jean-Baptiste Roux. ""This prerequisite, which can take almost a year, and cost 1,500 to 2,000 euros per product, has fortunately become more flexible since tests on animals are no longer compulsory,"" he continues. Apart from the administrative burden, ""it is a highly prized market for large groups, who spend huge amounts of money on rent, animations, and events. As a matter of fact, everything is expensive,"" adds Sylvie Loday. Another major difficulty is understanding the Chinese market ecosystem and knowing how to adjust its communication. ""It is crucial to propose a targeted storytelling, thought out beforehand, before establishing. A brand cannot simply think it will be enough to enter this market by imposing its vision of French luxury,"" insists Philippe Solas. ""It is a customer base unlike no other, which is self-sufficient from a digital point of view, and whose social networks must be conquered locally,"" analyses Benoît Verdier. To deal with the time-consuming formalities specific to the Chinese market, some brands resort to cross-border methods, like J.U.S or the brands sold by Liquides. ""Chinese consumers buy a lot online (50%), so we ship our products from France or a free zone, which allows us to sell and promote the brand,"" explains Jean-Baptiste Roux. Others favour a longer-term strategy. ""You have to start from scratch to set up in China,"" analyses Sylvie Loday. ""Online sales are very popular, like on sites such as Tmall. It's a tempting way in, but it's also a dangerous one, as it relies on numerous promotions and discounts. In the end, this can weaken the brand, because this customer base is very volatile. The use of digital marketing is of course impossible to avoid, but it is essential to combine it with a physical presence. You have to take the time to develop the brand in this new market, even if it means favouring neighbouring countries,"" adds the CEO of Ex Nihilo. This is a long-winded task that, according to Philippe Solas, also requires working with the right partner to get to grips with the specifics of the Chinese market. After an upstream analysis of the codes of the Chinese community, the brand Une Nuit Nomade recently sealed a partnership with the Centdegrès Agency to support its development. The brand has adopted a Chinese name that reflects its philosophy to align its communication with the Chinese market. The storytelling of some references has also been reworked. ""The nationalistic component in Chinese business is very important, and the community could very well, in the long term, focus solely on local brands. Hence the importance of having discourse and visuals adapted to its culture, thanks in particular to the expertise of an agency like Centdegrès,"" analyses the head of Une Nuit Nomade. Diptyque has successfully established itself in China over the long term, after opening its first outlet in 2014. The brand has managed to make its mark by enhancing its know-how and enriching its offer with details adapted to the local culture, without abandoning its identity. Just like L'Artisan Parfumeur, which has based its success in China on limited editions for the Chinese New Year. While the complexity of a market such as China can be a hindrance, other Asian countries offer good prospects. This is the case of Japan, which is very attractive according to David Frossard, because its customers - who have long been considered as not very receptive to perfume - are fond of trendy and creative concepts, and therefore very open to alternative brands. To be continued."
How TikTok disrupts traditional perfume codes,"Far from the dreamy and fantasised universe often put forward by brands, on TikTok, content creators openly talk about perfumes, often with marked opinions, and make fun of the supposed seductive powers of juices. They describe with a great deal of spontaneity and authenticity the scent, the colour, they share childhood memories, and sometimes stories (hashtag #perfumehistory has nearly five million views), far from the codes of the category, disregarding traditional segmentations and traditional retailing channels. TikTok's video format takes perfume into a new visual universe with bottles put forward by content creators who are in constant competition and completely disconnected from brand communication issues. Under the hashtags related to perfume, there are mostly videos of reviews of various fragrances, highlighting their key notes and the praises or successes they brought to the nose or the creator of the video. There are also a number of Top 5s and Top 10s along with every possible type of ranking. One of the recent trends is to display one's perfume collection in a video: the hashtag #perfumecollection has now reached 373 million views! Hence, many users like to share their passion for perfume and present, bottle after bottle, their collection, or show their collections, with products sometimes classified according to the shade of the bottle or the juice. Colour plays a key role in this media where attention must be caught in a few seconds. It's not surprising after all that TikTok likes red, which gives videos an immediate sparkle! Tom Ford's ""Lost Cherry"" (18.3 million views), Givenchy's ""L'Interdit Rouge"", Jo Malone's ""Scarlet Poppy"" (11k views) and Baccarat's ""Rouge 540"" (194.3 million views) are all widely promoted by the platform's active perfume fans. This is also the reason for the success of perfumes with sculptural and spectacular bottles, such as those by Paco Rabanne or Carolina Herrera. TikTok is also bringing miniatures back into fashion, with 3.4 million views for the hashtag #MiniaturePerfumes. This is an opportunity for users to highlight their favourite miniature vials. The power of the social network can also help reshuffle the deck in a world where brand awareness is a major asset. As in other beauty categories, a video that goes viral with powerful emotional content can boost sales of an otherwise unknown fragrance. One of the most famous examples being the sudden success of Missing Person, from the US brand Phlur, created by influencer Christelle Lim. On TikTok, unlike most commercials, the focus is on the scents and - above all - the impact they produce. People talk about the emotions they trigger, the memories they bring to mind, the substances they recall. Perfume ingredients are more rarely mentioned, except when they clearly emerge from the fragrance. The social network has also become an important vector for the dissemination of new gestures. The most striking example is certainly that of layering. Common in the Middle East, this practice - which consists of applying layers of different perfumes - has long struggled to spread to other markets. On TikTok, the hashtag #layeringperfumes now has more than 363 million views, and is teeming with videos of users revealing their current combinations, like @rebeccazeidenberg94, who suggests, for example, combining for an evening, two drops of Shaghaf Oud, by Swiss Arabian, with a spray of L'Interdit Rouge by Givenchy. The same female tiktoker also proposes to combine one's fragrances with vintage handbags... But TikTok is not only disrupting the category's traditional communication and practices. On their favourite network, the Gen Z is also on the hunt for perfume ""dupes"" (i.e. duplicates, products with characteristics similar to those of other more expensive products). The hashtag #perfumedupes has crossed the 114 million views mark. For instance, a significant number of videos with tens of millions of views compare certain perfumes from Zara with the much more expensive products of selective perfumery brands. A trend that can only encourage the common - and often criticised - practice in the perfumery world of using best-selling juices as inspiration to launch similar fragrances. But on this subject, where there is a fine line between inspiration and imitation, comparison and parasitism, and where the industry has for years fought the practice of correlation tables, brands are both cautious and suspicious: delighted when they benefit from a flattering comparison, much less when their sales suffer from it. However, the craze for perfume dupes should not lead us to believe that investment in innovation, creativity and brand image has become futile. The perfume story on TikTok serves as a reminder of the extent to which emotion is a powerful sales vector, and that it must above all be based on values of sincerity and authenticity."
"Wrinkles, imperfections, firmness: Skincare leads the way in beauty trends","The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly changed beauty habits, but it's not the only factor at play. Social networks — TikTok and Instagram in the lead — have quickly become major trendsetters, whether in skincare or makeup. However, while users are having a blast sharing increasingly elaborate beauty looks and techniques, it's skincare that's really appealing to people on a daily basis. The goal is to achieve a flawless complexion to avoid having to apply endless layers of makeup. On TikTok, the #skincare hashtag already has some 138 billion views, reflecting the public's infatuation with skincare, especially among younger people. It is now a question of structuring beauty routines around prevention, whether to get rid of imperfections, or to protect skin from pollution or the harmful effects of UV rays. The focus is on tailor-made skincare products based on effective and natural ingredients, based on the concept of holistic beauty, which encompasses cosmetics and wellness. Wrinkles, blemishes and sagging skin seem to be of particular concern to consumers around the world, regardless of their age. According to the first ever Beauty Trends Report from the beauty platform LookFantastic [1], salicylic acid was the most popular beauty ingredient of 2022. The ingredient was the subject of an average of 60,500 searches per month, and its hashtag had no less than 370 million views on TikTok at the end of 2022. Consumers aim to camouflage wrinkles, fine lines and dark circles, but also to fight against sagging skin. As such, collagen was the second most popular ingredient, with more than 60,000 monthly searches on average, and nearly 2 billion views on TikTok in 2022. It was followed by retinol (49,500 searches, 2.4 billion views); hyaluronic acid (49,500 searches, 760 million views), which is popular as an anti-wrinkle ingredient; and vitamin C (49,500 searches, 2 billion views), which is a major ally for dull and acne-prone skin. Throughout the year, TikTok has become the new incubator of beauty trends, allowing users to express their creativity. Countless techniques have made their 'appearance' on the social media site in 2022, starting with 'brow lamination,' the most popular beauty trend of the year with no less than 49,500 monthly searches, on average, and a hashtag viewed 1.5 billion times. The focus of this technique is getting perfectly shaped and especially full, bushy eyebrows, so you don't have to use makeup to fill them in. This beauty treatment comes ahead of other, such as microblading (49,500 searches, 2.9 billion views), eyelash serums (12,100 searches, 530 million views), and 'soap brows' (12,100 searches, 350 million views). Generally speaking, it seems that the most popular beauty techniques are those that seek to reduce the time spent in the bathroom, as well as the layers of makeup used to compensate for what can be perceived as 'flaws.' But TikTok is not only a trendsetter. The social network can also send the popularity of certain beauty brands soaring. This is the case of Charlotte Tilbury which, although already successful before the TikTok era, is now the most popular brand on the media. The brand saw no less than 450,000 monthly searches in 2022, while its hashtag has been viewed 1.7 billion times. The same goes for The Ordinary, the most popular skincare brand of the 2022, according to LookFantastic. According to the report from the British platform, the brand is the subject of an average 135,000 monthly searches, and its hashtag has no less than 2 billion views on TikTok."
The age of connection: 5 predictions for 2023 and beyond,"According to the beauty trends agency, consumers are discovering strengths that they never knew they had. They are more resilient, more adaptable and more connected than they ever realised. And if recent global events have proven anything, it is that health, freedom, and the future of the planet are all deeply interwoven. The success of one relies on the success of another. ""Our future is symbiotic. And yet, the desire for individual recognition and expression remains a prescient driver. As we move forward, consumers will continue to explore the special tension that exists between collective responsibility and personal growth, and between the quest for the optimised self and for globalised empathy,"" explains Leila Rochet, Chief Innovation Officer, Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation. Armed with increased knowledge, consumers will drive brands even harder to alter their behaviours in order to support rigorous ethical practices. In 2023 brands must become empathetic ambassadors, and respond to a new generation of eco-socio intellectuals. Results from the 2022 UEBT Biodiversity Barometer demonstrate there is now a global consensus that while planetary health is a clear priority in the minds of consumers, so are issues surrounding workers' rights and equality. Sustainability issues are now rightly being understood in the context of wider geo-political events. French brand Eclo, for instance, only works with ingredients that are local to its Brittany HQ and which also help regenerate the soil and the seabed. Taking a collective responsibility approach, Indigenous-owned brands often balance respect for nature with individual growth. Operating within this type of intrinsically holistic value system The Yukon Soaps Company thus uses native, wild botanicals hand-picked by elders and local young people. The brand teaches harvesting practices that foster an emotional connection to the land. Gen Z's takeover of social media has created a space where niche is the norm, and micro-expressions are the new mainstream. This mindset shapes a new generation of beauty connoisseurs, who bring a fine art approach and an exacting attitude to the beauty sphere. As consumer confidence grows and their skills continue to develop thanks to the TikTok explosion, we see a growing desire to express individuality through exquisite artistry. Brands that speak to individuality and trigger creativity through wild innovation will gain traction. Harry Styles's Pleasing inspires consumers to master micro-artistry, coupled with an approach that is embracive of every identity. Its ultra-inclusive storytelling paves the way for a ""Flat Age Society"" where traditional age segmentation has diminishing influence. Pleasing also encapsulates another key element - escapism. Younger generations are facing global challenges with a practical mindset, leaning into science and technology to forge world-changing solutions. STEM careers (science, technology, engineering and maths) are now the #1 attraction for Gen Z, according to a recent study, with particular popularity among females and people of colour. Brands must embrace this appetite for innovation. Combining their experiences at Tesla and the École Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne (ECAL), Aeir founders have created a new generation fragrance. More brands invest in bio-sciences to deliver smart, and green, solutions. In 2022 we saw Ulé (France) and Monday Musem (South Korea) lead the way with the adoption of vertical farming techniques. We are entering an era of intimately adaptive beauty that responds to the individual or is tailored specifically for individual needs. The continued fetishization of health and immunity will drive the creation of unexpected territories, ushering in new opportunities for beauty supplements, skin-optimising trackers, AI-aided personalization, and at-home beauty devices that deliver ultra-bespoke and professional results. In fact, consumer interest in beauty tech is set to continue to increase continuously over the next five years, reaching $8.93 billion by 2026. Beauty that delivers emotional benefits on top of functional benefits will gain traction, as consumers look to balance feelings of vulnerability with products and experiences that simultaneously provide care and protection. The role of functional fragrances will become heightened, as consumers and brands explore the idea that perfume can deliver benefits that go way beyond scent. This is an idea explored by American light artist James Turrell who has developed a collection of crystal light panels and perfumes for Lalique, which play on the abstract concept of the light we see in our dreams. Beauty imbued with cerebral and cognitive influence will play to the growing brain care category. Brain health supplements are forecast to grow at a CAGR of 8.3% from 2022 to 2030, as consumers explore new routes to optimise mind-care. Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation will explore these key trends in details at their Inspiration Bar and the Beauty Talks hosted by Leila Rochet during the next edition of MakeUp in Los Angeles, on February 16 & 17 2023.

PSYCARE: The emergence of a new beauty category,"""As mental health issues increasingly affect consumers worldwide, PSYCARE will eventually evolve into a beauty category of its own,"" says Michael Nolte, SVP Creative Director at Beautystreams, adding: ""In the beauty industry, we have the unique opportunity to bring moments of joy and a piece of mind to the lives of many individuals."" As one response to the ""perma-crisis,"" consumers seek out beauty and personal care that offer an experience which is more profound and which goes beyond the aesthetic, amplifying the effects of the time that they spend on themselves. They're interested in beauty products and routines that can enhance their well-being, improve their psychological health, address stress, and quiet a racing mind. According to a survey released in January 2022, when asked ""what areas will be important to you in the next 12 months?"" the most common answer was ""mental wellness,"" chosen by 65% of respondents. Meanwhile, ""stress management/relaxation/sleep"" was the fourth most-popular response, highlighted by 59% of those surveyed. This prioritizing of mental health is translating into a holistic approach to beauty, as brands actively seek to lift consumers' mood and spirit. Brands tap into treatments that draw on ancestral and holistic medicine – cue adaptogenic herbs or taking inspiration from the phases of the moon – to create a feeling of well-being and being grounded in one's body. Loneliness, too, is transforming from a taboo topic into an issue that's being directly addressed, whether through purposefully building a community around a brand or crafting scents that can positively impact one's emotional state. Beauty routines are a powerful ally in helping perpetually distracted consumers to focus on themselves, via rituals and self-care treatments that create a moment of relaxation. In a bid to weave together the aesthetic, physical, and psychological spheres, beauty brands are emphasizing treatments and products that soothe both the body and mind. These concepts often draw on traditional remedies and ancient wisdom, thereby linking the consumer – and the brand – to something larger that transcends time, that has a resonance beyond the individual. Depending on the slant taken, this can bring an almost spiritual dimension to a treatment, creating a feeling of healing on every level. One potential source of that emotional support is psychedelics, which are creating a buzz in mental health for their potential in treating myriad psychological conditions. There's also scope for them to make their way into beauty and wellness. From skin and personal care via color cosmetics, men's grooming, and fragrance to hair care, all beauty categories will be driven by the PSYCARE movement in the upcoming years, confirming the beauty industry's essential social function. More than just a superficial fix, make-up and hair color are important factors contributing to mental well-being. Color can directly affect our brains, and the concept of ""dopamine color,"" already trending in fashion and interior design, will increasingly find its way into the beauty color categories, as well. For many consumers putting on make-up or coloring their hair is turning into a mindful self-care routine. Skin and personal care will continue to evolve towards well-being rituals. While the categories are expected to remain functional and results-oriented for most of the time, consumers will also use them as a vehicle for momentary premium body and skin rituals on weekends and special occasion to celebrate mental well-being or to simply forget their stressful lives for just a moment. The role of fragrance also gradually evolves. While previously, comparable to fashion, the main functions of fine fragrance were self-expression and social status, over the last years the role of fragrance evolved towards feel-good moments and psychological well-being. This explains the rising demand for home fragrance and niche fragrance brands. Today, showing off a social status through fashion or perfume is considered indelicate. New essential functions of premium perfumes are to feel in harmony with oneself and to boost mental wellness and self-confidence. A special symposium dedicated to PSYCARE on January 31, 2023 Beautystreams will explore how PSYCARE will influence the skin care, color cosmetics, hair care, and fragrance categories for an entire afternoon.

Trends: 'Status skin' is the minimalist beauty routine getting love on TikTok,"The pandemic put a stop to the use of contouring products and high-coverage foundations. And if some people thought that the return to normal life would mean the return of full makeup, it's clear that skincare was the star of 2022, and it's a trend that's only just beginning. For proof, look no further than 'status skin,' a beauty trend on the rise on social networks, characterized by a combination of makeup and skincare. The aim is to let skin breathes, and to highlight it, rather than camouflage what have been referred to as 'imperfections' in the past. Many beauty micro-trends emphasized a natural approach over the last year, but this time it's about reintroducing makeup into one's routine without overdoing it. 'Status skin' is still based on looking after one's skin, and especially on prevention, in order to enjoy a healthy complexion without having to resort to a slew of various concealers, foundations, and contouring products. Moreover, it's no longer a question of hiding dark circles, bags and other pimples with multiple layers of covering products… In terms of beauty routines, this translates into essential skincare products, including serums, to create a healthy glow, as well as tinted moisturizers or creams. Forget about mattifying and high-coverage foundations, and focus on light, sheer and airy textures that will provide a discreetly sunkissed look. The goal is to highlight the skin, not to camouflage it under layers of makeup. This is reminiscent of the BB and CC cream era, except that the level of skincare has gone up a notch with multifunctional products that will perform several roles — makeup, moisturizing and anti-aging, for example. This trend also puts an emphasis on facial massages of all kind, whether known for their anti-aging benefits like Kobido, or for boosting radiance in one's complexion, as well as on tools that allow beauty fans to enjoy their benefits at home. Gua sha, jade roller, massage roller, and ice globes are progressively becoming bathroom essentials... But if there is one particular market that is growing at a rapid pace, it is that of facial massagers. These tools, which can combine massages, skin cleansing, light therapy treatments, and anti-aging treatments, are a hot commodity among appearance-conscious consumers. Not only do they provide the skin with the care it needs on a daily basis, but they have also been designed to offer users a moment of relaxation. This famous all-in-one product seems to be a favourite of those looking for a holistic approach. Complexions aren't the only body part that will benefit from high attention in 2023, as hair is also set to be pampered with a complete routine modelled on that of skin. Scrubs, anti-blemish treatments, exfoliating brushes, nightly treatments, exfoliating shampoos, and micellar shampoos will be among the year's beauty essentials. In 2023, prevention has grown more important than ever when it comes to beauty, as it is designed to allow for an increasingly minimalist and natural routine."
France: how solid cosmetics are gaining ground in beauty hygiene departments,"Before 2019, there were almost no references of solid cosmetics in supermarkets. Three years later, the situation has changed a lot, with a rise in value of +17%. This increase can be explained by the arrival of beauty giants on this segment, like Garnier, Dop (L'Oréal), Nature Box (Henkel), but also Nivea (Beiersdorf), Sanex (Colgate-Palmolive), or Corinne de Farme (Sarbec). ""As a leading brand in our industry, it seemed essential to help democratize this new, more responsible beauty gesture and support our consumers in adopting it"", explains Stéphanie Borri, General Manager of Garnier France. ""7.5% of French people purchased solid cosmetics at least once in 2021, compared to 1% in 2019,"" adds Anaïs Dupuy, Expert Hygiene Beauty at Kantar. In France, the solid cosmetics turnover reaches 85.5 million euros now (from November 2021 to October 2022), and the market share amounts to about 1.5% and 0.2%, exclusive of soap (source: IRI for all supermarket channels - exclusive of toothpaste and roll-on deodorants). ""Solid hair products represent slightly less than 13% in terms of market share. They are followed by face care products, with 2.1%, and preceded by soap, with 83.4%,"" says Valérie Locci, Key Account Manager at IRI. ""If soap is excluded, haircare is clearly a market driver, compared to other, niche categories in supermarkets, like shaving, bath/shower products, and deodorants"", she adds. Still, these figures should be qualified, since the institute excludes ""green roll-on deodorants (cardboard, refillable)"" from their calculations, so their weight is ""probably under-represented"". This appetite for solid products is confirmed by Anaïs Dupuy: ""Haircare products, in particular shampoo, were great recruiters in 2021, with +6.5 points, compared to +2.4 points in 2019. Consumers now dedicate 25% of their global shampoo budget to solid shampoo, which just shows how this new gesture is becoming a buying pattern"". And yet, solid cosmetics have not always had such a good reputation. ""They are not convenient, they make no foam, they do not clean well, they make the hair feel like straw, etc.,"" explains Laure Favre, co-founder [1] of the new brand beaudy. And yet, according to her, the demand for clean and responsible solid cosmetics is extremely high – hence the importance of innovative formulas. Is this the end of solid shampoos floating in their cups after use? Brands have rivalled with ingenuity to make the solid product gesture playful and accessible: suction cups to hold the products, nets to completely finish them, pretty waterproof travel kits… Everything should be well-thought-out to seduce consumers and make them feel like testing them. And it works! ""50% of our turnover is now achieved with repurchase"", says Sarah Pouchet, co-founder of Unbottled, which released a solid waterproof makeup remover a few weeks ago, along with reusable wipes. ""Brands' enthusiasm for solid cosmetics confirms they have grown aware of the ecological urgency: this is conveyed by their reducing the use of plastic in packaging, but also of water, which can represent up to 80% in a cosmetic formula"", emphasizes Sophie Lauret, the founder of Comme Avant. ""However, I am a bit less enthusiastic about the composition, although we have always been irreproachable. We based our brand on this essential value: a clean composition to preserve the whole family's health,"" she adds. ""Many brands have been emerging on all channels, and solid cosmetics have found their own place in supermarkets. The general public is gradually seizing this opportunity, which makes the segment grow,"" sums up Valérie Locci, IRI. The profile of solid shampoo buyers is actually far from the usual Parisians with a ""Bobo style"". ""It is close to that of liquid shampoo buyers, whether in terms of sociodemographics, age, or social class,"" explains Anaïs Dupuy. The brands surveyed confirm rather broad a consumer profile: mainly women between 30 and 50 who purchase products for themselves and their own family, almost everywhere across France. ""At Lamazuna, we have a fan base which accounts for about 20% of our turnover. However, we have noticed consumers have been fluctuating since before 2019, which can definitely be explained by the abundance of today's offering. They feel like testing several brands, which is only logical,"" explains Laëtitia Van De Walle, the founder of the solid cosmetics pioneer brand in France. In 2022, Garnier Ultradoux even launched a new solid reference, this time for children: an apricot and cotton flower shampoo. ""Offering a solid range with no plastic waste was an additional step in our commitment for greener, more sustainable beauty. It is also an answer to our consumers' expectations,"" explains Stéphanie Borri. She revealed to us that there are ongoing projects for the Fructis brand. ""The fact that this new galenic form is increasingly present in supermarkets, while until now, it had usually been available in organic stores, from the selective distribution, and online, reminds of the craze for organic products a few years ago,"" foresees Anaïs Dupuy. Distribution is also diversifying in city centres. After joining the Sephora network in early 2022, Unbottled has just opened a first store in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris, 60 Rue Vieille du Temple. This choice was carefully thought out. According to Sarah Pouchet, it can be explained by two parameters: e-commerce hidden costs and consumers' need for in-store experiences. ""Today, to get traffic online, you need to spend a tremendous amount of money. To me, there is a reverse movement slowly growing in this sector, which consists in reviewing one's vision of retail to get back to physical stores. In addition, contrary to what can often be heard, consumers do not feel like staying behind their screens. They do like visiting stores to get a unique experience, and that is what we provide them with this new shop: testing this new gesture related to solid cosmetics consumption, before buying it"", explains the creator. Of course, meanwhile, the brand takes care of its e-commerce customers. Next year, they will launch the website in several languages to virtually pass the French borders. This data seems pretty encouraging for a very young market which has only started to diversify!"
"Sales of refillable perfumes and cosmetics are booming in France, NPD finds","As brands strive to reduce their environmental footprint, bulk sales and refill solutions are mushrooming in the beauty market. And all retail channels are involved, including in premium and luxury ones. And the proposal seems to appeal to French consumers! Indeed, sales of refills and rechargeable products in the prestige channel increased by 50% between January and end of October 2022, compared to the same period in the previous year, found The NPD Group. This segment, estimated at 158 million euros during this 10-month period, thus achieved a performance dramatically higher than that of the whole prestige beauty market, which grew by 20% between January and the end of October 2022, compared to 2021. The market research company earlier noted a similar shift in the first seven months of 2022 in the United Kingdom. ""Consumers being more and more sensitive to sustainable development issues and aware of the influence they exert, we are logically seeing an increase in sales of rechargeable selective beauty products"", explains Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. It is in the perfume category that the refill option is the most developed, notes The NPD Group. In France, sales of refillable perfume bottles jumped 56% year-to-date to October 2022 compared to the previous year. ""The expansion of the refillable offer contributes to this good momentum: three perfumes, out of the five most successful launches of the period, are sold in a refillable format,"" emphasizes the The NPD Group. As far as refill is concern, France leads the way: refills and rechargeable products represent 8% of sales in the perfume category in France, compared to 6% in Europe, and 3% in North America. Actually refilling one's perfume is not a new practice for French consumers. Several brands that are iconic of the French fragrance heritage - such as Caron, Guerlain or Goutal - offer a refilling service in their own shops, as was done historically. In multi-brand retail shops, the possibility to refill one's fragrance was inaugurated with the launch of Angel by Thierry Mugler in 1992. ""Today, several technical solutions are available to perfumery brands,"" noted Gerald Martines, creator of the packaging development consulting agency In•Signes, during the Fragrance Innovation Summit. ""Depending on the technological choice, and the level of service desired, refilling can be carried out in retail shops or at home, with or without dismantling the pump. Recently, Interparfums has introduced for Moncler a concept that allows to retain the exterior packaging while the glass bottle itself is replaced."" Refills and rechargeable options are also meeting huge success in the make-up category. According to The NPD Group, sales were up 122%, between January and the end of October 2022 compared to 2021 in the prestige channel. Although they represent only 2% of sales in the category, rechargeable makeup products open up new prospects for brands and distributors. When it comes to skincare, the market is still in its infancy. Only 1% of high-end skincare sales concern rechargeable products and their refills. But the potential is huge, according to The NPD Group, which notes that during the first ten months of the year, sales of refills jumped 46%, while those of rechargeable products increased by 30%. In this category, refills are potentially an important driver of consumer loyalty. Repurchase is indeed a key issue, since it is obvious that refillable cosmetics only have a positive environmental impact when they are actually refilled! From this point of view, ""there is still road a long way to go"", emphasizes Mathilde Lion. Actually, refills currently represent only 2% of perfume sales, and grew by 21% compared to last year, a significant slower rate than that of refillable bottles. ""New fragrances that were launched with a refillable version must be given time to grow a loyal customer base and this will take several months. On the other hand, we are now identifying growth opportunities on the launch of refillable versions for the market's main flagship fragrances which have been able to demonstrate their ability to build loyalty for years,"" she concludes. While the success of refills can logically be explained by consumers' growing interest in products with a reduced environmental footprint, there are still many hurdles to overcome. According Gerald Martines, ""loyalty is a real paradigm shift in a market that has built its growth model on the multiplication of launches and the encouragement of experimentation"". Other difficulties, such as the proliferation of references linked to refills, and therefore a problem of space in points of sale, add up to make the shift even harder. Coming on the heels of the craze for solid and bulk cosmetics, the success of refills confirms consumer interest in products and practices that are more environmental-friendly!"
Who were the most powerful beauty influencers of 2022?,"According to the first Beauty Trends Report by online beauty retailer LookFantastic [1], American makeup artist and social media star Mikayla Jane Nogueira seems to have found the perfect formula to share her passion for beauty products, resulting in her becoming the most popular influencer of the year 2022. Both humorous and frank, her posts are winning over followers all over the world, to the point that the young woman is the subject of 2,400 monthly searches on average. Search interest for her name has jumped by 1275% in just one year. With more than 13.8 million followers on TikTok, Mikayla Nogueira is a little less popular on Instagram with 'only' 490,000 followers. But it should be noted that this is an unauthenticated account through which the social networking star only shares personal posts. Her professional account, Beauty by Mikayla Jane, counts over 2.4 million followers. And that's not all, since the makeup artist is regularly quoted in the media for her innovative techniques and tips and is at the origin of many beauty trends such as the 'sticky method,' just to name one. This kind of media coverage contributes to elevating the makeup artist's status to that of the most powerful beauty influencers in the world. In second place is London-based Nigerian social media star Uche Natori, who, although not as well-known as her counterpart, is one of the beauty influencers to follow very closely in the coming months. Famous for her perfect foundation — she refers to herself as ""the base queen"" — the young woman counts 300,000 followers on Instagram, nearly 160,000 on TikTok, is also present on YouTube, and has been the subject of 2,400 searches on average per month, as much as Mikayla. The top places in this ranking of the most popular female influencers of the year are rounded out by American Meredith Duxbury (1,900 monthly searches, 16.2 million followers on TikTok), Danielle Marcan (720 monthly searches, 3.4 million followers), and Tammi Clarke (480 monthly searches, 560,000 followers). When it comes to celebrity influencers (referring to those who were already famous before making a foray into the beauty scene) who dominate the world of makeup, this time, it's Kylie Jenner, no surprises there, who has risen to the top rank in 2022. The former reality TV star is simply unstoppable on social media, with no fewer than 376 million followers on Instagram (and that's not counting the people who follow her countless cosmetic and fashion brands). Meanwhile the hashtag #kyliejennermakeup alone has generated 255 million views on TikTok to date. Another star who launched her own skincare brand in 2022, Hailey Bieber is the second most popular makeup celebrity influencer in the world. Some 50 million people now follow her on Instagram, while the hashtag #haileybiebermakeup is responsible for 209 million views on TikTok. She is ahead of actress Alexa Demie, star of the series ""Euphoria,"" whose makeup inspirations have been seen more than 80 million times on TikTok, Madison Beer (65 million views), and, coming in last in this Top 5, Kim Kardashian, whose influence, it should be said, goes far beyond the field of makeup and beauty."
Trends: 'Skin flooding' or the art of skincare layering,"'Skin flooding,' as the name suggests, involves applying different layers of hydration to damp skin to maximize the effects of each product and to limit water loss, one of the causes of skin dehydration. The 'skin flooding' technique has so far generated very few views on TikTok, for the simple reason that its name was coined by the magazine Refinery29, which regularly tests new beauty trends spotted on the social network. However, the tip can be seen in many videos under the hashtags #dryskintips and #dryskinremedies, among others. The method can vary from user to user, but in all cases, it involves applying two serums to the skin, one after the other, the first containing hyaluronic acid and the second containing niacinamide. The objective is to deeply moisturize the skin, reduce redness and tightness, and help protect against further external aggression. The final step is the application of a thicker layer of moisturizer to nourish the skin's surface. Importantly, the first serum must be applied to damp skin, which should not be fully dried after cleansing, to help boost the absorption of the products to come. The many videos of this beauty trick feature several variations. For example, those who wish to can step up their 'skin flooding' experience by spritzing their face with a moisturizing mist between each step, a trick that could ensure extra hydration, say some TikTokers. It's also possible to add a moisturizer with sun protection to protect the skin from UV rays. This trend confirms the current global interest in skincare, which has been reflected throughout 2022 by the launch of new brands based on natural skincare. This trend is expected to grow even more in 2023 with the boom in holistic beauty, focused on prevention, well-being and skin health."
"Beauty Pie unveils top makeup, skincare, body and hair care trends for 2023","After having crunched numbers from Google [1], the British brand identified five haircare trends among the top 10 beauty trends, three skincare and two makeup trends. According to Beauty Pie, Butterfly haircuts have seen popularity spike by a +12,432% in the run up to 2023, suggesting it'll be one trend that's set to dominate next year. So what's all the hype about? A haircut that combines short layers with long layers for added dimension, movement and body. The benefit of the short, wispy layers is that they directly hit the chin and jawline to frame face and contour the face. The octopus haircut is a heavily-textured look that uses shorter layers on top, while thinner, longer lengths of hair are styled from underneath - which (very subtly) resembles the shape of an octopus. The octopus haircut is said to be an evolution of the mullet. This trend is really a mixture of trends, like 2014's soft pale grunge and balletcore. It's all about embracing 'hyperfeminity' and it takes us straight back to the early 2010s; think Lana Del Ray style eye-liner and girly pink blush. Popularity for this style of makeup has skyrocketed by 1,690% in the run up to 2023, according to Beauty Pie. The jellyfish haircut, a blunt bob with a mullet, takes fourth place, seeing a 1,185% increase in searches ahead of 2023. This style of haircut is inspired by the traditional Japanese princess cut – the top layer is cut shorter in a head-hugging layer, with longer lengths around the perimeter and Nicole Kidman has been reported to have been spotted with this new edgy look. Chebula is touted as one of the most powerful antioxidants in the world. It fights fine lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen production to serve up smoother, stronger skin. It also helps to regulate pigmentation and minimise inflammation. No wonder this skincare super ingredient has seen popularity rise by close to 1,000%. Peptide-powered lip treatments have seen popularity increase by over 400%, according to Beauty Pie, who spot themas one of the biggest beauty trends of 2023. Peptide lip treatments are a restorative method to create naturally plump and soft lips, whilst also minimising the appearance of fine lines. This skincare trend offers to smother the face in an occlusive moisturiser like petroleum jelly before bed to wake up to glowing skin. The trend has long been a practice that's featured in K-Beauty routines, and with searches increasing by 392% ahead of 2023, it looks like is set to be a massive trend to try. Driven by a love for 90s and 00s nostalgia, the spiky bun is back. This is a high bun with an ultra sleek finish. Spotted on Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner, the spiky bun has officially kicked the messy bun off its pedestal. It's easy to create, looks effortlessly chic and tonnes of tutorial videos are already available on social media. Another animal-inspired hair trend that Beauty Pie predicts to spike in 2023 is the wolf cut, which has been searched for globally 135% more than last year thanks to stars like Miley Cyrus rocking the do at one of her gigs. A rounded, wide eye look that's increased in popularity by 122% in the run up to 2023. It's a more innocent than sultry look - doe eyes are doll-like and they make eyes look larger and brighter. The trend's soft nature also offers some flexibility when attempting to recreate the style, with mascara being the key tool."
"Hygiene: Will climate concern fuel the ""unwashed"" trend?","According to a recent study by Ifop, three-quarters of French people (76%) say they wash thoroughly every day, as do their German neighbours (77%), but more that Brits (68%) and much more than Italians (53%). However, this daily shower weighs on energy bills and has a real environmental impact. According to the French Water Information Centre (Centre d'information sur l'eau - Cieau) laboratory, each shower requires about 57 litres of water, or almost 40% of a French person's total daily consumption. In addition, this water needs to be heated, which requires a significant amount of energy. As Europe faces soaring energy costs, some are questioning: Is it really necessary to shower every day? A question that echoes the unwashed trend, which recommends washing less in order to preserve the balance of the skin and scalp, and take care of their respective microbiomes. ""We don't have to wash our head to toe every day,"" states Marie Jourdan, a dermatologist in Paris. The skin is a living organ that renews itself: ""It cleans itself,"" explains a member of the French Society of Dermatology (SFD). The surface of the skin is covered with an emulsion of water and oil that forms a hydrolipidic film, and the first line of defence against infectious agents and pollution. This film is also essential in preventing dehydration. ""The skin is an ecosystem like any other and its balance must be preserved,"" stresses Dr. Marie Jourdan. If the skin is ""overloaded external stresses"" such as pollution or sweat, it needs to be cleaned. But as a general rule, ""using soap on a daily to wash the areas where perspiration is the most greasy, which are prone to bacterial colonization, such as underarms, toes, or private parts, with heavy, oily sweat is enough,"" she explains. Conversely, ""too frequent washing can create dryness and eczema,"" she adds. Since the 19th century and the work of Louis Pasteur, we have known that washing kills most of the bacteria that cause infections. But today, ""in our medical practices, we see many people who wash themselves too much, several times a day, often out of fear of viruses,"" reports Laurence Netter, a dermatologist and venereologist in Paris. ""The risk is to alter the surface hydrolipidic film that allows the skin to stay naturally healthy,"" she continues. Dermatologists therefore recommend focusing on areas where germs and sweat nest, using minimal detergents or foaming agents that attack the skin. ""If we practice this hygiene and shower every two or three days, it's not a problem, unless we sweat a lot or play sports,"" Lawrence Netter says. ""It's also great for adjusting to good hygiene, healthy skin and low energy consumption,"" she said. As far as bathing is concerned, just forget it. It can swallow 150 to 200 litres of water. And if it is associated with a moment of relaxation, it is often too hot or too long, which dries out the skin without balancing the composition of the epidermis. Born in the United States ten years ago, the ""unwashed"" trend once made the headlines after the lockdowns that marked the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Through the pandemic period, women chose to wash their hair less frequently, down almost 10% over five years to 2.8 times per week on average, highlighted Kantar in April. A shift in consumer behaviour which has resulted, for the hair care market, in a reduction in volumes in favour of a premiumisation of the market. And despite falling usage, sales of hair conditioners and treatments grew in value, generating 5% growth in 2020 (compared to 2019), and 7% growth in 2021 (compared to 2020). However, the evolution of hygiene practices depends on many factors and ecological motivations can take very different forms. A recent Opinionway survey thus showed a generational divide in France, with young people preferring to adopt new purchasing practices towards products deemed to be more eco-friendly, rather than changing their habits."
Three key skincare trends spotted at Cosmoprof Asia Singapore 2022,"Minimally invasive beauty was one of the most visible trends at the trade fair - and a key trend highlighted by trend forecaster Beautystreams in its Cosmoprof Asia 2022 Trends report. The trend encompasses highly sophisticated cosmeceuticals that promise to keep face and skin looking younger for longer, delaying the need for actual invasive beauty treatments such as plastic surgery. This new generation of functional face care is based on the latest biotechnological advances featuring innovations like freeze-dryed actives (to improve stability), cutting-edge delivery systems to allow ingredients to penetrate more deeply into the skin than ever, skin boosters that have a filler-like effect or self-dissolving micro-needle patches. Singapore brand Invity's SuperNAD Youth Activating Sheet Mask, for example, is described as the world's first sheet mask to contain the cell-energising molecule NAD (Nicotinamide Adenosine Dinucleotide). And Korean brand Coscoco new Medipair Collagen Veil Ampoule treatment kit contains five ampoules with a bioactive collagen booster said to improve skin health. Cellicon Lab's latest face care launches are based on the cell-to-cell DermiShuttle delivery system said to increase the efficacy of its cosmetic actives. The brand's new PermeaCell Lifting Kit combines freeze-dried powdered ingredients that are ""activated"" with a liquid ampoule. And Dermafirm's RX Melavita-C Exosome Cream is a brightening cream formulated with seven skin-boosting ingredients and a liposome-based delivery technology. Dissolving micro-needle patches are another interesting ingredient delivery system. In this face care technology, the active ingredients are manufactured into ultra-thin spikes which are attached to patches. The micro-needle patch is then applied to the skin with a light pressure, causing the ingredients spikes to slightly pierce the top layer of the skin and dissolve, allowing the actives to penetrate the skin more effectively than a topically applied serum. Several Korean exhibitors presented this kind of beauty tech, like Endoderma which showcased its most recent launch, comma-shaped undereye patches containing AHP-8 and caffeine to improve skin firmness and elasticity. While functional beauty is not a new trend, of course, beauty products and face care in particular are becoming more high-tech and effective every year. Certain ingredients stood out in particular at Cosmoprof Asia 2022, like EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) which made an appearance at quite a few exhibitors' booths. Korean brand Reblocell, for example, presented its new Flossom Regenerating Sheet mask which the brand says has been saturated with the equivalent of four EGF ampoules. Fellow Korean brand EGFology also introduced an EGF face mask kit which comprises a bio-cellulose mask and an EGF ampoule. And Belgian brand Celestetic newest EGF launch is a Hydra Mist facial spray in which the EGF amino acids are combined with other functional actives, like niacinamide and panthenol. Bakuchiol - often described as a ""plant-based retinol"" - has been trending in Western European and US beauty for a while. Now this ingredient seems to be taking off amongst Asian brands, too, with at least half a dozen K-beauty brands presenting bakuchiol serums and creams, usually combined with a vegan claim. Tinazana launched a new vegan bakuchiol serum and a bakuchiol cream. The serum is a dual-phase product formulated with bakuchiol, trehalose, panthenol and almond oil, tocopherol and lithospermum erythrorhizon extract. Fellow Korean brand Celestyn recently introduced a 3-sku bakuchiol-based range formulated with 1% plant-based retinol, retinol and multipeptides. Bunio has also just brought out a bakuchiol serum, as did Eleven Huesday with its new V-Renewal Bakuchiol cream which contains 1% bakuchiol as well as three types of collagen, peptides and retinol. Cosmetic products that focus on boosting and protecting the skin's microbiome have been a massively growing global trend for the last few years. Probiotic, prebiotics and ferments played the leading role in beauty launches at the Cosmoprof Asia show this year, often with the word ""biome"" strategically used as part of the product or brand name. Russian beauty brand Natura Siberica, for example, presented its new Lab Biome range. The brand's Lab Biome Rejuvenating Face Serum is formulated with 1% postbiotic actives derived from fermented Northern cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) and wild raspberry extracts while the Happy Age Anti-Ageing Serum, French indie brand Demain's most recent launch contains natural prebiotics and postbiotics. However, microbiome-centred launches were also highly visible amongst the Asian exhibitors at the show, like Korean brands Farmstay with its new Tea Tree Biome Calming Serum and IsnTree (http://www.isntree.com/) with the recently launched Yam Root Vegan Milk Toner which is said to help repair and protect the skin's barrier. Malaysian brand Sky Resources has also launched a microbiome-focused face care range this year. The brand's Rebiome Sunscreen, for instance, is formulated with polylysine said to actively boost beneficial skin bacteria. Next year Cosmoprof Asia is due to return to Hong Kong, taking place from 14th to 17th November 2023."
"Viva Magenta, the colour that signals strength and optimism for 2023","Spotted as the colour of 2023, Viva Magenta is, according to Pantone: ""An unconventional shade for an unconventional time,"" and a ""new narrative."" The next year could see some positive changes or, if the colour specialists are right, it could bring glimpses of new prospects.. Especially since the experts at Pantone associate this new colour with joy, optimistic celebration, strength, dynamism, and even vigour. After Very Peri, Pantone's colour of 2022, associated with inventiveness and creativity, Viva Magenta — code name Pantone 18-1750 — aims to establish a new dynamic, writing ""a new narrative,"" between power and exuberance. That's right, all that! In regards to the description provided by Pantone, this hybrid colour between crimson, purple and pink is only defined with ultra-positive superlatives. It's enough to make us want to plunge headlong into the future, and embrace this new vision that at the moment seems far off — very far off — from the ambient gloom of recent months, or even years. ""Brave and fearless, a pulsating color whose exuberance promotes a joyous and optimistic celebration... It is an animated red that revels in pure joy, encouraging experimentation and self-expression without restraint, an electrifying, and a boundless shade,"" outlines Pantone on its website. And not to spoil anything, it is also ""a colour that is audacious, full of wit and inclusive of all…"" A symbol of a great year ahead, then. But Viva Magenta also reflects another part of our evolving narrative, navigating between the physical and virtual. A hybrid shade in short, which incarnates the changes to come in our daily lives. ""Tapping into the experimental spirit of Viva Magenta, Pantone explores the dynamic between Artificial Intelligence and human creativity to create 'The Magentaverse' available to the public for the first time,"" Pantone outlines. But be aware that it's not about forgetting what's essential: nature. ""In this age of technology, we look to draw inspiration from nature and what is real. ""Rooted in the primordial, Pantone 18-1750 Viva Magenta reconnects us original matter. Invoking the forces of nature, [it] galvanizes our spirit, helping us to build our inner strength,"" says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. The designers of major fashion labels have not yet unveiled their collections for fall-winter 2023, but last fall we did get a preview of the inspirations for the next spring-summer ... And looking back on them, it's clear that Viva Magenta, or any other colour close to this shade, wasn't really in the spotlight. With regard to the trends defined by fashion search engine Tagwalk, which works to screen the shows of the various Fashion Weeks, the main shades making news for that season are cobalt blue, pastels, lilac, silver, fluorescent, gold, orange, and possibly transparent, which will be part of the game. Still, many celebrities didn't wait for the announcement of the color of the year 2023 to appropriate Viva Magenta, such as Chiara Ferragni who has worn it in accents; Selena Gomez who sported a satin version during the premiere of her documentary ""My Mind & Me"" at the AFI Film Festival in Los Angeles, and Kate Middleton who, according to the Instagram accounts her fans have dedicated to her looks, quite regularly sports the color of the year to come."
"Beauty consumers strive for efficient and potent products, says Mintel","Looking ahead, Mintel has identified three upcoming trends in consumer behaviour, product innovation and marketing tactics that will impact the future of the beauty industry in 2023 and beyond. Beauty Rx. The medicalisation of beauty is leading to more demand for proof behind claims, creating value through ingredient-led products and driving the market for synthetic natural ingredients. ""As the hunger for more efficient and potent products and treatments grows, consumers will look further to find proof that their money is being well-spent,"" says Andrew McDougal, Director, Mintel Beauty & Personal Care. Potential developments from beauty brands could come from the emergence of genetic sequencing and advances in diagnostics and electronic wearable devices. In this context, the beauty industry should tap into emerging technologies to develop new products and processes, improve existing ones and reduce costs to remain competitive in the future. Evolved Self-Care. Beauty is intended to be uplifting and can contribute to a post-pandemic sense of self-care that includes sexual wellness, the hormone journey and wellness for every life stage. ""It's critical to ensure that all consumers feel seen and spoken to. No longer will a singular approach to wellness be acceptable,"" highlights Andrew McDougal. Thus, global beauty companies are likely to focus on holistic habits and products that support everything from sleep to blood circulation and their connection to beauty. New Rules of Engagement. Brands should embrace disruption in the category to create new rules for engagement and building communities, allowing for more playfulness, experimentation and DIY. ""Experimentation drives engagement and technology will usher in the next generation of experience, whether in the store or the home. As online and offline formats continue to merge, technology will allow for the replication of experiences across channels with simple approaches, from RFID to digital avatars and the metaverse. Looking ahead, the development of VR (virtual reality) technology, hardware and content will become convenient and practical enough for consumers to use every day. This will enable brands to use these technologies strategically to create 'phygital' (physical and digital) experiences that will dominate the way consumers discover, shop and connect with brands,"" says McDougal.

Advent calendars: Properly meeting expectations to avoid a reputation crash,"Beauty, fashion, gardening, gastronomy, automotive, jewellery, crafts, culture, toys, design... The advent calendar craze has spread to every market sector — or just about. Instead of running out of steam, the phenomenon seems to grow from year to year, inspiring extravagant projects and versions, as well as some exorbitant prices. The time of children receiving an Advent calendar with religious images to help them await Christmas seems to be part of a long-gone past. Early in the 20th century, the Germanic tradition gave way to the first retail versions, still in the form of pictures but more playful than pious, inviting children to express their creativity with colourful drawings. Then the pictures gave way to chocolates and, gradually, to many other things, including: toys, jewellery, cosmetics, perfumes, beers, wine, tea, coffee, festive foods, miniature cars, candles, books, sex toys, etc. A wide range of variations is available to meet the tastes and desires of customers, including personalized or customizable versions, or even DIY kits. There is also a wide variety on the budget side: from ultra-accessible to ultra-luxurious, when it comes to advent calendars, anything goes. In fact these small-sized gifts packed into a countdown format inspire such enthusiasm that Britain's Beauty Pie recently created a contest wherein one lucky Advent calendar fan could get paid in exchange for reviewing several of them. Brands often see these colourful boxes as a profitable pre-Christmas operation. They help ""deseasonalize"" the end-of-year period. Since they are marketed in October, they represent for consumers a Christmas purchase before Christmas comes, and an additional source of revenue for both brands and retailers. From a marketing point of view, they also give the brand a privileged moment to introduce itself to consumers, inviting them to explore and try several of its products. A privileged opportunity to potentially spark curiosity, desire, and even passion for one or more products. However, as competition increases, appealing to today's consumers involves more and more creative efforts and margin compression: samples or special edition goodies thus tend to be replaced by true retail products. As a result, prices can easily soar — US$300 euros, US$500, even up to several thousand dollars for the extreme luxury versions — making the disappointment even greater when the contents don't meet expectations. Something that a major luxury house experienced fallout from last year, when it became the subject of a controversy on social networks. The cause? Its Advent calendar, retailing for US$825, was criticized by an influencer who did not appreciate the contents. If it contained miniature versions of collector perfumes, lipsticks, and creams, the luxury-priced box also contained, according to the young woman, pins, stickers, pouches, and decorative tree baubles that the label would generally offer free of charge to its customers upon the purchase of a product. A bit disappointing considering the amount of money spent. Fortunately, it's always possible to know the contents of an advent calendar before going to the checkout, allowing consumers to make perfectly informed choices. It remains to answer the big question of the moment! From the packaging to the content of the products, can Advent calendars be environmentally friendly? A part of the answer inevitably lies in the commitments made by the brand. A company that claims to be ethical, sustainably-oriented must offer products in line with its commitments, as a latter of logic and consistency. Packaging is increasingly made from sustainable or recycled materials, and tend to avoid plastics."
Makeup trends: Grey hits the heights on social networks,"At the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards — which each year crowns fashion's finest — the star stepped out in a Thom Browne ensemble that didn't fail to wow the photographers and guests in attendance. But it was her lipstick that set social networks on fire. And that's because the American celebrity made a bold move in choosing an unmissable matte grey lipstick, which has clearly gone down a storm. And that's all it took. On TikTok, the favorite social network of young people in search of new beauty inspirations, the hashtag #greylipstick has already scored nearly three million views. This reflects growing interest in this trend. The result is a host of videos featuring the supermodel's beauty look, but also in even more extravagant and futuristic variations. This trend has emerged in a context where beauty seemed above all to be embracing more vibrant colours, as if reflecting a need to rise up against the prevailing mood of gloom. Grey — a neutral colour symbolizing elegance and futurism, but also monotony, melancholy, even sadness — is ultimately part of a broader trend marked by a certain nostalgia. Actually, it's becoming clear — as evidenced by social networks — that grey is gradually becoming the flagship colour of the season, and for all types of beauty looks. Notching up no less than 2 million and 1 million views, respectively, the hashtags #greymakeup and #greyeyeshadow show just how much European and North-American social media users are starting to see themselves in grey this winter."
"""The Chinese culture influences perfumers"", David Huang, Robertet China","L'Oréal chose Documents, but other young companies like To Summer (观夏) or Beast (野兽派) are also very active on the Chinese perfume market. ""These two companies have been growing very fast, in particular To Summer, whose growth is phenomenal! Their investors have enough funds to finance their development, so for now, they are not considering selling their shares"", explains David Huang (黄赣军), nose and Technical Director of a creative team of 12 people at Robertet China, the subsidiary of the French company specialized in natural aromatic products that opened a plant in 2007 in Huairou, in the suburbs of Beijing, for 65 million yuans. The company has kept investing since then, almost twice more, says David Huang, who was born in the Henan province and formed the ISIPCA School in Versailles, France. To him, the communication between China and the other countries in the field of scents boosts the rebirth of the perfume culture. Indeed, if it was flourishing until the 13th century, it disappeared during the turmoil that buried part of the Chinese heritage. The first traces date back to more than two thousand years ago, when rose and jasmine fragrances were introduced by the Arabs. Then, China developed local scents, like osmanthus incense, whose olfactory signature has kept changing over the centuries. According to David Huang, the Chinese uniqueness is gaining ground again in the world of perfumes. The Chinese culture has a tremendous influence on perfumers, who choose plants like tea, osmanthus, and bamboo as a source of inspiration. For example, he has just created the fragrance Hangzhou Sweet for To Summer, using osmanthus, mung bean, and longjing green tea. Recently, on the dynamic segment of home perfumes, Beast collaborated with luxury hotel Capella Shanghai to launch a line called Santal Trouble, with a sandalwood trail. Compared to European and American consumers, Chinese people prefer smart, light, subtle, but not too sweet notes, David Huang says. In addition to that, he insists they expect other functions than a smell. Other than the originality of a niche product, for example, perfumes need to have a positive influence on the daily mood and to improve our condition at work by diffusing refreshing aromas. Although they are still bestsellers in China, a few global brands have integrated the local culture into their perfume design, such as Armani Privé with Pivoine Suzhou and Atelier Cologne with Oolang. David Huang hails these ""genuine efforts for the domestic market, which convey a unique thinking strategy on local Chinese assets. The Chinese perfume market is opening via global brands, and we think it is only the beginning"". The local competition is restless: the Qichacha institute counts about 2,000 Chinese scent brands. Other than those mentioned above, David Huang evokes a few more in this profusion of companies: Re Classified (调香室), Aynoir, Plustwo (普拉斯兔), Barrio (巴莉奥), SIT.E, Atypic Edition (返常), Reflower (花点时间), Meet House (香遇沙龙香水), Futchi, etc. They are entering a market which, according to the latest Euromonitor data, should achieve a 22.5% growth rate over the next five years (compared to 7% for the global market). By 2025, retail sales on the Chinese perfume market should reach 30 billion yuans. Right now, according to iResearch Consulting Group, women with medium to high incomes account for more than 80% of Chinese perfume consumers, with a purchase price per unit from 500 to 800 yuans (EUR 68 to EUR 108). As a consequence, a few analysts assert that China went from a pre-Covid economy focused on lipstick to a perfume-centred one. New trends in the Chinese fragrance market will be presented by Asia Cosme Lab at the Fragrance Innovation Summit, on December 1st in Paris: www.fragranceinnovation.com/en/"
"Sales of prestige hair care products boom in the UK, according to The NPD Group","According to The NPD Group, sales of prestige hair products increased 67% from January to the end of September 2022, compared to the same period in 2019. The market for prestige hair products in the UK was valued at £29.8 million in 2022, an increase of 18% compared to the same period in 2021. The market research firm says British consumers have shifted their behaviour during the pandemic and the closure of hair salons. During the various lockdowns, they turned to specialised treatments, shampoo and conditioning products from the prestige hair category for their home hair routine. This shift in consumer behaviour shows no sign of decreasing as sales across this category continue to grow, especially online. The study finds that 67% of all prestige hair products sales in the UK are made via online channels. ""Many people are loyal to the products within their hair routine and the online channel lends itself to replenishment purchasing. Online also allows the consumer to be savvier when searching for products to see where they are most competitively priced,"" explains Emma Fishwick, Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. Daily rinse shampoo and conditioner products perform well in this sector. Sales of dry shampoo increased 68% in the nine-month period compared to 2021, suggesting that consumers, who are commuting again and socialising more, maybe opting for an on-the-go quick fix. Sales of hair styling products including hair spray reported double-digit growth in this period compared to last year. As consumers are becoming more educated about ingredients in beauty and hair care, brands have responded with a multi-layered approach to hair care offering multi-step routines, akin to skincare regimes, for home hair care. Targeted products can address particular issues and deficiencies. As a consequence, sales of hair oil increased 34% and hair serum increased 33% during the first nine months of 2022 compared to last year. ""The prestige hair category has performed incredibly well since the beginning of the pandemic. Consumers are upgrading their hair care routines with everyday use prestige products such as daily rinse shampoo and conditioner that by their very nature address specific concerns from dry and damaged hair, to split ends and fizziness. This is a major shift, and we believe that the 'skinification' of haircare is here to stay,"" concludes Emma Fishwick."
"Ethics and mental wellbeing remain key consumers concerns in 2023, Mintel","Mintel's global consumer trends report for 2023 reveals that ethics and mental wellbeing remain the two main concerns of consumers. Indeed, in a context of global uncertainty and a series of crisis, consumers tend to refocus on what really matters to them. Centred around seven core drivers of consumer behaviour - identity, rights, surroundings, experiences, technology, wellbeing and value - the five key trends identified by Mintel are: Me Mentality. According to Mintel, in 2023, consumers will be eager to re-focus on themselves. For instance, Mintel highlights that 44% of US Gen Zs agree that finding ways to celebrate themselves has become more important to them now than before the COVID-19 pandemic. ""In recent years, consumers have had a community mindset, putting their own needs on the back burner to prioritise public health and safety. People are now emerging from the pandemic eager to re-focus on themselves,"" highlights Simon Moriarty, Director of Mintel Trends, EMEA. Power to the People. According to Mintel, brands need to adapt to a new model of consumer as co-creator. Consumers are investing, co-creating and voting for change. Popular social platforms like TikTok prioritise self-expression, driving consumers to develop and showcase their creativity across beauty, home and food. Responding to this demand requires brands to listen and react while keeping market innovation a priority. Hyper Fatigue. The pandemic, rising cost of living, energy crisis, geopolitical unrest and the climate crisis have all taken their toll on consumers and will continue to do so, causing fatigue and a sense of being overwhelmed. As a consequence, according to Mintel, consumers will try to cut through the noise and connect with what matters to them. ""Consumers will find meaning and solace in reconnecting with their surroundings, their communities and themselves,"" says Simon Moriarty. International Localism. Buying local will be a way consumers can protect themselves financially, environmentally and psychologically, and feel that they are giving back. ""With so much global uncertainty there will be a greater movement to protect local resources and boost local business. This is a hangover from the pandemic, but also a reflection of consumers' changing attitudes towards what's important to them,"" explains Simon Moriarty. Intentional Spending. In a tough economic environment, consumers want to make smart financial choices without sacrificing their quality of life. Mintel highlights that 45% of US consumers who buy select personal care products say they have chosen an alternative product/brand due to price increases in the last year. According to the market research firm, factors like flexibility, durability and sustainability will play increasingly important roles in consumers' value equation. ""Expect a stronger focus on durability, flexibility and timelessness as consumers seek to buy less and own products that last longer and serve multiple purposes. As the market becomes further saturated with added-value claims, consumers will grow more sceptical and discerning. In the next five years, expect to see purpose-driven brands emerge with innovations that address long-term challenges faced by the industries, nations, and communities in which they are a part,"" concluded Simon Moriarty. Mintel's 2023 Global Consumer Trends are available for free download here."
"As inflation soars, price comes before sustainability for U.S. consumers","As prices continue to rise and economic uncertainty looms, financial concerns are widespread among US consumers but all hope is not lost. According to a recent Mintel research, more than half (51%) of Americans say they are currently concerned about the future of the economy, however, a similar share (48%) feel confident their financial situation will improve in the next 12 months. In addition to the future of the economy, inflation is top of mind across the population. Nine in 10 consumers (94%) say they are currently worried about inflation, and 67% believe the majority of Americans share in these concerns, while a third (34%) believe it's other Americans - rather than themselves - who are financially struggling right now. Meanwhile, 22% of Americans overall - and 31% of parents - say they are struggling to cover day-to-day expenses. Mintel research shows that the most common consumer response to dealing with inflation is cutting back on nonessential purchases (40%), followed by dining out less often (37%). ""Americans' heightened concern about the country's economic future - which greatly exceeds all other surveyed financial concerns - is likely due to the current laser-sharp focus on this topic across news media, the political arena, and among business leaders. While not all consumers consider themselves financially struggling at this time, many are already adjusting their shopping behaviors regardless of their level of financial comfort,"" said Lisa Dubina, Associate Director of Culture & Identity, at Mintel. Age and current life stage affect where consumers' greatest financial concerns lie. Consumers aged 55-64 - who are more likely to be financially established - are more focused on big-picture concerns including the overall well-being of the economy (61%) and their personal retirement savings (46%). On the other hand, Gen Z consumers (18-24), who are earning less in general, are more concerned with their own short-term financial well-being: maintaining their current standard of living (38%), ability to pay their bills (41%), and ability to afford day-to-day necessities (38%). These shorter-term concerns align with younger consumers' tendency to prioritize living in the moment and could help brands identify where and when they are more likely to splurge. Despite consumers' willingness to pay more for higher quality (59%), there's little else they prioritize before lower prices. According to Mintel, more than six in 10 consumers (62%) prefer lower prices over a convenient shopping experience, and 57% say they prioritize lower pricing over sustainable brand options. More than six in 10 (63%) consumers say that brand name is not important to them when shopping most categories, yet 59% of people agree they'd rather pay more for a higher quality product than pay less to receive average quality. This shows that durability and long-term use are more important than the premium halo of a brand name. Although consumers prioritize price over convenience and exclusivity, these can still be attractive add-ons that can make a brand more appealing compared to similar price competitors. ""Consumers are likely to continue choosing the best price over the more sustainable and more expensive option. Understanding that now is a difficult time for retailers to offer more discounts due to challenges like supply chain issues and the rising price of labor cutting into profit margins, offering creative perks and benefits to customers can increase the value of purchases and help build long-term customer loyalty. Now more than ever, it's important for brands to not only communicate the value of their products and services but also prove it to consumers who are increasingly looking to avoid financial risk or waste,"" concluded Dubina."
Prestige refillable beauty products see strong sales growth in the UK,"According to The NPD Group, sales of refillable prestige beauty products in the UK increased 47% from January to the end of July 2022. Sales of these products (which are valued at £34 million in this seven-month period) performed far better than the total prestige beauty market, which increased 22% between January and the end of July 2022, compared to last year. Within the total refillable beauty market, the sub-category ""Product Refill Only"", where the consumer buys the product refill for use with the refillable exterior packaging, grew the fastest, with sales increasing 79% in the period from January to the end of July 2022. While refillable fragrances only account for a small proportion of the market, 5% of fragrance sales weight can be attributed to refillable packaging, said The NPD Group. To date brands have only offered a limited choice of refillable products, focusing on larger sizes. However, in the period from January to the end of July 2022 sales of 45-74ml fragrance juices (in all formats including EDT, EDP, Perfume and Cologne) have experienced strong increases, compared to the same period last year, marking a shift in retail as refillable becomes more mainstream. Refillable beauty is a key theme of launches this year. Some of the new launches with refillable options that The NPD Group has observed include Good Fortune by Viktor & Rolf, D by Diesel and Prada Paradoxe. The strongest category growth was reported in makeup where sales of refillable products increased 364% in the period from January to the end of July 2022, compared to the same period last year. This contrasts with sales growth in the total makeup market which reported a 30% increase year-on-year. Just over half of makeup refill sales can be attributed to lip colour. Other sub-segments that dominate the refill space include bronzer and blush. ""As consumers become more conscious of the importance of sustainability and their role in promoting it, we have seen a corresponding rise in sales of refillable prestige beauty products. These latest figures demonstrate that as far as beauty consumers are concerned, buying refillable products is becoming more mainstream. But there is a long way to go. What we are seeing here really marks the beginning of the refillable beauty story as only a small percentage of sales weight of makeup products are currently refillable. This is similar for skincare and hair products,"" said Emma Fishwick, Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty."
Beyond hairstyles: How hair has been a symbol of women's struggles,"From the Black Panthers' afrocentric hairstyles to the Rastafari dreadlocks or the 'natural hair movement', hair has long been considered a symbol of protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the ""flapper style"", with an androgynous silhouette and short hair, was already linked with women's desire for emancipation and gender equality. And now, hairstyle is being used this way once more in Iran, as demonstrated by a proliferation of videos showing women renouncing their long hair, like Iranian singer Donya Dadrasan, to show solidarity with Masha Amini, who died three days after being arrested by morality police for wearing an ill-fitting veil. ""I cut my hair... I hope for a day when women in my country can laugh, dance, cry, breathe and live freely,"" Donya Dadrasan wrote on TikTok. Women in Iran have already taken to shaving their heads in the past to show support for different movements, as well as to protest against the wearing of the veil. In 2016, the page 'My Stealthy Freedom', created by a journalist of Iranian origin living in London, published a photo of a young woman who chose to shave her head to stop wearing the veil. ""I sold my hair to those adorable angels who suffer from cancer. When I came to the street, I told myself 'no hair, no morality police! 'There is no reason for those who always tell me to cover my hair' or arrest me now,"" she wrote to accompany a picture on which she appeared shaved and unveiled. Last year, at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, South Korean archer An San unwittingly found herself at the center of a salvo of protest. The Olympic champion was subjected to insults and threats on social networks because of her short haircut, which some considered ""not feminine enough."" As they always do with social media, reactions came swiftly with one user initiating a counter movement, giving rise to a slew of videos showing women cutting their hair live under the hashtag ""#women_shortcut_campaign."" In Saudi Arabia, short haircuts - known locally by the English word ""boy"" - have become strikingly visible on the streets, conjointly with the rise of women in the country's economy. Sometimes it's not necessary to cut one's hair to make it a symbol of the fight against discrimination and inequality. Since the 1960s and '70s, the Afro hairstyle has been popularized by many activists, including Angela Davis and Nina Simone, imbuing it with both cultural and political symbolism. At the time it was about establishing Black women and men's natural hair as a symbol of resistance and celebration of African-American culture. It's a movement that continues today, under various names including the ""natural hair movement,"" because of persistent discrimination and prejudice related to the hair of Black women, men and children. Don't forget that the CROWN Act, a law aimed at prohibiting hair discrimination in the United States, was only adopted at a federal level by the House of Representatives last March, in the wake of earlier votes in California and New York. The legislation would aim at prohibiting discriminations based on hair texture, or certain hairstyles such as braids, dreadlocks or twists in access to employment, education, or even sports. Whether we cut it, show it in its natural state, or shave it, the symbolism of hair has much more than an aesthetic dimension, playing a role in fighting against various forms of inequality for decades. And it probably will continue to do so."
Skin whitening products remain popular in Cameroon despite risks,"Wearing a large hat protecting her face from the sun's rays in Cameroon, 63-year-old Jeanne now bitterly regrets using skin whitening products after being diagnosed with skin cancer. She is one of many women in Cameroon who use the controversial products that have been banned after social media outrage. ""I am embarrassed when people look at me,"" the trader in the capital of Yaounde said, wishing to only use her first name. After a lesion grew on her face over five months, she went to a doctor who diagnosed her with one of the most common skin cancers. Doctors told her the cancer is linked to her use of skin lightening products for 40 years. Jeanne, like millions in Africa and around the world, used the products for more lighter skin. According to the Cameroon Dermatology Society (Socaderm), nearly 30 percent of residents in the economic capital Douala and a quarter of schoolgirls used skin lighthening products in 2019. For some like 20-year-old student Annette, the effects can be harsh. She said she suffers from red patches on her face, peeling skin and also burns. ""Under a strong sun, my face became hot and I had to stop,"" she explained. The products with names like ""White now"" and ""Super white"", are instantly recognisable on shop shelves by the fair-skinned women on the packaging. Many of the products contain dangerous levels of chemicals that inhibit the production of melanin, a substance produced in the body by exposure to the sun. One of the chemicals is hydroquinone, banned in the European Union since 2001 because of the risk of cancer and genetic mutations. Hydroquinone is in fact one of the most used in whitening products in Cameroon, according to a 2019 study by Yaounde I University. But other dangerous ingredients, like mercury, are also common in these products, which are now seen as real public health problem. ""We encounter patients complaining of symptoms linked to skin depigmentation every day,"" Alain Patrice Meledie Ndjong, a dermatologist at a hospital in Douala, said. Other skin whitening products include potions, tablets and even injections. Some of the substances, when ingested, can cause diabetes, obesity, hypertension or kidney or liver failure, warned Ndjong, adding there was also a psychological impact on individuals like ""anxiety and depression."" Why risk such suffering? Despite the horror stories, some persons believe they will become more beautiful after using the products. ""Beauty standards promoted by media, advertising and marketing reinforce the bias that lighter skin tone is more desirable than darker skin tone,"" said WHO. Sociologist Achille Pinghane Yonta of Yaounde University offers blunter analysis of why the creams remain popular. ""There is a desire rooted in our consciences to want to look like Western populations,"" he said. ""It's a very old practice. It's even said, in some parts of the country, that a light-skinned woman's dowry is higher than that of a darker woman."" Cameroon's health ministry on August 19 banned the import, production and distribution of cosmetic and personal hygiene products containing dangerous substances such as hydroquinone and mercury. The decree was published after a controversy began in the summer when social media users criticised opposition MP Nourane Fotsing over her company that sells the products, angry that an elected official would profit from them. According to her party, the highly publicized furore was not devoid of political motives. Since the ban, police have launched raids, much to the chagrin of the sector's players who claim some seizures don't distinguish between the products that are banned by the government and those that are not. However, despite the ban, there is already a black market for the products. The cosmetic and personal hygiene market grew in Cameroon by seven percent in 2020 and was worth 380 billion CFA (around 580 million euros)."
"Sales of prestige fragrances overtake pre-pandemic levels in France, NPD","According to the market research company, sales of perfumes, eau de parfum, eau de toilette and colognes increased by 20% between January and August 2022 in France. A rate well above that of the whole of 2021 when sales had increased by 11%, cramped by successive lockdowns during the first half of the year. The increase is even more spectacular when compared to the same period in 2021. According to The NPD Group, these figures confirm the importance of perfumes in the prestige beauty market in France, of which they are a keystone. It is also the first flagship category of the whole beauty sector to return to pre-pandemic levels, with sales up 4% in value compared to the period from January to August 2019. While all segments contribute to these good results, consumers show a preference for more concentrated juices. Indeed, sales of eau de parfum jumped 23% compared to the same period last year and are up 12% compared to 2019. Even more concentrated, extracts and perfumes increased by 60% compared to 2021 and by 168% if we compare sales over the same eight-month period in 2019. These results confirm the growing interest of consumers for these type of fragrances, that are more expensive but have the reputation to last longer. According to The NPD Group, consumer preferences are also shifting towards increased preferences for high-end scents and collections. For the period from January to August, retail perfume sales with a value of 100 euros and more grew by 74% compared to 2021 and by 177% compared to 2019. These so-called ""premium"" fragrances accounted for 19% of total sales of fragrances in the selective channel in 2022, compared to 11% in 2019. This taste for more concentrated products and ultra-premium ranges has resulted in an increase in 5% of the average price of selective perfumes - at 68.30 euros - during the first eight months of the year, compared to the same period in 2021. ""The good results of perfumes in the selective beauty market are very positive news, for brands and retailers alike. They are supported by the ever-increasing appeal of fragrances, with consumers turning to higher-quality products. Despite an uncertain economic situation and its consequences on purchasing power, perfume is part of a holistic approach to well-being in which consumers continue to invest,"" said Mathilde Lion, European Beauty Expert at The NPD Group."
France: Organic cosmetics are innovating despite a difficult market environment,"Figures speak for themselves; the decrease in volume sales of organic cosmetics is ever present, in a French beauty and hygiene market which is also declining. In June 2022, the hygiene and care sector fell by 25.2% in the specialised organic channel (BioAnalytics 2022 data), while the other distribution channels, pharmacies and supermarkets, fared slightly better. Despite this difficult context, companies are continuing to invest to offer products that are more in line with the demand for simplicity of use and zero waste. Solid or powder formulas, therefore, were found in large numbers on the stands of exhibitors. The search for a fair price is also becoming a decisive factor in the purchasing act, knowing that on average organic products are 15 to 30% more expensive. Another new use is given to the container with the solid cosmetics proposed by the Anaé brand. Thanks to a partnership with the Duralex glass factory, the glass jars with different sizes of balms are reusable; the same goes for the lids made of cork from Portugal. The products consist of relaxing massage balms with hemp oil, nourishing balms with camelina oil or mentholated oil for the sport version, in 60ml format, as well as deodorant balms in 80ml format. At Perlucine, a discovery offering of mini formats, at a small price (6.45 €), allows testing the products, all of which are composed of oyster shell powder from Brittany. The hygiene kit includes a shampoo, a face cleanser, toothpaste, a shower powder and a deodorant, in 3g sachets. The well-thought salt shaker-shaped packaging delivers the right amount of powder in a very practical way. Mention should be made of Savons du Léman, a Nature et Progrès labelled brand, and of its founder Sandra Rembert, a soap maker who offers a specific range of organic soaps for short- and long-haired dogs, cats and equines as an addition to hygiene soaps. Particular attention has been given to the visual aspect of the soaps thanks to added natural pigments. New at Lamazuna is a baby range, with three solid products: a balm to protect babies from diaper rash, a perfume-free and surgras massage butter. Also, a solid shampoo with Lavandin oil to prevent head lice, as well as solid conditioners. For DIY enthusiasts, steam face masks from the Mas du Roseau brand. Packaged in canvas bags, the user simply takes the amount he needs and infuses it with hot water. At Beauty Garden, the Sothys Group's institute brand, everything originates from an organic permaculture garden in Corrèze, for a ""seed to cream"" concept. All the products on offer are made from crops grown in situ. Institute treatments such as ""Lâcher Prise"" or ""Détox"" follow the same four-phase ritual: first contact, nature in the skin, immersion and a gentle return with a seasonal organic herbal tea. Peppermint, birch, meadowsweet, Calendula, Camomile... plants that are key components of this skincare ritual. Superfruits are always in the spotlight; alongside cranberries, blueberries and pomegranates, mulberries come from a tree in the mulberry family, not to be confused with wild blackberry. It is a powerful, resveratrol-rich antioxidant. Thanks to both, the local food movement and the (hyper-)short circuit trend, French and even regional raw materials are in high demand. With a strong identity, these raw materials enhance the notion of proximity: lavender from Provence, Breton seaweed, mountain gentian, Alpine aster... The Elixens company has made them its spearhead, in its organic range: lemon savoury from Provence, oily macerate of meadowsweet, calendula... This trend was also noticed this summer at the Vivaness trade show in Nuremberg. Finally, let's note the Gold Trophy won at the show by Laboratoires de Biarritz, for their self-tanning face and body drops, (launched in February 2022). The plus of this product: it can be mixed with any type of skin care formula (emulsion, gel, lotion, etc.). Depending on the phototype and the number of drops added to the usual skincare product, it allows obtaining a tailor-made tan. Made up of a self-tanning complex (DHA from rapeseed and corn erythrulose), of a patented red algae antioxidant extract, Alga-Gorria®, of moisturising organic glycerine (rapeseed) and of soothing and moisturising organic Aloe Vera, this very comprehensive formula, presented in a recyclable glass dropper bottle, is handy, portable and economical. Radiant skin and a healthy glow are guaranteed all year round!"
YSL Beauty smashes virility codes with new campaign featuring Lil Nas X,"Clearly, Generation Z does not want to be pigeonholed and is shattering many of the constraints, stereotypes and preconceptions that have loomed large in the lives of previous generations. And the 23-year-old American rapper Lil Nas X is no exception — far from it, in fact — using his voice to make beauty more inclusive, and freer from stereotypes. And this seems to be welcomed by the sector's major names, which no longer hesitate to shake up the codes to help bring their cosmetics to a wider audience. Rouge Pur Couture The Bold high pigment lipstick, the latest addition to the YSL Beauty make-up range, is currently the subject of several campaigns, featuring both Kaia Gerber and Lil Nas X. The American rapper, who constantly breaks with convention, both in fashion and in beauty, proves once again that cosmetics are not — or are no longer — tied to gender, while simultaneously challenging many preconceived notions of virility and masculinity. Dressed in a black leather look, jacket open on his bare torso, or sporting a transparent shirt, the American artist presents some of the luxury brand's new makeup products, including Lash Clash mascara and Rouge Pur Couture The Bold lipstick. The two products have probably not been chosen at random, since they have previously been considered as being entirely dedicated to female customers. But that was then! The campaign shows Lil Nas X in the middle of the desert, posing in front of a mirror and applying the brand's products to gain voluminous lashes and vibrant pink lips — once again turning gender stereotypes on their head. This is not the first — and probably not the last — time that the rapper has been intent on shaking up long-established norms. Whether about town or on the red carpets, the ""Montero"" singer refuses to bow to convention, always showing off his unique style, wearing dresses, crop tops and skin-tight jumpsuits. These outfits have the merit of getting people talking, questioning, while also reaching a large audience, irrespective of whether they're open to embracing change. One of his most emblematic and evocative looks was no doubt a lilac half-dress half-suit creation by Atelier Versace, effectively embodying this desire to not (or no longer) be defined according to a gender. Like Harry Styles, David Banda, A$AP Rocky, Bad Bunny, Pete Davidson, Timothée Chalamet and Jaden Smith — to name but a few — Lil Nas X is part of a generation that is out to blur the boundaries, to push things forward, while deconstructing as much as possible the famous myth of virility."
"Kidcore, the trend that's taking Gen Z back in the 1990s and 2000s","Although only aged between 12 and 25 years old, Generation Z already seems to be nostalgic for childhood, to the point of embracing the outfits, cosmetics, and colorful or childish accessories that nurtured them since their earliest days. As such, the ""kidcore"" trend sets the tone for fall, and with it, there's no way you can take yourself seriously. Faced with the many crises that now loom large in our daily lives, the young generation is in search of extravagance and carefree vibes. And the ""kidcore"" trend isn't just about fashion, but is also being played out in the beauty and accessories sectors, and even in the food industry. Gaudy colours, prints and ultra-kitsch accessories have taken over TikTok, which is busy reviving the key trends of the 1990s and 2000s, such as skateboarding, vintage consoles and even disposable cameras. The #kidcore hashtag has already scored more than 1.3 billion views on Gen Z's favourite social network, not to mention its derivatives, #kidcoreaesthetic, #kidcorestyle, and #kidcoremakeup, which count several million. The aesthetic has also been reinterpreted by some designers for the spring-summer 2023 men's fashion week shows, for instance at Thom Browne and JW Anderson. The accumulation of accessories, and the mixture of bright colors and/or prints, are among the strong trends linked to the ""kidcore"" aesthetic. Scrunchies, barrettes, colored tights, jewelry of all kinds — or in throwback childhood designs — are legion, but that's not all. There's also an influx of garments and styles inherent to the 1990s and 2000s that have, for some, already made a comeback in recent months with the rise of the Y2K aesthetic. Think overalls, crop tops, bucket hats, low-rise pants and vintage sneakers, for example. On the beauty side, this translates into looks and hairstyles that are often inspired by manga and video games, such as pigtails, ultra-high ponytails, bright eye shadow colours, or even mini braids. All of this, of course, is embellished with beads, and other accessories straight out of this era. A trend that, in many ways, echoes the barbiecore aesthetic that brought gender extremes back took to the forefront of fashion this summer."
The influence of technology and new uses on the future of beauty,"The need to connect brands and consumers through a more responsible lifestyle is more and more imperative, according to a 2022 report by Mintel highlighting the necessity for brands to have ethical progress reports. Many web3 projects have been thought around sustainable engagements, like the one by Guerlain, When Material Becomes Art that merges futuristic, ecological, and artistic approaches, through 4 digital artworks. The project The Reaverse perpetuates the brand's sustainable values – the digital world comes to rescue the real world, through a collection of 1828 cryptobees sold to protect real bees and to finance the development of a natural reserve. These endeavors are greatly appreciated by the consumers and widely shared on social media. Furthermore, the interest has shifted towards green makeup or a form of naturality, as we can see through beauty social media trends, with concepts like the No make-up Look, the Dewy Look or the Glow Up (the expression reminds us of the Netflix show which celebrates diversity). The beauty sector is often associated to others, like spirituality and well-being: lately Kate Moss has launched her beauty and wellness brand, bringing to light a healthy lifestyle, beauty products, and well-being ones, like tea, to be accompanied by a daily ritual. More than ever, the bond between reality and the digital universe allows consumers to express themselves in plural ways. Besides cyborg-like filters (poreless skin, high cheekbones, catlike eyes, big eyelashes – a look coined ""Instagram Face""), the digital world allows people to be different and free. Shopping is easier and encouraged by virtual try-on, widely developed in the beauty sector to visualize a product on oneself. The use of technology also enriches customer experience, personalization, and brand engagement. A recent study informs that 92% of Gen Z consumers are interested in augmented reality during a shopping experience. Yves Saint Laurent offers three tools to try augmented reality within the comfort of one's home – Dress your lips for lipstick makeup, Master your gaze for the eye, and Face your style for the skin. Today, many brands multiply the touchpoints during product launches, with virtual popups, immersive screens, augmented reality filters… It is a way to expand the brand's notoriety and universe and to create a link with the consumers. The latest example by Prada Paradoxe shows how the barriers between reality and the digital field have erased – the brand asked its followers whether a fragrance could exist in a digital space, and they are invited to explore a multi-dimensional self and identity evolving constantly. What is beauty? On social media, the concept is more inclusive and universal, advocating ""happy beauty"". The launch of Clinique's first NFT, named Metaoptimist, is inscribed within this positive attitude. Another campaign by the brand aims at including more diversity in the metaverse, with NFP (non-fungible people), and looks for people with various skin colors, face shapes, hair styles and makeup. A TikTok report insists on the increase of beauty videos globally and of content that celebrates beauty and flaws, inclusivity and difference. Only communities contribute to redefining what is beauty and what are their expectations. Some brands are inspired by the virtual world in the creation of their products, offering a new space to consumers similar to the gaming industry. MAC Cosmetics has thus created 12 makeup looks within the game The Sims 4 and has launched a collection inspired by the game Honor of Kings. The gaming market paves the way for more freedom in the aesthetic world, allowing users to express their identity through their personalized avatars. Bridges, experiences, and emotions are created. In an ever-changing world, links between the digital and real worlds, eccentricity and naturality, self-identity and others, are countless. The future of beauty is shaped by the consumers themselves and by the increase of digital experiences that are more authentic and community focused. In this context, it is necessary to reconsider customer experience to produce engagement and bring together communities around shared values. These evolutions leave room for creative evolutions for both brands and consumers. WANDS, global communication agency, tells stories & brings to light in a strategic & innovative way brands that are sensitive to excellence, luxury & premium. The agency adapts itself with agility & sources the best experts/technology. At the service of emotion, it is all about impactful & engaging ideas, a custom-made service."
Focus on color: A snapshot of French and American beauty trends,"Spate's latest report reveals the behavioral specificities emerging from each market. Based on their latest: Hair & Makeup Trends Report for France & the USA (July 2022), Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation has identified three major takeaways: In both countries, warm red tones dominate search volume changes. In France, searches for ginger hair are up +2.0K. The rise of searches for burgundy immediately follows with +1.3K, then come auburn (+1K) and copper (+0.7k). While red is the warmest color for French consumers, rising interest in babylights (+1.1K) also suggests a desire for subtlety. Likewise, in the US, red hair is the most searched color for hair with a volume increase of +213.4K. Red is followed by copper (+36.2K), auburn (+35.8K), ginger (+32.3K) and red highlights (+29.0K), all of them featuring in the top ten. Across both countries consumers are using more nuanced search descriptors to find their desired hair shade, often searching for various colors alongside red hair, demonstrating a growing desire for tonal color with dimension and depth - as well as suggesting a desire for individuality. As Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation noted from the previous report on the US/France skincare market, French consumers lean into the classics - and the hair color category is no exception, with L'Oréal holding out as the most searched-for brand. On the other hand, US consumers appear to be more open to challenger brands, such as oVertone Haircare (+1.4K), Adore Hair Color (+350) and Creme of Nature (+260), which top out as the brands with the greatest search volume increase YoY. Lipsticks score high by search volume increase in both countries (+14% in France, +37,5% in the US). It is therefore not surprising that lipstick sales have seen a +28% rise in Q2 -2022 in the US according to NPD. Long-wear and glossy are at the top of the list for French consumers (+1.7K and +1.1K respectively), while shine (+35.2K) and lasting (+16.1K) score highest for the US, according to Spate. Interestingly for a country so defined by its love of the classics, magic/colour-changing lipstick is a rising category for French consumers, breaking into the top three most-searched-for benefits with an increase of +770 YoY. Searches for eyeliner are up by +8.9% in France and +11% in the USA. While white and brown eyeliners are owning overall search volume in both territories, blue eyeliner is also increasingly growing on the consumer radar (+230 in France and +19.1K in the US). Green is also breaking through in the US at +12.5K, with classic black dropping into third place for both countries. French consumers are slowly shifting away from the classics, and are exhibiting growing interest in on-trend, contemporary colors and formulations. The uptick in searches for more niche lipstick benefits (such as 'color-changing', 'waterproof' and 'sheer') present opportunities for brands to inspire with innovative new concepts. What is emerging is a shift towards greater expressions of individuality, which is apparent in growing searches for nuanced hair colors and bolder eyeliners. Download the full report here. Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation will explore these trends in detail at the upcoming MakeUp in New York event, where Leila Rochet, Chief Inspiration Officer of the agency will be joined by Olivier Zimmer and Addison Cain of Spate to discuss the major global drivers fuelling the appetite for pleasure and individual expression. Beauty Talk #2 - Joy-Care - Beauty in the Name of Pleasure September 14, 3:30 pm – 4:15 pm at the Beauty Agora MakeUp in New York, September 14 & 15, 2022 at River Pavilion - Javits Center, New York."
Fall make-up trends: From glazed donut nails to siren eyes and slugging,"Life seems to be getting back to normal this fall, bringing with it some of the habits that were shelved during the past two years. In the bathroom, this means a return to makeup essentials neglected in recent months due to the mandatory wearing of face masks and successive lockdowns. Now, however, people — especially social network users — seem keen to make up for lost time with fun and eccentric beauty inspirations. Glazed donut nail art is one of the biggest makeup trends of the fall, with no less than 80 million views on TikTok. Popularized by Hailey Bieber during the summer, this look — which is expected to last through fall — involves lacquering nails in a way that resembles the glaze of a donut. It's a trend that puts eccentricity back on the agenda, and one that's incidentally boosting demand for pearlescent nail polish. According to the global fashion search engine Stylight [1], searches for this type of nail polish have jumped 203% in just one year. Actually, boosted by the pandemic, the global demand for nail polish promises to be particularly dynamic for the next ten years! 'Siren eyes' are another trend that has became a staple of the back-to-school season. The trick, which enlarges the eyes and gives them an almond shape using eyeliner and brown eyeshadow, is proving a hit on TikTok, with nearly 600 million views for the associated hashtag. Stylight reports a 99% increase in search interest for the keyword ""siren eye"" on Google, but also a substantial 232% increase in clicks for brown eyeshadow on its international platforms. But if there is one beauty trend that continues to appeal around the world, then that's slugging. Inspired by the slimy appearance of slugs and snails, this new beauty routine involves covering the face with a thick layer of petroleum jelly before going to bed to boost hydration and enjoy plump, radiant skin in the morning. Although criticized, this method is already scoring hundreds of millions of views on social networks, and is now spurring spin-off techniques like nail slugging and hair slugging. Lipstick is also making a comeback this fall, but not in any form. It's anti-smudge liquid lipstick, delivering long-lasting wear and no transfer, that has been all the rage for several weeks, with a significant 300% increase in clicks for this category on Stylight. If one thing's for sure, it's that people seem ready to add a little colour — and fun — to their lives this season."
Natural and organic beauty: Three key trends spotted at Vivaness 2022,"Unsurprisingly for an organic beauty event, the quest for sustainability was the key market driver at Vivaness 2022. Indeed, sustainability concerns continue to grow among European consumers who had to cope with record temperatures and unprecedented droughts during this summer. Within this general framework, plastic-free and zero waste, the rise of natural and sustainable oral care, and local sourcing, turned out to be the main trends that emerged from the show floor. Solid cosmetics and zero waste concepts continued to be popular, with slew of new and indie brands introducing water-free/water-conscious products. French solid beauty pioneer Lamazuna presented its new solid perfumes while fellow French brand Balade en Provence introduced a solid eye cream based on borage oil. Similarly, Italy's Everyday for Future, a recently launched vegan brand, showcased a quartet of twist-up face and eye serums. As far as German companies are concerned, zero waste brand Niyok introduced a solid hand cream; 4 People Who Care showcased a solid SPF50 sun cream called Naseweiss; and CMD Naturkosmetik joined the powder products trend with a foaming powder cleanser for hair. Let's also not the makeup remover glove based on natural plant fibres developed by emerging beauty brand Nakt. Crowd-funded start-up Fabel's multipurpose makeup sticks are hand-made in Berlin, based on fair trade shea butter and clad in locally-produced paper packaging. Eventually, DIY zero waste beauty brand Hello Simple, which started out with deo creams in 2016, has also recently brought out a lip-and-cheek colour stick. Some Asian exhibitors were able to participate in the show. Among them was Taiwanese beauty brand Naveen, which presented a sachet-free undereye mask. The cardboard-packaged mask set contains dry undereye masks with the serum packaged separately in a glass flacon. The zero-waste and water-free/water-conscious trend has also been driving product development in the oral care market. This product category was very prominent at Vivaness 2022, with a lot of water-free toothpaste alternatives such as tooth cleaning powders and tablets. Teethlovers, for example, introduced its range of four differently flavoured tooth cleansing powders in late 2020 while fellow German start-up Zahnheld and its stylishly packaged vegan toothpastes and toothpaste tabs were launched in 2021. German brand Apeiron presented a new mint-flavoured tooth cleaning powder with cardamom, neem and cloves, while Italian manufacturer Gala Cosmetici, formulated their new Bio Happy Whitening Tooth Powder with charcoal powder, eucalyptus and ginger essential oils. Plastic-free alternatives for manual tooth brushes and heads of electric/sonic toothbrushes were also a big trend at Vivaness 2022. There were also several exhibitors showing plastic-free and/or vegan interdental brushes or dental floss. Sweden's The Humble, one of the first European brands to launch bamboo handled manual toothbrushes back in in 2013, presented its recently launched replacement heads for electric toothbrushes which are made completely from renewable materials including cornstarch, bamboo and castor oil. German brand Truemorrow which was launched a couple of years ago also introduced replacement heads made from renewable raw materials as well as plastic-free and vegan dental floss (which comes packaged in glass or stainless steel according to preference). Localism was the third big trend visible on the show floor, with brands highlighting locally produced hand-made small batches or focusing on locally sourced actives and botanicals. Bavarian start-up brand Rose and Ann, for instance, manufactures rosehip kernel oil from food-waste rosehip kernels sourced from a local jam company. The upcycled, cold-pressed oils are then blended with plant stem cells. Fellow local start-up Raw Naturkosmetik produces its cold-pressed plant oil-based beauty products by hand. Based in Baden-Württemberg, the company says each product is based on a key oil, like poppy seed, pumpkin seed, black cumin or hemp. Spirit of Rügen is another recently launched German indie brand. Its products are hand-made on the small island of Rügen which is famous for its white chalk cliffs, and several of its beauty products feature the famous healing Rügen chalk. Dutch brand Van Toen Remedies showcased classic European apothecary style healing balms and lotions in a modern organic interpretation. The range includes a self-warming soothing balm, cooling lotions for sore muscles, a healing arnica lotion and plant-based vaseline. With their new range, Naked, German mass market beauty brand Hej Organic, showed that organic beauty can be just as functional as conventional cosmetic products. The new line offers a micellar water, serum, enzyme peeling and face cream formulated without fragrance components and with high percentages of targeted actives, like vitamin C, azelaic acid, bakuchiol and zinc PCA. The next Vivaness will take place at its usual winter dates, from 14th to 17th February 2023."
"Moss, McCartney...: holistic beauty is the new holy grail of celebrities","British model Kate Moss recently made a much noticed entry into the world of skincare with her brand ""Cosmoss by Kate Moss,"" and a short video revealing without any artifice, in fact without any clothing. The line, which aims to combine ""beauty & wellness,"" offers no mascara, no foundation, no lipstick, but rather skincare products, oils and drinks such as special tea blends, all designed as components of rituals to elevate body and mind. In short: raw holistic beauty. Holistic beauty in and of itself is not a new concept; Susanne Kaufmann, founder of the cosmetics brand of the same name, launched her approach to this idea nearly two decades ago. But it has made a comeback with the Covid-19 pandemic, as makeup sales collapsed with lockdowns, and the public turned to more natural and authentic products, ingredients, and lifestyle practices. Gone were the days of contouring, layering, and piling on cosmetics and makeup, replaced by a new approach to beauty based on caring for body and mind. These days it's all about approaching beauty in its entirety, under the spectrum of food, fitness, well-being, sleep, and of course cosmetics. All this with the help of natural ingredients, if possible, as well as science and new technologies. The objective is no longer to treat or cover, but to prevent, by strengthening the skin's natural powers. LED light, prebiotics, facial gymnastics and other types of facial massage are all techniques and ingredients that are very popular today for reinventing our beauty routines. Despite makeup sales bouncing back in the course of 2021, many celebrities - usually backed by beauty majors - intend to build on this concept with new launches in the skincare and body categories. Millie Bobby Brown was among the first to have tried to mine this niche with Florence by Mills, combining clean and vegan makeup and skincare, but without the well-being facet. Since then, other celebrities have followed suit. Hailey Bieber with Rhode Skin, Kim Kardashian with SKKN By Kim, which is ""at the intersection of elevated simplicity and innovative science"" via ""clean ingredients and technical formulas."" The whole thing is based on ethics and sustainability, two key words that can be found in most of these cosmetic lines. Other common points: a limited choice - with a focus on essentials - and a beauty routine that emphasizes time with long-lasting results. Whether fastidiously elaborated and explained or not, the concept of holistic beauty is indeed at the center of these new brands' communication strategy. It's the same thing with JLo Beauty, the brand by Jennifer Lopez, and even more so with The Outset, the label developed by Scarlett Johansson. But with Cosmoss, Kate Moss seems to want to go even further, with a line including tea to rid the body of its toxins, creams, a 'sacred' mist and an oil with CBD. ""Each product has been meticulously crafted with wellbeing in mind; each ritual opens a door to balance, restoration, and love,"" reads the brand's Instagram account. Last comer in the race, Stella McCartney has teamed up with the beauty division of the LVMH group to develop the skincare line, STELLA by Stella McCartney, with the aim to combine nature, efficiency and responsibility. The short range consists of three essential products: Reset Cleanser, Alter-Care Serum and Restore Cream. According to Éric Briones, co-founder of the Paris School of Luxury, and author of the book author of Luxe et digital, which will be released in October by French publisher Dunod, in Paris (not translated), ""beauty and well-being will be the new growth drivers for luxury."" This would explain, according to him, the mushrooming of celebrity-owned or endorsed beauty lines. Especially since ""investing with a celebrity is much safer than with a young unknown brand, because you start with a fan base"" which can reach millions of people."
'Clean' beauty trend to drive growth of the Philippines' skincare market,"The skincare market in the Philippines will be primarily driven by the make-up remover category, with the overall fastest value CAGR of 7.8% during the 2021-2026 period, followed by facial care with a projected CAGR of 7.7%, found GlobalData in a recent report['[Philippines Skincare Market Size by Categories, Distribution Channel, Market Share and Forecast, 2021-2026', March 15, 2022]]. As COVID-19 restrictions ease and people begin venturing out for work and social activities, consumers are naturally paying more attention to their personal appearance with 'clean' beauty products trending on social media and proving popular. These products are usually formulated with a simpler ingredients list, are quick and easy to use, and serve a multipurpose. ""Consumers are seeking effective and convenient methods to rejuvenate their skin without using multistep skincare regimens, which is why multipurpose products with high quality and more natural ingredients are growing in popularity,"" said Likitha Nalluri, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData. Per capita expenditure (PCE) of skincare in the Philippines increased from USD 4 in 2016 to USD 4.6 in 2021, which was lower than the global average of USD 9.8, and the regional average of USD 9.2 in 2021 due to the lower consumer spending power of the developing economy. By 2026, the PCE on skincare in the Philippines is expected to increase by a third to reach USD 6.1, according to GlobalData. Convenience stores were the leading distribution channel in the Philippines' skincare market in 2021, followed by hypermarkets and supermarkets, direct sellers, health & beauty stores, chemists and pharmacies, para pharmacies and drugstores. Unilever, Procter & Gamble, and Natura & Co were the top three companies in the Philippines' skincare market by value in 2021, and Pond's and Olay were the leading brands. ""The resurgence of household disposable incomes, consumer confidence, and the return to offices will boost demand for skincare products in the Philippines. The 'clean' beauty trend will continue gaining momentum, thereby spurring the launch of more natural and sustainable skincare products,"" concluded Likitha Nalluri."
The global nail care market is expected to grow rapidly for the next ten years,"The global nail care market - which was valued at USD 10.9 billion in 2021 - is estimated to reach USD 23.1 billion by the end of 2031, according to a study by Transparency Market Research (TMR). According to the market research firm, the global sales of nail care products (nail colours, nail care products, accessories) are likely to develop at a CAGR of 8.0% during the forecast period, from 2022 to 2031. In terms of products, the nail colour segment represents the most significant part of the nail care market. In this segment, the liquid nail colour sub-segment holds the largest market share and is followed by gel nail colour. This trend is projected to continue throughout the forecast period. Nevertheless, the nail treatment segment is likely to grow at a faster pace than the overall market. Sales are expected to grow in all geographic zones as women around the globe are becoming more independent and are investing a significant portion of their disposable income in grooming and beauty products. In 2021, Asia Pacific accounted for the major share of the global nail care market, followed by North America. The region is prognosticated to maintain its leading position in the nail care market throughout the forecast period, owing to many factors including a surge in the adoption of advanced technologies in different nail care products such as nail varnishes with special effects and bold colours, or long-lasting traditional manicures. Similarly, the increase in the use of latest finishes including glitter polishes, matte top coats, and magnetic nail polish in several developing nations including China and India is bolstering the Asia Pacific nail care market, note analysts at TMR. In addition to the surge in the interest about the nail care among the global population, TMR also points out the growing importance of social media exposure across the globe as a key growth driver in the nail care market. Indeed, according to TMR, women's increased exposure to beauty enthusiasts and influencers through social media is boosting the interest for nail care across all demographics. While younger nail care consumers are more likely to wear nail paint to express their personality and keep up with current trends, older consumers are increasingly interested in products with nail care benefits. Companies in the nail care market are therefore increasing R&D efforts in order to provide next-gen products that can moisturize, strengthen, and make nails smoother. Some key players are also investing heavily in order to develop products that are specifically intended for the older population, add the authors of the report. However, rising concerns regarding the components in certain nail products is the main impediment to the category growth, note TMR analysts. Camphor, toluene, formaldehyde, and di-butyl phthalate, for instance, are pointed out as possible sources of side-effects or health problems. As a consequence, consumers are increasingly looking for more natural solutions but are not ready to make compromise on product functionality."
Export: Towards a record year 2022 for French cosmetics?,"The year 2022 should confirm the strong momentum observed last year for French beauty exports. Indeed, the French cosmetics industry's exports rose by 19% during the first five months, compared to the same period in 2021, according to the French Federation of Beauty Companies (FEBEA). The first months of the year were marked by a very strong demand in the US. With an almost 32% increase, for a total of 2 billion euros of exports over this period, the US is ahead of China again, as the first export destination of made-in-France cosmetics. In Europe, Germany remains the main destination for French exports, with an equally impressive 32% sales increase. However, the Chinese market, the main growth driver over the past few years, has been less dynamic due to the sanitary restrictions implemented in the second quarter 2022. French cosmetics exports to this country still rose by 9% from January to May 2022, compared to the same period last year. Makeup and perfumes were the two most dynamic export categories during the first semester 2022. The products most exported to China are still lipsticks. As a reminder, in 2021, France exported more than one lipstick out of three to China. Perfumes are right behind. Perfumes are the top-selling products in the US and Germany. Then, there is eye makeup, in the US, and lipsticks, in Germany. If things keep going at this pace, the French cosmetics industry, which already exports 60% of its production, could beat new records. ""This strong increase confirms that French cosmetics still make people dream all around the world! We can definitely hope to reach 20 billion euros of exports in 2022,"" says Emmanuel Guichard, General-Delegate of the FEBEA, although he explains that these good results are also due to the increased value of the dollar, compared to the euro. ""With a value chain firmly anchored in the French industrial network, the cosmetics sector manages to keep producing and exporting despite supply shortages,"" concludes Emmanuel Guichard. In 2021, total French exports of cosmetic products had reached 16.2 billion euros."

United Kingdom: Prestige beauty sales benefit from the premiumisation trend,"Sales of super-sized and potent formula prestige beauty products report double digit growth in the six months of 2022 in the United Kingdom, according to The NPD Group. The prestige beauty market was valued at GBP 926 million in the first half of 2022, an increase of 23% on the same period in 2021. According to the market research firm, this dynamism is linked to the trend of premiumisation where consumers upgrade their beauty purchases to include larger sizes and more potent formulas. Consumers also appear to be upgrading their purchases to items with a higher price point, a trend observed in the foundation market. The average sales price of prestige beauty products in the first half of 2022 increased by 8%, compared to the same period last year. The premiumisation trend is most evident in the prestige fragrance market. Both men's and women's Eau de Parfum and Perfume formats have increased in importance and are growing faster than the rest of the market. In the first half of 2022 sales of women's perfume formats rose 137% compared to the same period in 2021 and sales of men's perfume formats doubled at 100% in the same period. Total sales of women's fragrance juices (including formats like Eau de Toilette, Eau de Parfum and Perfume) increased 34% and sales of fragrance juices over 100ml in size rose 50% in the first half of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. Sales of fragrance juices in the first half of 2022 with a retail price over GBP 125 now equate to 11% of the mix of total fragrance sales compared to 7% of the mix of total fragrance sales in the first half of 2021. Sales of these products with a retail price of GBP 125 and above increased 91% in the first half of 2022, compared to the sales for the total fragrance market where the uptick was 33%. The average sales price of prestige foundations was GBP 30 in the first half of 2022, an increase of 10% compared to the same period last year. This is driven by innovation and newly launched products. The top five new foundation products launched in the first half of 2022 have an average sales price between GBP 32.45 and GBP 37.69, demonstrating the impact of premiumization in this sub-segment. The average sales price for women's skincare products increased 7% in the first half of 2022, compared to the same period last year. Women's prestige skincare sales were up 8% year-on-year whilst mid-range skincare sales increased just 4%, indicating that women are opting for more premium products with a higher price point. ""Consumers are increasingly choosing to buy more premium products with a higher average sales price in the prestige beauty market. While we recognize that there is pressure on people's expenditure now, and people are seeking better value for money, and larger sizes and more potent formulas are more cost effective to buy,"" explains Emma Fishwick, Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. ""We believe that people are buying less and upgrading their purchases to those with more innovative formulations (as in make-up and skincare) and in fragrance they are opting for more expensive bottles and the most potent fragrance formulas. There is also the lure of premium brands where people can 'buy into' designer brands in an affordable way."""
"Cosmoprof North America completes its 2022 edition with 32,000 visitors","Cosmoprof North America successfully concluded its 19th edition from July 12-14, 2022, at the Las Vegas Convention Center, a shift from the Mandalay Bay Convention Center previously. The trade show welcomed attendees from across the globe at its new location across a new two-hall format which saw Cosmopack North America, the event dedicated to the entire beauty supply chain, with its dedicated hall for the first time. Throughout the three-day event, 32,000 retailers, distributors, investors, beauty brands, suppliers, and the press connected with over 1,100 exhibiting brands to discover new product launches and facilitate business. In addition to the new location and two-hall format, the 19th edition also unveiled a new categorization of finished products into four macro categories: hair care, skin care & makeup, nails, and natural products. Alongside these macro-categories were the return of special areas Discover Beauty, Discover Beauty Spotlights, Discover Green, and The Beauty Vanities, in addition to the Country Pavilions, featuring brands organized by international delegations from Argentina, Chile, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Italy, Korea, Morocco, and Spain. New special areas Discover Black-Owned Beauty, highlighting Black-owned and founded beauty brands that was curated in collaboration with The Beauty International Group, and Beauty Tech, highlighting companies providing the latest technological and digital solutions, made their debuts in the West Hall and North Hall respectively. The show also saw the return of the Buyer Program, connecting exhibitors with leading retailers, e-commerce platforms, international buyers, distributors, and brands including Aminco, Bloomingdale's, Cos Bar, The Detox Market, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Revlon, Shiseido, and Space NK along with first-time participants Target and Coupang, South Korea's largest online marketplace.

Entrepreneur Academy, a unique one-day intensive workshop for up-and-coming beauty entrepreneurs, was sold-out, as was the newly offered Cosmopack Education, with each of its nine beauty supply chain-centered sessions standing room only. Also returning was the CosmoTrends report, featuring trends showcased among exhibitors, including FILL IT UP (refillable beauty), LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX, SUPERCHARGED SERUMS, TEXTURED TRESSES, ETHICALLY SOURCED, and WFH SPA, and the Cosmoprof and Cosmopack North America Awards, which honored the best in beauty among exhibitors across seven categories live at the event. Both initiatives were conducted in strategic partnership with Beautystreams. Other notable highlights of the show included Boutique, the onsite sampling bar featuring deluxe-sized samples from 20 brands with proceeds donated to Strength In Beauty (A CUT IT OUT® grant for industry professionals), and the Press Zone, which connected exhibitors with influencers and press from leading publications like Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, Refinery29, NewBeauty Seventeen, and Women's Wear Daily for one-on-one meetings. Also, the newly launched Innovation Studio at Cosmopack, showcasing innovation in the beauty supply chain across two installations on the show floor: LIFESCAPES, also in collaboration with BEAUTYSTREAMS, and Packaging Power!, presented by the FIT's Packaging Design BFA Program. Cosmoprof North America will celebrate its 20th edition at the Las Vegas Convention Center on July 11-13, 2023."
Dopamine beauty: When colour and makeup make a powerful comeback!,"What if makeup would have a positive effect on mood? This is one of the explanations given for the famous ""lipstick index"", which means that lip makeup sales skyrocket during or after crises. After the profusion of natural and authentic beauty looks seen since the beginning of the pandemic, colour appears to make a powerful comeback, precisely to give a much-needed lift in morale! Researchers at France's National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) have described dopamine as a chemical substance used as a neurotransmitter that produces a state of satisfaction. While a lack of dopamine can lead to a drop in motivation, mood swings or significant fatigue, it is possible to naturally boost its production through certain foods rich in tyrosine, such as avocado, banana, and of course chocolate, as well as through exercise, exposure to sunlight, or enjoying certain activities like listening to music or simply stroking an animal. But chromatherapy - or colour therapy - could also promote happiness, hence the rise of #dopaminebeauty - also known as #dopaminemakeup - which has taken over social networks in recent weeks. Just type the hashtags #dopaminebeauty and #dopaminemakeup into TikTok, and you'll soon see a joyous riot of colours. Rainbow or two-tone eyeshadows, in bold, vibrant shades, multicoloured eyeliner, and glitter galore, all seem to have invaded the social network, and for good cause. The idea is to indulge all imaginable fantasies — within reason — with vivid, zesty colours, temporary tattoos, stickers and more. In short, it's about having fun. And for the less daring, this can simply be a matter of stepping up their makeup doses, whether it's blush, lipstick or lip gloss, or showing some flights of fancy in small touches. Those who don't have to go as far as fluorescent eyeshadow, can still try adding a line of coloured eyeliner, a mouth-watering lip colour, or even flashy nail polish to draw attention to their hands. On TikTok, there's even a #dopaminenails hashtag, which is all about using bold shades on the nails to feel better…"
Lipsticks regain colour and bank on customization,"After two years of slowdown, the makeup category is growing again, both in the US and Europe. ""There is a sort of catch-up phenomenon,"" explains Mathilde Lion, Expert Beauty Europe at The NPD Group. ""Today, makeup is the most dynamic category of Prestige sales, compared to 2021, with a +42% growth rate between January and May 2022 in European countries including the Big 5 [1],"" she explains. ""However, it is still -23% compared to 2019, so there is still a long way to go."" According to NPD, lipsticks represent one of the most dynamic segments since the beginning of the year, with a +74% growth, compared to 2021 in Europe. ""But it is still 48% lower than 2019, whereas the nail segment has completely recovered: it has even achieved a 5% growth, compared to 2019. As such, it is a reversal in trends, because the pre-Covid years had been marked by a sharp decline of this segment,"" says Mathilde Lion. This growth is mainly due to the share of 'long-lasting' products, which are doing well with 60% of lipstick sales, compared to 56% in 2019. ""Today, long-lasting lipsticks are a must-have, but natural ingredients, symbiosis with skincare, and refills are also very strong trends. We will see whether the refill concept lasts when refill sales statistics get significant,"" explains Mathilde Lion. At the peak of the crisis, eco-design and customization innovations helped boost these products. At the CES 2021 show, YSL Beauté, a brand of the L'Oréal Group, showcased Rouge Sur Mesure Powered by Perso, the first connected device to create your own customized lipstick at home. This device makes a lipstick in just a few minutes… Maison M Paris developed a similar technology: the brand devised a customization concept of a new kind soon to be marketed. Consumers will choose three shades among the 60,000 colours available, on their own or according to an AI recommendation based on a photo diagnosis. The three shades will then be inserted in a 'stick', so users can simply switch from one colour to another, depending on their moods or on the occasion. The liquid shades are produced in single units based on a technology patented by the brand. ""Brands offer plenty of colours and 80% of women have more than three shades at home. So, we imagined a system to unite them in only one lipstick. It is more convenient, greener, and completely customized,"" says Marie Rocchisani, the concept creator. The long-wear, no transfer liquid formulas of this 3-in-1 product are composed of ingredients of natural origin. Each capsule can be refilled independently of the others. The Maison M lipstick will be available online for about 49 euros, and the refill will cost about 29 euros. In the long run, the brand founder plans to install her patented system in stores, where the product will be made upon request with the help of a beauty advisor. Following the same principle, since December 2021, the young, independent French brand Bâton Rouge has offered customers to make their own tailor-made lipstick in a store. After four years of technical and regulatory developments, the brand opened its first point of sale in the Marais neighbourhood in Paris. With the help of a professional makeup artist, customers can create their own shade among infinite possibilities and choose the perfume and texture they want to get a unique lipstick. ""All colour shades, all tones and undertones are possible. Customers can also pick up a perfume among a choice of five – they are all 100% natural and free from allergens – and one texture: liquid, solid, satin, matte, or one with natural ingredients. The market, in particular the French market, lacked such a concept,"" says Christelle Percheron, the creator of Bâton Rouge. The customized colour is created with the makeup artist during the sampling phase, based on pigments pre-dispersed in castor oil. Customers test the sample on their lips and modulate it until they are satisfied with the result. ""We can play with all shades – red, pinky red, orange, or blue – like a painter playing with pigments to lighten, darken, or fade a colour,"" describes the founder. Once the choice has been validated, the stick is made straight away, in just a few minutes. Bâton Rouge boasts an eco-responsible, transparent approach, with products made upon request in their laboratory-store. Solid formula packs can be refilled and the products are presented in pouches made from organic cotton as secondary packaging. ""We make products upon request, so there is no stock, no waste. Our customers mainly come for the experience: for the tailor-made colour, the experience with the makeup artist. It is definitely a moment of pleasure for them. And the eco-responsible approach is a real plus,"" says Christelle Percheron. These new consumption patterns can definitely put a smile (back) on people's faces!"
Fragrances: The main driving trends of the 12th edition of Esxence,"This 2022 edition was marked by the presence of floral notes. After two gloomy years, brands are encouraging us to see ""life infused with roses"". The queen of flowers dominated the launches of the first half of the year (Diptyque's L'Eau Rose, L'Artisan Parfumeur's Mémoire de Roses, Tom Ford's three new roses, Guerlain's La Petite Robe Noire Rose Rose Rose, Chanel's Paris-Paris...). A trend confirmed at Esxence, where roses were ever-present, like Rose Ardoise by Atelier Materi, a blend of Centifolia and Damascena roses, with spicy notes on a mineral base, or Jardin des Avelines by Pont des Arts, a balmy, woody rose by Bertrand Duchaufour. White flowers are not outdone, prized for their luminous and positive character, like Isabey's Avant et Après, a lovely sunny composition refreshed by a salty breeze. Long shunned as ""outdated"", lily of the valley, a symbol of happiness, is making its comeback (Eau Guillerette, by Anatole Lebreton). Brands are continuing to explore the ""feel good"", sweet and reassuring side of orange blossom, which is very much in vogue. But confinements have also revived the desire to reconnect with nature, a phenomenon that also applies to niche perfumery. Green notes are reinvented with a vegetal approach, to express a need for a breath of fresh air, a return to green areas. This thirst for exoticism also draws on the freshness of marine notes. For a few years now, aquatic notes have been making a comeback, in a play of contrasts with amber, woody and gourmand accords... This trend is enhanced by a strong presence of mineral and iodine facets reminiscent of summer days, from ocean spray to sun-kissed skins. Uermi's Il Solo Dentra, by Pierre Guéros (Symrise), is a good example of this trend, combining sunny and salty notes with the green breath of geranium on a gourmand base. The time has come for olfactory nomadism. Brands have understood this and are focusing on lightness, offering 30, 20 or 10 ml bottles. Smaller sizes are more suitable for consumers who regularly switch from one fragrance to another. A trend that is also in line with the layering trend, which is very much in vogue at the moment. Indeed, ""traditional"" niche brands, such as L'Artisan Parfumeur or Parfums de Rosine, encourage their customers to combine fragrances within their range. This is part of the DNA of Olibanum, the new brand of Gérald Ghislain, founder of Histoire de Parfums, who presents incense notes combined with duos of ingredients, presented in 12 and 50 ml bottles, to layer according to one's desires. In perfumery too, the trend of naturalness is gaining momentum. Many brands claim to have 95% natural ingredients in their formulas, like Bastille Parfums. A bias that can be found in a growing number of brands, even if it is not their primary concept (Obvious, Cherigan...). Others are making the 100% natural their identity, like Floratropia, Parfumeurs du Monde or Hiram Green, an artisanal brand whose fragrances are surprisingly complex for this type of product. Alongside the natural trend, there is a real appetite for technological innovations. Headspace, the new brand founded by Nicolas Chabot (Le Galion, Aether) made quite a splash in Milan. An original project, based on the headspace technique, a new extraction method that allows capturing the scent of a plant when it is impossible with classic extraction techniques. An opportunity to discover compositions that enhance skin headspaces, champagne, or nature after a storm... Finally, there is a growing number of brands with an ecological stance, in terms of packaging (recyclable materials, refillable bottles) and sourcing of ingredients (upcycling, biodegradable materials). This is the concept of the Obvious brand created by David Frossard, based on eco-responsible perfumery: organic alcohol, recycled and recyclable glass bottles, agglomerated cork caps from wine cork production waste, recyclable cellophane-free paper cases. Many brands are taking on this environmental issue (Cherigan, The Different Company, Stéphanie de Bruijn...). A trend that is as commendable as it is unavoidable, although the frantic number of launches may call into question the paradox of this ""sustainability"". A pace that is not likely to slow down, considering the new products and labels that have marked this 12th edition of Esxence."
How #Barbiecore is bringing gender extremes back to the forefront of fashion,"The post-pandemic period is ultimately quite surprising! Not only many women have decided to move on from the comfort of sweatpants to embrace more extravagant clothing styles, bright colours and mismatched patterns, but some of them are choosing to dress like Barbie... Dubbed ""Barbiecore"", the trend imposes all things pink, ultra-short, ultra-tight and ultra-kitsch, the exact opposite to non-gendered fashion. The #Barbiecore wardrobe is stereotypical in the extreme - channeling fun, glamour and ramped up femininity - close to the aesthetic of the video of late-1990s Barbie Girl song, by Danish band Aqua, that was an ode — albeit an ironic one — to the dream life of the popular plastic doll. This aesthetic, inspired by Barbie's world, above all translates into an explosion of pink, a colour already adopted by a host of stars across the Atlantic. Megan Fox didn't miss the opportunity to step out in the shade when attending the premiere of the documentary about her dear and beloved Machine Gun Kelly, aptly titled ""Life in Pink."" She took to the red carpet in a Barbie-esque outfit. An experience that she repeated the following days on the streets of New York. But the American actress is far from the only one taking style cues from Barbie. Hailey Bieber posted a picture on Instagram showing her wearing an outfit directly inspired by the world of the famous doll — a pink skin-tight mini-dress and XXL platform boots. Similarly, the now blonde Kim Kardashian went as far as accessorizing her metallic pink outfit with a matching handbag adorned with multiple glittering embellishments. Meanwhile her sister Khloe posted pictures of herself looking like Barbie in a pink latex minidress with pink shoes and blonde locks. After two particularly gloomy years, the idea is to show off and have fun, summer being the ideal season to do both. This is precisely what could make this trend last! life of this born! Born with the first images of the filming of Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the #Barbiecore wave could survive the summer. The fall-winter 2022 shows proved a real ode to pink, starting with Valentino, which splashed the shade on dozens of looks, both in women's and men's styles. But the fashion house isn't alone in bringing pink to its collections. Michael Kors, Versace, Act No. 1 and Dolce & Gabbana are among the brands that hope to keep pink-tinted fashion on the agenda for a few more months."
Natural personal care products market reached USD 12.5 billion in 2021,"Global sales of natural and organic personal care products have reached USD 12.5 billion last year, according to a new research by Ecovia Intelligence [1]. The global market revenues increased by 5.4 percent in 2021. However, the market research firm expects slower growth in 2022 as rising raw material prices, inflation and economic uncertainty are having a negative impact on sales. Most natural and organic personal care product sales are from North America and Europe, but Asia is the market showing the highest growth, with revenues increasing exponentially over the last decade. ""High investment is coming into the Asian natural and organic products market, with large cosmetic firms launching their own lines whilst the financial community is investing in established brands"", said Ecovia Intelligence. Furthermore, new players continue to enter the natural and organic personal care products market. L'Oréal and Unilever are the leading multinationals acquiring natural and organic brands. Another strategy consists in launching natural or organic versions of best-selling products. Colgate-Palmolive, for instance, launched their first COSMOS certified natural toothpaste in mainstream retailers in Europe. Product innovations are also stimulating market growth; Carrefour, one of Europe's largest retailers, launched the Soft Green brand last year. The Carrefour Soft Green range has certified organic soaps and solid shampoos in plastic-free packaging. O'Right and Upcircle Beauty are two brands using upcycled ingredients in their natural personal care ranges. Widening distribution is another major driver of market growth. Natural food shops and organic food shops are the traditional sales channels; they still comprise most sales in Europe and North America. Distribution of natural and organic personal care products is increasing in department stores, beauty retailers, pharmacies and drugstores. Online retailing and digital marketing have become more important since the pandemic. Eventually, Ecovia Intelligence finds the number of natural & organic standards is growing. There are now over 30 standards worldwide; COSMOS and NATRUE are the frontrunners. Initially adopted in Europe, both standards now have an international following. Almost 40,000 personal care products are now certified according to these standards."
"U.S. consumers are back to their former makeup habits, NPD finds","""As women get dressed up again, makeup is a natural accompaniment,"" said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. ""The recovery and creativity of the makeup category is leading sales gains for the prestige beauty industry in 2022. After a gloomy period shrouded by the pandemic, we are seeing a renaissance in makeup artistry, as consumers experiment with color again."" In fact, about 70% of makeup wearers in the U.S. have returned to previous routines or are wearing more makeup than they did last year, according to The NPD Group, and the use of several makeup products is on the rise. Findings from the 2022 ""Makeup Attitudes and Usage Report"" from NPD show that mascara is the most used makeup product overall, followed by foundation, eye shadow, eye liner, and lipstick. In the U.S., sales revenue of the prestige makeup category grew by 22%, from January through May 2022, versus last year. That's more than twice the rate of skincare, and faster than fragrance, according to Retail Tracking Service data from NPD. Women report that they primarily wear makeup to enhance their appearance; however, Gen Z and Millennial women wear makeup mainly to boost their confidence. Across generations, almost 30% of women wear makeup because they say it brings them joy. ""The pandemic shifted our definition of wellness, moving it beyond the physical to be more about mental health and well-being,"" Jensen said. ""Makeup products are satisfying an emotional need to look good and feel better about ourselves."" NPD's data are comforted by figures recently released by Global Data, which found that 46% of US women have used more makeup in 2022 than during the pandemic: A similar trend was observed in France where prestige makeup sales were up 8% during the week starting March 14, 2022 when the obligation to wear a mask in all public venues was lifted. While broader figures have not been released to date, there are reasons to be optimistic as most European countries have returned to growth and to an almost normal social life, and as tourists are flocking back to usual European summer destinations. In China, however, the COVID-19 outbreak during the second half of March, led to regional lockdowns and an increase in mask use that caused prestige e-commerce beauty sales to decline 1% for the month. According to NPD, makeup and fragrance categories experienced respective declines of 6% and 4% in March 2022, compared to last year. While restrictions were maintained in April and part of May in some major cities, including Shanghai, the situation has improved at then end of May, just in time for the kick off of China's 618 Shopping Festival."
"Short hair, don't care: Saudi working women embrace cropped locks","The haircut — known locally by the English word ""boy"" — has become strikingly visible on the streets of the capital, and not just because women are no longer required to wear hijab headscarves under social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler. As more women join the workforce, a central plank of government efforts to remake the Saudi economy, many describe the ""boy"" cut as a practical, professional alternative to the longer styles they might have preferred in their pre-working days. For Safi, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym to preserve her anonymity, the look also serves as a form of protection from unwanted male attention, allowing her to focus on her patients. ""People like to see femininity in a woman's appearance,"" she said. ""This style is like a shield that protects me from people and gives me strength."" At one salon in central Riyadh, demand for the ""boy"" cut has spiked — with seven or eight customers out of 30 requesting it on any given day, said Lamis, a hairdresser. ""This look has become very popular now,"" she said. ""The demand for it has increased, especially after women entered the labour market. The fact that many women do not wear the hijab has highlighted its spread"" while spurring even more customers to try it out, especially women in their late teens and twenties,"" she said. The lifting of the headscarf requirement is just one of many changes that have reordered daily life for Saudi women under Prince Mohammed, who was named as the heir to his 86-year-old father, King Salman, five years ago. Saudi women are no longer banned from concerts and sports events, and in 2018 they gained the right to drive. The kingdom has also eased so-called guardianship rules, meaning women can now obtain passports and travel abroad without a male relative's permission. Such reforms, however, have been accompanied by a crackdown on women's rights activists, part of a broader campaign against dissent. Getting more women to work is a major component of Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030 reform plan to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on oil. The plan initially called for women to account for 30 percent of the workforce by the end of the decade, but already that figure has reached 36 percent, assistant tourism minister Princess Haifa Al-Saud told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. ""We see women today in every single job type,"" Princess Haifa said, noting that 42 percent of small and medium-sized enterprises are women-owned. Many working women interviewed by AFP praised the ""boy"" cut as a tool for navigating their new professional lives. ""I am a practical woman and I don't have time to take care of my hair,"" said Abeer Mohammed, a 41-year-old mother of two who runs a men's clothing store. ""My hair is curly, and if my hair grows long, I will have to spend time that is not available to me taking care of it in the morning."" Saudi Arabia has traditionally outlawed men who ""imitate women"" or wear women's clothing, and vice versa. But Rose, a 29-year-old shoe saleswoman at a Riyadh mall, sees her close-cropped hair as a means of asserting her independence from men, not imitating them. It ""gives me strength and self-confidence... I feel different, and able to do what I want without anyone's guardianship"", said Rose, who did not want to give her full name. ""At first my family rejected the look, but over time they got used to it,"" she added. Such acceptance partly reflects the influence of Arab stars like actress Yasmin Raeis or singer Shirene who have adopted the style, said Egyptian stylist Mai Galal to AFP. Nouf, who works in a cosmetics store and preferred not to give her family name, described the message of the ""boy"" cut this way: ""We want to say that we exist, and our role in society does not differ much from that of men."" Short hair, she added, is ""a show of women's strength""."

"A staple of the 1990s, permanent makeup is on the rise as a beauty go-to","The pandemic, through its lockdowns and mask wearing, disrupted the beauty routine of many women around the world. Gone are lipsticks, contouring and other techniques to achieve a perfect complexion. The focus has now shifted to skincare, which has replaced cosmetics intended to camouflage all sorts of imperfections rather than actually improving skin texture. And it's a trend that appears to be persisting beyond the pandemic, even if mask wearing is no longer mandatory in many countries around the world. These changes have helped bring back one trend that was thought to have fallen by the wayside: permanent makeup. Very popular in the 1990s, permanent makeup techniques are once again winning over those in search of a more natural beauty look. That might sound paradoxical, but it actually makes sense. Beauty is no longer about spending hours in the bathroom plastering on layers of foundation, concealer and other correctors, but about enhancing the eyes and mouth through perfectly shaped — and subtly tinted — eyebrows and lips. Actually, permanent makeup is, in fact, closer to the art of tattooing than to makeup, but with one key difference: it most often relies on dermopigmentation. In other words, it involves introducing a coloured substance — a pigment — via micro-needles into the superficial layer of the dermis (or skin) — much less deep than a tattoo, and therefore less permanent since the pigments decompose over the years. It is most often used to add colour to a specific area, whether to fill out sparse eyebrows, to redraw the contour of the lips, to add colour to pale lips, or even to enhance the eyes. If permanent makeup may have traumatized many people in the 1990s, techniques have evolved in recent years to offer a more natural — and discreet — result. Gone are the days of leaving a beauty parlour with frozen-in-place eyebrows, or worse, with an ultra-contrasting lip outline. The goal today is to save time with a natural but enhanced look focusing on pale shades, allowing yourself the luxury of skipping a few steps in your daily routine, but without going overboard. This is a concept that's well understood by today's professionals, who now offer all these services. Permanent makeup techniques are many and varied, but a lot of the options involve eyebrows. Microblading (1.8 billion views on TikTok) is undoubtedly one of the most common techniques, since it can reproduce a hair-like effect using pigments, and can therefore effectively reshape brows and thicken them according to the desired result. Microshading, on the other hand, uses pin-like dots to offer a more powdery finish, as if you'd used a simple eyebrow pencil. The more recent micrograyling technique works on the same principle, except that it is aimed at those with a more complex natural brow shape, and who simply want to reduce the sparse appearance. But permanent makeup is also a great ally for women whose lip contour has faded over time. Candy lips is one of the most popular techniques, which can redraw the outline of the lips through a process of micropigmentation, while also adding colour, thus creating a more voluminous effect. Some also use it to correct any potential asymmetry. And if you want to go even further, it is now possible to get an eyeliner line, or even an eyeshadow effect, applied permanently, in just a few sessions, or even to add a few freckles here and there, in line with a major trend of the moment. However, the main disadvantage of permanent makeup is that it sometimes lasts longer than trends. While permanent makeup fades with time — the duration depends on many factors such as age or sun exposure – one's should still think carefully before taking the plunge. For example, while thick eyebrows have been all the rage for several years, there have been several attempts to bring skinny brows back into fashion in recent months."
The top three beauty trends spotted at Cosmoprof Bologna 2022,"Most of the key trends spotted amongst the finished beauty products at Cosmoprof Bologna this year are related to sustainable, eco-friendly and climate-conscious lifestyles. This mega-trend has been gathering pace during the pandemic and is growing stronger and more inclusive every year. As a result plastic-free and zero waste brand concepts were visible everywhere on the show floor, as were water-conscious products in various iterations. Let's also note that vegan has become the norm for newcomer brands, especially those from the clean beauty and organic space. Solid hair and body care formats have been dominating beauty launches in recent years. However, many of the new bath and body care solids presented at the show had little to do with the classic square shampoo or shower bars, as newcomer and indie brands are coming up with ever more sophisticated product formulae and designs. Organic Korean beauty brand Urang Natural's new Moringa Healthy Scalp Shampoo Bar, for example, has been formulated with soap noodles which help generate an extra creamy foam, and with moringa extract for scalp-conditioning. The ovoid shape of the solid shampoo is comfortable to grip with wet hands and its rough surface lathers up quickly. Similarly, the Lithuanian solid beauty brand Solidu Cosmetics uses processed plant oils as a base in its Thyme Body Butter (rather than the more commonly used shea butter or cocoa butter) so the easy-grip hexagonally-shaped body moisturizer melts quickly into the skin without leaving it sticky. There was also a wave of solid face care launches at the show. Depending on their positioning, brands are marketing solid face care sticks as plastic-free/reduced packaging alternatives or as more convenient, fun and travel-friendly products. Korean beauty brand Cetena introduced several twist-up facial moisturizers including a Multi Balm formulated with avocado oil and macadamia oil. Fellow K-beauty brand Lovbod presented its new Dark Spots brightening stick formulated with soothing bisabolol and sweet almond oil to hydrate and lighten discoloured skin patches, while Canada's Attitude launched several solid face and body care ranges, including an entire line of cardboard-packaged sun care sticks with mineral filters. As dry products are much lighter, need less packaging and generate a lower CO2 footprint in terms of manufacturing and shipping, anhydrous beauty products - in the shape of tablets, powders or flakes - were also highly popular at the show. They also supply a fun DIY touch as they are designed to be reconstituted with water by the consumer at home. Lebanese brand Beesline received one of the show's Awards for its new Deodorizing Roll-On, a vegan deodorant tablet that turns into a liquid deodorant formula once dissolved in water. Organic beauty brand Ben & Anna from Germany, who originally started out with baking soda deodorants, has launched a compressed soap tablet available in two fragrance variants which can be used to create liquid hand soaps. Zero-waste also continued to be a popular concept in both product packaging and ingredients/formulations, with more and more brands using upcycled or rescued food waste ingredients. Vegan UK brand Upcircle Beauty was one of the first European body care brands to utilize food industry waste ingredients in its products - the company started out with bath and body care formulated with upcycled coffee grounds. Today Upcircle Beauty also uses other food waste by-products: the brand's recent hand wash and body lotion duo launch contains upcycled bergamot and kiwi fruit waters. And fellow British indie brand Fruu Cosmetics formulates its 40-sku range of solid hair, skin and body care products with food industry wastes such as fruit skins, pulp, juices and extracts. Brands also continued to highlight key ingredients in their products especially when sourced locally, combining transparency in terms of ingredients sourcing with localism and a pride in regional/national heritage. Swiss newcomer brand Chiara Zurich's 6-sku face care range is based on glacier water which is sourced from the Titlis mountain near Lucerne where the brand's founder comes from. Korean indie brand Sioris' recently launched The Only One gel-textured facial essence, which is based on Korean bellflower extract. Similarly, Danish organic company Unique's latest brand launch — vegan, gender-free face, body and hair care line Beauhe:it — contains a whole range of typically Scandinavian plant ingredients. Eventually, let's mention Irish brand Green Angel's new Hyaluronic Spheres Serum, which has been formulated with locally collected seaweed and algae extracts. This sharpened focus on ingredients can be traced back to the functional beauty trend which was also playing a major role at the show. Many brands presented active ingredients in the shape of intensive serums and ampoules. Classic actives like hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, retinol or niacinamide were especially visible in the ranges of brands such as Turkey's The Purest Solutions or UK's Nature Spell. However, there were also a number of brands highlighting pro-biotics and ferments as their key functional active, like South African brand Esse's Probiotic Serum. Personalisation continues to be a key source of innovation in beauty, in particular in categories such as face care. Cosmoprof Bologna 2022 featured a number of exhibitors showcasing different angles on product personalization. DIY concepts like active ingredients in serum/booster form to tweak beauty products or brands offering a neutral base cream plus suitable actives to customize a face cream are still popular. However, the advent of smart tech, digitalisation and DNA beauty is opening entirely new possibilities for consumers and brands alike. Spanish brand Lesielle's Adaptive Skin Care concept includes a small machine that mixes individual portions of skin care by combining actives with a base cream. Swiss beauty tech manufacturer Réduit received one of the Cosmoprof Awards for its new Booster, an AI-driven hand-held applicator for creams and lotions that promises more efficient ingredients delivery. Eventually, Genetica 23 from Italy offers personalized cosmetics based on DNA analysis, a detailed face scan analysis and comprehensive questionnaire."
"Wheat, oats, corn: grains are on the menu of new beauty routines","The pandemic has helped boost the success of many natural ingredients in cosmetics. As a result, grandma's own recipes are now all the rage on social media, riding the wave of DIY, with an emphasis on plants, seeds, and flowers that are perceived as safe for the skin and for the planet. Nettle, aloe vera, and tea are among the must-haves that have come back into fashion in recent months, as have broccoli, onions, and even mustard, which are more unusual. And if we were already betting on rice and flax as 2022 must-haves at the beginning of the year, it's finally all the grains — or almost all of them — that are getting ready to make their entry into bathrooms. Although we know the health benefits of consuming grains, which are rich in fibre and minerals, their benefits for the skin remain a mystery to many. In this respect, generalizations should be avoided because corn does not have the same properties as rice, oats or rye, thus affecting each type of skin and answering each need differently. Some of the most well-known are the moisturizing and anti-aging properties of wheat; the purifying, soothing, and regenerating qualities of oats; the nourishing power of sesame; and the multiple properties of rice, which combine all these benefits. A growing number of cosmetic brands are harnessing the power of grains, gradually integrating them into their formulas. Some have even made it their trademark. One such example is La Belle Meunière, which claims to be the first line of cosmetic products made with grains from French organic farming. From masks to scrubs, moisturizers, radiance serums and makeup remover oils, the brand offers everything you need for a complete routine, with the possibility of making some products yourself in DIY style. All guaranteed natural, vegan, made in France, and transparent. The beauty industry now uses grains in a wide range of products from vegetable oil to shampoo, and even more specific treatments such as eye creams. Aroma-Zone, for instance, offers vegetable oils made from rice bran, oats, sesame and wheat germ. All of which meet the many needs of skin, whether or not they are combined with other ingredients. Other brands choose to offer cosmetics in which the powers of grains are boosted by other ingredients. This is the case of Centifolia and its Sublime Jeunesse eye cream, which combines buckwheat [1] oil extracts and green micro-algae to reduce dark circles and puffiness while improving skin tone, and Body Nature's Soothing Shampoo, formulated with oat milk, barley water and sage infusion to cleanse and soothe the scalp. At The Body Shop, you'll find the Almond Milk with Oats Instant Soothing Mask to exfoliate the most sensitive skin, while Qiriness offers the Exfolys Rice Wrap to unclog and tighten pores. A growing number of all kinds of cosmetics that show a definite taste for the previously unsuspected powers of grains for the skin - and you may want to ask for more."
Ecocert believes in fair trade development in the cosmetics industry,"The pandemic has considerably impacted consumer habits. For more than 72% of French people, consuming less and better has become a requirement [1]. Inevitably, this consumption trend has impacted the cosmetics sector and brands have had to reinvent themselves. In 2021, the number of products certified organic or natural by Ecocert has increased by 30%. The French market for natural and organic cosmetics is also booming, with a growth of 12% in 2021, while sales of mainstream cosmetics are down by 6.1% [2]. Today, 74% of French people surveyed would like to have more information on the environmental and societal impact of the products they buy [3]. This is the whole point of certification, emphasises Ecocert, as it guarantees compliance with a stringent set of specifications. For instance, more than 29,000 products and 18,000 ingredients in some fifty countries are currently certified under the COSMOS Organic or Natural label by Ecocert. To go even further, the Ecocert Group is committed to labelling so-called ethical cosmetic products and ingredients with the Fair For Life (FFL) label. Created in 2006, Fair for Life is an international fair trade label for food products, cosmetics, textiles and handicraft products. It applies throughout the supply chain, from production to distribution, to secure supply chains and establish long-term fair contractual partnerships. This translates into long-term contractual commitments: a fair purchase price, a minimum guaranteed price, the financing of collective projects, a commitment to expected volumes, pre-financing, technical support... In 2021, the number of Fair For Life labelled beauty brands amounted to 33, with nearly 350 products. These figures are in fact quite low, considering the size of the global beauty market, but they could increase in the coming years with the redefinition of certain criteria as of 1 June 2022. The new version of the Fair For Life labelling standard seeks to adjust to the reality of the cosmetics market and to some products with complex formulas. Before this update, all ingredients were screened except for water, salt and minerals. From 1 June 2022, petrochemical preservatives and so-called complex ingredients of natural origin, which in practice cannot be labelled ethical and fair trade, will also be excluded. For Ecocert, the aim is to make the scheme available to more companies to help them structure themselves and commit to an increasingly ethical approach focused on people, their working conditions and fair remuneration. Over the past 15 years, Ecocert teams have seen the list of Fair For Life labelled cosmetic ingredients grow. The cosmetics industry's Fair Trade sectors offer some 80 increasingly diversified ingredients such as shea butter, argan oil, aloe vera, moringa, coconut oil, sesame oil, or illipe butter, recently labelled by Expanscience... ""Being Fair For Life labelled will enable brands to enhance the value of the raw materials they use in their cosmetic products,"" explains Pauline Raffaitin, Head of the Ecocert Home & Personal Care Business Unit. It is also an opportunity for some brands to consolidate their historical commitments. Hence, for Justine Humbert, Biodiversity & Sustainable Ingredients Manager at the L'Occitane Group, ethical cosmetics involve products which, ""through their manufacturing, distribution and use, respect both women and men (be they the company's employees, suppliers, partners or consumers) and the environment."" For L'Occitane, which boasts the double label - COSMOS and Fair For Life - for some of its ingredients and products, fair trade certification is both a proof of commitment in terms of trade practices and support to our partners, but also, specifies Justine Humbert, ""a highly structuring approach for securing our supplies."" A concern that could not be more topical!"
"""Jello Skin"": Korea's beauty routine that promotes firm and plump skin","K-beauty - or Korean beauty - remains one of the major drivers of the beauty trends that land thick and fast on TikTok. The latest in line is a new viral skincare trend called ""Jello Skin."" ""Jello Skin"" evidently refers to Jell-O, the brightly coloured gelatine dessert well known in the US and Canada. The account of TikTok influencer @glowwithava, who regularly shares tips and tricks with her 1.4 million followers, has become somewhat emblematic of this viral skincare trend - so much so that she even labels her various accounts with the #jelloskin hashtag - a hashtag that counts no less than 14.2 million views on TikTok. However, before being a beauty routine, ""Jello Skin"" is a way to describe firm, plump skin - bouncy like gelatin - and the many tips and tricks straight from Korea to achieve it. And, according to @glowwithava, it's all about one thing: collagen. In other words, if you want to have ""Jello Skin,"" you need to boost your production of collagen, a protein that slows down the effects of skin aging, but which gradually diminishes after the age of 30. According to the TikToker, diet, exercise, massage and skincare need to be mixed to get this firm and plump, almost bouncy-looking skin. A trends that eventually refers to the underlaying holistic beauty movement, which can be defined as taking an all-encompassing approach to beauty, from the inside out. Some of the things that @glowwithava advocates are adding collagen powder to one's yogurt at breakfast, applying sunscreen daily, exercising, or even applying masks with specific ingredients. But that's not all. To boost collagen production, again according to the influencer, it is also necessary to eat foods rich in vitamin C (red fruits, citrus fruits, certain green vegetables, or even certain cereals), to perform facial massages — with or without specific tools — and, of course, to use cosmetics enriched with anti-aging ingredients. A trend that seems to be gaining more and more followers around the world."
"Men are increasingly interested in manicures, and not on social media only","Men's interest in manicures seems to be steadily growing. And if rappers, singers and other famous actors have set the trend, it's now a whole generation of men who are stepping up to show that coloured and manicured nails are no longer (only) a thing for women. Beauty, like fashion, is progressively becoming a new form of self-expression, which interests women as much as men. Despite the best efforts of pioneering artists and celebrities, from David Bowie to Johnny Depp, who dabbled with more androgynous looks, the 2020 decade might appear to be a true turning point, with a real blurring of the boundaries between genders, especially in the cosmetics industry. Last March, European online beauty booking platform Treatwell unveiled a survey that reflected these changes. The survey showed that three in 10 French men, for instance, were willing to get a manicure and pedicure, and that manicures were one of the most popular services for men. The specialist site also noted a 23% increase in nail care before the holiday season. All in all, these figures suggest that such services are indeed meeting men's new demands. From the catwalks to the red carpets, via the music industry, or even street styles, men's manicures have recently become part of the routine for some celebrities, helping to make male nail care more popular worldwide. And we're not talking about black nails — often the standard of the punk or grunge look — but colored nails or nails decorated with patterns of all kinds. As often, Harry Styles appears as one of the leaders in this field, often posing or stepping out with perfectly groomed and painted nails. But he is not alone. ASAP Rocky, Lil Nas X, J. Balvin, Bad Bunny, Pete Davidson, Jared Leto, Marc Jacobs and Machine Gun Kelly are among the many men who have taken the plunge, making numerous appearances with nails painted in various colours. Une publication partagée par the Blonde Don (@machinegunkelly) The latter has even launched his own brand of unisex nail polish, UN/DN LAQR, reflecting the popularity of this trend, which seems on its way to become a standard beyond social networks."
"Quality over quantity: The pandemic has shifted beauty habits, found Kantar","In their report, 'On Trend: The evolving beauty consumer', Kantar analysed the purchase habits of more than 300,000 individual and households in 20 countries [1] and women's daily usage habits across seven major economies [2] to understand the impact of two years of coronavirus lockdowns, shifting priorities, and the continuation of the work from home culture. The data collected by Kantar shows a striking decrease in the weekly use of cosmetics in every market, with weekly usage down an average of 28% compared with pre-pandemic levels and down 31% compared with five years ago, as women choose simpler routines. The trend is particularly apparent amongst European beauty consumers who have significantly decrease their use of face and lip make-up, year-on-year. The study also identifies that more shoppers are opting for fewer, higher quality usage occasions. The focus is now on fewer, long-lasting beauty products that can be applied quickly. Actually, according to Kantar, the increase in premium beauty product usage along with a surge in demand for natural beauty products, which moved from, on average, 18% of sales in 2017 to 24% of sales in 2021, helped the market recover to pre-pandemic levels of revenue. Through the pandemic period, the percentage of women choosing to wear their hair longer grew from, on average, 58% of women in 2017 to 62% in 2021. Simultaneously, women chose to wash their hair less frequently, down almost 10% over five years to 2.8 times per week on average. Illustrating the premiumisation trend, despite falling usage, hair conditioners and treatments grew in sales value, generating 5% growth in 2020 (compared to 2019), and 7% growth in 2021 (compared to 2020). The premiumisation trend has been spearheaded by requirements for specific haircare solutions to help promote growth. For instance, products targeting specific hair conditions including hair loss and dandruff have grown 5 times faster than the overall shampoo market rate. Another underlying trend noted by Kantar is the growing awareness of consumers of beauty products regarding sustainability and safety issues. Hence, face and body products made from naturally produced ingredients represented 24% of sales in 2021, compared to 18% of sales in 2017. The largest increase is in France, where the shift was from 23% of consumers in 2019 to 32% in 2021. Environmentally conscious consumers are also willing to pay extra for sustainable and natural products, also highlighted Kantar. Eco-active households spend more than the average household on beauty products, with French Eco-Active households spending 5% more on beauty products per shopping trip. ""Though consumers are seeking simpler routines and a 'natural' look, this does not mean they will suddenly move away from beauty products. Consumers will binge on various products that respond to their changing demands,"" said Ashley Kang, Global Beauty Director of Kantar. In the skin care category, consumers will continue to focus on 'sustainable', 'natural' and 'derma' products. Furthermore, with growing number of females wearing hair long, hair and scalp treatments represent a growth major opportunity."

Social media trends: TikTok celebrates natural beauty,"Each week brings something new on TikTok. Users of the social network, which is usually bursting with beauty and makeup tips of all kinds, and sometimes totally wacky, now seem to aspire to a more natural, authentic approach. For several weeks, posts on the social media site favoured by the younger generations have been celebrating naturalness, self-assurance and diversity. Will the trend last? Nothing is less sure. But that doesn't stop users from expressing a growing interest in videos without filters, makeup, or other embellishments, striving to meet beauty criteria that aspire to a certain idea of perfection. If there is not (yet) any particular hashtag to spearhead this trend, it is mainly expressed through terms like 'no makeup', 'no makeup challenge' or 'no makeup trend.' American actress and singer Ashley Tisdale is one of the site's users who has decided to show themselves naturally, soundtracked by the song ""Tear in My Heart"" by Twenty One Pilots, which quickly became the official anthem of this new beauty trend. In a video posted at the end of March, the ""It's Alright, It's OK"" singer was first filmed with a filter giving her a glowing complexion and an ultra glamorous look. Then, in the blink of an eye, the filter disappears to reveal her au naturel, without the slightest hint of makeup, with the words ""I love a no makeup trend."" A post welcomed by many users of the social network, who did not fail to share their enthusiasm. ""I Love seeing celebs looking normal,"" one follower commented. Another user even said: ""This trend is so wholesome."" And it seems that this natural, makeup-free trend has spread like wildfire on the social network, with videos of the kind multiplying at great speed. For the first time in a long time, self-esteem is being celebrated on the social network, much to the delight of its users, who most often describe the trend as ""healthy"" or ""refreshing."""
Curls bounce back in Cairo as natural hair styles become trendy,"For Rola Amer and Sara Safwat, their curls were once a career-hindering nuisance. Now part of an aesthetic liberation movement sweeping Egypt in recent years, they own a curly hair salon that caters to women and men like them. Amer used to spend hours straightening her bouncy curls, she told AFP as she began her day at the Curly Studio, which became Egypt's first natural hair salon in 2018. ""Curly hair takes a lot longer to cut than straight hair,"" Amer said, meticulously snipping her way through a client's curly mane in an affluent suburb of Cairo. Three hours later, she can finally show the result to her client, and both are delighted as the salon buzzes around them. It's a far cry from Amer's own experience a few years ago. ""If I ever left my hair curly, I'd feel shaggy, like I wasn't taking care of myself,"" she said. In this rare type of salon in Cairo, the final product fits each client's curl pattern, and rollers have replaced straightening irons to prevent heat damage. Safwat, 38, thinks hair straightening, can be dangerous. The obsession with straight hair, rooted in what Safwat calls ""completely false beauty ideals,"" compelled generations of women to burn their hair to a crisp using chemical treatments and excessive heat damage. With her curls considered ""unprofessional"" Safwat says that, before she became a hairdresser, she would often be asked in job interviews: ""Will you be coming in to work like this?"" In the early 2000s, Lebanese singer Myriam Fares was one of the first curly-haired icons in the Middle East. Halfway across the world, Black women in the United States were increasingly embracing their curls in a natural hair care movement. Many of the biggest brands built by Black women at the time would eventually find their way onto the shelves of curly salons in Cairo. In 2012, Egyptian actress Dina el-Sherbiny became one of the first to break the taboo on screen, flaunting her chestnut curls in hit TV series ""Hekayat Banat"" (Girls' Stories). Ten years later, curly heads feature in TV shows, movies and the billboards that line Cairo's highways, a marked change in pop culture. In Hollywood, Egyptian-Palestinian actress May Calamawy even shows off her curls in Marvel's latest series, ""Moon Knight,"" helmed by Egyptian director Mohamed Diab. ""There has been a real social movement,"" Doaa Gawish told AFP. In 2016, Gawish launched a Facebook group called The Hair Addict to help women give their hair a break from harsh chemicals and blow dryers. Within months, the online forum had grown from 5,000 to more than 80,000 members, as the local cosmetics market grew by 18 percent, according to Euromonitor International. Two years later, Gawish launched her eponymous haircare company. ""A lot of big cosmetics companies started releasing products for curly hair, because they could see it was an essential customer base,"" she told told AFP. This base is steadily growing in Egypt's sizable cosmetics market. With a population of 103 million, the country has about 500,000 salons and more than three million employees, as estimated in 2020 by Mahmoud el-Degwy, head of the hairdressers' division at the Cairo Chamber of Commerce. Teacher and natural hair influencer Mariam Ashraf (photo) has seen the market's potential first-hand. Only a hobby at first, her Instagram videos quickly became ""a real source of income"", she told AFP before filming a new clip for her 90,000-plus followers. ""Brands are contacting me more and more to showcase curly hair products,"" the 26-year-old explained. ""And now modelling agencies are contacting me for advertisements."" But the world of natural hair care is not accessible to everyone. While the average monthly income in Egypt is 6,000 pounds (US$325), a haircut at the Curly Studio can cost up to one-tenth of that. Some men also give free rein to their curls. Since he inadvertently discovered his curls during Covid-19 lockdown, cybersecurity expert Omar Rahim has been gladly paying to maintain his style. Today, he maintains an intricate regimen, despite jeers from his friends in a conservative and patriarchal society. ""We have a problem with fragile masculinity; people think a man shouldn't take care of his hair or buy products,"" he told AFP. ""I want people to understand that this is normal, but I'm not ready to fight this fight just yet."""
#innerbeauty : New generation food supplements,"Holistic beauty, role of the microbiome, benefits of natural ingredients, need for targeted vitamins and trace elements, general atmosphere favourable to self-focus… all these factors have played a role in the boom of nutricosmetics. Just like English-speaking and Asian countries, the pioneers of this trend already familiar with the gesture, the French market has gradually gained importance, from pharmacies to new distribution channels. It has also developed new galenic forms, new categories, and new combinations to provide this product of pharmaceutical origin with its cosmetic dimension. If beauty from the inside is a notion already fixed in the minds of consumers fond of nutricosmetics, few brands clearly highlight topical cream + food supplement combinations in their offerings. Launched in 2017 by Sandra Gasmi, the natural and organic-certified brand Demain Beauty already does. ""In 1958, an apple contained 400 mg of vitamin C. Now it only has 4! There is nothing left. So, if we want to stay healthy and have a beautiful skin, we do need supplements. As soon as I launched the brand, I started developing food supplements that acted in synergy with our cosmetic products for maximum efficacy. That's why our products go in pairs,"" she explains. The glowing exfoliating cleansing gel Go for Glow is used with the Go for Detox supplement which cleans the body and plays on our glow, digestion and blemishes. The Go for Protection moisturizer and antioxidant + immunity supplement act hand in hand. And the Inside supplements will be added to the three anti-ageing skincare products recently launched. To combine the benefits of nutraceutics with the effects of cosmetics, the Anjac Health & Beauty group, whose 14 integrated companies contribute to creating and manufacturing cosmetic and health solutions and products, launched an original premium range of health complements last June. The Liver, Immunity, Stress, Sleep, Joint, and Energy solutions come in liquid products to be assimilated by the body four times better than solid forms. ""We created a core formula to protect the actives and prevent them from being destroyed in the stomach. Their quantity is four times higher when they arrive in the gut, where nutrients are absorbed, than that of solid food supplements,"" explains Matthieu Erre, PhD in Pharmacy at the Anjac group. In addition, the laboratory worked on the notion of compliance, because the regularity with which the product is taken over time is key for its efficacy. They also put their innovation know-how in the service of brands, influencers, and distributors with a B2B offering based on efficacy and taste in the form of nutraceutics (liquid solution, gummies…) and nutritional products (functional drinks and food). Coming soon: a resorbing physio gel and natural energy drinks to provide energy and beauty with a low glycemic index. A very well-adapted answer to the issue of compliance, gummies are currently the most trendy food supplements. In between a gelatine sweet and a health gesture, this new galenic form from the United States has appealed to a broader, younger panel of users. The global market should generate a turnover of 7.15 billion dollars by 2025, according to a Market Research Future study. Both sweet and fruity, this small tasty gum boasts a sensorial asset that capsules lacked, being more drug-like. ""It is much more pleasant to take two small gummies a day for two to three months than swallowing capsules. There is pleasure, and pleasure is the key to compliance. It is the main difference with standard food supplements,"" explains David Gueunoun, founder and CEO of the brand Les Miraculeux. Launched in 2019, the brand exclusively dedicated to this product category soon imposed itself as a forerunner and market leader, alongside competitor Lashilé. The two young French brands have since shared the market with the main pharmaceutical laboratories who have also adopted this new popular galenic form. ""The assets are compliance with the treatments and bioavailability, because sugar is a good carrier; the effects are quick to come. It is also easier, because you do not need a glass of water, you can take it anytime,"" confirms Fanny Adida, the co-founder of Lashilé. The brand puts forward the efficacy associated with the sweetness of its products. Every gummy contains 2.5 g of sugar, which makes 5 g a day for the recommended dose of two gummies. ""It represents the equivalent of a spoonful of jam. It is very little and it has never been an objection for our customers,"" says Lashilé's co-director. Still, next spring, the brand will launch a ""sugar-free"" version of its slimming formulas. This issue can actually make a difference. Les Miraculeux range already contains very little sugar, and there is a sugar-free version. ""We are the only ones to offer this choice. It was the last obstacle that prevented some brands from going for this product form. Sugar can be considered contradictory with the health proposal,"" says the Director. This health proposal has a larger dimension. To historical claims focused on sun care or hair and nail strengthening were added new, rather unexpected categories: women's libido for Lashilé, vegan supplementation, or supplements for the menopause with Les Miraculeux, who have also just launched a range dedicated to menstrual comfort. ""As a laboratory, with this form, we aim to target all family health needs from childhood to the menopause, from digestion to stress. We aim to keep exploring grounds that others do not,"" says David Gueunoun. The latest innovation in the food supplement industry is attributable to the Evielab brand. They have just added CBD – the star molecule of wellness and cosmetics – to their concept. This new generation of products in the form of dry microbeads to melt under the tongue, just like homeopathy, contains 5 mg of cannabinoids associated with the actives of each reference. Packed in a mini-travel size case, these microbeads can be carried everywhere for relaxation, concentration, sleep, sports recovery, immunity benefits… This new approach will be available for testing next spring."
Lips shine again in France with the end of compulsory mask wearing,"The end of the obligation to wear a mask in all public venues - with the exception of indoor transport and health facilities - led to an immediate surge in sales of prestige lipsticks in France, found The NPD Group. According to the market research firm, sales of prestige makeup products for the lips increased by 30% during the week starting March 14, 2022, the day the restrictions were lifted. Such a significant increase is to be compared with sales beauty products in the selective channel, which rose by about 3% at the same moment. Such a surge illustrate clearly the renewed interest in a part of the face that had been concealed for more than two years. ""The lifting of face cover rules has literally boosted lip makeup sales. Indeed, many consumers have celebrated this newfound freedom by buying a new lipstick. This is excellent news for make-up brands that were dramatically challenged by the pandemic,"" said Mathilde Lion, Europe beauty expert at The NPD Group. In the selective channel, overall makeup sales were up 8% in just one week, driven by the lips segment, which was the main contributor to the category sales growth during this period. As far as lipsticks are concerned, sales surged by +35% compared to the previous week. Beyond figures, the growing interest in lip glosses and lipsticks is clearly visible on online platforms, and even more on social networks. It is likely that new trends will emerge from this renewed enthusiasm, which expected to strengthen as summer approaches. In any case, the #lipstick hashtag has accumulated more than 11 billion views on TikTok, demonstrating that lip makeup has - probably - still a bright future ahead of it."
L'Oréal UK partners with TikTok for a new online shopping experience,"It's may be impressive to see success certain products meet on social networks, especially on TikTok, in just a few days. Promoted by influencers and content creators, some cosmetics become real star products, selling like hotcakes in record time. This is something that has not escaped the attention of the biggest cosmetics companies, and L'Oréal UK & Ireland is the first to get onboard with these new online buying behaviours. The Anglo-Irish branch of the cosmetics giant has just enriched its partnership with TikTok by joining the platform's #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt e-commerce campaign. Viewed more than 10 billion times, to date, on the social network, the hashtag is most often used by influencers to highlight their favourite products through content — whether via partnerships or otherwise. And it has already allowed many beauty products of all kinds to go viral. The phenomenon has also shined the spotlight on many cosmetics launched by the L'Oreal Group. Thanks to this collaboration, shoppers in the UK will be able to get their hands on beauty boxes filled with products endorsed by creators themselves. Garnier, L'Oréal Paris, Maybelline, NYX Professional Make-Up and Essie are among the brands involved. Only available to users in the UK — for now — this new experience reflects brands' growing interest in social networks, which seem to be transforming themselves into go-to places for next-gen shopping with sales expected to reach USD 1.2 trillion by 2025."
Gamification in marketing - a passing trend or a real strategic tool?,"The use of playful characteristics is common to drive engagement and motivation – learning methods, commercial challenges, contests, retail animations. A recent study highlights that the global gaming industry is worth $150 billion with over two billion gamers. The rise has contributed to the adoption of gamification in other contexts reserved for pure gamers, as a powerful marketing tool that is bound to stay. Gamification may be used in the choice of format for brand content and the selection of platforms (Instagram or Snapchat filters for instance), or in the mechanisms (TikTok contest, Web App, transforming a customer journey on an e-shop, use of motion design to bring interaction on a landing page). Within the core of an efficient marketing strategy implementing gamification, we may find the notions of rewards, fidelity, ranking and challenges. Gamification is based on a vital social aspect where the user seeks interaction, recognition, competition. Hence, the user is active at the heart of the experience, an actor, and a growth driver. It is then possible to unite a community around common interests and values. Furthermore, data collection makes gamification a useful device to develop commercial campaigns, as long as they are accompanied by a recurrent reporting. A brand should adopt gamification for various reasons: – It brings an immersive experience that prolongs the brand's storytelling; – It allows the construction of innovative and customized customer journeys that maintain attention; – The engagement rate is high, just like conversion and transformation rates – Customer loyalty is retained and higher. The art of creating emotions, of surprising and of engaging is inscribed in the cosmetic universe in which it is essential to embark the customers in a world that combines visualization and usage. The brand NYX is a paragon in the use of new technologies and gamification, from augmented and virtual reality to the metaverse. After using filters on social media for virtual try-on, an efficient means for cosmetics, the brand has developed a virtual makeup artist named MYAIA who offers personalized makeup consultations by an artificial intelligence. Virtual shopping was also developed by the brand, with a shop designed in augmented reality on Snapchat and Thriller, offering an immersive shopping experience with virtual try-on and games. In 2021, NYX launched an NFT skin during the Meta Gala at the first Crypto Fashion Week. Gamification is a way to get a foothold in Web3 defining the trajectory of a playful universe in which the community is involved. The synergy between gaming and the luxury industry is obvious: the need for a personalized, engaging, and immersive experience to seduce the audience before and after the buying process, is constant. As an agency specialized in visual innovations for luxury Houses, WANDS Paris accompanies brands from the strategy to the deployment, in adopting gamification for their brand platform and versions – filters, augmented reality, 3D, Wep App, immersive universes…A way to guide brands in defining their objectives, taking into account the question of adaptability, fluidity and brand content to unleash the full potential of creativity in the realization of gamified experiences."
"As virus cases surge and economy slows, can China's zero-Covid strategy hold?","Originally scheduled to be held on 14-15 April 2022, MakeUp in Shanghai and Luxe Pack Shanghai have been rescheduled to June 7-8, 2022. The two trade shows have been postponed while millions in the country are currently under lockdown in an attempt to halt the march of the Omicron variant. Similarly, considering the ""zero-Covid"" strategy means that inbound travel to Hong Kong is likely to remain subject to quarantine restrictions, the organizers of Cosmoprof Asia have decided to relocate the show to Singapore next November. China essentially closed itself off from the world in March 2020 to follow a formula it calls ""dynamic zero"" for curbing outbreaks: strict lockdowns and immediate mass testing. Unlike during softer lockdowns elsewhere, people in China can be banned from leaving their building or forced to remain inside a hotel room if they are considered high-risk contacts. Mandatory track-and-trace apps mean close contacts are usually detected and quarantined quickly. Shops, schools, tourist sites, office blocks and malls have been summarily locked down with people inside after the detection of a single close contact. Officials are routinely dismissed or castigated in state media for outbreaks in their areas. That puts the onus on local authorities to move fast and hard on any clusters. Residents are forced to stay at home at a moment's notice, including the 17 million people of Shenzhen who were locked down on Sunday. International flight volumes have also collapsed, with the limited arrivals undergoing strict weeks-long quarantine. The government has said it will not renew expiring Chinese passports unless the holder has a good reason for travel — shredding outbound demand for travel. China's caseload since the start of the pandemic — just over 115,000 — is a fraction of those recorded elsewhere. The official death toll has stayed under 5,000. Although cases from the chaotic initial outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020 are widely believed to have been under-reported, life since then has largely returned to normal. Beijing's communist leadership has made its handling of the pandemic a matter of political capital, saying the low death rate demonstrates the strength of its governance model. It has highlighted chaotic Covid responses in the US as an example of the wider failures of liberal democracies. Analysts warn any change in strategy will also need to shift perceptions of the virus among the masses in China. Loosening virus restrictions could also prove risky for President Xi Jinping as he seeks a third term in October after billing himself as the leader who keeps China safe. However, China's zero-Covid strategy comes at a cost, both human and economic. It has caused repeated disruption, particularly in port cities and border areas that endure almost constant lockdowns. Analysts say repeated shutdowns of factories and businesses have contributed to the slowing economy. And there has been a grinding impact on ordinary lives. Locked-down communities have complained of poor access to food, supplies and medical treatment. The distressing case of a pregnant Chinese woman miscarrying after a strict lockdown delayed her access to medical treatment reignited debate over the limits of China's zero-tolerance approach. Meanwhile, migrant workers have been left stranded from families for months due to onerous travel rules and restrictions. Examples of extreme enforcement have sparked outrage, such as when health workers beat a corgi to death after the owners were sent to quarantine. A top Chinese scientist said this month that the country should aim to coexist with the virus. Meanwhile, the government announced it was introducing rapid antigen tests for the first time, which would allow at-home testing — a potential loosening of the state's hold on the health crisis. However, there are concerns over the capacity of the country's healthcare system and the efficacy of domestic vaccines. Peking University researchers have warned China could suffer a ""colossal outbreak"" that would overwhelm its medical system if it relaxed restrictions to a similar level as in Europe and the US. And officials are anxiously watching the experience of Hong Kong, where hospitals have struggled in a recent outbreak. The city currently has one of the world's highest death rates from the virus, as the Omicron variant cuts through its elderly population, among whom vaccine hesitancy is common."
"""Shopping is the logical next step in the story"" - Charles Levecque, TikTok","TikTok used the occasion of Paris Fashion Week to organize some exclusive events with certain labels, such as Off-White. Can you tell us more about these operations? Charles Levecque - Regarding Off-White, that was a very nice project for us, allowing us to demonstrate new experiential tools for the community and how we can offer the TikTok community an even more immersive experience of fashion shows. There were several cameras that were positioned on the runway; it really offered the impression of total immersion. We'd already done many shows in the past, in 2020, with many labels. Here, we feel like we're taking the experience to the next level. Of course, other fashion shows also are taking place on the platform. We've already had the Dior and Balenciaga shows, for which the community could register beforehand to be able to view it on the platform on the big day. In the area of luxury and fashion what types of content are most appreciated by users? Charles Levecque - There is one trend that stood out for me during the Men's shows in January. It's all the vlogging done around the backstage or pre-show. I've seen a lot of content on that coming out. In the last few years, we had a lot of intra-show content. And now, we can see, for example with AMI Paris or Dior, content on TikTok that was created before the shows, on the celebrities attending, but also on all the excitement surrounding the event. This content is watched quite a bit. Which fashion and luxury deals have had the most success on TikTok? What is the most popular fashion label on TikTok? Charles Levecque - Now that's a tough question. There are a couple of shows that surprised me for many reasons and which were very popular on the platform. Gucci, during Milan Fashion Week, did a pre-show to prepare users for the shows beforehand featuring rather exclusive content with a creator named Francis Bourgeois. It's totally offbeat content that uses the codes of the platform 200% and, in particular, which uses all the codes of this creator. He's a fan of trains who had a resounding success with several million views on the platform during an earlier collaboration with North Face. So they take him, a few days before the show, to bring him to Milan. We see him arrive at the station. We see him get the invitation card. He goes to change before the show, all in Gucci of course, in a shop where he enjoys a little private shopping session, etc.. And then, he arrives at the show, he gets to check out the set. Viewers see him explaining that aspect a little bit. During the fashion show, everyone, all the TikTokers were asking ""Where is Francis?"" We saw a kind of excitement build up around him. Another example is Balmain, with the music. It was last September. They were doing the Balmain festival. They did a concert with Doja Cat for the occasion, live via TikTok. Users could watch the mini concert, and right after the fashion show. The community loves this kind of content. It's clear that people are quite interested in fashion shows. As we saw with TikTok star content creator Khaby Lame, who became a face of Hugo Boss, content creators are valued by brands. Can they have an influence on the fashion of tomorrow? Charles Levecque - I was quite blown away by the whole Hugo Boss operation. It signals a transformation, dramatically different from the brand of two or three years ago. They are very modern. It's quite powerful what they did because the Khaby Lame community represents millions of people, but they didn't come for the fashion at all. They came for humorous content. They come looking for an audience, which is also quite new for this environment. That's what I find interesting, to see if these communities can mix and, in doing so, make brands that are more global and inclusive. Will they shape the fashion of tomorrow? I think they are mostly amplifiers. Fashion and luxury brands are increasingly present on TikTok. What do you think is attracting them to this platform compared to other social networks? Charles Levecque - There are several reasons. The first for me is that we are the easiest gateway to reach a new generation of users, new consumers, new codes, new means of expression. TikTok is this gateway that allows them to go and understand them. We know that Millennials, and even Generation Z, will be the massive consumers of luxury in the near future. I think that they will represent more than 70% of luxury consumers in a few years. TikTok can be a good way to ""meet"" them and more specifically to enter into discussion and engage with them. We are also in the process of becoming a platform that offers a rather perfect showcase for creativity because it's a platform that is full screen. There is no other content around it. It's creators who are making a lot of content on the platform, who are ultra-dynamic, ultra-original and ultra-creative. I think that brands have a lot of stories to tell. They often have beautiful messages, and also a lot of content that is very well done. I think it's a great place for them to express their creativity. Most TikTok users are quite young — an audience that is not necessarily able to buy luxury products. So what interest do these brands have in establishing a presence on TikTok? Charles Levecque - The platform is experiencing tremendous growth. Our user base has grown very quickly. Today we can say that 67% of our audience is over 25 years old, a telling figure. I want to make that clear because it's part of an image we're trying to change. Perhaps two years ago, the platform didn't look the same as it does today. It's well known that one thing that works well on TikTok is a kind of naturalness, which does not necessarily always work with the highly coded images of fashion and luxury brands. How far are they willing to go in this regard? Charles Levecque - Should brands, since they do have these very powerful codes, adapt to TikTok? I think that's a discussion we'll see evolve. Our application is quite young. We've already seen significant change since the beginning, a year and a half ago, almost two years ago, when content was a bit of copy and paste from other platforms or experiments. Now, it's clear to see that there's a higher level. Shopping via social networks is a key trend this year. How does TikTok plan to get involved in this new market? Charles Levecque - Shopping is the logical next step in the story. Today, we have users who consume content on a largely entertainment-oriented platform. The next logical step is to know how we can help them generate actions, discover — maybe on a website or elsewhere — products and potentially purchase luxury goods. We have done different operations with brands, like Make Up For Ever and the LVMH group with Dior. TikTok creators presented beauty ""moments"" with the possibility to promote the collection shown for purchase. This doesn't necessarily mean ""buy now."" It's more, ""watch some content on TikTok, watch this video and look at the products we've focused on and now are concretely presenting for you."" We still need to think about how we can create more integrated experiences on the platform to build simpler pathways. That's because taking the user out of the platform, creating too many avenues can be complicated for them."
Brazil: Sales of the beauty and personal care sector dropped 2.8% in 2021,"After an atypical increase (compared to the rest of the world) of 5.8% in 2020, sales of the Brazilian industry of personal hygiene, perfumes and cosmetics recorded a 2.8% drop (ex-factory prices) between January and December 2021, compared to the same period of the previous year. According to ABIHPEC, the sector faced multiple challenges throughout the year. Personal hygiene products were the best performers of the sector last year. The good results of this category limited the overall decline. With sales growing by 4.7% (ex-factory prices) compared to 2020, the category benefited from the intensification of hygiene habits as a protection against Covid-19 contamination. On the other hand, cosmetics (-15.4%) and perfumes (-2%) recorded significant drops compared to 2020. While the consumer price index (IPCA) rose by more than 10% in 2021 in Brazil, the sector limited the increase in the price of its products during the year, ending the period with an average inflation of +3.1%, i.e. 7 percentage points below the general national index. ""Although it is essential for society today, hygiene and beauty products is the third most taxed sector in the country. The heavy tax burden it bears demands enormous efforts from companies to absorb constant cost increases and avoid an even greater contraction in demand,"" highlights ABIHPEC. Generally speaking, hygiene and grooming products were the industry winners in 2021. Among the best performing products is soap, with a growth of 9.7% compared to 2020. Bar soap continues to be the main segment of the market, with 80% of sales, while liquid soap, one of the symbols of the fight against Covid-19, has gained popularity. Shampoo sales remained stable, rising less than 1%, while the haircare category saw sales growing 5.8% in 2021. The skin care category, which had grown by 21.9% in 2020, indicating greater interest from Brazilian consumers in well-being products, especially during times of greatest social isolation, fell by 12.4% in 2021. According to ABIHPEC, this result is linked to the reduction in the time available for skin and body care rituals, due to the gradual resumption of outdoor activities. It also shows the opportunity to educate Brazilians on the long-term benefits of taking care of their skin. Finally, with regard to perfumes, ABIHPEC data show sales down 2%, despite the investments made by companies in the sector. Despite this overall drop in sales, it should be noted that the Brazilian trade balance of the health and beauty sector remained in surplus in 2021, for the second consecutive year."
"Biotulin meets success with a botanical-based ""natural botox"" face gel","Most of the botox-like face care products come in the form of a simple anti-aging serum, — a gel to be precise — which is simply applied to the face. The Ordinary's ""Argireline Solution 10%"" — which sells for less than $10 — has long been promoted on social networks for its ability to smooth out wrinkles almost as botox would do. Its main active ingredient, Argireline, a proprietary peptide complex (a solution of Acetyl Hexapeptide-3) from Lipotec (Lubrizol Life Science). The Ordinary says that ""studies have shown that Argireline improves the appearance of facial areas prone to developing dynamic folds, including around the eyes and in the forehead area."" But it is now the ""Supreme Skin Gel"" from the German brand Biotulin that is in the spotlight and makes much ado on social networks. Its main component, spilanthol, is a fatty acid amide extracted from Acmella Oleracea, a plant native to South America — hence it being dubbed 'natural' botox. This local anesthetic is said to relax the muscles around the eyes and lips, reducing wrinkles in just one hour. This natural ingredient, which gained popularity in 2021 thanks to German-based organic skincare brand Spilanthox Therapy can b in se foundeveral products such as Patyka's Age Specific Intensive Instant Wrinkle Filler, or L'Occitane en Provence's Immortelle Reset Overnight Reset Oil-In-Serum. According to INCI Beauty website, it is present in 0.09% of cosmetic products. To stand out, Biotulin's flagship product had the support of Jennifer Lopez who officially thanked the brand on Twitter earlier this year after the Golden Globes awards ceremony."
France: Sales of prestige beauty products increased by 9% in 2021,"After a sharp fall in 2020 (-20% compared to 2019), sales of the selective channel in France returned to growth in 2021, with an increase of 9%, compared to the previous year, to reach EUR 2,689 billion in 2021, according to The NPD Group. However, the persistence of the pandemic and the successive lockdowns in the first half of 2021 (with store closures) have slowed the recovery. The prestige beauty market has yet to return to pre-Covid levels, with sales down 12% in 2021 compared to 2019. The pace of growth nevertheless accelerated during the second half of 2021, with fourth quarter sales reaching a level similar to that of the same period in 2019. Eventually, the year ended with record sales during the two weeks before Christmas. Physical stores were the main contributors to growth in the prestige beauty market in 2021. After the reopening of brick-and-mortar stores after the last lockdown in France, online sales began to slow down, and even strongly decreased in the fourth quarter , with a double-digit drop. Sales in traditional stores accounted for 84% of the pretige beauty market in 2021, compared to 16% for online sales, these results confirm the importance of the in-store shopping experience. Fragrances were a key driver of the prestige beauty market growth (accounting for 82% of the progression), with sales up 11% in 2021 compared to 2020. The most dynamic segment in the category was home fragrances. In addition, high-end fragrances and more concentrated scents, such as eaux de parfum and extracts, were preferred by buyers, resulting in a 3% increase in the average price. The same behaviour has been observed in the United States. While skincare sales increased by 5% in 2021 (vs 2020), unit sales increased by 17%. For this category, consumers favoured less expensive products and more affordable brands. Driven by the home-spa trend, sales of body care products confirmed their success, exceeding their 2019 level. As far as face products are concerned, skin care products, sprays/mists, oils, exfoliants and make-up removers returned to growth and recorded double-digit growth in 2021 compared to 2020. Sales of prestige makeup were up 5% compared to 2020 in France. As wearing face covers was mandatory in most places, consumers focused their purchases on the eye and nail segments, which recorded a double digit growth. However, the consumption of the category's emblematic products, such as foundations and lipsticks, resumed at the end of the year. ""This is a very positive signal, announcing a good year 2022 for make-up,"" highlighted The NPD Group. Still emerging in the selective channel, the haircare category continues to establish itself, rising by 43% in 2021 compared to 2020, a year which was already considered to be flourishing for this segment. This growth is based on promotional sets and hair care. ""There are increasingly visible signs that the recovery is accelerating since restrictions were lifted. Once again, consumers have demonstrated that the health of the sector depends mainly on in-store experience, even if online shopping has transformed their habits,"" concludes Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group."
The Italian cosmetics industry expects to recover from the crisis this year,"""Recovery was strong in 2021, both in the domestic and overseas markets,"" stressed Renato Ancorotti, President of Cosmetica Italia. According to the association's estimates, the Italian industry closed the year 2021 with total sales of EUR 11.7 billion, up +10.2% compared to 2020 when sales in value had fallen to EUR 10.6 billion. A significant but partial recovery, since the Italian industry only recovered EUR 1.1 billion out of the EUR 1.5 billion lost in 2020. In 2021, recovery was first driven by external demand (+13.0% for exports, which reached EUR 4.7 billion), while the domestic market (+6.5%) remained disrupted by the restrictions linked to the pandemic. Cosmetica Italia expects to return to - and even exceed - the pre-crisis level (EUR 12.1 billion in 2019) later this year. The trade association anticipates closing 2022 with a business volume of EUR 12.5 billion (which would represent a +6.5% increase compared to 2021). Contract manufacturing, one of the strong points of the Italian industry, should even see its activity grow significantly with a growth forecast of +15% in 2022 (compared to an estimated +8% increase between 2020 and 2021). A survey conducted among the association's member companies, however, shows several concerns among manufacturers, in particular, due to supply chain disruptions (more than 80% of the companies surveyed believe that difficulties will persist in 2022) and rising production costs. ""Despite the significant growth at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, several indicators are worrying players in the sector,"" Cosmetica Italia underlines. Nevertheless, the association considers that the Italian cosmetics industry has proven its resilience and that investments in innovation will continue to pay off, in particular by strengthening the competitiveness of Made in Italy products on global markets."
French women are massively opting for organic and natural beauty products,"French women are increasingly reliant in organic and natural cosmetics, which seem to reassure them. The Slow Cosmétique Label, in partnership with market research firm Harris Interactive [1], takes stock of the situation and the result clearly shows the success of natural formulations with female consumers aged 18 to 50. Thus, more than nine out of ten French women (92%) buy natural or organic cosmetics at least once a year, and nearly six out of ten opt for these products at least once every 3 months. The study also shows that environmental concerns are not what motivates French women to buy organic or natural cosmetics, at least in the first place. Indeed, nearly half of respondents (47%) say their personal health is the main reason for purchasing these cosmetics, protecting the environment comes second but is mentioned by 17% of women only. Furthermore, if the pandemic has boosted sales in local retail and boosted the interest in locally made products, it seems that this is not (yet) the case in the beauty sector. Only 8% of respondents say that local production and/or made in France labels are a source of motivation for purchasing cosmetic products. This might be explained by the strong position of the French industry in this business. French made products brands are therefore widely available on shelves, a notable difference compared to many other market segments. The study also reveals that French women prefer supermarkets rather than specialized shops to purchase organic or natural cosmetics. When asked where they buy organic and natural products, 76% of French women mention large and medium-sized retails, then pharmacies and para-pharmacies (41%), e-commerce (25%), and finally specialized organic stores (17%). Beyond organic and natural, the Slow Cosmetique seal also seems to interest French women. Created by French-based Slow Cosmétique Association, the seal is awarded to brands that promote responsible natural skincare, with formulas that are free from controversial ingredients in terms of health or environmental impact, and which are also committed to developing equally healthy marketing, without greenwashing or outlandish promises. Eight out of ten French women said such a seal is interesting and 92% believe it helps the beauty industry to move in the right direction. For nearly nine out of ten women (88%), it increases their confidence in the product. To date, 313 brands have been awarded the Slow Cosmétique seal."
From lip pencil to concealer: How are TikTokers hacking cosmetic uses,"Looking for fun and also for saving money and resources, TikTok users have quickly understood that cosmetics can have several lives, and just as many uses. For a few months now, the social network has been an inexhaustible source of tips and tricks, each more original than the next, and all aimed at hijacking cosmetics from their initial functions to transform them into more or less successful beauty innovations. If these hacks may seem crazy at first glance, they are no less effective — or so says the TikTok community — and they also come with a sustainable slant, as they help to reduce waste or multiple purchases. In the space of just a few weeks, TikTokers switched around the original functions of their lip and brow pencils. Some now use the former to achieve the perfect smoky eye, while others turn to the latter to get the perfect shade of lipstick. It's hard to follow, we agree, but these tips have already been seen — and maybe adopted — by thousands of users. Not content with hijacking the eyebrow pencil, TikTokers went the extra mile to get the perfect lip color, by adding a touch of blush — which, of course, is intended for cheeks — before finishing things off with a small dose of gloss. According to its advocates, the whole process helps achieve ultra glamorous and luscious lips. More so, in any case, than with a mere lipstick. You may not know it, but concealer isn't just for dark circles and blemishes. In 2022, it gets mixed with other products to brighten your eyes, or achieve perfect contouring. A few weeks ago, a TikToker revived a beauty hack straight from the 2000s, involving spreading on some white concealer to structure her face and brighten her eyes. The video has gone viral and scored several million views. It followed another ingenuous hit video about the 'Rainbow Contour,' a method for achieving a perfect, natural glow without a single touch of foundation. Concealer, blush, cream bronzers and the likes applied in a rainbow of stripes supposedly deliver the result in just a few minutes, as shown by many contouring aficionados. Other TikTokers have had fun hijacking the uses of the jade roller, initially intended to firm up the face and reduce dark circles and wrinkles, by transforming it into a beauty blender. A trick that proved a hit, since it allows you to enjoy the benefits of the jade roller while applying your foundation with precision. But the craze was short-lived, as this hack requires time and patience. On a different note, one user went so far as to use intimate lubricant as a foundation base, turning it into a very surprising primer. From this initiative came a host of videos in which users raved about the results, showing off their radiant complexions. However, for obvious safety reasons, some products should probably not be diverted from their primary functions… And these practices can be a real headache for manufacturers who are legally required to anticipate the ""reasonably"" foreseeable use of their products. But they are also a source of inspiration and innovation..."
Brazil: Exports of personal care products record double digit growth in 2021,"International trade flows (exports and imports) of the Brazilian personal hygiene, perfumery and cosmetics industry reached USD 1.4 billion in 2021, compared to USD 1.2 billion in 2020, a year-on-year increase of 16.2%. Exports reached $700 million in 2021, an increase of 14.9% over the previous year (USD 609.3 million). The Brazilian industry exports its products to 173 countries, mainly to its neighbours in Latin America, with Argentina being the first buyer. However, the Brazilian Association of Personal Hygiene, Perfumery and Cosmetics Industries (ABIHPEC) highlights the fast-pace growth of exports to Chile and Mexico. Over the period January to December 2021, imports of the hygiene-cosmetics sector reached 688.4 million US dollars, an increase of 17.5% compared to the same period of the previous year (585.9 million US dollars). dollars). France and China topped the list of the 75 countries supplying for the Brazilian personal hygiene and cosmetics market. In the end, the sector's trade balance recorded a surplus for the second consecutive year, after ten years of deficit. Indeed, December was a decisive month for the sector, thanks to a surplus of 11.6 million US dollars. ""The end of the year was a good surprise: indeed, the trade balance benefited from the increase in exports from August and the month of December was decisive to reach a final trade surplus in the sector,"" commented João Carlos Basilio, Executive President of ABIHPEC. Hair products have been the leading category of Brazilian cosmetics exports for several years. Next, soaps and oral hygiene products. However, among the most imported products in Brazil are high value-added items, such as skin care, sun protection products and tanning products, followed by perfumes, as well as oral hygiene products. According to ABIHPEC, the presence of the oral hygiene category at the top of both exports and imports can be explained by significant imports of toothbrushes, and by exports of other items in the category, in particular toothpaste."
Exports: France consolidates its position as the world leader in cosmetics,"After a 2020 year marked by an 11.8% drop, the first since 2009, exports of made in France perfumes, cosmetics and toiletries were on the rise again in 2021 to reach EUR 16.2 billion, according to French customs figures. With an increase of 22.5% compared to 2020, the French cosmetics industry posted the best performance across all sectors. Not only has the pre-pandemic level been regained, but exports have increased by a further 2.5% compared to 2019. Although imports also increased in 2021 (+24%), the trade balance, however, exceeds the outstanding level reached in 2019 and the cosmetics industry ranks in the top 3 contributors to France's positive foreign trade balance, with a balance of EUR12.9 bn, behind aeronautics (EUR30.8 bn) and wines and spirits, (EUR14.6 bn). The EU and Asia together account for almost 2/3 of French cosmetics exports. With EUR 1.9 bn or 11.7% of exported goods, China is the leading country of destination for French exports. After a 2020 year already marked by a sharp increase (+20.4%), due in particular to the substitution of purchases previously made during trips to France, the acceleration in exports (+28.9%) in 2021 attests to the attractiveness of French cosmetics, particularly make-up, for Chinese consumers. For instance, France currently exports more than one in three lipsticks to China. The United States follows in second place, with EUR1.8 bn or 11.2% of total exports. Growth was again robust in 2021, particularly in the perfume category, which grew by 66% compared to 2020. In third place comes Germany with €1.5 bn or 9.5% of total exports. In contrast, in Russia and Brazil, two countries where sales have fallen by around 22% since 2019, partly because of their economic situation, exports are down. The Middle East is also experiencing a drop (-5.7% compared to 2019), mainly due to the standstill in air traffic and consequently travel retail because of the pandemic. The make-up, skincare and perfume categories are the most dynamic in terms of exports. Together they represent 86.2% of total sales of French cosmetics abroad. Perfumery alone, with 30.6% of French cosmetic exports, posted the highest growth in 2021: +35.4% compared to the previous year. Make-up and skincare together account for €9 bn or 55.6% of exports. Skincare products rank first (€7.5 bn), followed by lipsticks and eye make-up products. According to the French trade association representing cosmetic manufacturers (FEBEA), these figures confirm France's position as the world leader in cosmetics, a country whose know-how is recognised throughout the world. ""The cosmetics industry is proving its impressive ability to bounce back from the health crisis,"" says Emmanuel Guichard, Delegate-General of the FEBEA. ""It took advantage of course, of the market upturn, but also innovated to meet new consumer expectations. Companies of all sizes play a part in these good export figures, large groups but also many small companies which, thanks to their dynamism, are also champions of the Made in France label. Since the onset of the crisis, demand for more natural and environmentally friendly products has increased. It is because the sector meets these expectations and invests heavily in R&D that it can perform so well throughout the world."" According to the FEBEA, the cosmetics industry employs more than 160,000 people in France."
The age of fluidity: Five beauty predictions for 2022 and beyond,"In 2022, purposeful beauty merges with sustainability to create a new beauty eco-system - one that is built upon uncompromising standards and principles. Consumers are pushing beyond 'clean' to a place of uncompromised wellbeing - where pleasure and personal beauty are achieved without detriment to people or the planet. The expectation is for nothing less than net-zero. The rising climate anxiety is propelling consumers into taking affirmative action - over half (51%) now factor in whether a product was produced with a traceable and transparent origin. And, attuned to the tropes of greenwashing rhetoric and marketing messages, consumers will drive brands to adopt proactive climate-positive strategies. When it comes to production, radical transparency is key. 61% of consumers say they struggle to tell whether a beauty product is ethically produced by looking at its packaging, while half of would like brands to make it easier for them to spot how a product was produced [1]. Going forward, consumers will ask to be told to The Who, The Where and The How behind each product. With this clear shift from sustainability to beauty uncompromised, brands will need to reinforce their transparency credentials. Beauty brands can deliver assurances by putting transparency at the center of the product experience, freeing the consumer to enjoy and experiment without guilt or compromise. Joyspotting reveals a new facet of beauty, one where makeup is cumulatively self-care, a tool of transformation and a manifestation of self-fluidity. This is a trend borne from the Tiktokization of the Beauty industry - where creators and influencers encourage followers to escape from the rules and embrace the fluidity of experimentation. On TikTok, there's no room for perfection or judgement, just joy - a third of users (31%) report turning to the app in order to lift their spirits. Fuelled by these influences, beauty in 2022 will be rich with aesthetic rebellion and fluid creativity. The face and body will become canvases for celebratory makeup looks. And consumer sentiment is firmly behind experimentation - Pinterest reports a spike in searches for mullet hairstyles (+190%); tooth gems (+85%); bejewelled eye looks (+110%) and rhinestone pedicures (+150%). In the US, rising brand Danessa Myrick is connecting with next-gen Joyspotters through a strategy built on inclusion and artistry. The brand's ethos that, ""everyone should be able to have the freedom to enjoy makeup,"" speaks to the new fluidity. The color-changing pigments of the brand's signature Chrome Flakes are representative of the new wave of ephemeral and transformative products that are only just beginning to emerge. Creative ephemerality also comes to the fore, with new products and devices allowing users to easily switch up their beauty looks. In South Korea, nails become a vehicle for self-expression as the pandemic continues to stifle opportunities to showcase creative flair beyond the home. In response, nails are getting bigger and bolder, popping with 3D accents of glitter, crystals and jewelry. In the future, brands will approach the art of beauty as an act of pleasure, and those that can deliver an instant shot of happiness will connect with consumers, who are looking for products to lift them out of the pandemic slump. As we move towards a post-inclusive society the beauty industry will seek to further individualise its approach. The industry will need to push beyond skin-tone matching to encircle all aspects of inclusivity, including the Gen Z vs Mature skin silos. As we move forward, fluidity will be treated with the same value and respect as accessibility and adaptability. And as we evolve our understanding of what true inclusivity means, today's diverse and multifaceted consumers will expect to be met with products that fit their exacting needs. Beauty products that radically adapt to individuality, moving from social specificities seen at the surface (skin tone, hair type, etc.) to a profound understanding of the ""underskin"" mechanism, will continue to emerge. And we are only just beginning to see what is possible, as brands start to come through with tailored products that more insightfully address biological or physical nuances. In the Future, the Beauty industry will take action to ensure that no consumer is left out of the conversation - regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, size or ability. Currently, 15% of the world's population are living with some form of disability, and as the population ages, this number will only increase. Designing products, tools and packaging with this demographic in mind should be imperative for the industry. The pandemic has stirred the ultra-fetishization of wellness and the healthification of the beauty industry. With a preventive mindset becoming the new normality, consumers are focused on care and safety, and they crave potent, power-dosing ingredients across all of their beauty products. In response, brands are engineering products using the latest technological advances, while at the same time introducing new, biological semantics into the beauty narrative. Stories around skin barrier empowerment, microbiome and psychobiological enhancers, hormonal regulators and circadian champions will continue to break through, as brands add another level of science-proofing to the consumer experience. And in the years ahead, consumers will be alerted to a new discourse around the underskin. More and more brands come with sophisticated formula with ""skin health"" related ingredients. Be Radiance now infuse their makeup powders with probiotics, which activate with water to positively ""colonize the microbiota"" explains the brand. A global beauty approach of the skin, where makeup goes beyond color as it rebalances the skin while protecting it against external aggressions. In the future, products that adapt to the rise of skin sensitivity will become critical for consumers who want to preserve their skin health, without sacrificing performance. In this context, the boundaries between makeup and skincare, food and beauty will blur. A new generation of hybrid products will explode the frontiers between traditional segments to levitate beauty to new horizons. Tech is tapping the mood for fluidity, as innovation keeps pace with consumer demand for products that allow them to seamlessly switch-up their beauty looks, from home. And science-backed products, temporary treatments and formulations engineered to cheat surgical procedures, appeal to those looking for sophisticated out-of-the-jar beauty solutions. Since the pandemic ushered in new ways of working and living, consumers quickly learned how to adapt and realized that joy can be found in impermanence. Now, the desire to eschew long-term commitments for temporary thrills is taking hold in beauty. Innovations at CES 2022 captured this creative ephemerality - from L'Oréal's AI-integrated hair coloring device, the Colorsonic, to the handheld temporary tattoo-printing machine from start-up, Prinker. In the future, scientific legitimacy coupled with technological precision will allow consumers to achieve - and measure - next-level results, without the commitment of permanent procedures.

"U.S. prestige beauty sales grew by 30% in 2021, surpassing 2019 levels","Beauty addicts snapped up prestige cosmetics in the United States las year, according to figures published by The NPD Group. After a 19% decline in 2020, in the wake of the pandemic, the market strongly rebounded and surpassed 2019 levels (USD 18.8 billion). According to the market research firm, the industry generated USD 22 billion in 2021, up 30% from 2020 when sales only reached USD 16.1 billion. According to The NPD Group, with sales up 23%, the makeup category benefited from a return to consumer interest in makeup artistry. Sales of face makeup products, including foundation, primer, and tinted moisturizer, grew double digits, as did makeup-setting sprays and removers. Growth was also observed for cream and stick blushes and other products prevalently used in YouTube videos and other social media. To top that off, NPD notes that brands born from makeup artists and social influencers had the highest revenue gains among all the makeup brand types. Within the hair category (+47%), hairsprays, gels, mousses, and other styling products returned to growth in 2021, with hair-styling product sales up 45%, versus 2020. According to The NPD Group, the hair-styling segment is expected to rise another 15% in 2022. More broadly, NPD expects growth in this category to continue through 2024, as people continue to return to more social activities in the months and years ahead. Core skincare product sales, including facial cleansers, creams, and serums, grew between 15% and 24%, versus 2020, while the whole category grew by 18% in 2021. Sales of targeted products, like eye and lip treatments, also increased. Clinical skincare brands (cosmeceuticals) contributed the highest revenue gains to the category. In 2021, clinical surpassed natural as the largest brand type in skincare, based on revenue. The fragrance category registered double-digit growth against both 2020 and 2019, as consumers looked to treat themselves. Sales of perfumes, colognes, and other fragrance juices increased by 61%, year over year, as sales of candles, reed diffusers, and other home scents grew by more than 20%. The fourth quarter accounted for 45% of fragrance category sales revenue in 2021, growing by 35% during the critical holiday selling season, found NPD. ""As we move through 2022, the beauty companies that will thrive are those that harness the industry's unique ability to spread joy, while also recognizing the opportunities of a changed consumer and retail environment,"" said Larissa Jensen, beauty industry advisor at NPD. ""We can expect more change to unfold in 2022, but, along with these changes, new opportunities for the beauty industry will present themselves."""
Is the metaverse set to shake up fashion and beauty purchasing habits?,"Marketing in the metaverse is still in its infancy: fashion and beauty players are just beginning to explore the endless possibilities this virtual world can offer. However, as soon as 2022, physical and digital collections should be available simultaneously. In real life, many people lack the opportunity and/or the means for buying a Gucci, Balenciaga, or Ralph Lauren wardrobe, or Louboutin stilettos. But those who can't fill their closet with luxury clothes, could outfit their avatar in them, and go to a virtual restaurant suited up like never before. It's a great way to indulge oneself at a lower cost... This is just one of the many possibilities offered by the metaverse, and brands, for whom this universe is proving to be a lucrative new playground, are already starting to present collections aimed at users of the most popular platforms such as Roblox, Zepeto, and ""Fortnite."" The foray into the metaverse getting the most attention in recent months is none other than that of Balenciaga in the world of ""Fortnite."" For the first time, high fashion has entered the virtual world of one of the most popular games in the world, in the form of a collection signed Balenciaga x Fortnite. Demna Gvasalia, creative director of the luxury brand, has managed to blur the lines between the virtual and real worlds even further. Not only did players have the opportunity to buy outfits and accessories for their avatars, but they were also able to buy Fortnite x Balenciaga clothes in stores, real ones. A twofold hit for the label that continues to expand and build its community. And the example has since been followed by the brands Moncler and Jordan, which have both, through diverse and varied experiences, collaborated with Epic Games, the parent company of ""Fortnite."" Vans, Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger are among the brands that have already teamed up with Roblox, proposing new collections and objects for users' avatars. Zepeto is not to be outdone as it has already collaborated with MCM, Louboutin, Ralph Lauren, Gucci, and even fast fashion giant Zara for fashion, and brands such as Dior Beauté and Nars for cosmetics. The South Korean metaverse has even gone further by offering clothes associated with artists and key figures from the worlds of animation and sports, such as Miraculous, Selena Gomez, Major League Baseball, Blackpink, The Little Mermaid, and One Piece. And this is just the beginning... These virtual worlds could very soon look like life-size (digital) shopping malls. In the same vein, it is not surprising to learn that Nike and adidas have already moved to the next level by creating their own virtual realm. The brand with the swoosh has teamed up with Roblox on Nikeland, while Adidas has teamed up with Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gmoney, and PUNKS Comic to create its own metaverse, which invites users into ""a wild world where possibilities are truly limitless."" Actually, the metaverse is not 'just' a universe where brands can sell virtual collections. Fashion shows, advertising campaigns, conferences, games, experiences, lectures, shopping... the possibilities are indeed endless, and there's something for everyone, the ultimate luxury consisting in hunting not small, colorful monsters, but NFTs. For its entry into the metaverse, adidas has launched its very first digital tokens, providing access to virtual clothes for the game as well as physical products. The sale of NFTs, these non-fungible tokens that allow you to buy rare or exclusive digital works of art and other products, is indeed a significant source of income for brands in the metaverse. They're even becoming an obsession, because not only can luxury brands use them to strengthen their links with their community, but they can also use them to highlight their artistic inspirations, as well as their involvement in various causes. L'Oreal Paris USA recently enlisted five female artists to create NFTs and make a case for gender equity in the realm of cryptocurrency, while Givenchy teamed up with graphic artist Chito to auction off several NFTs, the sale of which benefited a Dutch organization committed to ocean cleanup. Gucci, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana, and Karl Lagerfeld, to name but a few, are among the many brands that have already embraced NFTs, an area which is proving to be particularly fruitful, and which should thrive, if not go massive, with the advent of the metaverse and Web 3.0. It remains to be seen how brands will combine their CSR commitments with this virtual development whose environmental impact could quickly seem unrelated to its social utility and whose impact on human health remains to be assessed..."
Indonesia and Malaysia: At the forefront of halal beauty innovation,"The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is accounting for the largest slice of this thriving market, with Malaysia and Indonesia leading the pack. Although Malaysia is a comparatively small country, with 32.7 million nationals in 2021 (over 60% of which identify as Muslim), its economy is well-developed and the Malaysian halal beauty market is one of the biggest markets in the ASEAN region. Indonesia, on the other hand, is the largest Muslim-majority country in the world with a population of 275+ million and 87% Muslims. In both countries the size of the halal beauty market has been growing strongly in recent years. According to Sancoyo Antarikso, Chairman of Indonesian Cosmetics Association Perkosmi: ""Indonesia is the largest halal consumer market in the world. Consumer spend reached USD 184 billion USD in 2020, of which USD 4.19 billion were cosmetics and toiletries (C&T)."" In comparison, the overall Indonesian C&T market is worth around USD 6.34 billion and over the next five years, halal-certified cosmetics are expected to outpace the non-halal beauty market. ""While halal certifications in cosmetics are still lagging behind halal-certified food products in Indonesia, they have been increasing steadily over the last few years. In 2017 there were only 64 cosmetics companies that had a halal certification. This number grew to 129 companies in 2018, 162 companies in 2019 and 214 companies in 2020, including both Indonesian and foreign players,"" adds Muti Arintawati, President Director of Indonesia's Assessment Institute for Food, Drugs & Cosmetics Majelis Ulama Indonesia LPPOM MUI. One of the reasons for this development is the Indonesia's halal product law, which applies to cosmetics, foods and non-food products & services and went into effect in 2019. Under this set of regulations all foreign beauty products distributed or retailed in Indonesia will be treated as non-halal unless they've been certified in Indonesia or by an accredited foreign certification body. While cosmetics brands have until 2026 to fully implement this law domestic and regional halal beauty brands have long since begun this process. Indonesia's established halal brands, like pioneer Wardah, which was founded in 1995 and has a strong distribution across the entire ASEAN region, have been instrumental in driving the domestic halal beauty market. When Wardah was first launched, there were few halal certified brands and even less consumer understanding of what halal was. Over the past 20 years, however, awareness of the ""hijab lifestyle"" has been growing strongly in Indonesia. And today's young halal consumers aren't just looking for a religious certification any more. Prita Anindya Laksmita, Beauty Sector Manager at Kantar Worldpanel Division explains: ""Looking at the growth drivers today, the market isn't driven by the halal logo per se. Consumers are now also looking for more sophisticated benefits such as brightening or anti-ageing so modern halal beauty brands are dialling up the key ingredients of a product rather than focusing exclusively on the halal seal."" And indeed, in recent years a crop of trendy, young domestic beauty brands has been brightening up the Indonesian halal cosmetics and toiletries market place. While 15 years ago, halal brands tended to look staid and a bit conservative, the new generation of female-founded beauty brands is in a different league altogether, wowing its digitally native demographic with exciting products and ultra-stylish packaging. Many of these new launches are makeup brands which are actually boosting the entire Indonesian colour cosmetics market: According to GlobalData, the domestic makeup sector is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2020 to 2025 [3], driven by the certified halal makeup market. Amongst the biggest beauty labels is BLP Beauty which was launched by prominent beauty blogger Lizzie Parra in 2016 and offers a range of inclusive shades for the many different skin tones of Indonesian women. The products are also light-weight and comfortable to wear in the country's hot and humid climate. Luxcrime is another beauty brand with a strong GenZ vibe and stylish packaging, as is Rosé All Day launched in 2017, which offers skin care and makeup. Colour cosmetics brand Esqa was launched in 2016 and is both halal and vegan while Mad also caters to the GenZ and Millennials demographic. Face care brand Base, on the other hand, offers personalized skin care: users fill in an online questionnaire and the brand then selects suitable products from the range and ships it directly to the customer. As far as halal beauty is concerned, Malaysia isn't trailing far behind its neighbour. Despite Malaysia's comparatively small population size, the country is the fourth largest economy in South-East Asia. It is also amongst the top 5 international Muslim consumer markets. The country's halal authority JAKIM is one of the biggest certifying bodies in the region and over the past decade the Malaysian government has implemented various initiatives expanding and promoting the country's halal manufacturing eco system, making Malaysia one of the key countries for halal OEM/ODM manufacturing. According to Alvin Yim from the Malaysian Cosmetics & Toiletries Industry Group, the local trade organization, Malaysia's halal exports came to USD 7.25 billion in 2020, with C&T products accounting for turnover worth USD 0.64 billion (8.7%). The major exports market for Malaysian halal cosmetics are Singapore (by a very large margin) followed by Turkey, UAE, the Philippines and Japan. The 2020 result was affected by the pandemic, Yim says, as cosmetics export turnover had been growing strongly from USD 0.52 billion in 2016 to USD 0.71 billion in 2019. However, Yim expects the Malaysian halal beauty exports to rebound and expand further in the post-pandemic period. And the demand is definitely there! Like Indonesia, Malaysia's contemporary halal beauty market is driven by the many new and trendy makeup and skin care brands that have appeared on the market over the past five years. These labels are primarily female-owned, proudly manufactured domestically and aimed squarely at the demands of young urban women. Launched in 2016, So.Lek is a good example of this new kind of beauty brand. Founders Dahlia Nadirah and Luqman Hakim wanted to create an affordable makeup brand celebrating Malaysian culture and traditions rather than giving it the more usual international or anglicized brand vibe. The products and shades of So.Lek's makeup range are named in Bahasa Malaysia rather than English and even the brand name is based on the Malaysian word for makeup. Also launched in 2016, Nita Cosmetica has a similar brand ethos. Founder Aznita Azman wanted her makeup brand to represent Malaysian culture and values through packaging and product names. Her brand offers accessible and affordable colours for different skin tones. dUCk Cosmetics is the sister brand of hijab label dUCk, which was launched by local fashion entrepreneur Valet Vivy Yusof in 2014. After expanding into bags, accessories and other home and lifestyle products, Yusof introduced a halal cosmetics range in 2017 which was the first Malaysian beauty brand to be retailed in Kuala Lumpur's ultra-prestigious Pavilion Shopping mall. Millennial beauty brand Oh Most Wanted Cosmeceuticals, launched in 2018 by Malaysian actress Nora Danish, manufactures makeup with functional skin care benefits while Irisa Cosmetics, founded that same year by siblings Iman and Irisa, is offering stylishly packaged lip, eye and brow colour cosmetics. Velvet Vanity, whose brand founder was 24 when she introduced her brand in 2016, sells a range of fully vegan and halal makeup. Other notable domestic makeup brands include lip colour labels Marcella & Co, Orkid Cosmetics and Pretty Suci. In 2017, Pretty Suci's two founders launched Malaysia's first halal beauty online store. The outlook for the halal beauty market in the APAC region is very bright. According to Mulyorini R. Hilwan, Advisor of Halal Audit Services at LPPOM-MUI, the region is set to have 1.5 billion Muslims by 2050 and Alvin Yim estimates that by 2027, APAC will register the highest percentage of the double-digit halal cosmetics market growth which is expected to reach USD 104 billion by 2027. And with so many exciting new regional beauty brands the ASEAN halal beauty market is more attractive than ever. Interestingly enough turnover of halal beauty has also been growing amongst non-Muslims in APAC as domestic consumers are increasingly turning to halal-certified cosmetics in their search for safe, clean, cruelty-free products. ""Halal has become a popular product quality seal,"" confirms Kantar Worldpanel's Prita Anindya Laksmita. With ingredient safety a major consideration for many ASEAN consumers, this development will further continue to boost the halal beauty market. What is halal beauty? Manufactured according to the Islamic Sharia law, halal cosmetics must not contain ingredients that are haram (forbidden) by Islam, such as alcohol or GMO ingredients, components sourced from the human body, from animals that are forbidden by Sharia (such as pigs) or from animals that have been slaughtered in a non-halal way. The cosmetics cannot be manufactured in a facility that also handles non-halal products (this also applies to product storage, packaging, display and shipping) or processed with non-halal machinery and equipment. While this might seem straightforward enough at first, it becomes more complex with beauty and personal care. Face creams often have 20+ ingredients including actives and compounds which are sourced from different companies and regions. To certify a product halal the source of each cosmetic ingredient must be demonstrably free of non-halal components. For example, cosmetic actives cannot contain placenta, albumin or keratin components derived from humans or from incorrectly slaughtered animals, whilst the culture, media and additives used in the manufacturing of other typical beauty ingredients such as enzymes, proteins, ferments or even AHAs must also be certifiably halal, i.e. containing neither non-halal components nor having been produced in a non-halal facility. Products such as colour cosmetics, sun screens or body lotions also need to be water-permeable to allow for the ritual wudhu washings, so ""water-proof"" and ""water-resistant"" claims can also be tricky. Since there is no global halal authority or certifying body and each Muslim (or Muslim-majority) country has its own halal regulations (and domestic certifiers), a halal certification gained for a particular regional market might not be recognised in another Muslim country. However, the certifying authorities in the bigger halal markets, such as Malaysia or Indonesia, usually acknowledge certain foreign halal certifiers although products will still need to be officially registered in the target country."
Powder cosmetics: industry adapts to market boom,"The craze for a ""zero waste"" bathroom free from liquid hygiene products with bulky packaging, most of which made of plastic, is now conveyed by an increasingly substantial powder offering. Various solutions have been emerging: loose or compact powders to be rehydrated in a bottle (900.care, Juliette) in order to reconstitute a liquid product and keep it, or loose powders to be directly used with water, like the Perlucine range, the Yodi shampoos and cleansers, or the Laboté face care masks in single-dose plant-derived capsules. All these solutions go with a new, simple and convenient gesture appealing to consumers willing to reduce their carbon footprints, while preserving the quality and sensoriality of the products they use daily. In this context, the latest launches seem to highlight a preference for the loose version of powders. ""Loose powder has the advantage of avoiding a shaping phase, compared to compact forms, and of dissolving more easily and quickly in water, a priori, when the product is reconstituted. But because it is designed to be diluted so it becomes a liquid hygiene product that can be kept, preservatives are needed,"" explains Stéphanie Reymond, founder and Director of Squarexpert, a technical and marketing consulting agency specialized in cosmetics. However, this constraint can be avoided with the loose version to be diluted every time it is used. The latest launches include the brand new JU shower gels. Perfumed with cotton flower, orange blossom, vanilla, or almond, they get in the bathroom in the form of packs of powder to be diluted. A secured glass-based pump-bottle is supplied with the first order, along with three 25-gramme powder packs with various perfumes which, once diluted in tap water, are used to reconstitute a liquid shower gel to be kept. The very fluid powder can be easily mixed to formulate a product suited to the whole family. The doses packed in paper and partly in a light recyclable plastic film are shipped in a plain envelope and can be kept up to three years. ""We wanted to make things happen by first offering a shower gel, a product which usually contains 90% of water. JU only keeps the 10% of actives remaining in the form of powder composed of 99% of ingredients of natural origin,"" explains Karline Hamain, founder of the Juliette brand. Going forward, the brand has planned to develop a comprehensive hygiene range for adults & kids, including, next February, toothpaste designed with the same concept and presented in the form of an 8-gramme pack of powder to hydrate in an adapted pump-bottle. To support its strategy, the brand has partnered with the Normandy-based, health & beauty specialists Laboratoires Gilbert to make the products. ""There are still few specialized players on the market. Formulation and packaging are quite technical,"" explains the brand founder. As Stéphanie Reymond confirms, powder product manufacturing still presents a few constraints. ""In terms of formulation, the choice of solid surfactants is still quite limited, especially when you want to satisfy naturalness, Cosmos, and skin tolerance criteria,"" she says. ""In terms of production, packaging is tricky. Due to the volatile nature of powder, there can be risks when handling this type of ingredients: some mixtures are explosive, there are risks of inhalation and contact with the skin… All this should be avoided,"" she adds. The brand Step One, launched in 2019 in Aurillac, in central France, actually developed based on their technical skills: as soon as 2017, they registered a first patent about their production method. Now, they boast a broad range of 21 references: shower gels/cleansing gels for body & hair, face & hands, and shampoos, always in the form of powders to dilute in a bottle, and refills in compostable PLA paper packs. The brand exports a lot, in particular to Nordic countries, and in January 2022, they launched the first powder deodorant to be reconstituted (6 g) in a 50-ml roll-on bottle with a glass ball recyclable over and over. ""We were the first to define a formulation + production complex. Today, there is a strong demand for tailor-made products based on our technology,"" explains Héloïse Fontaine, founder of the startup. To meet this demand, the laboratory is considering stepping up their game with a more important industrialization phase, in particular with the support of ADEME, the French Agency for Ecological Transition – the company won the EETE request for proposals as part of the France Relance state recovery programme, which shows their commitment for sustainability. ""The idea is to be able to supply key accounts, because they are increasingly interested in our approach,"" highlights the entrepreneur. As for Lessonia, the ingredient & cosmetics manufacturer and powder specialist since the company was found, they also chose to strengthen their industrial tool by purchasing a packaging machine for powder cosmetics. ""Powder products require industrial equipment and know-how that not all cosmetics companies can boast. The issues are not the same, there are problems with mixtures, grain size, density, long wear… As for packaging, a powder injector is definitely not the same thing as an injector designed for liquids,"" says Innovation Director Charles-Henri Morice. In addition, the Director points at regulatory constraints, which, for now, are not adapted to this new market and its very specific characteristics. ""What can be considered as the finished product, the powder or the reconstituted product?"" he asks. ""The fact that the product is transformed makes it all more complex, and we are struggling with this regulatory vacuum. Let's take the example of preservatives: they need to be in sufficient quantity in the finished reconstituted product, but on the other hand, under the European Cosmetics Regulation, there is a limit not to be exceeded in the dry product. So we need to find the right percentage in the powder so it is enough for the reconstituted product,"" explains Charles-Henri Morice. Despite being very young, the powder cosmetic/hygiene product category requires adjustments due to a high demand. This transitional phase promises a bright future."
"2022 beauty will be bold in the UK, according to John Lewis","Having experienced with beauty during lockdowns, consumers will continue to do so with a renewed interest for bite-sized beauty. Advents calendars, gift boxes and discovery sets will continue to be key to trial luxury brands and new products before committing to full size. The concept of 'fragrance wardrobe' is also building momentum, with consumers exploring new fragrances based on their mood, or layering them to create a bespoke scent. Long-lasting EDPs are preferred over EDTs, luxe scented body sprays and hand care elevate hygiene routines, and fragranced shower oils, shampoos and mists are taking over personal care. Going back IRL, people are boasting bolder makeup looks. In tribute to the 1990s, lips will be the focus of makeup, with highly pigmented, matte lipsticks meant to withstand mask-wearing, and lipliners making a dramatic comeback. With light-catching complexions and fluffy-yet-defined eyebrows to complete the tableau. To picture it, think Emily in Paris! Multi-use beauty is taking a new form. Maximising efficacy and cutting down on packaging, it ticks all the right trend boxes. Biggest seller for beauty, skincare drives this, with amped-up active-based products that target, in one go, multiple post-pandemic lifestyle-related skin concerns. In this hygienic era, consumer look to bridge the gap between cosmetic and pharmaceutical skincare, seeking well-known staples in the likes of retinol, vitamin C, AHAs, BHAs and hyaluronic acid to achieve salon-level results. Buzz word of the year, microbiome should get yet more adepts, while makeup and haircare will also boost their formulas to offer multiple benefits. And while beauty routines are potentially shrinking around multi-use products, the at-home salon experience is still high in demand. Which should profit the soaring sales of LED light masks, facial toning devices and clever cleansers. Daily beauty routines seem also to be blending into 24-hour wellness routines. The raise in mental health awareness led many consumers to educate themselves and seek calming essential oils and self-mixed aromatherapeutic blends for the day. As an example, at John Lewis, the sales of Aveda Chakra™ 4 Balancing Mist have increased by 350% year on year. And it seems the night is no longer a no-beauty zone, with sales of sleepscape elements going out the roof: apart from the scented pillow mists, the British department store recorded +533% in sales of silk pillowcases. This holistic beauty movement is seeing collagen supplements becoming customer favourites on our shores too. A well-identified post-pandemic trend, beauty with meaning is seen by John Lewis as a new essential. They foresee waste-reducing refillable products becoming the norm, with the likes of Ouai, Rituals, Charlotte Tilbury, Hourglass, Evolve, Voltary already well into the movement. Not just preferable anymore, sustainably sourced ingredients, responsible formulas and planet-first packaging will be core benefits for beauty products."
Focus on microbiome creates new skincare generation,"A pioneer of the microbiome-friendly skincare wave, the brand Gallinée has become a reference. Launched on the British and French markets six years ago, it is now significantly growing: its turnover doubles every year and it is present in over 30 countries. ""Gallinée is fast developing. We stand out from other brands on the market in that they are mostly focused on skincare, while we develop different product categories at the request of our customers. For example, we are the first to offer 'microbiome-friendly' oral care products. It should be known that the mouth microbiome is protective. 95% of these bacteria are good, while 5% are possibly deleterious, and yet, twice a day, we try to kill them with antibacterial products,"" explains the brand's founder, Marie Drago. Indeed, the brand has developed toothpaste with prebiotics whose microbiome-friendly action was confirmed by an independent laboratory, just like for all the brand's products, and a solid mouthwash with pre- and probiotics to nourish the mouth microbiome – the brand's current bestseller. The hair care line focused on scalp issues is also successful, and, more recently, Gallinée launched the first face oil with prebiotics on the market. ""There has been fast-growing interest in these products due to the Covid pandemic. People really tried to understand how prebiotics and probiotics could protect the skin. On Google, searches with the 'microbiome skincare' keywords rose by 5,000% in 12 months. Major brands like Sanex also took the plunge. There is real growing interest, with congresses getting organized and articles published. To me, in the future, the impact on the microbiome will be essential to launch a cosmetic product,"" she adds. American brand Dr Elsa Jungman's experience confirms this growing interest. With its minimalist, holistic approach to skincare, the Dr Elsa Jungman range is composed of a gentle cleanser and moisturizing serums with a maximum of five ingredients. ""Our philosophy is based on the 'less is more' concept for the benefit of the skin microbiome. We organize a lot of masterclasses and online events with our community to educate and help consumers reconnect with their skins. Adding a product cannot solve a skin problem,"" explains Elsa Jungman, founder of the brand, the first to be ""microbiome-friendly""-certified in the US. Faced with an increasing number of customers asking for more knowledge about their own skin flora, the scientist developed Meet My Microbiome, a chargeable kit to analyze your skin microbiome, in partnership with a laboratory. ""Last spring, we tested a pilot for 50 USD. Despite the price, the experience was much successful and I realized what people actually wanted in the first place was discover their own microbiome. It confirms the market is much more mature in the US. A year ago, I would never have thought I could launch this product,"" she explains. The participants received a report which described the diversity of their microbiome, the number of bacteria and fungi species detected, and the corresponding definitions. ""We did the scientific literature search needed to find out what was the potential impact of each of the species detected, and we defined a score indicating their positive or negative impacts on the skin,"" adds Elsa Jungman. In addition to the report, there are recommendations regarding rituals or product profiles. ""But no brands, not even ours. Consumers should remain free to make their own choices"". The final version of Meet My Microbiome has been available since last October on the brand's website, as well as at clean beauty distributor Credo Beauty for 149 USD. Given the increasing demand for products that preserve the skin's bacterial flora, manufacturers have started developing ranges with clearer claims, like MS Beautilab, who highlight the postbiotic concept with their new anti-ageing natural line, Fermented Line, the first of the laboratory claimed to be microbiome friendly. ""We use probiotic ferments like a plant that produces synthetic ingredients in order to collect metabolites derived from their work. Then, these metabolites become postbiotics: our active. Here, we used an active developed by Silab, Lactobiotyl,"" explains Frédéric Boucly, R&D Manager – MS Advanced Skincare Solutions of MS Beautilab. This active acts on cell renewal and skin radiance. It is a postbiotic designed to target radiance and the skin barrier's integrity. It is used in all the emulsions in the range. ""We also used fermented camellia oil with a better affinity with the skin and squalane derived from sugar cane fermentation,"" adds Frédéric Boucly. With this new anti-ageing line, MS Beautilab associated naturalness with actives derived from fermentation, as they viewed their natural properties as an additional advantage. ""The notion of fermentation is very common throughout Asia. Consumers are familiar with these claims, since they are related to naturalness and provide an added value in that they offer a skin benefit,"" concludes the scientist. After prebiotics and probiotics, postbiotics derived from fermentation could represent a new phase in microbiome-focused cosmetics."
Shopping on social networks could reach $1.2 trillion by 2025,"According to an Accenture study titled Why Shopping's Set for a Social Revolution, so-called social commerce is expected to be worth USD 1.2 trillion by 2025, while the current global market generates $492 billion [1]. According to Accenture, shopping on social networks will grow ""three times as fast as traditional ecommerce."" In other words, it's a market with high potential for influencers on networks like TikTok or Instagram. At the forefront, Generations Z and Y could be at the origin of 62% of the spending done via social networks. Millennials are forecast to account for the majority of social commerce spending, to the tune of $401 billion, compared to $359 billion for Generation Z. Boomers are likely to be less fond of this way of shopping, with a spend of some $128 billion expected for 2025. As for Generation X, they will be responsible for 28% of the market, with $344 billion worth of shopping on social media. Some 64% of social network users report making a purchase on a platform in the past year, which already accounts for almost two billion online shoppers worldwide, Accenture notes. ""The pandemic showed how much people use social platforms as the entry point for everything they do online — news, entertainment and communication,"" said Robin Murdoch, global Software & Platforms industry lead at Accenture. ""The steady rise in time spent on social media reflects how essential these platforms are in our daily life. They're reshaping how people buy and sell, which provides platforms and brands with new opportunities for user experiences and revenue streams,"" he added. Among online shoppers, 63% say they are more likely to buy from the same merchant, highlighting the importance of loyalty even on social networks. According to the study, consumers are most afraid of not being refunded properly and not being protected enough. This was a negative point also raised in the early days of e-commerce, points out Accenture. Oliver Wright, the firm's global Consumer Goods and Services lead, said: ""Trust is an issue that will take time to overcome, but the sellers who focus on these areas will be better positioned to grow market share."" The Accenture report also determines which purchases are likely to be the most popular on social media by 2025. Fashion will be the primary driver of growth, with 18% of all social commerce by 2025. This will be followed by electronics at 13% and home decoration at 7%. Accenture also points out that the sale of fresh food products and snacks could well reach 13%, almost exclusively for the Chinese market, and that the beauty sector should rapidly gain ground in the coming years. L'Oréal's Professional Products Division, for instance, recently announced a partnership with the start-up Replika Software to implement its turnkey social selling software in the brand's network of partner hair salons."
"""Ice globes"" - Is the power of cold creating a new skincare trend?","Throughout 2021, TikTok and the other social networks were invaded by new beauty techniques dedicated specifically to skincare. If there's one thing that really stood out, it's ice, and using the powers of cold, notching up millions of views. Indeed, skin-icing, frozen cucumber, iced rice water and frozen beauty blenders were some of the top beauty hacks of 2021, while cryolipolysis — or fat freezing — has become one of the most popular cosmetic treatments (even if side effects suffered by the ex-model Linda Evangeslista came to underline the risks). Inevitably, this icy wave has paved the way for new beauty tools and tricks. This is undoubtedly the case of ice globes, the new skincare trend to monitor in early 2022. Such is the hype that the global search platform Stylight [1] has seen a 97% increase in clicks for the Skin Gym brand — known for its many facial tools — between November and December 2021. The search engine also reports a 194% jump in search interest for ice globes during December 2021, according to Google Trends data. An ice globe is a very simple tool which — as its name suggests — takes the form of two globes that you fill with water then place in the refrigerator or freezer, before applying them to the face for a massage on dry skin or after applying a cream or serum. They supposedly help soothe the skin, reduce inflammation and imperfections, and even reduce dark circles and bags. Their virtues are therefore similar to those of skin-icing, which only requires an ice cube, but without the discomfort of applying ice directly to the skin. On TikTok, at the beginning of the months, the #iceglobe hashtag counted more than a million views, and #iceglobes counted more than nine million views. Overall, ice globes form part of a larger phenomenon that involves drawing on the riches of nature — sometimes among the simplest — to get healthy and flawless skin."
Co-creation: Towards a novel innovation strategy?,"Launched two years ago by Simon Ménard, the Nidéco platform relies exclusively on its female consumers to develop its product range. ""Our 10-years' experience in the cosmetic sector showed us that things were not necessarily done by our values. Most of the time, the product had to appeal to the retailer first and foremost, leaving the final consumer aside. Hence, we felt that we needed a more straightforward brand, we wanted to create THE brand for female consumers. In this case, they provide the project, select it and support it. The idea is also to redistribute differently the value created,"" he explains. The idea behind Nidéco is based entirely on this interaction. A call for projects is launched on the site. Consumers respond and submit their ideas for products, often based on a specific issue for which they found no answer on the market. One to two projects are selected per month and put to the vote. The idea validated by at least 2000 voters will directly trigger the formulation process with constant consultation of the community. ""At this point, we start co-developing the project via Instagram with people who might be interested (4000 to 5000 people). Since the beginning, with nearly 80,000 people, 20 projects have been co-created, of which 16 became sales products to date,"" adds Simon Ménard. The community is involved in the marketing mix, the choice of packaging, texture, volume... A partner laboratory develops the formula with the approval of the co-creator who came up with the idea. In this collaborative spirit, the concept leaves a lot of room for the sharing of the value generated. The co-creator receives an envelope of 500 euros when her idea is selected, then a 1500 euro cheque once 2000 votes have been reached. Finally, she receives 10% of the profits from the sale of her product. An unprecedented value creation process. ""We would also like to set up a system of ambassadresses, a sort of direct digital sales concept,"" adds the founder. For the time being, the Nidéco range, which is currently only sold online, and consists to date of 16 references, will make its debut in January at Le Printemps in Paris (Nation and Grands Boulevards). The director also confirms the launch of the brand in the Middle East with the Chalhoub Group at the beginning of 2022, as well as an expansion in Europe via Amazon. ""We will also make our debut on the Chinese market next spring via the social selling model, which is very popular in the country,"" he continues. More recently, the Crème de Toi initiative is aimed at brands by offering them decision-making tools during the design and development phases. ""For brands, it is difficult to access a panel of consumers for regular exchanges. Crème de Toi is a platform for the co-creation of cosmetics, which positions the consumer as a decision-making aid for brands. He becomes a consumer-actor,"" explains Ranesha Goorochurn, cosmetology expert and founding partner with Pierre Guérineau, in charge of artistic direction, and Yazid Saïdi, the technical director, also founding partners. ""The idea is to put the consumer back at the centre of the cosmetic creation process, with confidence and transparency. It also allows showing the consumer the different steps to create a finished product. On the other hand, the brand will be able to test its ideas and its product and therefore correct its development if necessary,"" he specifies. On social networks, the brand invites its community to be closely involved in the creative process, like ""accomplices"" by registering on a dedicated platform. Participants will then be able to interact on different successive product development stages: Analysis, conception, design, development, manufacturing and marketing. ""The brand will submit its product idea to consumers who in turn, will give the thumbs up or down for it, in the form of votes or comments. The first three stages are really about determining the expectations of consumers, on the ingredients, the texture, the pack, or any other matter that can be customised by the brand depending on its product, for example, the choice of a lipstick shade... This further improves the attractiveness of the project,"" adds the co-founder. The 400 ""accomplices"" registered on the platform to date, have filled their profile in (skin type, hair type, age, needs, expectations, etc.). This data will allow the brand to evaluate and take into consideration those who best match its target. Once the specifications have been determined, a targeted panel will test and give feedback on a sample of the product which was sent to them. Free since its launch last March, the platform will offer brands a monthly subscription system or à la carte packages from 2022. The Crème de Toi team is now working on the next version, which will include a gamification system. Each interaction will result in points being earned, and ultimately products."
Beauty snacking: A moment to break up the boredom of the homeworking lifestyle,"""Beauty snacking"", this short beauty moment that combines relaxation and pleasure, to break the routine of homeworking, is one of the major trends of the moment, according to WGSN. This phenomenon was born from the boredom of the first lockdowns during which consumers learned to intersperse their tiring and endless days of online work, with cocooning moments in their bathroom: a moment in the bathtub, a charcoal mask applied to the face, a scrub or a home hair treatment… Between two contracts, reports, or videoconferences, these micro sessions of self-care aimed to take an invigorating, energizing break, that helped to avoid the monotony of this period of social distancing. Contrary to what one might have imagined, heading back to the office didn't really alter these new habits adopted by women and men during lockdowns. The trend is not about applying a quick face mask in the middle of the open space, it is about using certain — more discreet — products at any time of the day to give one's morale, as well as one's skin, a boost. WGSN describes it as ""micro beauty moments"" to ""break up the homeworking lifestyle or create moments of pleasure."" There are a multitude of products that are perfectly suited to this new practice, and more are expected to arrive in 2022: lip balm and scrub, rapid face masks, eye masks and patches, etc. Among the cosmetics best suited to this trending routine are none other than moisturizing mists and sprays that do not affect one's makeup. Dry shampoos can be used between two meetings, while a multitude of tools for the face such as the famous jade or rose quartz stone rollers, and tools used for gua sha massage can be used for a quick, relaxing swipe. According to WGSN, 'beauty snacking' will also take on a more literal definition with edible skincare in the shape of sweets and health bars that will continue to grow at fast pace in 2022."
Fermented beauty: The rising trend of 2022?,"Beauty habits have changed considerably since the beginning of the pandemic, with many consumers trading their multiple layers of cosmetics for a more minimalist and holistic beauty, with the aim to safeguard the skin from environmental factors — like pollution, tobacco, the sun, etc. — while giving it the opportunity to restore and strengthen. To this end, the boom in prebiotics and probiotics is expanding, giving rise to a new, very similar trend, in fermented beauty. An age-old process used in many countries around the world, particularly in Asia, biological fermentation describes the transformation that certain organic materials undergo under the action of enzymes secreted by micro-organisms. In other words, these micro-organisms — which can be enzymes, bacteria or yeasts — induce the decomposition of basic materials or ingredients to transform them into components that may be much more powerful. As with prebiotics, the objective is to multiply the ""good"" bacteria at the expense of ""bad"" ones in order to ramp up the power of each active ingredient and boost its benefits for the skin. Fermentation has long been practiced for the processing of a large variety of foods. And the process is essentially the same for fermented beauty. According to the supporters of the technique, not only does fermentation act as an active ingredient booster, but it also makes for a higher concentration of nutrients and antioxidants — goodbye signs of aging — while optimizing the penetration of active ingredients into the skin. Furthermore, the natural substances developed during the fermentation process supposedly extend the shelf life of these formulations. Some niche brands already offer — and in some cases have long offered — cosmetics based on fermented ingredients, but the giants of the sector are also starting to gradually adapt to meet new customer demands. Indeed, fermented beauty is one of the beauty trends that's predicted to boom in 2022, as revealed by projections from trend forecaster WGSN. It's a phenomenon that could send kombucha, a fermented tea-based drink, racing to the top of the most popular cosmetic ingredients. In the meantime, it's already possible to try out this new generation of cosmetics thanks to the Gallinée brand, a specialist in prebiotics, whose hair cleansing cream is enriched with fermented rice water. Otherwise, look for Innisfree and its fermented soy masks, or Whamisa, a true specialist in the field."
"Trends: Generation Z sets the tone for cosmetics, said Quadpack","Quadpack's Market Insights team analysed the rising trends that will affect the beauty industry in 2022. All sum up the mindset of a principled, yet playful generation. Joy and playfulness are the new keywords for colour cosmetics. Young consumers want a fun routine with products that stimulate their creativity. Limited editions and collaborations with bold colours, glitter and unique textures invite the consumer to have fun. Consumers are less willing to compromise their beliefs over an attractive product or brand. The beauty industry must truly commit to social and environmental causes, being transparent every step of the way. As young people are increasingly informed and educated, they spot greenwashing in a heartbeat. As an evolution of the 'natural beauty' trend, consumers are more open to lab-made solutions that help protect the environment. From an ingredient that replaces animal origin elements to a mineral sunscreen that is not harmful to coral reefs, tech for good is always welcome. The era of 'hiding imperfections' is about to die – at least for now. Freckles, spots, wrinkles, folds, are personal marks and should be enhanced by make-up. Brands must be inclusive and bring diverse solutions or risk being boycotted. Products that make people look and smell good are desirable, but not enough to conquer their hearts. Besides having beautifying and healthy effects, cosmetics should tackle wellbeing and bring holistic benefits, for the body and the mind. Gen Z established TikTok and their virtual lives are more important than ever. While some brands are launching try-on filters and apps, others are focusing on products that help the consumer look good on camera."
Skinskool lists lower-cost alternatives to expensive luxury skincare,"The algorithm developed by the Skinskool platform allows to find copies — or dupes — of skincare products considered as too expensive by some consumers. A score shows how well the original product matches the cheaper one. And in this little game — which can last for hours — one might soon notice that certain skincare products selling for nearly EUR 150 are 100% similar to products selling for less than EUR 20, as far as the list of ingredients is concerned. ""Dupe Finder"" is the name of the algorithm developed for the Skinskool platform, with the help of a biochemist and a software engineer. It is not based on a keyword search but on the ingredients contained in the formula of each product. The ""Dupe Finder"" groups all similar ingredients and prioritizes them ""based on relevance and functionality."" All of this is done automatically, making it easier to include all the new skincare products that regularly come to the market. With this technology, any internet user can simply search for a specific skincare product to see a list of similar — or almost similar — products, rated with a match score. The platform claims to be able to identify ""comparable dupes for over 90% of skincare products on the market."" The ETX Studio team tested the algorithm with La Prairie's ""Skin Caviar Crystalline Concentrate"" firming serum, priced at EUR 440 per 30 ml on the brand's official website. The result was hardly convincing, since the product that came closest to this choice only 'matches' by 51% and is priced at a minimum of USD 165. All the products that ETX Studio looked for had matches below 75%. However, by making the test with a product put forward by a TikToker fond of this new platform: the antioxidant serum ""C E Ferulic"" by SkinCeuticals, selling for more than EUR 155 in its original version, the ETX Studio team found more impressive match scores: 100% for one product, and 99% for seven other products, and with a price under EUR 10 for some of them. However, are consumers interested in such a platform really aware of the limits of making a comparison of ingredients in a formula? Of course, the platform can detect products based on catalogue formulas and which differ only in marketing. Or, the cases where a multinational sells the same formula under different brands and at different prices. These cases exist, but are not very numerous. But what do 60% or 70% match scores mean? Indeed, it's hard to know if the missing ingredients are or aren't the ones that (ultimately) make all the difference: active ingredients for instance. Moreover, for SkinCeuticals' ""C E Ferulic"" serum, for example, a comparison of the full list of ingredients shows that the original product and its dupe are very similar in the substances they contain. But what about the concentrations? This information is not disclosed by manufacturers and therefore not available to those who designed the algorithm. Hence, SkinCeuticals' ""C E Ferulic"" serum claims to contain ""15% pure vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid), 1% vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and 0.5% ferulic acid."" All these ingredients can also be found in the closest dupe, but without any information on their concentrations. It's a detail that isn't insignificant! To date, the ingredients of more than 32,000 skincare and haircare products have been scanned by Skinskool. It remains to be seen whether consumers will be convinced."
"Beauty, wellness, fashion, home: What trends will Gen Z be driving in 2022?","Looking ahead to 2022, Instagram has unveiled a comprehensive report on the trends to watch out for on the web in its Trend Report 2022. After interviewing 1,200 social network users, aged 13 and 24 in the United States in October 2021, Instagram has identified ten points shaping up to be hot topics in 2022. About one in three people who participated in the survey say they're more interested in buying and learning about ""clean"" makeup and beauty products in 2022: ""This includes plant-based skincare, vegan makeup, using less products on their skin and products with 'clean' ingredients,"" Instagram explains in its report. Clean beauty that balance glowing skin with minimal products and safer ingredients will only grow in 2022. In the same time, fashion looks set to come in various flavours next year. 50% of the teens and young adults surveyed are set to try bold fashion aesthetics like ""Dark Academia,"" ""Goblincore"" and more nostalgic looks in 2022, confirming the return of retro. However, one the main issue will be about protecting the planet. Almost one in four people, or 23%, are expected to shop on second-hand fashion sites in 2022. About 24% of teens and young adults intend to help make fashion more eco-friendly by selling their stuff on sites or social networks next year. Thrift store fashion will still be relevant in 2022 as the issue of eco-responsibility in the fashion world is still a top concern for Generation Z. While online shopping has become a real trend on social networks, about 27% of teens and young adults, or more than one in four, plan to use social networks to make purchases. While TikTok can boast of being a springboard for new artists, Instagram also confirms the importance of music on its platform. 24% of users say they are more excited about visual music experiences in 2022, while one in four teens expect to follow live concerts on social networks. 70% of teens even rely on social networks to discover new songs and artists. And when it comes to music, it's all about dancing. Dance challenges will always be a hit online. More than one in three teens are looking forward to new dance challenges in 2022, including more elaborate routines. For four in five young people, influencers and other well-known content creators on social networks have more impact on culture than traditional celebrities such as actors, Instagram reveals in its report, ""Today, young people are impacted by a wide spectrum of creators and their relationship is more tightly aligned around shared interests and less so on how popular they've gotten."" The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken up the relationship with work. 63% of Gen Zers agree that they have re-evaluated their career goals because of the pandemic. For this so-called sacrificed generation, a large salary is no longer seen as a goal in life. 71% now prefer to have a meaningful job, even if it pays less. The younger generation has totally redefined what success looks like. 90% of Gen Zers believe that the best education comes from real-life experiences. 66% of them are even beginning to re-assess the true value of a college education. The #Food hashtag has a bright future ahead of it. Cooking on social media will still be trending in 2022. According to Instagram, young users will still be looking for new and increasingly complex recipes to further improve their cooking skills. Indeed, one in six teens or young millennials are showing increased interest in at-home molecular gastronomy. Meanwhile, one in five young adults want to learn more about mixology techniques to try at home, or are ready to go out of their way to learn about new ways to source ingredients. Wellness is one of the trends that works on Instagram. Indeed, at-home workouts are more popular among the social network's users, at 48%, compared to 34% for those not on Instagram. To feel good, users will continue to talk about mental health. About one in three will partake in activities such as meditation sessions and exercise events. Creative hobbies will also be sought after, with one in four young people trying their hand at drawing, painting or any other artistic activity. The new generation wants to feel good, both physically and mentally, and this also involves creating a more environmentally friendly home. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the world of video games has boomed. This trend was already present and will continue to attract new followers. With the creation of avatars and the arrival of fashion and beauty in the metaverse, ""non-gamer"" gamers are accessing video games through fashion. Now, one in five young people expect to see more branded clothing for their digital avatars. Plus, 40% of teenagers and young adults expect more trends around video games in 2022. Live-streaming of video games will continue to appeal to young people, with about three in ten watching livestreams of gamers. To better cope with the often gloomy news, internet users will increasingly rely on the use of memes, these humorous viral montages often shared on social networks. More than one in five young people paid more attention to memes about the stock market and astrology in the past year. Instagram users are more engaged citizens, it seems. They are more likely to have voted in local, state and national elections, at 18% compared to 6% for young people not using Instagram, the social network said. Plus, 52% of Instagrammers followed a social justice account in 2021. They are also increasingly willing to donate to causes, at 37% for 2022 against 32% in 2021. A generosity from which charities will be able to benefit by making appeals for donations directly on Instagram."
Influencers have a significant impact on sales but not on the long term,"Nine out of ten products analysed in select Amazon subcategories showed a relationship between TikTok viral exposure and a rise by more than 85.3%, on average, of their Amazon revenue, from one month to the next, found a recent study, conducted by Ines Durand, eCommerce Specialist at Similarweb. But while this beneficial effect is visible, it's not necessarily sustainable. According to the study findings, sales of these products return to normal two months after their TikTok success. Many products have become viral hits on TikTok, from CeraVe SA Cleanser to The Ordinary's AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution and Revlon's One Step hair-drying styling brush. Such products have brought increased revenue to brands. Analyzing revenue from these products, which are widely reviewed on TikTok, between September 2020 and August 2021, the study showed an average growth of 112% for Revlon, 61% for The Ordinary and 37% for CeraVe. L'Oreal Paris, for its part, managed to achieve more than 400% growth on average with its Infallible Fresh Wear Powder foundation, released in December 2020. According to Similarweb analytics, the original video was viewed by seven million users in February 2021, launching a chain reaction of videos. Dates that coincide with revenue growth of over 1,238% between January and February 2021. While revenue for the foundation reached $20,300 last January, it jumped to $272,200 the following month, far exceeding the +2.6% month-on-month category growth rate for the period. More generally, the #Beauty hashtag has almost 71 billion views on TikTok. The hashtag #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, bringing together products promoted by users, has more than seven billion views. The #BestAmazonFinds hashtag has been used more than 45.7 million times. Furthermore, Similarweb's study highlights TikTok's significant power of influence compared to Instagram. TikTok achieves a better engagement rate, four times higher than Meta's social network, at 17.5% compared to just 4.2%. Brands have every interest in developing their presence on TikTok. With a particularly high engagement rate, and a growth in the number of active users on the social network, TikTok is a hive of marketing opportunity for brands. That's something that the shaving cream brand EOS has clearly understood. After a video of the user Carly Joy went viral on TikTok, the brand chose to surf on this free publicity. After around 10 million views, the brand launched a limited-edition version of the product presented by Carly Joy, using her own technique. The study reports month-on-month revenue growth of over 171% for EOS shaving cream in March 2021, from $54,100 to $146,800. The expected growth in this product category was, however, estimated at +30%. It is clearly a reality and not a myth that TikTok influencers have the power to boost product sales. Some are already capitalizing on their popularity by adding links to mentioned products in their biography — a way to earn commission on sales. Conversely, it is likely that a bad buzz, like the one recently experienced by the Chanel Advent calendar, can also have disastrous consequences."
From waterless washing to wild bathing: the key beauty trends for 2022,"The focus of beauty products for 2022 will be on usability and sustainability. ""The top beauty trends for 2022 reflect wider societal changes, as consumers continue to look to sustainably minded practises and products including waterless elements and longer shelf lives,"" says Clare Varga, WGSN's Head of Beauty. According to WGSN's international team of expert, next year's trends will feature hygiene procedures that save water, fermented beauty, faster makeup routines and beauty snacking: – Waterless Washing: Waterless washing products conserve water, accommodating the one in 10 individuals globally who lack access to safe drinking water. This trend is an evolution of waterless beauty, and bring your own water (BYOW) products, with early innovators offering Showerless Shampoo and no-water-needed shaving products. – Fermented Beauty: The desire for potent ingredients that last longer is driving interest in kombucha for the skin. Driven by the K- and J-Beauty markets, fermentation releases enzymes that break down molecules so they can better penetrate the skin, delivering powerful ingredients into the very structure of the skin or hair. The process of fermentation also cultivates the growth of beneficial bacteria such as lactic, organic and acetic acids, which act as natural preservatives. These naturally occurring bacterias prolong the shelf life of formulas, appealing to both the sustainably minded and value-focused consumer. – The two-minute make up bag: The two-minute makeup bag appeals to consumers who want a healthy 'no make-up look' quickly. Aligning with the convenience of fast, low-maintenance looks and techniques adopted during the pandemic, the two-minute make up bag offers flexible and low-key beauty lifestyles as consumers adjust to a hybrid post-pandemic existence. Products will concentrate on new and smarter beauty hacks that deliver better results with less effort, money, and commitment. – Beauty Snacking: A new beauty trend emerged during lockdown: the beauty snack. Set to become a staple in 2022, micro beauty moments were incorporated into consumers' lives during the pandemic, to break up the homeworking lifestyle or create moments of pleasure. Beauty snacking includes flash treatments and easy, no-mess formulas. It will also take on a more literal definition with edible skincare in the shape of sweets and health bars emerging in 2022. – Wild Bathing: The urge to reconnect with nature will drive customers to seek the natural benefits of open water and outdoor spas. With roots in many cultures, indigenous populations, and traditional therapies across the world, such as Japanese onsen and Victorian bathing machines, this practise is steeped in heritage. Bath and body products that replicate outdoor bathing will bring nature inside. Soaps, substances, and materials derived from nature will increase in popularity, as will products based on seaweed or seawater. – Coastal-Foraged Ingredients: Skincare and personal care products that include seaweed extracts, kelp, sea fennel and algae will become mainstream must-haves. Coastal ingredients will be valued for their soothing, hydrating, detoxifying, therapeutic, and transportive ability. Consumers will gravitate towards local, seasonal, and wild-harvested items that are beneficial for their skin and the environment."
Top beauty trends spotted at Cosmoprof Asia Digital Week 2021,"With rigid beauty stereotypes still the norm in many Asian societies, anti-ageing cosmetics are traditionally a large and important market in the APAC region. In countries such as China, for example, anti-ageing buyers are getting increasingly younger and even women in their early 20s are starting to purchase beauty products that promise to guard against signs of early ageing. At CADW, many of the face care products had a distinct high-tech or medical vibe. Japanese manufacturer Alen International introduced Skin Scientist AI, described as an anti-ageing serum formulated with ""smart"" capsules of ingredients that recognise damaged areas in the skin barrier and deliver the specific actives that are needed. Malaysia's Sky Resources presented the Age Halt Needle-Free Serum which contains Neodermyl complex and hyaluronic acid. And Changzhou Weibo Hi-Tech Biotechnology from China specialises in freeze-dried functional cosmetics. The brand's Centella Repairing Freeze-Dried Mask is a sheet mask ""activated"" with water which turns the active ingredient into a rich, thick essence. The global microbiome skin care trend was also visible at the show, especially amongst Korean exhibitors. Product launches highlighted calming and microbiome-strengthening ingredients like ferments and probiotics. K-beauty brand Reinplatz's Calming Sensitive Serum contains centella asiatica and saccharomyces ferment to strengthen the skin's barrier while Aqua Derma Cream in Korean microbiome researcher Bifido's Bifidolab face care range combines probiotics with hyaluronic acid to strengthen the microbiome. And fellow Korean Biomeek's Sensimetic Soothing Toner contains a special barrier complex and hyaluronic acid to deeply hydrate sensitive skin. While international skin and body care labels are, of course, still popular in APAC there has been a distinct rise in domestically-manufactured cosmetics brands across many of the major regional markets. Local pride is ruling supreme in a number of Asian countries. In China, the recent popularity of local beauty products rose on the back of the guochao trend [Chinese retro trendy] which, in turn, has been fuelled by the current surge in patriotism amongst the younger generation. Hanbang beauty [based on traditional Korean medicine] has been popular in Korea for decades whilst Japanese consumers are traditionally deeply appreciative of regionally specific beauty or food ingredients. However, the price-performance ratio also plays a crucial role in some APAC markets. In the developing economy of Indonesia, for example, domestic beauty has also grown since the pandemic began but here the cheaper price tag (when compared to imported brands) is playing an important role. At CADW many of the Asian exhibitors presented products with specific regional ingredients. Japanese beauty brand Edobio, for example, recently launched the Saketernal Hydration Serum which contains lactobacillic fermented sake lees and sweet potato root extract. Korean manufacturer Roots Base face care line-up is formulated with ingredients traditionally used in Korean medicine. The Roots Base Hydrating Essence Toner includes poria cocos, a medicinal mushroom that grows amongst the roots of pine trees. Fellow K-beauty label Accoje's products are based on ingredients sourced from Korea's famed Jeju island. The brand's Dust Block Finisher is an anti-pollution moisturizer formulated with Jeju pine leaf extract and Jeju green tea. Another product category that made a strong appearance at CADW was personal fragrance. Traditionally perfumes are not a big market in APAC and up until a few years ago, the Asian fragrance sector was dominated by the classic international mainstream fragrances. Then niche fragrances appeared on the scene – in China, for example, demand for indie fragrances went quickly through the roof – and now a clutch of new Asian fragrance houses is shaping the domestic fragrance markets, especially amongst GenZ consumers. Subtler fragrance options like solid and cream fragrances are a popular format in Asia judging by the number of domestic fragrance houses presenting these types of products at the show. Korean newcomer brand Come Inside Me, for example, offers several cream perfumes packaged in tubes, while Japanese fragrance house Sholayered top sellers include their Crème de Parfum and Crème de Cologne. The brand has also just launched a Non-Alcoholic Perfume Spray said to be particularly suitable for customers who want to avoid alcohol or don't usually wear strong perfumes. Fragrance is also increasingly associated with well-being and mental health in Asia, with aromatherapy-influenced fragrance products very visible at Cosmoprof Asia Digital Week. This trend is, of course, directly related to the effects of the on-going pandemic, correlating to the global surge in popularity of personal care products promising relaxing, calming or sleep-enhancing benefits. Korean fragrance brand I Gentleman for Homme showed its two new scented sprays for fabrics based on the brand's iconic men fragrances. Scented aromatherapy mask sprays are also popular pandemic launches – Sholayered recently brought out a mint-scented fabric mask spray. Japanese exhibitor Edobio launched Aroma Floreeze Spray, which is formulated with lactic acid, green tea extract and lavender. Korean fragrance start-up Deepscent presented its Arom Official ""aroma styler"", a smart fragrance device that is filled with scent capsules and can then be programmed with the user's favourite fragrance blends. The latest Arom Official launch is a range of curated scent travel sets which take customers on an olfactory journey to nine international destinations, including the Korean island of Jeju, the French city of Grasse, Sapporo in Japan, the Maldives, Los Angeles and Seattle. The next Cosmoprof/Cosmopack Asia trade fair is set to take place in Hong Kong from 17th to 19th November 2022 (hopefully), celebrating the 25th anniversary of Asia's leading trade show."
Sales of unisex fragrances expected to grow in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates,"The fragrance market in the U.A.E. is expanding rapidly owing to the rising disposable income. Moreover, the rising investments in advertising and marketing campaigns, increasing volume of digital marketing activities, and growing relevance of personal grooming are also contributing to the growth of the market. From USD 720.2 million in 2020, the U.A.E. fragrance market is set to witness an 8.3% growth rate (Compound Annual Growth Rate – CAGR) between 2020 and 2030, according to market research firm P&S Intelligence [1]. In Saudi Arabia, the fragrance market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% to reach USD 3,810.5 million in 2030, from a USD 1,738.5 million base in 2020 [2]. In both countries, the fragrance market was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a sharp reduction in sales in 2020. In the very next years, unisex fragrances are expected to play a key role in both markets. Younger generations, in particular, seem less interested in the traditional segmentation between women's and men's fragrances. Fragrance companies are recognizing this by designing perfumes that aren't gender specific. While natural fragrances are expected to experience the higher CAGR, of 8.5%, in Saudi Arabia, consumers in the U.A.E. seem to prefer long lasting synthetic fragrances. The demand for luxury fragrances is also expected to grow in both markets. The growing brand consciousness and increasing expenditure on luxury goods by millennials are the main growth drivers for the prestige and luxury segments. Both markets are benefiting from a favourable development in average disposable income. According to P&S Intelligence, currently, almost 60% of the population of the U.A.E. falls in the age group of 14–40 and this population has a significantly higher purchasing power than that in other age groups. According to the Census and Economic Information Center (CEIC) data, in Saudi Arabia, the gross national disposable income reached USD 658,493.5 in 2017 from USD 617,848.7 in 2016. Moreover, as per the data provided by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, consumer spending in the country increased to USD 83,916.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 from $80,067.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Increased participation of people in social events and the need to make a good impression on one's peers also contribute to the rise of fragrance usage."
From originality to retro inspirations: Pinterest's incoming trends for 2022,"With 400 million users worldwide, Pinterest has identified 175 emerging trends that may well shape 2022. [1] When it comes to beauty, watch out for eyelids, teeth and even skin being adorned with jewels in 2022.

"Black lips, face gems and scalp skincare: Beauty is going bold in 2022!","After the no-makeup days of lockdown, then dealing with a more normal but still face-mask-wearing life, next year should bring a touch more eccentricity to the makeup department. While it's hard to know if face masks will still be a must-have accessory of everyday life, it seems that women are opting for more bold and daring beauty choices. So, after being somewhat neglected in recent months, lipstick is now poised to return, albeit in an unexpected colour — black. We knew that the pop-punk aesthetic was making a comeback on the fashion scene, but it was not 100% sure that it would also take over the world of makeup. But that just goes to show how much people are raring to liven up their lives with a touch of audacity. Gone are slippers, dull complexions and sweatsuits, giving way to more extravagance, self-expression and freedom. New data shared by the global fashion research platform Stylight [1] points to a strong craze for black lipstick, as from November. In fact, the platform reports a jump in clicks of more than 1,000% for Clinique's Almost Lipstick in the Black Honey shade. And it's a trend that's confirmed on social networks, with several tens of millions of views for the hashtag #blacklipstick on TikTok, and more than 500,000 publications on Instagram, including a host of recent posts and videos. But that won't be the only extravagant beauty trend coming next year. Even more surprisingly, self-adhesive face jewels also seem to have been gaining popularity for several weeks. Stylight reports that search interest for ""face gems"" tripled in the month of November on Google, and sharply increased on its own international platforms. In particular, ColourPop's face crystals set saw a 100% increase in clicks over the previous month. Not only have brands increased the number of scalp care products, such as brushes and exfoliating scrubs, in recent months, but beauty fans are going crazy for these items. It became a trend, dubbed ""scalp skincare"", a focus on caring for the scalp. Search interest for the terms ""scalp products"" increased by 70% on Google in November, while the favorite product among internet users seems to be the NatureLab Tokyo clarifying scalp scrub, with clicks up 350% on Stylight in October-November compared to the previous two months. As in 2020 and 2021, organic and vegan skincare products will also be in demand, as well as tinted suncare and blue-light protection products, reflecting a desire to prevent environmental damage and combat the signs of skin aging."
German prestige beauty market bounces back thanks to fragrance sales,"Sales of beauty products in the selective channel [1] in Germany increased by 3% in the in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2020, reported market research firm NPD Group and the trade association VKE-Kosmetikverbrand. However, sales over the period January-September 2021 remained down 7% compared to 2020 [2]. The fragrance category clearly appears as the main growth driver, with sales up 7% compared to 2020 and an increase of more than 4% compared to 2019. Skin care, on the other hand, has not yet regained its 2019 level and even remains below the 2020 level. Eventually, the make-up category, which was negatively impacted in 2020, stabilized in 2021 but sales remain down by nearly 20% compared to the 2019 mark. ""The fragrance category is experiencing a faster recovery in the nine countries that we follow at The NPD Group, while social life is gradually getting back to normal. We believe fragrance could even become the new 'lipstick index', "" said Samantha Grand, Executive Director, Germany Beauty at The NPD Group. Actually, perfumes are less impacted than makeup by requirements to wear face masks. Moreover, according to The NPD Group, local demands may also have been stimulated by the dramatic decline in the number of international travel, with a shift in sales previously made in travel retail. Online sales continue to play a major role. The e-commerce now accounts for 40% of the selective beauty market in Germany, compared to 20% two years ago, reported The NPD Group and VKE-Kosmetikverbrand. However, e-commerce sales did not make up the decline of sales in brick and mortar stores that had to close during lockdown periods. However, while restrictions ended in May 2021, the number of shoppers in physical stores remained below expectations, according to The NPD Group, partly due to the absence of international tourists and the continued home working for many employees. ""The pandemic has definitely been a driver and accelerator of omnichannel strategies. But brands also took advantage of this opportunity to improve the customer experience,"" emphasized Martin Ruppmann, Managing Director of VKE-Kosmetikverbrand. In such a context, the last quarter will therefore play a key role for the German prestige beauty market, with high expectations from the various players, whether for Black Friday or for Christmas sales. However, ""purchasing behaviours could be very different compared to recent years,"" pointed Samantha Grand. ""A study by The NPD Group in the United States already confirms this possibility for the American beauty market. The results show, among other things, that we can assume consumers will be shopping earlier this year as they anticipate supply chain shortages and resultant price increases."""
Beauty sales in physical stores rise as UK consumers return to the high street,"Prestige beauty sales in brick-and-mortar stores increased 9% in the 13 weeks to the end of October 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, according to The NPD Group. Online sales for prestige beauty in this period declined 6% when compared to the same 13 weeks in 2020. Based on the 13 week period to the end of October 2021, brick-and-mortar sales accounted for 62% of total sales weight, which increases to 68% if total sales weight when looking at the fragrance category in isolation. According to The NPD Group, this is positive news heading into the Christmas retail period as historically, November and December account for approximately half of a full year's worth of fragrance sales. Fragrance is one of the most dynamic categories in prestige beauty, growing 14% in the period from January 2021 to the end of October 2021, compared to the same period in 2021. This reflects a similar trend across the prestige beauty market where all categories (skincare, make-up and fragrance) are all performing positively compared to the same period in 2020. ""It's great news to see consumers returning to the high street and visiting beauty counters. It demonstrates the continued importance of beauty consultants, and there are other benefits including no delivery costs, you can touch, feel and smell products while also embracing the social aspect of retail therapy. In brick-and-mortar stores you can purchase the tangible product and take it away there and then,"" explains Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty. However, the prestige beauty market has changed dramatically since last autumn when stores were periodically closed due to lockdown. A number of high street retailers have also closed due to the pandemic and e-commerce rapidly developed to become the second largest channel for beauty and grooming purchases after hypermarkets and supermarkets according to GlobalData. The fact that customers return to physical stores for a more hands-on shopping experience represents positive news for prestige beauty retailers and confirms the adoption of e-retailers for beauty and grooming is set to slow. However, e-commerce will continue to grow in the country and retailers definitively have to provide beauty consumers with a tailored omni-channel shopping experience."
Brazil's B-Beauty is winning over its home market and expanding internationally,"Brazilian consumers are convinced their (often) mixed skins, which are highly exposed to sun rays, have their own specificities and require specific rituals. ""We have spent years and years receiving and using products that came from abroad, that were hardly taking into account the peculiarities of Brazilian skins, cultures and routines,"" explains Patrícia Lima, CEO and founder of Simple Organic. ""The Korean routine, for example, has so many steps that it doesn't fit in with our everyday life. Heavy formulations, which require a long absorption time, were not designed for our combination and oily skins and very hot days,"" she adds. Simple Organic is one of the pioneers of the B-Beauty (Brazilian Beauty) movement, which emerged in response to the globalization of cosmetics. ""B-Beauty defends a minimalist and effective routine with products targeting the characteristics of Brazilian skins,"" explains dermatologist Luiz Romancini, founder of Creamy. ""The movement stands out by enhancing the diversity of Brazilian skins. This cultural identification in beauty and personal care rituals is important in finding more assertive formulas and treatments."" The movement has amplified with the outcome of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Skin care has grown in importance during the pandemic and Brazilian brands have focused on bringing the best of Brazil and its raw materials, strengthening themselves in the domestic market and becoming a benchmark in the international market,"" says Patrícia Lima. Patrícia Camargo, co-founder of CARE Natural Beauty, underlines another driver supporting the diffusion of the B-Beauty movement outside Brazil. ""Five years ago, we didn't have as many technologies available for developing high performance products. We think it's a nice surprise for the international market to see so many quality products, originating from Brazil, and focusing on national assets,"" she explains. According to Patrícia Camargo, B-Beauty brands are also very attractive because of their concern for sustainability. ""People are more concerned about everything ending in the environment and the impact of rampant consumption on the planet and health. Purchasing behaviours are changing and consumers' eyes are now attentive to substances harmful to the health and to what packaging is becoming after use."" Another characteristic of companies in the B-Beauty movement is their digital culture: online sales, proximity to customers, partnerships with influencers who respect the diversity of their audience. ""Like other young cosmetics companies, Creamy is completely digital. We were born in the midst of a pandemic and that did not prevent us from conquering our audience. Influencers have played an important role in this process, not only for the sale of products, but also for disseminating useful information on skin care,"" says Luiz Romancini. According to him, B-Beauty is here to stay. ""People are looking to optimize their time, so a simpler and more precise treatment proposal is the best option"". The founder of Simple Organic also believes in the future of the movement. ""What happens abroad will continue to be incorporated into Brazilian routines, but B-Beauty complements that process and is unlikely to evaporate. After all, it makes a lot more sense to adopt what was first thought out for me,"" concludes Patrícia Lima."
Fragrance or face cream: What are the most popular beauty gifts in the USA?,"Because cosmetics are among the most popular gifts at this time of year in the USA, Yves Rocher set out to find out which beauty gifts were most popular in each of country's state at this time of year. The company used data from a Google Trends search of ""beauty gift"" for the period of November 27, 2020 to December 24, 2020 in the USA [1]. According to the study, fragrance gift sets top the list of beauty products heading under the tree December 25, on par with face creams. Sometimes allowing you to test several fragrances, or combine them with other types of cosmetics, fragrance gift sets lead the way as the most popular holiday beauty gift in 11 states, including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. Face creams, in particular moisturizers, seem to make the perfect gift for many Americans, as they also top the list of popular beauty gifts in 11 states, including Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. Makeup is also very popular for holiday giving. And if eye and lip palettes are often the season's star products, these two must-haves seem to be outshone by nail polishes at this time of year. Nail varnish ranks number one in no less than ten states, including Montana, North Dakota, New Hampshire, Indiana, Alaska, and Hawaii. Among the other states surveyed, lipstick is all the rage in New York, eyeshadow palettes are popular in Arizona, Oklahoma and South Dakota, and bath sets seem to be a hit in Arkansas and Kentucky. On the whole, Utah and Oregon appear to be the two states most interested in beauty gifts during the frenzied shopping season that runs from Black Friday to Christmas Eve."
"Harry Styles, icon of a stereotype-free generation, launches beauty line","For several years now, Harry Styles has been cultivating an androgynous look, a style that he has fun with at red-carpet noutings, gala social events, and concerts. But it was just a year ago, at the end of 2020, that the global star definitively defied fashion conventions that emphasized the duality of men and women. However, on the cover of the fashion bible Vogue, the former member of boy band One Direction posed in a Gucci dress. It marked the first time that a man was featured on the cover of the American edition of the legendary magazine, and moreover in an outfit that had heretofore been associated with the female gender. It was a statement-making move that would shake up gender conventions. As with any (r)evolution, this cover met with a mixed reception from the public, generating some criticism and insults and, inevitably, sparking debate. But Harry Styles has received a significant boost from Gen Z, a generation not shy about exerting its powerful influence, and who are more supportive in this regard than previous generations. It's a generation that is also highly determined when it comes to shattering anything remotely resembling a stereotype. ""In terms of marketing targets, Generation Z doesn't fit neatly into the boxes, if only because it can't stand the stereotypes that are the legacy of older generations. For example, they are totally averse to the notion of gender,"" explained Éric Briones, editorial director of the Journal du Luxe, last March. There is no doubt that the British singer has not only understood the messages this generation wants to send — messages that brands are struggling to decipher — but that he has above all chosen to embrace it. A prominent muse for the house of Gucci, Harry Styles has not stopped working this gender fluid fashion style throughout the year, all done without intention of being shocking or provocative, rather just with the desire to express his unique vision and his personality, through those most visible vectors of fashion and beauty. And, as proof that the British star isn't mistaken in his stance, his desire to let his true fashion colours show, his fame has continued to grow over the last few months, making him one of the most influential celebrities in the fashion world. Last March, Harry Styles chose a boa to jazz up his on-stage outfit for the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, creating an unprecedented — or nearly unprecedented — buzz for an accessory previously considered primarily feminine. Global fashion search platform Lyst observed a 1,500% jump in searches for feather boas no less than two days after the British singer's appearance at the music event. His highly personal style, essentially based on a concept that has taken centre stage in 2021, that of self-expression, also earned him a place at the top of The Year in Fashion ranking, also put together by the Lyst platform, a few months earlier. The ranking gave him the title of best-dressed celebrity of the year, a reward for the numerous search spikes generated by the outfits worn in his videos, or during his public outings. And this week, the singer has once again caused a sensation, this time on the cover of DAZED, where he appears posing in lilac-coloured flared pants and a cut-out top, in an exaggerated way, on a motorcycle. Inside the magazine, in the feature article dedicated to him, he also appears in a green sweater dress and polka dot tights, a semi-transparent jumpsuit, and oversize quilted coat. A photo shoot that confirms the star's desire to push back against stereotypes and diktats that have been bending to the point of breaking for months under the weight of a generation that is freer than any one that came before. ""It's funny because I don't think of myself that way (as a style icon)... but bringing people together is the thing I'm most proud of,"" Harry Styles told the fashion magazine. Cheers to that! Harry Styles doesn't intend to slow down any time soon, on the contrary, as he moves seamlessly between the roles of influencer to musical artist and beauty line creator. The star this week presented Pleasing, his first line, which takes the form of a brand of clean, vegan cosmetics for everyone. From the colours chosen for the website to the campaign shots to the product themselves, everything has been thought out with inclusiveness top of mind. Nail polish, serum, eye gel and lip oil, the first cosmetics proposed by the brand, are aimed at consumers of all genders, the goal being for everyone to find... their pleasure. It marks one more step towards a desire to help make society more inclusive, one which brings people together more than it divides, and of which beauty and fashion are reflective symbols. Beyond the notion of gender, it's about putting an end to a single representation of femininity or masculinity and offering all individuals the space they deserve to express themselves."
"Alibaba, JD enjoy record Singles Day despite tech crackdown","The firm said 540.3 billion yuan (US$84.5 billion) was spent as China's army of consumers went on a splurge. Sales rose by 8.5%, compared to the previous year, despite a much lower-key sales campaign following pressure from the government to tone down the aggressive promotions and rampant consumerism. Combined sales with industry rival JD.com came in at 889 billion yuan (US$139.4 billion) — equivalent to the GDP of many countries — which was also a record and up about a fifth from last year. Both Alibaba and JD.com reported strong sales of items such as electric appliances, electronics, pet supplies, and cosmetics and other personal-care goods. ""Single's Day"" — so-called for the 11.11 date — began more than a decade ago and for years was a one-day, 24-hour event on November 11. But industry players expanded it recently into an extended promotion from November 1-11, with many retailers and platforms offering discounts and pre-sales even earlier. The shopping fest now dwarfs the US ""Black Friday"" spree and has become a barometer of consumer sentiment in the world's second-largest economy. However, concerned that Alibaba was becoming too powerful and abusing its market dominance, the government has this year dramatically tightened regulation. In e-commerce, the government has taken specific aim at alleged abuse of user data and monopolistic business practices by platforms, such as banning merchants from selling their products on rival sites. But the steadily rising consumer sales are also likely to be quietly welcomed by the government, which is moving to create a more modern consumer-driven economy, lessening the traditional reliance on manufacturing, exports and government investment."
"E-commerce is the second largest channel for beauty in the UK, says GlobalData","""The COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for the changes in the personal care retail landscape in the UK. New circumstances have forced hesitant consumers to start shopping online for products they would previously purchase in a brick-and-mortar store. Even with restrictions being lifted, many of those shoppers have been converted by the frictionless omnichannel shopping experience,"" explained Nina Nowak, Senior Researcher at GlobalData. According to GlobalData's 2021 Q1 consumer survey, 80% of UK consumers stated that how well the product or service aligns with their time and money constraints either always, often, or somewhat influences their product choice. ""The advanced digital tools and apps that allow personalized product choice based on a 'selfie' image provided by a consumer are efficiently replacing an in-store experience. The growing variety of delivery methods help accommodate busy consumers, saving them time and minimizing social contact,"" continued Nowak. Indeed, when asked about the main advantages of purchasing items online compared to visiting a store, UK consumers listed convenience (64%), timesaving (48%), minimal social contact (43%), variety and choice available (36%), and lower prices (32%) as the main benefits. Although the adoption of e-retailers for beauty and grooming is set to slow, the data and analytics company forecasts it will retain positive growth - posting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.1% over 2021-2025 to reach a forecast value of £2.1bn in 2025 - owing to these perceived benefits. ""E-commerce allows nearly unlimited personalization, which is an especially important element of effective personal care sales strategies. Modern e-commerce tools allow retailers to track the consumer journey from initial interactions on the website to the final purchase. This enables businesses to create customized ads, recommendations, and price promotions to further solidify the relationship with the consumer,"" added Nowak. ""Consumers' shopping habits may have changed for good with traditional ways of purchasing becoming a thing of the past. Extended lockdowns and social distancing restrictions have triggered a permanent shift towards e-commerce across various categories, including beauty and grooming. This change should be an impulse for personal care brands to focus their strategy toward enhancing their online presence, with brand and retailer deals at the centre, as well as providing a tailored shopping experience for consumers,"" she concluded."
The cult series of the '90s are making a comeback... in cosmetics,"Ah the power of nostalgia! Cosmetics brands are turning to TV series from the 1990s and 2000s to attract the attention of millennials. That's the finding of a new study from GlobalData, which is based on the recent launches of several industry players in the run-up to Halloween, a time of year when consumers often like to buy new makeup products. The data analytics platform tells us that younger consumers are the most likely to experiment with new skincare and makeup products, with millennials leading the way (76%) ahead of Zers and those in generation X. Millennials are likely the preferred target of cosmetic brands for these new fall launches. This is reinforced by the themes of the new collections, namely some of the most emblematic series of the 1990s and 2000s, thus accessing the nostalgia of an entire generation. Some examples include the ""Saved by the Bell"" collection from the brand Wet n Wild Beauty, ""Gilmore Girls"" makeup from Ulta Beauty, and a tribute to ""The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror,"" the chilling Halloween episodes of the animated series, by the brand Makeup Revolution. According to GlobalData, this marketing strategy is linked with ""retrophilia"", and it corresponds to the current expectations of consumers. It can also be seen in the fashion industry, the 1990s and 2000s have also made a remarkable comeback on the catwalks since the end of lockdowns, with bootcut jeans, visible underwear, platform shoes, and more testifying to the consumers' enthusiasm for these two decades. The return of the 1990s supermodels — in particular Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss — on the catwalks of the four fashion capitals during the latest ready-to-wear shows is also noteworthy. ""In a society that highly values individuality, film and TV-themed makeup taps into that deeply rooted emotion: nostalgia. We feel connected to characters - especially ones that we grew up watching - and having an opportunity to in some way be connected to those shows can be enjoyable. The makeup market is pretty oversaturated, so using such pop culture-inspired themes could help a brand deliver a unique edge and help reach consumers that would not otherwise purchase,"" explains Nina Nowak, Senior Consumer Researcher at GlobalData. If cosmetic brands are currently tapping into the nostalgia chord, it's probably because TV shows are more than ever considered powerful fashion and beauty influencers. This was already the case in the 2000s with series like ""Sex and the City"" and ""Gossip Girl,"" strongly inspired by the world of fashion, but the phenomenon has been growing in recent years. ""Emily in Paris,"" ""The Queen's Gambit,"" and ""Bridgerton"" are among the television series that have helped to bring certain pieces back to the forefront. Not to mention the success of ""Squid Game"" which has even managed to boost the search for vintage tracksuits. ""We are witnessing a grand return of the '90s and early 2000s styles in fashion. As fashion and beauty coexist, and influence each other, retrophilia in the makeup category is a natural consequence. The key resonating point of such themed lines is allowing consumers to project a certain image — which is in line with the self-branding trend,"" outlines Nina Nowak. It remains to be seen whether this trend will continue after Halloween, which is a good time to slip into the shoes of fictional characters who have left their mark not only in the form of a personal story but on a whole generation."
L'Oréal Paris is the world's most searched beauty brand online,"L'Oréal Paris is the most searched cosmetics brand in the world, according to a study conducted by cosmetic surgery education site Tajmeeli [1], which curated a list of popular beauty brands and used Google Trends to determine search interest in 108 countries. The French cosmetics giant's brand is preferred by people in nearly a quarter of the nations studied, showing clear interest in its products among beauty fans. The French brand is particularly popular in the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Ukraine, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, India, Thailand and Turkey. It's also the most popular brand on three continents: Asia, Europe and South America. But, against all odds, L'Oréal Paris is not the favourite brand of the French, who, it seems, prefer luxury beauty brand Guerlain. The ranking shows that, with a few exceptions, people around the world prefer accessible brands, such as L'Oréal Paris. The French brand is followed in second place by American brand CoverGirl, leading in 10 countries around the world and on two continents — North America and Australia & Oceania. Maybelline, NYX Professional Makeup, and Avon follow, with products that are also sold at affordable prices. Ultra-influential on social networks, celebrity-founded brands are also making waves. Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty is the ranking's number one brand in the US, while Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics is number nine worldwide — on par with Dior — featuring as the most popular brand in four countries worldwide. But it's Rihanna who dominates the world of celebrity beauty brands, with Fenty Beauty taking fifth place in the global ranking, notably thanks to popularity in certain African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria). According to the study, Hong Kong is the world capital of (prestige) beauty, with no less than six cosmetic brands all taking first place, including Chanel, Shiseido, Estée Lauder, Clarins and Bobbi Brown."
Spain: exports of cosmetics and fragrances return to pre-pandemic level,"The data collected by the Spanish Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (Stanpa), which gathers the main manufacturers and distributors of perfumes and cosmetics in the country, show a strong increase of the sector's exports in all categories during the first half of 2021, with categories such as colour cosmetics and perfumes, which had been the most impacted by the crisis, recording very high growth rates, +49% and +40% respectively. In total, the sector's exports passed the 2.25 billion euro threshold during the first six months of 2021, growing by 21% compared to 2020. From this basis, Stanpa projects Spain's exports to reach 4.5 billion euros at the end of the year, a level equivalent to that before the pandemic. The trend is positive for all geographic areas, with particularly strong increases in some countries outside the European Union, including South Korea (+80%), the United States (+60%), Mexico and Russia (+54%), Chile (+58%) and Morocco (+14%). As far as the European Union, the main destination for Spanish exports, is concerned, all markets are on the rise including major destinations such as France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Germany. In the Middle East, exports to the United Arab Emirates, which ranks among the top ten markets for Spanish exports of perfumes and cosmetics, rose by +39% during the first half of 2021, driven by the strong growth of the perfumes category. Regarding China, after a significant growth during the previous year (+41%), exports from Spain remained stable during the first half of 2021, at 170 million euros."
K-Beauty: How did Korea make its mark in the world of cosmetics?,"With a double-digit growth of its cosmetic exports in 2020 compared to the previous year (+15% according to data from the Korean Customs Service and the Korean Cosmetics Association [1]), South Korea is now one of the world's leading exporters of cosmetics. In absolute value, Korean exports amounted, according to the same sources, to US$6.12 billion in 2020, while imports dropped by 0.7% to US$1.07 billion. With a different basis of calculation, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety estimates the increase in exported beauty products at +16.1% in 2020 vs. 2019, or US$7.57 billion in value. These figures have enabled the Korean authorities to claim 3rd place among the world's cosmetics exporting countries in 2020, after France and the United States, two countries which over the same period have seen their exports impaired by the Covid-19 pandemic. If Korean exports were able to maintain their dynamics in 2020, it is because they are still mostly intended for the Chinese market (50.3% of total exports), despite the country's efforts to diversify its markets. However, the country has not been completely spared by the crisis, since according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the production of cosmetics decreased by 6.8% in 2020 to about US$13.4 billion. After China, the United States is the biggest importer of South Korean cosmetics. In Europe, ""France is the first importer of Korean cosmetics with 35%, followed by the UK (16%) and Germany (9%),"" explains Zoé Maillet, Marketing Specialist at KOTRA (Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency). The craze for K-Beauty actually took shape in the wake of what the Chinese media called, in the 1990s, the Hallyu, literally the ""Korean wave"": i.e., the growing popularity of the South Korean entertainment industry (mainly TV series and Korean Pop, but also movies and literature). Korean beauty first came to the fore through the worldwide success of some of its emblematic products, in particular, BB creams and cushion compacts, which were also adopted by European and US brands, eager to win over Asian consumers. At the same time, major Korean brands have capitalized on the success of these products to make a name for themselves, while skilfully relying on the development of travel retail to gain notoriety with the foreign public. But above all, Korean brands draw their strength from a particularly dynamic local market, where fierce competition calls for a capacity for innovation and a speed to market to which Western brands are not used. In this country, where skincare is a real concern for both women and men, large conglomerates such as AmorePacific or LG rub shoulders with ultra-dynamic indie brands such as Look at Me, When, Let Me Skin. Brands that have also built a reputation for naturalness, in line with consumer demand, particularly thanks to botanical ingredients such as green tea, ginseng or Centella Asiatica. On the industrial side, a rich network of suppliers and subcontractors first made its mark in serving Japanese brands, before becoming a world reference for its outstanding manufacturing methods and speed of production: significant assets in cosmetics where products and trends change rapidly. The Korean beauty routine is particularly attractive to Asian consumers because of its coherence. On the other hand, it is often considered too complicated in Europe and North America. ""It's all about the layering method, which starts with a double skin cleansing with oil, then foam, an exfoliant, an essence, a serum, a mask, an eye cream, a face cream and then a sun cream,"" details Zoé Maillet. Will this very extensive beauty routine suffer from the desire of consumers to reduce their consumption and streamline their routines? Nothing is less certain! In Asia, consumers are much less concerned by the search for a minimalist routine and by the naked beauty trend. Moreover, the search for more natural products and healthy skin should be favourable to face cleansers, a strong asset of Korean brands. According to Zoé Maillet, ""the demand for cleansing products, such as facial oils, cleansing balms or cleansing foam, will soar in the coming years."" The recent success of Cyca, a plant-based ingredient found in many Korean skincare products, including those of Dr Jart+, demonstrates the ability of brands from the land of the morning calm to constantly innovate and gain global recognition, probably for many years to come!"
France: Selective beauty up 6% between January and August 2021,"After more than a year of lockdowns, restrictions on social interaction and massive teleworking, French people seem to be gradually returning to their pre-health crisis consumption habits, particularly when it comes to premium beauty products, according to The NPD Group's latest report. Between January and the end of August 2021, the French high-end beauty market recorded a 6% increase, both in value and volume, compared to the same period in 2020. With total sales amounting to EUR 1.327 bn in value, this market is clearly showing positive signs of recovery. However, the market research institute points out that 2020 losses have not been compensated. Indeed, in the first eight months of 2021, sales of selective beauty products remain 20% below their 2019 level. In practice, sales of selective products are driven by perfumes with sales up 10% in value in the first eight months of the year. Compared to 2020, sales of gift sets, eaux de parfum, extracts and home fragrances achieved double-digit growth. To a lesser extent, sales of skincare products are also on the rise, with a 2% increase in value and 16% in unit sales in the first eight months of 2021. This is due in particular to a 5 euro drop in the average price of skincare products, with consumers preferring less expensive products. It is worth noting the good performance of body care in this category, which recorded double-digit growth between January and the end of August 2021, compared to 2020. It should also be noted that the recovery does not yet concern selective make-up, which remains on a downward trend (-2%) between January and the end of August 2021. Some segments are however emerging. This is the case for instance with eye make-up which, according to The NPD Group, recorded ""double-digit growth"" during the period. Tinted creams and concealers are also on the rise again, reflecting the renewed interest of French consumers. The return of people to the office was also accompanied by their return to bricks and mortar shops, with sales up 1% in value compared to the same time a year ago, despite a further period of confinement in the spring and the continuation of many restrictions. Nevertheless, consumer confidence has been restored since the reopening of shops last May. From 17 May to 29 August, sales increased by 13% in value compared to the same period in 2020, and by 2% compared to the same period in 2019. Yet, over the whole period, growth in value sales is mainly due to online sales, which grew by 34% in the first eight months of the year compared to 2020. Online sales now represent 19% of total sales of high-end beauty products in value, up from 8% in 2019, before the pandemic, and 15% in 2020. ""The year 2021 was marked by restrictions in shops and a third lockdown, which impacted the beauty market in perfumeries and department stores. Consumers demonstrated flexibility, especially when restrictions were lifted. While returning to the shops, they continued, however, to buy online,"" says Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group."
Sustainable cosmetic companies fly high as investors bet on sales growth,"Clean and natural beauty brands are attracting investors around the world as sales are forecast to register steady growth in the future. In North America, Jessica Alba's The Honest Company, which was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in May, raised USD 413 million and is now valued at USD 1.8 billion. In April, Beautycounter, another Californian company, received investment from The Carlyle Group. The investment firm has taken a majority stake in the natural personal care company, valuing it at US $1 billion. Beautycounter is using the capital to build omnichannel sales, strengthen brand awareness, and new product development. The private equity firm Berkshire Partners has invested in Mielle Organics. The natural hair company has received over US $100 million to help it expand internationally and reinforce its community development programme. Launched in 2014, the brand has been expanding in mass market retailers such as Target, Walmart and CVS. For its part, Bain Capital has taken a majority stake in Hand in Hand, a mission-driven organisation that produces sustainable soap products whilst having a positive social impact. Let's also note the acquisition of Costa Brazil and EcoFabulous Cosmetics by sustainable materials firm Amyris. Costa Brazil has a range of natural personal care products made using Brazilian ingredients, whilst EcoFabulous Cosmetics specialises in clean beauty products for Gen Z. In Europe, the largest investment went to Aroma-Zone. The French company sells natural essential oils, aromatherapy products, and DIY cosmetics via its online shopping platform and in its brick-and-mortar stores to over 2 million customers per year. Aroma-Zone has received EUR 410 million (USD 485 million) from the global investment firm Eurazeo to expand its retail footprint and boost international sales. The French natural refillable brand 900.care raised EUR 10 million (USD 12 million) in seed capital. Based on a subscription model, the company offers natural products in tablet or stick form. In the UK, Pai Skincare, a London-based organic skincare brand, obtained EUR 7.5 million (USD 8.9 million) from the private investment firm Famille C Venture. It plans to use the investment to expand R&D and manufacturing capabilities. The trend is the same in other regions. In India, the organic beauty brand Juicy Chemistry has got financing from Verlinvest. According to Ecovia Intelligence, large multinationals are expected to purchase more natural and clean beauty brands. In 2020, we saw the acquisition of Thayers Natural Remedies (L'Oréal), Drunk Elephant (Shiseido), Stop The Water While Using Me! (Beiersdorf), and Hello Products (Colgate-Palmolive). The consulting firm expects more mergers, acquisitions and investments in the coming months. ""Seeing high consumer demand for natural and organic and clean beauty products during the pandemic, the financial community is 'going clean' when looking at investments,"" said Ecovia Intelligence in a statement. This month, Ecovia Intelligence will discuss the evolution of sustainability issues in the cosmetics industry at the European edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, hosted online on 25-28th October. Michael Brenner, Executive Board Member of Weleda, will give the opening keynote. He will share the company's green journey and give his perspective on future developments. The role of green materials, the environmental impact of packaging, how technologies disrupt sustainable supply chains, as well as the marketing and customer issues raised by the move to sustainable cosmetics, will be debated during the event."
J-Beauty: a minimalist approach to beauty that is growing in popularity,"The covid-19 pandemic and the quest for more natural skins may have accelerated the end of K-Beauty (short for Korean Beauty), a vision of beauty straight from that country, which, until recently had appeared unstoppable in winning over followers — and, perhaps even more significantly, has had a wide-ranging influence on the international cosmetics industry. But now the K-Beauty approach, based on layering, and in particular on a ten-step beauty routine, seems to be losing ground to a more minimalist and natural routine, which has been growing in visibility and popularity during the health crisis. And even if K-Beauty later came up with the idea of ""skip-care"" which, tried to gain acolytes by reducing the full routine to just a few multifunctional products, it is, in fact, J-Beauty (Japanese Beauty) which could correspond best to top concerns of consumers at the moment. And since ""we're always our own best advocates,"" J-Beauty is first and foremost gaining in popularity in its homeland, the Land of the Rising Sun. The J-Beauty based cosmetics market is expected to grow from 521.9 billion yen in 2020 to 554.6 billion yen in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 1.2% over the period, GlobalData experts report. ""Japanese consumers are extremely health-conscious, which also reflects in their beauty purchases. Consumers are drawn towards products which have a positive impact on health and well-being,"" says Sukanyashri Kabali, consumer analyst at GlobalData. And it's a trend that is also gaining ground in the West, especially in Europe and the United States, with a clear revival of interest in natural ingredients, especially those from Japan such as rice or rice water, which is as popular in cosmetics as it is on social networks, shell ginger or getto, or ashitaba, among others, which are in line with this desire to combine nutrition, health, and the beauty of the skin. All alongside a key — if not the predominant — philosphy underpinning J-Beauty: the idea of prevention. And this is evident through trends that are cropping up all over the world, including the boom of prebiotics in cosmetics. Men and women are no longer looking to systematically repair the damage suffered by the skin, but to prevent it through various actions and a routine that will help it defend itself against potential aggressions. While J-Beauty relies greatly on science, and more particularly on a combination of science and nature, as well as on technological advances, it is also about ancientl traditions. In this respect, we are seeing the arrival of rituals straight from Japan that focus on prevention, particularly in the fight against the signs of aging. This is the case of Kobido, a ""natural face-lift"" technique that relies on a set of very precise movements, and that is now offered by many experts and facialists, but also many institutes and spas. In other words, J-Beauty still has many days ahead of it!"
Men in China go under the knife to boost life chances,"Beauty standards in China can be exacting, from pressure over skin tone, eye and nose shape to the controversial ""little fresh meat"" look — a buzzword used to describe handsome young men with delicate features."" The 27-year-old researcher wanted medical procedures to transform his look from ""engineering geek"" to something he thinks will boost his life chances. ""I feel I should be 'fresh meat' at my age, but I already look like a middle-aged uncle,"" explained Xia. AFP met Xia in Beijing as he was preparing for surgery to plump out his features. He had already spent 40,000 yuan ($6192) on a face-filler procedure earlier this year. ""I grew up in the countryside — my face was dark, my skin was bad, I thought my appearance was not good in general,"" he said, adding that he had long planned to rework his face. ""I always felt a sense of inferiority,"" he added. The intense popularity of Chinese social media — rife with trends in cosmetic procedures, beauty ""tutorials"" and advice on how to become ""beautiful"", has added to the pressure for many. Growing numbers of educated men in China are opting for aesthetic and surgical procedures to give them the edge. According to iResearch, around 17 percent of male white collar workers in China have had cosmetic treatments (compared to 30% of women) and the vast majority of men had their first procedure before the age of 30. Xia Zhengyi, the doctor carrying out Xia's procedure, says he has seen an increase in young men coming to him for procedures. ""Surgery can change the facial expression and give people a feeling of intimacy, which is good for your relationships with people,"" he said. Rose Han, from the BeauCare Clinics investment group, said male civil servants opt for procedures because they worry looking tired or old may mean missing out on promotions. Men in their twenties were most keen on eye and nose reconstruction surgery, according to surgery app So Young, which cited a survey of their 8.9 million active monthly users. ""It's not like buying a Gucci handbag — it is giving yourself an opportunity. Confidence will bring changes to my work and life,"" said Xia. China's average national disposable income has more than doubled since 2010 according to government data, and increased wealth among China's middle classes has also fuelled interest. Zhang Xiaoma left his job at an IT company to become a full-time social media influencer after sharing his own experience of cosmetic surgery. ""You can do more on-camera jobs if you become more attractive,"" Zhang said. His procedures include ""elf ears"" — a procedure that fills ears with hyaluronic acid to make them look more prominent while the face appears smaller. This became popular after a social media star documented the procedure and it went viral. Model Nai Wen has had more than 60 procedures on his face, including laser treatments, and believes cosmetic surgery changed his fate. ""It is as convenient as a face mask — it's really amazing that you can increase your age but not grow old,"" he told AFP during a shoot. China's cosmetic surgery industry is now worth 197 billion yuan (USD 30 billion or EUR 26 billion) — up from 64.8 billion yuan in 2015, according to iResearch. But the rapid growth in demand comes at a time when authorities are concerned the nation is facing ""masculinity crisis"". Beijing has criticised the ""little fresh meat"" look, and has proposed an increase in physical education classes for boys to encourage a more ""traditional"" form of masculinity in society. Earlier this month, the broadcast regular ordered TV channels to resist showing ""abnormal aesthetics"" such as ""sissy"" men on screen. There are also safety and quality concerns — the National Consumer Association logged more than 7,200 complaints relating to the cosmetic industry. Xiaoran, a 33-year-old online influencer, died of a serious infection after undergoing liposuction, state media reported in July. The clinic where she had her surgery has since been closed, reported the state-run Global Times. And pictures shared by actor Gao Liu this year went viral on Chinese media, showing dead, blackened flesh on her nose after surgery went wrong. Critics believe there needs to be better regulation. Model Nai admits there is a risk that cosmetic surgery becomes ""addictive."" ""You can't accept an ugly self,"" he added. After his hour-long surgery in Beijing, Xia examines his face in a hand-held mirror, turning from side to side. ""It feels a little bit different, but it isn't quite as I expected,"" he admitted. ""I think achieving the perfect look may take some time."""
Embracing the Afro in revolt against Venezuela's 'bad hair' stereotype,"After a near two-decade struggle with chemical straighteners, she embraced her naturally curly hair and a bold, shoulder-length Afro style and says she feels ""divine."" From the age of 12, when her mother started relaxing her hair, ""I felt obliged to present myself in a certain way, because straight hair gives you status,"" Mejias, now 28, explained at a salon in central Caracas where she was treating herself to a moisturizing treatment. Mejias said she long felt ashamed of her pelo malo (bad hair), as natural Black hair is called in Venezuela - a symptom, some say, of deep-seated racism. Then, she had a change of heart. ""I was tired of salons (for straightening treatments), of not having the freedom to let my hair get wet (as it would frizz). It felt like a form of slavery,"" she told AFP. Changing to an Afro style was ""like meeting me again. It was the best decision I could have made."" Venezuela has a racially diverse population as a result of mixing between indigenous peoples, Spanish conquistadores who arrived in the 15th century and the African slaves they brought from other colonies or directly from Africa. The country also received an influx of Europeans escaping the ravages of WWII and people from other Latin American countries fleeing dictatorships and armed conflict over the decades. Today, more than half the population identifies as mixed-race or mestizo. Yet, it is widely accepted that the darker your skin, the likelier you are to be poor in Venezuela, and to suffer from prejudice. Despite a 2011 law against racial discrimination, the country has a complicated relationship with its cultural identity. Racism is sometimes overt, often subliminal. In Venezuela, ""everything that comes from being Black we think of as bad or... as exotic, that is, not the norm,"" sociologist Zulima Paredes, who has written about the aesthetics of Afro hair, told AFP. The country that has enjoyed outsized success in the world of beauty pageants, has won the Miss Universe title seven times. All its winning contestants were fair-skinned and had straight or straightened hair, reflecting the nation's continued pursuit of a ""western European"" standard of beauty. In 2018, when dark-haired, olive-skinned model Isabella Rodriguez was crowned Miss Venezuela — her tresses also artificially straightened — she was ridiculed online for her modest background and her mixed-race roots. Hair discrimination also has more practical, day-to-day implications. Paredes, who is also of mixed race, said she suffered workplace discrimination over her hair. Once, applying for a job while sporting an afro, ""they told me: 'look, no, with this hair you will not get in here'."" And the victimization starts young. ""You cannot enter school with an Afro hairstyle, you have to tie it up... or straighten it,"" under many prevailing dress codes, said hairdresser Gabriela Delgado. Under such indoctrination, she herself used long, straight hair extensions until four years ago, when she decided to switch to dreadlocks. ""There are people who start relaxing their hair as young as six, five,"" said Delgado's colleague Ludizay Gardona, 35. The pair work at Afro Caracas, a salon specializing in black hair styles. ""People have not yet shaken off the stereotype that Black people were slaves and not much else. These prejudices are what we are trying to change... We have to become strong,"" said Delgado. ""This hair has not hurt anyone, it cannot be bad."" The issue was tackled in the 2013 Venezuelan film Pelo Malo about a young boy's obsession with straightening his hair, which won the best film award at the San Sebastian Film Festival. Venezuela is not the only country to have struggled with the issue. In 2019, South African Zozibini Tunzi, became the first Black woman with a short, natural haircut to be crowned Miss Universe. ""I want to re-assure people that this hair is as beautiful as any other hair,"" she said at the time. In July 2019, California became the first US state to ban discrimination based on a person's natural hair, in a law that stated that hair was a frequent reason for racial discrimination, particularly for Black people."
Online shopping to account for nearly 30% of global beauty sales by 2026,"Health and beauty ecommerce will grow more than three times faster than store-based retail over the next five years as the COVID-19 crisis, lengthy lockdowns and shuttered high street shops and shopping centres reset shopping habits, according to a new report from Edge by Ascential's research and data insight arm, Edge Retail Insight [1]. Altogether, the health, beauty and personal care retail category will add US $305 billion in global sales between 2021 and 2026 to US $1.34 trillion, the report's authors forecast. Reflecting a wider shift to online shopping - a trend accelerated by the pandemic - just over 50% of that growth will come from ecommerce. According to Edge Retail Insight online category sales will have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.1% between 2021 and 2026, far exceeding the growth rate of 3.3% CAGR for store-based sales. The shift to online in this category is embodied in the Edge Retail Insight figures showing Walmart's store network adding just 3% CAGR growth between 2021 and 2025, compared to 13.6% CAGR growth in Walmart's dot com sales over the same time period. As a consequence, online shopping will account for nearly 30% (26.8%) of the global category sales by 2026, up from a fifth in 2021. ""Items that were once bought in-store are not only becoming available online, but in an increasingly mobile-first age, brands have been rapidly experimenting with innovative digital technologies to engage customers remotely, such as using augmented reality to allow customers to try on lipstick virtually and getting involved with seasonal events and shoppable livestreaming opportunities increasingly offered by digital marketplace giants like Alibaba, Amazon, JD.com as well as China's fast-growing group-buying platform Pinduoduo (PDD), which - with an expected 17% CAGR between 2021 and 2026 - will lead growth in the category over the next five years,"" said Deren Baker, CEO at Edge by Ascential. The continued inexorable rise of marketplace ecosystems means brands operating in the health and beauty space must focus on understanding how to optimise their growth levers in this channel. ""To compete in a new world of retail, brands must leverage marketplace-specific shopper engagement strategies as well as make sure they have strong fulfilment and flexible supply chain strategies to cater for short lead times and meet unexpected surges in customer demand,"" added Baker. While Amazon and Alibaba are forecast to grow rapidly between 2021 and 2026, with 14.2% CAGR and 12.4% CAGR respectively, the highest growth rates are forecast in Asia. According to Edge by Ascential, China's six-year-old mobile app Pinduoduo, which reported at the end of last year that it had 788.4 million users in 2020, ahead of Alibaba's 779 million, will grow at a CAGR of 17.1% to 2026, while South East Asia's Shopee is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.8%. Both Pinduoduo and Shopee operate innovative models focused on social engagement and mobile experiences. Shopee is also expanding its cross-border operations in Latin America, while Pinduoduo continues to push its highly successful group purchasing approach to drive further engagement with its users. ""The lucrative opportunity of ecommerce in health and beauty has not been lost on some of the dominant forces in the category today. In July, the LVMH-owned French beauty chain Sephora, which has one of the largest beauty store networks in the world, entered the UK market with the purchase of ecommerce firm Feelunique, while in April, US investment firm Carlyle bought Beautycounter, a mostly digital 'clean' cosmetics and skincare brand, in a deal worth US $1 billion,"" said Florence Wright, Senior Analyst at Edge by Ascential and report author. To address the shifting shopping habits of consumers, brands within the health, beauty and personal care sector more than ever need to take an omnichannel approach and use all digital touchpoints to maximise engagement and increase sales."
How 'genuinfluencers' are taking authenticity to social networks?,"Too perfect, too smooth, too unreal: the influencers who embrace unrealistic aesthetics are no longer popular. Now in order to win over followers, it's all about being authentic, even if that means being imperfect and vulnerable. In short, you have to be a 'genuinfluencers.' This term was coined by trend forecasting company WGSN by mixing 'genuine' and 'influencer.' It refers to the social network stars who use their platforms to go beyond product placement. ""The genuinfluencer does not specialise in fashion, beauty or lifestyle content,"" WGSN's Cassandra Napoli explains to the Guardian. Instead, these content creators ""spread important information that can keep people informed."" This includes health recommendations, but also how to use the platform's latest features. According to Hilary Williams Dunlap, senior vice president of talent at Digital Brand Architects, a digital marketing agency, interviewed by Vogue, ""the landscape has completely changed in regard to who is considered a person of influence and how we define that term."" A new generation of influencers is gaining traction by being engaging rather than perfect. And today, being too 'aspirational' — meaning retouched — is flat out considered off-putting by many members of Generation Z. Transparency is also required. Influencers can easily find themselves under fire if they use the wrong term, or exhibit behavior that is at odds with the highly informed Generation Z. Essentially, an authenticity that reflects one's followers."
Trends: Are men really going to adopt make-up habits?,"Like fashion, beauty is gradually shaking off some of its most deep-rooted stereotypes to move towards less gender differentiation. Today, makeup would no longer (just) a matter of gender or sexuality, but a form of self-expression used by men and women. Just take a look at social networks — Instagram and TikTok, in particular — and you'll soon see a multitude of videos and pictures of men wearing makeup. It's a phenomenon being driven by several personalities and influencers, who are contributing to bringing male makeup into the mainstream. Of course, men haven't waited until 2021 to start wearing makeup. In fact, it's a practice that dates back to antiquity, and one which has endured over the centuries. From David Bowie to Johnny Depp to Prince, many celebrities have tried to pioneer the practice, paving the way for others to follow, but without ever succeeding in bringing what's considered an exclusively female domain into the male mainstream. So why now? Probably because the time is favourable to change, driven largely by the will of an entire generation — Generation Z — to shun labels, pigeonholes and to refuse to conform to stereotypes. The fashion industry has quickly caught on, sending out a slew of new gender-neutral collections. Now it's the cosmetics industry's turn to meet the demands of a generation with an increasing influence — and buying power. It's not surprising to learn that men's cosmetics are booming in Japan, among the younger generation. While the phenomenon may not be taking off at lightning speed, it is making steady progress all around the world. Harry Styles — who famously posed for Vogue magazine wearing a dress, and matched his suit with a boa at the Grammy Awards — has largely contributed to shaking up certain preconceptions in fashion and beauty. He is also one of several men who use eyeshadow and mascara as and when they want, like Jared Leto and many K-pop artists — who are ultra-influential globally. All such individuals are also contributing to challenging certain beauty standards. The result is visible on social media, with no less than 230 million views for the #boysinmakeup hashtag, and over 550 million views for #mensgrooming, on TikTok. Much more than a trend, male makeup is, in fact, a practice that is progressively entering the mainstream, buoyed by unexpected events such as... the pandemic. As more and more women ditched makeup during the pandemic, favouring a more natural and authentic routine, men, on the other hand, sometimes started to dabble with makeup as their days filled up with Zoom meetings. That's the reason why former baseball star Alex Rodriguez launched a makeup line for men, currently consisting of a concealer for dark circles and wrinkles. ""I realized as I was jumping from meeting to meeting, I needed something quick and easy in my routine to conceal blemishes or razor bumps,"" the sportsman said on Instagram at the time of the collection's release. So-called Zoom fatigue could well explain, in part, men's sudden infatuation with makeup. And the trend is confirmed in numbers. Last year, the web data analysis company Moz reported an almost 80% increase in internet searches for ""male makeup looks"" during the lockdown month of April, compared to the same period in 2019, as well as an increase in searches for tips on hiding dark circles or blemishes. For its part, The Guardian recently reported 300% growth in the men's skincare market in the last six months of 2020, relaying data from one UK retailer. However, these figures tend to show that men's cosmetics — and makeup — still have a long way to go. From the most upmarket to the most affordable, many beauty brands now offer makeup for men, like Gucci Beauty, MMUK, and, of course, Chanel, Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs — some of the pioneers in the field. And when products aren't specifically aimed at men, they are often aimed at all, like at Nars Cosmetics or M.A.C Cosmetics. This summer, in London, the War Paint For Men brand opened the world's very first store dedicated to selling makeup for men. With such initiatives growing at a rapid pace, it seems that male makeup is well on its way to becoming more mainstream."
Sales of global men's grooming products to double by 2031,"Thus, revenue from the sales of men's grooming products across the world will nearly double by 2031 from the current value of US$ 55.5 Bn. Geographically speaking, North America is expected to be the most lucrative market for men's grooming product companies, with an absolute dollar opportunity of around US$ 14.0 billion. In recent years, men's grooming in the region has shifted from a conventional focus on shaving to a broader perspective of personal care. For example, consumers are adopting varied shaving habits as a result of a growing desire for a trimmed beard over a completely shaved appearance, which is driving sales of beard wax/beard fixers and beard trimmers across the region. South Asia is also set to be an important market for manufacturers, rising at an impressive 12.6% CAGR and capturing 9.4% share of the global market. In 2020, India accounted for 32.1% share in the South Asian market for men's grooming products, and is expected to grow at a rapid rate. As far as East Asia is concerned, China will continue to be a key market. Sales of men's grooming products grew 9.2% from 2016 to 2031 in the country. According to the report, grooming is closely tied to remaining clean and looking their best in the natural state for the average Chinese male. This shows that there is opportunity to get better in the Chinese market through knowledge and product endorsement. In terms of products, shave care currently accounts for a significant market share of around 42.3%. According to the Persistence Market Research report, products in the mid-price range, which are affordable to male consumers, currently hold the biggest market share globally and are expected to hold around 53.3% market share in 2031. Eventually, online retailing is expected to be the fastest-growing distribution channel, at a high CAGR of 8.4% over the period 2021-2031. Consumer preferences have shifted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other key factors driving the growth of online sales are the availability of a wider range choice of products and the discounts. Other key trends include the increasing demand for natural and organic products along with alcohol-free fragrances."
China prestige beauty e-commerce sales increased 47% in the first half of 2021,"""One of the key takeaways from the prestige beauty industry's experience with COVID-19 lockdowns has been that manufacturers and retailers must have an up-to-date and actionable digital strategy,"" said Stanley Kee, managing director, APAC, The NPD Group. ""Not only are more people buying beauty products online, but new selling formats such as livestreaming or short-form videos are continuing to rise in popularity, providing endless marketing opportunities for beauty brands."" According to the market research firm, hair and skincare e-commerce sales saw the largest increases, at 84%, and 50%, respectively. Fragrances and makeup followed with respective increases of 48% and 34%. [1] Skincare sales continued to dominate China's prestige beauty e-commerce market in the first half of this year, but it did show a slight decline in terms of value share when compared to the second half of 2020, dropping to 68.5% from 70%. Apart from the sales increases seen in the two highest revenue-generating segments within the Skincare category, Sets & Kits, and Face (60% and 51%, respectively), there was a noteworthy increase of 107% in sales of sun care products. Demand for makeup increased as mask mandates were loosened throughout the country earlier this year. Generating over $528 million in e-commerce sales, Total Face Makeup was the segment that generated the most revenue in the makeup category. ""These strong sales signal that more consumers were prepared to spend time outside of the home, unlike last year when the pandemic had gripped the country,"" said Kee. ""Thanks to the easing of mask mandates in some offices and outdoor settings throughout China in the first half of the year, virtually all prestige beauty segments experienced strong growth."""
Men's cosmetics booming among Gen-Z Japanese,"Are the days when cosmetics were only for women coming to an end? Moisturizers, anti-wrinkle products, serums, even make-up: men nowadays have a wide range of choices to offer themselves moments of pampering. This can be observed in many countries around the world, especially in China and the United States, where the market for men's cosmetics has been growing steadily over the last few years, but also - and especially - in Japan, where the Gen Z male can't seem to do without cosmetics anymore. The craze is such that Gen Z men - born in the mid-1990s - spend almost 20% more per month on cosmetics than the whole Japanese population, Nikkei Asia reports. The economic daily even states that the best-selling products among this group are estimated to cost more than 2,000 yen (about 15 euros), an amount that is higher than that spent by women. More broadly, while the cosmetics market declined in Japan in 2020 due to the pandemic, the men's cosmetics segment has recorded a 4% increase, according to data presented by the firm Intage. The pandemic, and in particular the multiplication of videoconferences, could be at the origin of this craze for men's cosmetics. However, the phenomenon began long before the health crisis. In 2018, Chanel already launched ""Boy de Chanel,"" a line of makeup for men that now brings together a varnish, an eyebrow pen, a lip balm, a concealer, or even a tinted fluid makeup, all the make-up essentials that could be found in a woman's beauty kit. There are now many brands that offer cosmetics entirely targeted for men. One of the latest to have launched in the niche is none other than former baseball star Alex Rodriguez, who created his own line of makeup for men in collaboration with Hims & Hers. A key item? A stick intended to camouflage dark circles, wrinkles, and other imperfections. Nothing surprising in 2021, but the product would probably not have received the same welcome a few years ago. The boom in combination skincare also offers men the opportunity to discover a world they are not necessarily familiar with, and which they seem to be embracing with pleasure. The Ordinary, Absolution, Aesop, and Eyden all offer cosmetics that are suitable for both men and women. It's a trend that is unlikely about to fade away."
Self-esteem: Older women feel more confident about their bodies,"One might think that youth is synonymous with self-confidence, but that's not the case, as a new study conducted by Australian and New Zealand researchers* Body Image, Volume 39, December 2021, Pages 114-124] reveals. Scientists from the universities of Griffith, Auckland, and Queensland were interested in the level of satisfaction with body image among 15,264 participants aged 18 to 94 years, of which nearly 63% were women. To conduct their research, they looked at longitudinal data covering no less than six years, from 2010 to 2015. Published in the Body Image journal, the study revealed that participants became more satisfied with their bodies over the years, although this upward trajectory did not appear to be meteoric. Self-esteem was not very present in the youngest women, but it increased with age, particularly around the age of 60. The research stops short of fully explaining this phenomenon, although the researchers do offer a few suggestions as to why it might be the case. In their work, the researchers mention the fact that as adults age, they may give more importance to how the body functions than to how the body appears. In other words, health would then come before physical appearance, which could lead to lower expectations on the appearance side. But of course societal pressure may also play a role in these results, since they could have an influence on the perception that we have of our body. Trying to conform to such ideals of beauty at all costs — or more precisely, of not being able to reach them — could play a role in self-confidence. Such pressure may dissipate over time in women, according to the researchers. It should be noted that this improvement in body image satisfaction over time is only slight; women aged 60 remain concerned — although a little less than younger women — about their appearance. Finally, the researchers were also interested in men's self-perception; overall they showed higher levels of satisfaction with their body image than women, although these also get better throughout their lives."
"Eyeliner, fishnet and combat boots: Fall fashion gets a pop-punk attitude","When it comes to fashion trends, it's key to keep up as they can evolve at breakneck speed. We were expecting a classic back-to-school season, with a wardrobe full of timeless clothes — especially since sustainability is now a must when buying new items — and pieces that combine elegance and comfort, but we find ourselves with a punk trend in the pipeline. And it's a trend that offers possibilities for the entire wardrobe, from checks to boots through the fishnet, or just in a few touches of makeup. More precisely, it's the pop-punk aesthetic that is set to make a comeback this fall, according to the global search platform Stylight. [1] Many of the pieces and inspirations associated with this trend have been getting more and more attention from users in the last few weeks, starting with the fishnet tights (+48% of clicks in July compared to the same period a month earlier) that were left untouched at the back of our wardrobes last fall. But for the pop-punk aesthetic to be perfectly executed, combat boots cannot be forgotten! And this season, they are showing up in a taller version that partially hides the knee (+25% of clicks). And of course, the global search platform has also noticed the beginning of a craze for plaid clothing, from pants to skirt through to dresses (+17% of clicks), and for studded belts (+14%). A trend that's just simmer but which should increase as autumn approaches. It remains to be seen if pop-punk can also influence the world of beauty with a boom in related hairstyles and makeup looks. If so, we should see an autumn dominated by quiffs, shaved temples, even half-mohawks, studded accessories, and, perhaps the most essential, ultra pronounced, smudged eyeliner."
"Beauty has boosted the mood of Brazilian women during the pandemic, says Avon","An unprecedented survey carried out by Avon, in partnership with consulting firm Grimpa, has highlighted changes in the habits and self-esteem of Brazilian women since the start of the pandemic. Called #OlhadeNovo - named after the repositioning campaign the brand recently launched in Brazil - the study included 1,000 women aged 18 and more across Brazil. All of them were users of make-up products, perfumes and body and facial care products. Even though it was only applied once or twice a week on average, during the height of the pandemic, makeup had a transformative role for women. According to 80% of them, it improved their mood during this period. 78% of women surveyed said they used lipstick to feel good and not for attracting the attention of others, and 74% said makeup can also be used at home. In Brazil as everywhere, the use of facial masks to limit the spread of the Covid-19 disease has changed makeup routines: 33% of women surveyed gave more importance to their eyes and 21% switched from lipstick to balm lips. New habits linked to the pandemic have also boosted the use of face care products: 35% of women surveyed by Avon said they use them. Unlike other consumers around the world, Brazilian women have not given up on perfume during the pandemic; on the contrary if we are to believe the figures published by ABIHPEC! As far as the Avon study is concerned, 46% of surveyed women said that perfumes have the power to transport them to other places or remind them of the life's happy moments. In short, they also have the capacity to boost their mood! It's therefore no surprise that, when asked about the future and the beauty habits with which they will enjoy reconnecting when the pandemic is under control, Brazilians mention perfumes (65%), lipsticks (62%). and mascaras (58%)."

Global luxury market grows but gets more regional as Covid curtails travel,"Industry giants have reported results that show the world's well-heeled are splurging on luxury goods as sales surpass even pre-pandemic levels. LVMH — home to Louis Vuitton, Moët, Fendi, Dior, Guerlain and Kenzo brands among others — saw first-half sales climb by 11 percent above their pre-pandemic level to 28.7 billion euros (34.1 billion) as it reported a profit of 5.3 billion euros, a whopping 64 percent increase from 2019. Rival Kering — which owns the Gucci and Balenciaga brands — bested its pre-pandemic level by 8.4 percent with a record 8 billion euros in sales. Hermes reported a 29-percent jump to 4.0 billion in sales. Both recorded profits of more than a billion euros, beating expectations. The Swiss luxury group Richemont — Cartier, Piaget, and Montblanc — beat its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter by 18 percent, while Italy's Prada bested 2019 first-half sales by eight percent. It is the ""upper middle class, the rich and ultra-rich untouched by the crisis"" who could not travel or eat out and instead bought luxury goods, said Arnaud Cadart asset manager at Flornoy. The Chinese, ""who represent 35 to 40 percent"" of luxury customers, are still crucial, he added. But while Chinese buyers previously made a lot of their purchases while visiting Europe, they are now making them at home. In fact, ""what was surprising was not so much the recovery in China but the violent rebound in the United States,"" remarked Erwan Rambourg a sector analyst and author of Future Luxe: What's Ahead for the Business of Luxury. Compared with previous crisis recoveries, after the September 11 terror attacks or the 2008 economic crisis for example, ""the feeling of guilt, the idea that it is inappropriate to buy luxury goods, disappeared,"" Rambourg told AFP.""There is a young generation in the United States that feels comfortable with luxury purchases,"" in particular among the African-American, Hispanic and Asian populations, he explained. Hermes chief executive Axel Dumas told a telephone news briefing: ""We've seen a very strong rebound in activity in the United States from our loyal clients as well as a new clientele that came to us thanks to digital"" marketing by the company. Hermes's sales in the US jumped by a quarter from their pre-pandemic level. Citigroup analyst Thomas Chauvet noted the fact that a roaring US stock market had made many Americans more wealthy, on paper at least. The US government measures to support the economy, including financial aid, have also provided an important psychological boost to consumption. In Europe, the sector's performance was better than might be expected given the absence of tourists who normally generate half of sales, because local clients turned out. ""Europeans had to a considerable extent deserted this market"" but this year the trend was reversed, said Flornoy's Cadart. Rambourg added: ""To everyone's surprise, the brands discovered that by stimulating the local clientele"" via social networks ""the French, Italians, Spanish turned out more than hoped"". Chauvet cautioned that ""the rebound in local demand doesn't compensate for the loss of tourists."" ""The luxury market will nonetheless remain dominated by local buyers for at least another year,"" Rambourg concludes."

Eye area is number one beauty concern in the age of video calling,"With the pandemic spreading over the world, video calling has become the new normal since public health precautions necessitated time spent apart from family, friends and colleagues. Skincare brand StriVectin has commissioned new research to explore how beauty perceptions and habits have changed after a year of unprecedented disruption. The survey of 2,000 US adults [1] explored the impact living in a largely virtual world has had on how consumer perceive themselves. As experts say that our phone and computer video cameras can intensify shadows around the eyes and nose, highlight blemishes and wrinkles and even make the face look fuller, it is no surprise that 69% of the persons surveyed say the things that bother them on video calls are not the things that bother them when they look in the mirror. Eye concerns are one of the most common ""video face"" complaints, with 1 in 4 US consumers saying they notice under eye circles more on video calls. 30% say they have actually turned their camera off during a video call because their eyes looked tired on the screen, and 71% say they are making an effort to positively accentuate the eye area. All-in-all, 37% have stepped up their efforts with serums, eye creams and devices, while 34% have added products to conceal or diminish dark circles. 31% rely on added definition with color cosmetics and 44% have researched how to look better in video calls specifically, while 33% have even considered cosmetic procedures after constantly seeing themselves on video calls. 51% say their monthly skincare/ grooming/ self-care expenditure has increased since the start of the pandemic. And 52%, more than half, say the spending increase is a result of greater concern over their appearance due to frequent video calls. The revelation is not a total surprise to the R&D and marketing teams at StriVectin. The brand has seen a double-digit percent increase in sales of its eye care products over the last year. ""With eyes the main element of our appearance visible to the outside world this past year, it is natural that they have become our focal facial feature,"" said Alison Yeh, Chief Marketing Officer at StriVectin. Eventually, after a year of virtual meetings, 67% of the US consumers surveyed say they have finally figured out how to ensure they look best on video calls. Nearly half (46%) say their number one last-minute pre-Zoom beauty touch-up is... brushing their hair. And about a quarter (23%) say mascara is their pre-Zoom go-to beauty savior (the number two choice). When asked what they have added to their beauty routine, respondents' number one response was ramping up their skincare regimen with greater focus on worry areas. The good news is that 56% say that after a year of video conferencing, they are now more comfortable seeing themselves on camera. Perhaps this is why more people say that even post-pandemic, they would prefer a virtual call to an in-person meeting (47% to 44%)."
In-store shopping: Has the pandemic really changed consumer habits?,"While digital shopping had its heydays during lockdowns and is largely seen as the future of shopping, consumers nevertheless appear to be very happy to rediscover the experiences that are unique to brick-and-mortar retails: touching, trying on, social interactions. This doesn't mean that they're giving up shopping online, but that they now count on enjoying the best of both worlds. No less than 80% of consumers surveyed in the United States, France, the United Kingdom and China, say they ""feel comfortable"" visiting physical stores now, according to a report released by the Mood Media agency [1], a provider of multimedia solutions for improving the in-store experience. And while they're still worried about catching covid-19 from visiting stores (48%) — Chinese consumers being the most concerned (50%) — a majority of consumers say that shopping in physical stores feels good (54%). Consumers in the US are most at ease with the idea of returning to stores (86%). Shoppers in the UK are more confident than in 2020 (just 62%), but still remain the least confident (76%). For now, consumer shopping habits have not yet returned to how they were before the pandemic, but there's every indication things are changing, and in a positive sense. Nearly two-thirds of global shoppers say they still don't visit stores as often as they did before covid, but nearly three in 10 (29%) say that they spend more per visit. Note that almost half the consumers polled (46%) say they spend ""more or less the same"" as before. However, six out of ten consumers around the world already say that they expect their shopping habits to return to normal by the end of 2021, and one in five even consider that this is already the case. Still, some seem more optimistic than others. American men are the most optimistic, believing that their purchasing habits will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year (74%). This is not the case in the UK, however, where 14% believe that their habits will never return to how they were before the pandemic. The ability to touch, feel and try products is what consumers around the world found they couldn't replace and missed the most when stores were closed (45%). It's also the top factor driving shoppers to physical stores rather than online (59%). The report notes that the social aspect of shopping, which can be enjoyed with friends, is another of the irreplaceable aspects consumers missed (35%), as well as being able to take purchases home right away (35%). Globally, shoppers especially regretted not being able to visit malls (38%) and fashion stores (36%) during the pandemic. The French (46%) and the British (30%) particularly missed fashion stores, while American consumers above all missed not being able to go to shopping malls (40%) and grocery stores (30%). However, consumers do intend to take advantage of the services made available to them when stores closed, therefore enjoying the best of both physical and digital shopping. Click and Collect was particularly popular (33%), as was curbside pickup (19%), not to mention the QR codes placed on products seen in store and then purchased online (17%), although opinions differ from country to country."
Could chatbots be the key to creating customer loyalty in e-commerce?,"While physical stores have reopened across much of the world, consumers seem to be increasingly looking towards a phygital experience, which would combine in-person and online shopping. This requires optimized services that allow them to enjoy a virtual shopping experience that is similar to that found in physical stores. And it's not an easy thing to accomplish. Chatbots seem to be of particular importance to shoppers but they feel that their mere presence on an e-commerce site is not enough, they expect more extensive capabilities from these features. More than four out of ten (43%) UK shoppers say chatbots never — or rarely — understand them, and nearly three out of ten (28%) say they will leave a website and seek information elsewhere if the chatbot doesn't provide answers, according to a study by Lucidworks [1]. Shoppers would also like chatbots to be used for more than just customer service. More than half of the British buyers surveyed would like to also use them to get advice from a brand or store employee, and 45% would like to get help finding specific products. Upstream of a purchase, therefore. When it comes to e-commerce, recommendations seem to be an essential element for the buyer. This is something that brands must take into account, if only to compensate for the absence of being able to touch or try on products. Recommendations can also help increase the average value of orders. More than three quarters of shoppers in the UK and US say they ""interact"" with product recommendations all or most of the time, and more than half of Brits surveyed say they regularly, if not always, buy recommended items they hadn't planned to put in their cart. More generally, both British and American shoppers consider product quality, personalized recommendations and excellent customer service to be key to brand loyalty. According to this study, it's in the interest of brands to optimize the online shopping experience because many consumers are not yet totally ready to return to physical stores. More than half of the respondents in the UK and the US plan to avoid shopping in physical stores ""as much as possible,"" or at least to go to stores less often than before the pandemic. However intentions vary depending on the sector. Clothing stores could suffer much less from these changes, for example, with more than half of British shoppers (59%) waiting for the restrictions to be lifted before shopping in stores. In contrast, only 26% of Britons surveyed plan to buy electronics in stores when health measures are eased."

In addition, we are incredibly lucky to be part of the Infopro-Digital group which, thanks to the diversity of its portfolio, has been able to support us and keep our jobs for the benefit of an entire industry. I remain convinced that physical shows are the best business providers for beauty suppliers. What is the program for the coming months for the MakeUp in network? Sandra Maguarian - The second semester concentrates all of our exhibitions usually spread over a year. MakeUp in Shanghai will be held on July 7 and 8, MakeUp in New York on September 22 and 23, Clean Beauty in London on October 12 and 13 and MakeUp in Paris on October 20 and 21. We'll end the year with the amazing MakeUp in Los Angeles on December 9 and 10. It's a lot of preparatory work but there will be new things in terms of animation with new business and conviviality areas, digital communication, etc. We never lose sight of the fact that our exhibitors are there to showcase their know-how and all our energy is focused on this. What do your shows mean to exhibitors and professional visitors? Sandra Maguarian - I have the feeling that in many ways the MakeUp in - and soon to be Clean Beauty - tradeshows are a creative refuge and an expert response in an exclusive area of makeup / care. We can find the same spirit as the 17th century salons where we met each other linked by the same centre of interest. At Makeup in, it is all the same. Exhibitors know that only brands from the beauty sector will visit them. It is a mutual benefit of commercial, sociological, cultural exchanges with museum exhibitions, conferences on colors, on consumer behavior or, creative workshops. Above all, this is the huge opportunity to do business. MakeUp in shows are an experience for the whole industry chain, with interactions between exhibitors as well. It is where brands discover beauty innovations. How did you manage to stay in touch with your visitors and exhibitors during the COVID crisis? Sandra Maguarian - By being worldwide with our local exhibitions, we have always had very privileged contacts with our exhibitors. Yet they come from a variety of industries ranging from ingredients to packaging and formulation, but they all form a family - the MakeUp in family - that we take great care of. The Covid crisis has hardly changed the frequency of our communications. We created the BeauteaMatch.com platform which offers suppliers and cosmetic brands to keep in touch, to continue to present new products, and focuses on innovation and information in the sector. Your ranks have grown to welcome new ""skincare"" exhibitors. What is it and what is the link with makeup? Sandra Maguarian - MakeUp in is a living brand that adapts to markets and needs. When it came to support the Brazilian market, we went to Brazil. For K-Beauty we went to Seoul. We support the emergence of indie brands in Los Angeles and so on. When again brand marketing managers asked us to expand our offering to ingredients, we did. Today we are witnessing a takeover of the hybridization of makeup and skincare. With ever more sophisticated claims such as a mascara that promotes eyelash regrowth, a moisturizing lipstick ... Hybridization is born from the BB cream. So yes, Makeup in salons are - and have been for several years now - targeting both skincare and makeup brands. You are soon launching a new show in London, ""Clean beauty"". What is this show for? Sandra Maguarian - Here again, our listening to the market shows all its power since for two years the ""clean beauty"" movement - responsible cosmetics, non-toxic for humans and nature - is booming. It was at this point that the need for an event was felt. The launch delay, due to the pandemic, allowed us to refine the concept and focus on the innovation in this area. Our exhibitors will be the suppliers of beauty brands in skincare, haircare, makeup, hygiene etc. who will meet the clean beauty brands of today and tomorrow. How do you see 2022? Sandra Maguarian - I am extremely positive for 2022. The need to free ourselves from our chains will be such that there will be a boom in cosmetic purchases. We will finally be able to meet and erase the traces of the distorting images of video conversations! Thanks to research and innovation, the cosmetics industry never gives up and anticipates consumer trends, needs and expectations in terms of diversity or performance. Therefore, I predict happy days for the cosmetics industry and its players while caring for everyone's health, especially at our shows."
"Sales of perfumes continue to rise in Brazil, despite the pandemic","In a year when a large part of the Brazilian population has reduced their outdoor activities to carrying out their daily activities (working, studying and chatting with friends) from home, the perfume market could have - as elsewhere in the world - register a significant decline. But that's not what happened! According to the Brazilian Association of Personal Hygiene, Perfume and Cosmetics Industry (ABIHPEC), the perfume market in Brazil grew 8.4% from January to December 2020, compared to the same period of the previous year. The devaluation of the Brazilian currency against the dollar and the euro, restrictions on travel and the increasing quality of perfumes offered by national brands help to explain this growth since opportunities for purchasing abroad have been reduced. ""Brazilians are increasingly surprised by the offer of domestic perfume brands which, in addition to offering very high quality, have made constant investments in innovation in recent years,"" said João Carlos Basilio, president of the ABIHPEC. ""The year 2020 has been a challenge for everyone,"" said Olindo Caverzan Júnior, Managing Director of Água de Cheiro. ""We have realigned some forecasts, adjusted our schedule but, despite the chaotic situation, we have been successful in maintaining our franchise network and opening new points of sale."" The company which, before the pandemic, had planned to open 80 units in 2020, finally opened about thirty new points of sale over the year. The company's sales rose by 23% in 2020 compared to 2019. According to Olindo Caverzan Júnior, the search for well-being linked to the pandemic combined with the ""deserve it"" effect have driven sales in the category. ""In addition, we have invested more in the advertising, especially in television, we have launched new products and special actions with major brands,"" he emphasized. The year 2020 also allowed the emergence of new players in the Brazilian market. CR Beauty, for instance, launched in December 2020. ""I very much agree with the proverb that says 'Smooth seas do not make skilful sailors',"" explained Cecilia Rascovschi, Creative Director of the brand. In the midst of the second wave of Covid-19, the young perfume brand invested in a digital strategy alongside a team of influencers. ""We understood that we had to take advantage of this moment, when consuming was not a priority for people, to provide information on CR and its products, without trying to force sales,"" she explained. CR Beauty offers genderless fragrances, that are classified according to their olfactory families. A fairly new approach in Brazil. Another novelty comes from the Boticário group. In addition to the launch of its luxury perfume brand O.U.i, the Brazilian giant has also made a new foray into this category with Vult. Initially specializing in make-up, the brand launched its first line of perfumes, created in collaboration with Brazilian influencer Gabriela Sales (aka Rica de Marré). ""We are betting on the strength of the co-creation movement and on a partnership with one of the main beauty influencers in Brazil to consolidate the brand's entry into this category"", explains Diego Costa, perfume marketing director of Grupo Boticário. According to the marketing director, the three new fragrances are already showing very promising results. ""We carefully monitor the behaviour of consumers and we know that their relationship with perfumery has changed during the pandemic. But, it is a category which generates high emotional bonds and whose consumption has not stopped, even at home."""
"56% of Americans rarely or never use sunscreen, finds recent survey","Despite efforts to inform people about health risks linked to overexposure to the sun and the proven effectiveness of sunscreens to prevent skin damages, skin cancer is on the rise in the US. Over the past decade (2011 - 2021), the annual rate of newly-diagnosed melanoma cases increased by 44% and it is expected that 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70, said The Derm Review, a comprehensive online resource on skin care products and cosmetic ingredients. To get a better idea of why this might be, The Derm Review surveyed 1000 Americans to see how many people follow the doctors' orders and wear sunscreen on a regular basis. Actually, the survey found that a whopping 56% of participants rarely or never use sunscreen. Indeed, 35% of respondents said they never use sunscreen, while 21% say they wear it once or twice a year or less. Only 19% wear it on a daily basis. According to The Derm Review, this low use might partly explain why skin cancer has increased 300% over the past two decades. ""Skin cancer in Americans is five times higher than breast and prostate cancer, and ultraviolet radiation is responsible for 86% of melanoma cases,"" explains the publication. Indeed, the link between UV exposure and skin cancer is well-documented; unprotected sun exposure is associated with 90% of non-melanoma skin cancers and 65% of melanoma skin cancers (one of the deadliest types of skin cancer). In addition, the survey revealed that women tend to wear sunscreen more regularly than men with 26% of women saying they wear it on a daily basis, compared to just 11% of men. Out of the respondents who say they never or rarely wear sunscreen, 62% were men and 50% were women. The same gap between men's and women's behaviour was recently found in France. Interestingly, these stats mirror the results for new-diagnosed skin cancer cases, which are higher for men than women. Men account for 6% of new melanoma cases compared to 5% for women. Geographically, people from the West wear sunscreen the least with 47% reporting they never use it. The South came in second place at 41% reporting they never use sunscreen. Ironically, these are typically the states who would spend the most time in the sun. About 38% of Northeasterners and 39% of Midwesterners report never using sunscreen. Of those surveyed, Alaska and Hawaii saw the largest number of sunscreen users. Considering people who reported never wearing sunscreen, wearing it less than once a year, or less than twice a year, States where sunscreen use is at the lowest are Rhode Island and Kansas, while Alaska and Hawaii are those with the highest rate of sunscreen users."
Trends: Natural is the new normal for younger US beauty shoppers,"Forget masking imperfections under layers of foundation, concealer, highlighter and the likes; these days it's all about looking for ways to keep skin in radiant health long term. While contouring techniques counted millions of followers not so long ago — especially among the young — new desires have emerged and the pandemic seems to have accelerated the trend. These days, the watchwords of cosmetics are authentic, natural, essential, reflecting a wider desire to embrace minimalist routines. As a result, Gen Z, has got more in mind than (just) makeup. In fact, young people of approximately 13 to 26 years old see skincare as the Holy Grail of beauty routines. It's now about nurturing and caring for skin, as the notion of health takes a growing place in the world of cosmetics. In fact, more than four in 10 Gen Zers (41%) polled put skincare as their top beauty category, according to [a study carried out by Klarna, the Sweden-based provider of online payment solutions->https://www.klarna.com/us/business/fresh-faces-full-carts-report/] [1]. After surveying 15,000 shoppers in February 2021, the poll also revealed that Gen Z spends more on skincare than the previous generation, Millennials, as well as Gen X and Baby Boomers. That should give brands some serious food for thought, given how much the phenomenon has been growing in recent months, forming part of wider clean beauty and skip-care trends, shifting the focus to minimalism and the overall health of skin. For younger generations, the biggest consideration when shopping for beauty products was ""natural, non-toxic ingredients"". Gen Z and Millennials were also more inclined to buy cruelty-free and vegan products than their older counterparts. While shoppers across all generations agree that brand values factor into their purchasing decision, they have different appreciations of what matters most. The key brand value for younger shoppers is diversity and inclusion, while older generations are more concerned with sustainability and innovation. As a result, according to Klarna, Boomers value sustainability more than the Gen Z when shopping beauty brands. Still, according to the poll, Gen Z hasn't totally turned its back on makeup. Products of particular interest to younger shoppers include bright makeup palettes, especially for eyes. And this may seem understandable, given that eyes are often the only visible part of the face when face masks are mandatory. But as the weather improves and the summer vacation season approaches, and with sanitary rules hopefully becoming less stringent, beauty looks could be set to take a bolder turn, ushering in bright colours and motifs of all kinds in a bid to shake off a long period of doom and gloom."
The Ordinary is the world's most sought-after skincare brand,"In just a few years, The Ordinary — a brand that's yet to celebrate its 10th anniversary — has managed to join ranks with the most popular skincare brands. Analysing search data for more than 70 major skincare brands worldwide, expert advice website Skincare Hero [1] reveals that The Ordinary tops the search list in 41 countries around the world, far ahead of major international brands like Dove (ranking first in 9 countries), Bioderma (ranking first in 6 countries), and CeraVe ranking first (in 5 countries). There's no denying that The Ordinary, now part of The Estée Lauder Companies, is a hit on social media, particularly on TikTok — a favorite among Generation Z users — and that the brand is backed by a crowd of influencers including Kim Kardashian, who alone has some 220 million Instagram followers. The brand also fits with several major trends of the moment, meeting new consumer expectations with simpler formulations, no controversial ingredients, minimalist packaging echoing pharmacy brands, and accessible prices. In fact, the brand's products retail at US$3.50 to US$28.90, with a majority of products priced at under US$10. And price is a major factor for consumers who, from the look of their many TikTok comments, also appear to be satisfied with the effectiveness of these beauty essentials. The Skincare Hero study reveals that The Ordinary tops the skincare brand search list in the USA, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain and Australia. From the look of the ranking of most-searched brands, it seems that accessible skincare is especially popular with consumers. Dove comes in second place, topping the search lists in nine countries — including Bosnia, the Bahamas and Jamaica — while Bioderma comes third, topping the search list in six countries, including Hungary. Next come CeraVe, Estée Lauder, L'Oréal Paris, Vichy, Clinique and Neutrogena."
"""China will soon be the 2nd global perfume market,"" Sylvain Eyraud, Takasago","Although it took the Chinese market quite long to embrace the perfume culture, today's young generation keeps showing a partiality for this luxury product by imposing new expectations. The most legitimate L'Atelier Chine offered by Maison Takasago is aimed to share the knowledge needed about this market recognized as having a very strong potential for the future of perfumery. ""As a hundred-year-old Japanese company and market leader in Asia, we endeavour to develop our expertise in all Asian markets, in particular the Chinese. What is the Chinese consumer like today? What are beauty drivers there? What are the olfactory preferences? What are the ingredients with the strongest potential? How can brands go beyond the olfactory clichés according to which China is fond of easy, little sophisticated floral fragrances in order to invent tomorrow's signatures? It is the first time we have also shared our palette of local, 'made in China' ingredients, from the most beautiful natural scents to outstanding collections for a real olfactory journey. All this is essential to invent tomorrow's greatest signatures and gain ground on the Chinese market,"" explains Sylvain Eyraud. ""By 2030, China will most probably have become the second global perfume market,"" adds Sylvain Eyraud. This statement is based on an in-house study results that predict beautiful days for perfumes in this country. Asia – mainly Japan, Korea, and China – represented 13% of the global premium perfume market in 2020. In this region, China is the most promising country in this critical year, with a 15% growth. Furthermore, Takasago's study also unveils prospective hypotheses about the evolution of this market from 2020 to 2024, and from 2024 to 2030: it reveals how China should get from the 6th to the 2nd rank on the global market. ""On the one hand, there are quite stable mature markets, and on the other, a Chinese market with a remarkable growth potential due to the young generation being open to perfumes. The next five years will set the tone, but what we build today will serve as a basis for tomorrow's successes,"" explains Mathilde Girardon. In a country whose economy is one of the few that ended the year 2020 with a positive growth rate, and where the gross disposable income has doubled since 2010, the situation is highly favourable to the consumption of luxury products, in particular perfumes. Driven by the Millennials generation, this economy is opening to new national specificities brands need to adapt to: a huge craze for digital technologies with a very strong influence of KOLs, the search for new experiences, a will to reconcile men and their environment based on a relationship with ancestral Nature, but above all, the search for a new form of patriotism. ""Everything you see in the Western world about the return to local consumption is also true in China. People have this sense of belonging (Chinese Pride) which can be observed in the way they consume, but also in their emotional or cultural references. Their relationship with nature is crucial, although there is still a difference in terms of sustainable maturity between this market and more mature markets, like the US and France,"" says Sylvain Eyraud. This patriotic consumption is conveyed by a marked attraction to products Crafted in China, rather than Made in China, which are already present in the perfume segment with well-established brands, like Scent Library, Boitown, ReClassified, Herborist, and O D'Hora, but also by a recognition of olfactory ingredients derived from the country's herbalist culture. Some ingredients have a particular echo in China, like green and black tea, Ganoderma, jasmine, gingko, ginger, ginseng, bamboo, arnica, and carnation. ""China boasts countless treasures: flowers, spices, tea, fruit…,"" promises the Takasago team. The group wanted to share 25 unique olfactory treasures with a strong emotional power. The Chrysanthemum Flower, the imperial symbol of longevity in China, Da Hong Pao, a real national treasure, Iris, Magnolia, the plum tree flower, which embodies inner beauty, the jackfruit fruit, Buddha's hand, Sichuan pepper, star anise, Ganoderma and ginseng, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine, and lastly, the smell of black ink inspired from calligraphy. Each of these smells is associated with its local symbols. If fresh and fruity scents still account for the majority of sales, bolder fragrances, in particular niche perfumes, already follow this trend. ""These consumers are ready to be taken by surprise. But to actually surprise them, brands need to understand them, and not just copy what is done in the Western world, so they can better invent the great signatures of tomorrow,"" concludes Sylvain Eyraud."
Beauty brands that show diversity in advertising inspire American consumers,"New research from Mintel reveals that more than three-fifths (63%) of Americans say they are inspired by beauty brands that show diversity in advertising. The majority of people who would like to see diversity in beauty/grooming advertising say they feel this way because it ""reflects real life"" (68%) and ""shows that there are different ways to be beautiful"" (56%). What's more, almost half (47%) of beauty consumers say they have looked for/bought from brands with diversity or inclusivity in the last year and a quarter (24%) have shopped with beauty brands that are minority owned. Indicating further desire for change among beauty brands, almost three-quarters of adults agree the beauty industry plays on women's insecurities (73%) and society's idea of beauty is too rigidly defined (72%). This points to opportunities for beauty brands to evolve away from these negative perceptions by inspiring and empowering consumers. ""Beauty marketing is increasingly shifting from 'aspirational' to 'inspirational.' Successful brands recognize that demonstrating a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion - whether through employment, advertising and/or product development - helps drive inspiration and empowerment,"" said Clare Hennigan, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Analyst, at Mintel. ""Brands have the opportunity to make a real impact by integrating different types of beauty diversity in a way, and at a place and time, that is truly authentic to them. For example, waiting until Pride Month in June to promote gender-neutral products could be perceived as a marketing stunt instead of a brand value. Brands that stand to win are the ones who have committed to diversity as an ongoing practice and genuinely listen to their audience to determine how those efforts are perceived."" However, understanding consumer perception of beauty inclusivity is complicated and nuanced, notes Mintel. Indeed, half (52%) of consumers who use beauty products say affordable products indicate that a brand is inclusive, while 48% say a wide range of shades makes a brand inclusive. Two-fifths (39%) feel that when brands represent diverse groups in advertising that makes them inclusive. But inclusivity indicators also vary by life stage. For example, 55% of Baby Boomers [1] say brands with products that meet a variety of age-related needs are inclusive, while only 32% of Gen Z [2] agree. And 40% of Gen Z think brands that offer gender neutral products are inclusive compared to only 25% of Baby Boomers. When consumers consider whether or not a beauty brand is inclusive, it is heavily dictated by whether the brand satisfies the consumer's own needs - how accessible the brand is to them personally - underlining the importance of understanding core audience values and needs. ""This approach has led to some brands developing hyper-personalized, inclusive products like the L'Oréal Perso, which is said to launch in 2021 and uses AI to create personalized skincare formulas. At the same time, other brands are exploring inclusivity through a minimalist or universal approach. Skincare brand Humanrace markets itself as 'suitable for all humans.' Whatever the approach, brands that are able to align their inclusivity efforts with the needs and expectations of their target audience will have greater commercial success,"" concluded Hennigan."
Online shopping and homemade beauty come out winners of the pandemic in France,"While beauty stores reopened their doors on Wednesday, May 19 in France, it is clear that the pandemic has forced consumers - and therefore brands - to transform their habits. Beauty's digital pure plays are undoubtedly the big winners of this particular period. Their sales jumped 43% between February 2020 and February 2021 in France, in the midst of a pandemic, according to the latest report from The NPD Group [1]. A year earlier, during the 12-month period leading up to February 2020, their sales had increased by 10% ""only"". These e-retailers have taken full advantage of the prolonged closure of brick-and-mortar stores and of the shift in shopping habits of consumers forced to go online to find some of their beauty routine essentials. This is reinforced by the fact that brands and retailers have invested heavily in new virtual reality and artificial intelligence technologies now allowing products to be tested at home. Beauty subscription services and beauty boxes were also quite successful during the period. Their sales increased 10% in the 12-month period leading up to the end of February 2021, compared to the same period the previous year, according to The NPD Group. The average individual basket amounted to 22.11 euros. Blissim has maintained its leadership position in France, while players like Nuoo and Big Moustache have grown rapidly. In addition, many emerging trends have experienced a strong expansion during the pandemic. Consumers have turned increasingly to natural, organic and more responsible products. The phenomenon was accentuated by the adoption of ""self-care"" and at home spa routines and by the desire to buy more healthy products. As a result, home-made cosmetics have had a huge following throughout this particular year. The NPD Group reports a 29% increase in sales of Aroma Zone, the French specialist in homemade cosmetics, during the 12-month period ended at the end of February 2021, with an average basket set at more than 35 euros. This is the second consecutive year of double-digit growth for Aroma Zone, which recorded a 28% increase in sales between February 2019 and February 2020, compared to the same period the previous year. Long periods of store closures have negatively impacted the beauty sector in France during the twelve months between February 2020 and February 2021. However, the success of digital players is an excellent signal, according to Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. ""These digital companies are breathing new life into the industry and becoming prescribers across the entire sector,"" she explained."
USA: What will post-pandemic beauty consumers look like?,"More screen time, fewer occasions to shop out of home, and a social life on hold for several months: the global pandemic has undoubtedly completely changed consumption habits, forcing brands to reinvent themselves in order to adapt to these new ways of life. For its part, the beauty industry must address not only a new beauty routine, but also new purchasing habits induced by the successive lockdowns. PowerReviews has surveyed 10,646 active beauty consumers across the United States. The study found that a majority of Americans (56%) are more focused on skincare now than they were before the pandemic. A situation that may be linked to the fact that people are spending more time at home and may have more time to devote to more thoroughly caring for their skin. Simultaneously, many consumers are cutting back on makeup use. In fact, the survey found that more than half (54%) of consumers indicate they wear less makeup now than pre-COVID, likely because they're not leaving the house as much, but also because wearing a mask is compulsory in public places. As a result, natural beauty has emerged as a key trend, with people getting back to basics. A trend that should continue in the months to come, even if the pandemic ends. There's been a well-reported uptick in e-commerce shopping since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a situation that is reshuffling the cards in a sector where, until then, most consumers had a preference for brick-and-mortar stores. The study confirmed things are changing as more than half of shoppers (53%) buy more beauty products online now, compared to pre-COVID. This number is even higher among younger consumers with 66% of Gen Z shoppers and 58% of Millennials (Gen Y) saying they're spending more online on beauty products now than they did before the pandemic. In addition, Americans are also spending a lot more on the internet. Almost half of them (49%) said they spend more than US$ 50 per month, compared to just 16% in the previous study in 2019. Furthermore, while two years ago, 47% of online beauty buyers said they were typically starting their beauty shopping journey on Amazon, in the last survey they were nearly a half (44%) to say their starting point was a beauty retailer's website (Ulta.com or Sephora.com). The PowerReviews study also confirmed that, while price, brand and quality still matter when choosing beauty products, beauty shoppers increasingly seek out products and brands that align with their values. More than three-quarters (76%) of shoppers said they plan to buy beauty products that are made sustainably. Gen Z shoppers (86%) and Millennials (80%) are even more likely to purchase sustainable beauty products. However, inclusiveness and racial justice are also emerging as priorities for American consumers. The study tells us that half (50%) of consumers plan to actively seek out beauty products made by Black-owned beauty brands. This number is even higher among Gen Z (75%) and Millennials (58%)."
Social media: new beauty influence trends for 2021,"Brands can no longer afford to map out their strategies without a key element: influence marketing, an essential in the beauty world. Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) have become creators of inspiring content and both free-spirited intermediates and brand ambassadors. More professional, they break the mould and provide innovation and freshness thanks to an expert, impacting profile. And as the share of online sales and the time spent on social media keep soaring, no doubt this trend will keep growing. Meanwhile, social media increasingly develop technological tools and systems for brands: augmented reality, buy buttons, live shopping… According to Kolsquare, if beauty has gained such importance on social media lately, it is because this industry banks a lot on visuals and experience. ""Beauty digitalization paves the way for technological innovation: today, you can follow a tutorial or test a lipstick on your smartphone. Influence marketing completes these new technologies with a genuine authenticity made possible thanks to the trust relationship between KOLs, subscribers, and brands,"" say the platform representatives. In practice, the format the most widely used by cosmetics brands is image, and by far: 85.9%. Then come videos (10.3%), Instagram stories (2%), and Instagram videos (IGVT), which represent 1%. A visual network par excellence, Instagram is by (very) far the number one medium for beauty and lifestyle. Statistics are quite clear: 90.4% of the 1,210,622 publications related to beauty analyzed in 2020 are on Instagram. With over one million beauty contents counted in 2020, Instagram offers a great variety of formats (feed, stories, lives, reels, IGTV). Lives actually boomed during the first lockdown with 800 million active users every day in April 2020. According to Kolsquare, this format helps brands and influencers increase their communities' commitment with a place where they can interact live. The use of Reels has also made steady progress since summer 2020. These 15-second videos are much popular among brands, in particular when it comes to explaining how to use a product or launching a challenge. It should be said that 90% of Instagram users follow at least one brand, and 130 million click on a shopping post every month to learn more about a product. As regards the commitment rate, TikTok is actually the most efficient, with 4.9%, followed by Instagram (1.07%), YouTube (0.5%), Facebook (0.15%), and Twitter (0.03%). If it is still far from Instagram, audience-wise, TikTok is gaining ground, especially among the young generation. On TikTok, beauty is at the core of trends, along with other themes like video games, sports, fashion, family and education. According to the latest TikTok for Business report, in 2020, beauty videos grew by 90% in France, 41% in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, and up to 238% in Spain. ""On TikTok, people talk about both beauty and blemishes. They celebrate inclusiveness, difference, and mutual help. This creative community is redefining beauty: they want it to be greener, more transparent, and representative of diversity. The most viewed videos are tutorials, tips and tricks, and product tests,"" emphasize Kolsquare experts. As for YouTube, it is undeniably the network for beauty tutorials: it is more adapted to longer, detailed videos. According to Kolsquare, beauty will be green, inclusive, and committed in 2021 on social media. The influence marketing platform mentions several typical hashtags and influencer profiles for the year: #skincare - In 2020, a new group emerged among beauty KOLs: skinfluencers – skincare enthusiasts. This group is completed with pharmfluencers, who have a more scientific profile, so they can talk about product ingredients and skin types. #selfcare - The return to naturalness is on a roll, as minimalism is put on the spotlight, as well as the no-makeup and vegan trends. These trends actually grew in 2020, with minimalist, or even no makeup, and reduced rituals: a movement called skip-care. Green brands like Lush, Origins, and Typology boomed. #filter - Augmented reality and virtual reality are more and more widely used in the beauty sector. They make it possible for users to directly test makeup products or accessories. This testing system has thrived since the sanitary crisis began. Influencer remuneration according to the sales generated via a commission calculated with a tracking system (affiliate link, url tracker, promotional code, dedicated Amazon e-shop) is extremely popular in the beauty sector, because it is both efficient and simple. However, to be satisfactory for both advertisers and influencers, it should be based on mutual trust. This key lever requires a clear contract, Kolsquare experts explain. Still, for brands, the main challenge lies in identifying the most relevant influencers. To this aim, Kolsquare promotes their own solution based on the aggregation and analysis of data targeting influencers according to their audience, commitment rate, number of followers, themes they deal with, or even the brands they partner with. ""Big Data and machine learning help target particular influencers, learn about their objectives, and also accurately measure a given campaign's ROI,"" highlight the platform experts. In conclusion, Kolsquare emphasizes the fact that KOLs' creativity, which keeps being expressed through new formats, is an added value and a key advantage for brands. However, as authenticity is more than ever a guiding principle in influence marketing, contacting influencers at random, without taking the time to get to know them and target them, is no longer efficient. As consumers increasingly expect transparency and authenticity, it has become crucial for brands to interact with their ambassadors: they have a lot to gain by appropriately targeting their influencers and maintaining complicity with them."
"""Diversity is a statistical reality"", says The Colors founder Haweya Mohamed","How did the idea for The Colors platform come about? Haweya Mohamed - The idea for The Colors project was born out of an observation: the products and services offered by large corporations do not fully satisfy the aspirations of multicultural consumers. Today, in the world's largest consumer market, the United States, 40% of people identify as Latino, Black or Asian, according to the official figures of the United States Census Bureau. These ""minority-majority"" groups are expected to make up more than 50% of the North American population by 2045, as is already the case in most major cities such as New York and San Francisco. Culturally, we don't do this type of demographic count in Europe. However, whether you are in London, Paris, Berlin or Brussels, you can't help but notice that the consumers in the major shopping areas are clearly multicultural. And what about the 1.2 billion Africans, who will soon be 2 billion, with a constantly growing purchasing power? The Colors is therefore first and foremost about the desire to address these consumer markets by accompanying brands that want to better understand and serve these consumers, but also by accelerating startups that are targeting these markets 100%. What is the aim of The Colors? Haweya Mohamed - Our intention is for The Colors is to become the platform of reference for decision-makers seeking expertise in how to address these markets. It also aims to contribute to advancing the subject of diversity and inclusion in the domaines of fashion and beauty, and to support entrepreneurs who address multicultural populations or who promote skills and expertise of the African continent. The platform brings together experts such as Desiree Reid, who launched Iman Cosmetics; Jackie Celestin, who for a long time was Chief of Diversity at L'Oréal; Noelly Michoux, who recently raised money for her startup 4.5.6 Skin, and many others. It also brings together consumers who are very demanding when it comes to diversity issues and who interact with the entrepreneurs. The mantra of The Colors is ""Diversity is a fact. Inclusion is a choice."" Do you think today's fashion and beauty brands are inclusive? Haweya Mohamed - Diversity is not an aspiration or assertion, it is a statistical fact. As for inclusion, it is an economic choice that consists simply in wanting to sell to more people. In the future, given the numbers cited above, it will be a matter of ""being able to sell at all."" My feeling is that brands that don't deal with the reality of consumer diversity will disappear, or at least their influence will be considerably reduced. So basically, it's not a problem for anyone but themselves. The startups we work with are ""multicultural natives"" and moreover are 100% digital. The challenge for traditional brands faced with Digitally Native Vertical Brands, for example, is not to miss the opportunity for a multicultural transformation, just as they should not have missed the opportunity for a digital transformation — or else they will be disappointed. The most successful brands are inclusive: Nike, Ulta Beauty, H&M, Zalando, Mented Cosmetics, Estée Lauder... For the others, there is still work to be done, because for many marketing and communication decision-makers, embracing multiculturalism will mean leaving their cultural comfort zone. Why is it still difficult today to find hair products, creams, or makeup for all skin tones or all hair types? Haweya Mohamed - The problem starts at the laboratory level. Do they work on all skin types? Do the people in charge feel sufficiently concerned by the subject of diversity to create formulas adapted to skin types 4, 5 or 6? The answer lies in the number of laboratories dedicated to this type of formulation. Of course, there is also the question of distribution. With The Colors, the goal is to promote the creations and know-how of African entrepreneurs in the fashion and beauty sectors. What are the obstacles the most frequently face? Haweya Mohamed - The Colors wants to celebrate diversity through entrepreneurial successes without focusing too much on the known obstacles — lack of visibility, little or no access to retail, and of course little funding. With The Colors, we also want to promote the African agricultural sector. When we talk about natural products such as shea, coconut oil, ylang-ylang and argan, or textile fibers such as organic cotton, we're just talking about agriculture. Promoting the fashion and beauty sectors also allows us to have more impact on employment and women's agricultural entrepreneurship. How do you support them as they develop their brands? Haweya Mohamed - Our main means of action are our community of experts, the digital expertise of the Afrobytes community at the service of The Colors community, and our visibility. Then there's matchmaking, which is in our DNA. The strength of Afrobytes is its ability to bring together communities on three continents: Europe where we are based, the United States where our main tech partners are, and finally Africa where we have been supporting entrepreneurs for years. New brands could change the game, but shouldn't the giants in these sectors do something too? Haweya Mohamed - Large companies often focus on the acquisition of growing brands, but they should, I think, ask themselves: do I have people in-house who can help me understand what's going on and develop products that meet specific needs? A recent study done in the US revealed that multicultural consumers drove the growth of beauty products in 2020. It is important to note that multicultural consumers are increasingly paying attention to who makes and sells the brands and products they buy. It's up to brands and retailers to meet the needs of these consumers. Can the arrival of Gen Z in this market help make the fashion and beauty industries more inclusive? Haweya Mohamed - Gen Z is an inherently multicultural segment of the global population. Many brands have yet to figure out how to effectively address Millennials, let alone Gen Z, which presents an even bigger marketing hurdle. But understanding Gen Z is about understanding multicultural consumers! In an ideal scenario, how will these two industries evolve over the next 10 years? Haweya Mohamed - There's a study I often quote, which was done by Nielsen analysts in the US, which says the following to the big brands: ""if you don't have a multicultural strategy for your brand, chances are you won't have a brand in the next 10 years. Multicultural consumers are the fastest growing consumer segment in the US, so it's important to make a cultural connection with them."""
The pandemic has made wellness more of a preoccupation for consumers,"In a recent study, American management consultancy McKinsey & Company surveyed 7,500 consumers in six countries around the world (Germany, Brazil, China, the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom) to investigate the growing importance of the quest for wellness in our societies. The study focused on six major categories associated with this theme: health, fitness, nutrition, appearance (fashion/beauty), sleep and mindfulness. A major finding was that 79% of those surveyed considered wellness to be important, while 42% said it was a top priority. The study further noted that the priortization of wellness has grown steadily over the last two or three years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the aspect of wellness that attracts the most interest is health, an area in which consumers are increasingly eager to take control, particularly with data-driven care, apps to manage appointments and smart health devices. In line with this logic, consumers are also concerned about fitness. Particularly with regard to the ongoing health crisis, they have been finding it difficult to maintain their pre-covid levels of physical activity given that gyms have been closed and remote working has become the norm. However, this context has also created a boom in apps and equipment for exercising at home. In all of the countries surveyed, a majority of respondents affirmed that they would like to give more priority to mindfulness. For the authors of the study, this trend is also linked to the pandemic, which has contributed to a global increase in levels of stress and mental distress. Probably for the same reasons, respondents also revealed a growing interest in technologies (apps and trackers) and accessories (blackout curtains, gravity blankets etc.) that aim to improve sleep quality. Last but not least, nutrition also figures large in the wellness trend, with consumers eager for food that not only tastes good but also contributes to health goals. In the realm of services linked to appearance, nonsurgical aesthetic procedures are enjoying rapid growth, notably micro-needling, lasers and oxygen jets. As for clothing, the study confirmed a trend, which has been prevalent since the onset of the pandemic: athleisure. Pioneered in the United States, athleisure focuses on practical and functional garments for comfort and ease of movement. It is also a manner of dressing that strongly correlates with kicking back and relaxing, especially when teleworking. The priority attributed to each of these different aspects of wellness varies from country to country. For example, Japanese respondents were most interested in appearance, while Germans were more focused on fitness. For people in Brazil and the United States mindfulness was of the utmost importance, while the British and Chinese emphasized nutrition."
"Natural beauty records double-digit growth in Brazil, according to Kline","In connection with the COVID-19, Brazilian have intensified their hygiene habits, leading to an unexpected 5.8% annual growth (ex-factory price) in sales of cosmetic and hygiene products, according to the Brazilian Association of the personal hygiene, perfumery and cosmetics industry (ABIHPEC). Furthermore, as consumers in the country isolated themselves and took precautionary measures to prevent infection, they gave renewed attention to the importance of wellness and self-care. As a result, categories such as facial masks and treatments as well as hand/body cleansers and moisturizers increased in terms of demand, found Kline in a recent report. According to the market research firm, several brands successfully launched innovations in these categories such as new facial masks from Quintal Dermocosméticos and the new Beauty Nectar from Elemento Mineral. Skin care products with essential oils as a part of their formulation also grew in popularity, boosted by launches of new products, such as the Synergy of Oils from By Samia and Phytoterápica's new essential oils, Junípero and Yuzu. In parallel, L'Oréal's Garnier successfully entered the Brazilian skin care market during 2020, landing among the top 10 natural skin care brands, according to Kline's Natural and Clean Beauty Global Series report. In addition, found Kline, consumers increasingly gravitated toward brands that offer a more responsible position, both from social and environmental point of views. For example, LiveAloe, with its complete portfolio of organic products; Boni Natural, which made its entry in many supermarkets and drugstores chains; and Cativa Natureza, with its sanitizing lotion. The trend has also helped the natural segment to perform well. Natural brands such as Elemento Mineral, with its complete line of facial treatment, Care Natural Beauty, ad Up2You, which have invested a lot in social media communication and digital channels, also had an extraordinary performance in 2020, said Kline. Actually, most natural skin care marketers were already quite savvy and actively present in the e-commerce domain, and were able to successfully pivot online to meet consumer needs, during lockdowns."
Clean and ethical beauty is an obvious choice for Gen-Z consumers in the US,"""GenZ is a conscious generation as teens this Spring cite Racial Equality & the Environment as their top-two social issues. We have also seen 'thrifting' emerge as a strong trend as thinking secondhand is becoming second nature to teens. In fact, 47% of teens have purchased and 55% have sold secondhand,"" said Erinn Murphy, Piper Sandler senior research analyst. However, the study does not explain why teenagers are buying more secondhand goods. Price could be the main motivating factor - more than commitment to the environment - especially when you consider that Amazon remains the online shopping site most commonly cited by young Americans (56%), ahead of Shein (7%), Nike (5%), and PacSun (3%). The study of 7,000 Americans with an average age of 16.1 years [1] has also revealed ""a female-led spending recovery with upticks in spending on clothing, handbags and skincare in particular."" Furthermore, in the wake of COVID-19 and given these consumers are digitally-native, it is no surprise to see online adoption at its highest ever. 96% of females claimed to shop online vs. 88% last year, while 92% of males claimed to shop online vs. 91% last year. Say goodbye to makeup, the health crisis has completely overturned the beauty habits of this generation, which now has a growing interest in skincare. ""Spending on skincare products for women has overtaken spending on makeup"", reveals the survey. An interesting aspect of this change is that teenagers are increasingly turning to online influencers when seeking information on current trends and new beauty brands (86%). However, dermatologist-recommended products are very much in vogue with Gen-Z, a fact reflected in the ranking of the age group's favorite brands: CeraVe (35%), Cetaphil (10%), Neutrogena (8%), The Ordinary (7%), and Curology (3%). For fifth survey in a row, Ulta maintains No. 1 preferred beauty destination against Sephora (46% share vs. 39% last year). At the same time, 80% of female teens say they are willing to spend more for ""clean"" or natural beauty."
"Interest in perfume has never been greater, according to Cinquième Sens","""The pandemic has put the spotlight on anosmia and raised global awareness about the importance of olfaction in our lives. As a consequence, this led to a growing interest in perfumery; not only in a more in-depth knowledge of perfumes but also in the impact the sense of smell has on our well-being and psychological balance"", explained Isabelle Ferrand, CEO of Cinquième Sens in Paris, France. This trend had emerged before the outbreak of the pandemic, but it has been reinforced and accelerated with the different lockdowns. ""On the one hand, people have realized the importance of fragrances and want to occupy their free time and learn different things from home. With the pandemic, many people want to do what they never gave themselves the opportunity to do, make their dreams come true and one of these dreams may be to learn more about perfumery. On the other hand, there are the entrepreneurs. People who lost their jobs due to the pandemic and want to start a business in perfumes, soaps or candles,"" said Ana María Páez Saldarriaga, director of Atelier Olfativo, Cinquième Sens' franchisee in Colombia. ""We are finding a fascinating mix between individuals and professional interest. We have individuals who never thought a perfumery training could be available to them based on where they live (i.e. far from the USA perfumery centers of New York and California) so Zoom is giving them new access. Also people who were too crazy at work to invest time to physically go to training now can join us for short snippets since they are working from home and have more flexibility,"" confirmed Tami Katz, from U.S. fragrance consulting firm Serendipitee. ""Since the pandemic, there is an increase in individuals who seek help launching a natural perfume brand because they want to change their career and do something they love,"" observed Samantha Taylor from Australia's The Powder Room. ""A booming momentum for olfaction is happening right now,"" added Alessandra Tucci, founder of Paralela Escola Olfativa, in São Paulo, Brazil. ""Loss of the sense of smell, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic also revived the discussions around scents for wellbeing and emotional comfort,"" noted perfumery expert Rajiv Sheth, Founder and CEO of All Good Scents, in India. ""We are witnessing a real breakthrough in the relationship to perfume. Previously, people were using perfumes in order to be more attractive. Now, the perfume experience is becoming more complex and increasingly involves a search for personal well-being,"" added Isabelle Ferrand. In many markets, people are increasingly interested in knowing more about the link between the sense of smell and their emotions. ""Aromachology is on the rise, we have more and more requests for training on the effect of odours on well-being and health,"" said Isabelle Ferrand. For Ana María Páez Saldarriaga, a lot of perfumery concepts currently emerging in Colombia are linked to emotions (joy, energy, calm, etc.), with some of them inviting to the escapism (one of the hottest desires of the moment). Product wise, the quest for wellbeing and positive emotions is leading to an increase in the demand for home fragrances, according to Rajiv Sheth. In Colombia, ""there is a surge new local brands of scented candles, sometimes with air purifying claims,"" observed Ana María Páez Saldarriaga. At Cinquième Sens in Paris, the creation of fragrances for candles is indeed the business which is currently recording the fastest growth. In order to address the rise of the demand for perfume education, Cinquième Sens and its franchisees - in 14 countries on all continents - are constantly adapting their training offers to changing demands. For instance, a programme dedicated to home fragrances had been set up even before the acceleration of the demand, in the wake of the pandemic, and a module devoted to sustainable development in the perfume sector (covering regulatory and technical aspects specific to perfumes) is currently under preparation."
Canada's prestige beauty market begins to recover after steep decline in 2020,"Widespread lockdowns and retail restrictions led to steep declines in several key beauty categories including makeup (-33%), skincare (-9%) and fragrance (-7%). In 2020, the overall Canadian prestige beauty market declined by 17%, according to The NPD Group. [1] A deeper look at the different product categories shows that despite its decline skincare maintained its standing as Canada's number one category. Furthremore, while fragrance sales declined by -7% consumers spent +6% more on average compared to 2019 as they shifted their dollars towards stronger, more concentrated scents and the iconic designer brands and pillar brands they know and love. Furthermore, sales of fragrance home scents grew by +10% in 2020 as consumers searched for ways to incorporate luxury into their stay-at-home lifestyles. Eventually, with its +33% growth, the hair care category was the fastest growing category across all the countries tracked by The NPD Group. In brief, the top market share gainers for 2020 included hair products; fragrance eau de parfum and eau de toilette; face creams, serums, cleansers and exfoliators; body creams/lotions; candles and nail care. As in most other markets, since brick-and-mortar stores were closed, a part of prestige beauty buyers switched their habits to purchase their favorite prestige products online. Online sales saw an increase of +56% in 2020 as the channel registered almost one third of all prestige beauty sales on the year compared to just 17% in 2019, found the market research firm. While the last 12 months have been difficult, the Canadian beauty industry is beginning to show signs of growth. Year-over-year sales for the week ending March 13 increased by +3%, which was the first time the industry has seen a positive weekly sales increase since the week ending November 21. [2] ""As we head towards recovery, there is a great opportunity for brands and retailers to delight and surprise consumers and build loyalty both in-store and online,"" said Alecsandra Hancas, Canadian Beauty Industry Analyst at The NPD Group. ""Recovery will vary by category, and while Skincare and Fragrance have shown positive signs, there are bright spots even within the struggling makeup category. Lipstick, just like going out, will make a comeback and we can't wait."" In 2020, prestige beauty sales dropped -16% in Germany, -19% in the U.S.A., -20% in France, and -24% in the U.K."
Make-up: Is orange set to be the next hottest color for lips?,"Lipstick isn't dead yet! The pandemic has certainly meant it's been out of the spotlight for a while, relegated to the background by mask wearing, but we haven't seen the last of it. It is even making a comeback in its most daring shade, a vivid orange that will not go unnoticed this summer. It remains to be seen if it will really get to be seen by the world live in the flesh, or if it will rather make a statement as the star product in beauty styling pix posted on social networks. And yet, by all indications the global pandemic was at the root of a return to more natural makeup looks, with a smoothed-out but not overloaded complexion, lips that are shiny but not tinted, and a more distinct eye, but not overly made up. This penchant for going back to basics is directly linked to lockdowns and the implementation of working from home, as well as to the necessity of wearing a mask in public spaces. Why spend time and effort on a sophisticated makeup look that no one will see? So now what does this return to a vibrant color like this orange signify? The end of the pandemic? That seems somewhat further off. It seems more linked to a need for optimism, freshness and cheerfulness, in response to a gloomy period. And there's no denying it! These orange lips, these looks full of energy and daring, have a feelgood effect in the midst of the covid era. The positive impact of vibrant colors on the human mind is well known! Followed by nearly 14,000 people on Instagram, Afnan Dano recently posted an ultra bright look, featuring fluorescent orange, from eyelids to lips that has sparked a host of positive reactions. A photo that clear has the power to help forget this complicated period ... at least for a few seconds. And TikTok is also playing a role; the influencers keep coming, one after another to present their favorite orange lipstick, from pastel to fluorescent shades through orange reds... The views on the hashtag ""#orangelipstick"" figure in the hundreds of thousands, and orange lipstick is making an appearance in many videos dedicated to spring 2021 trends. With this springtime inspiration, one has to wonder if ultra-pigmented shades are set to be back in the spotlight after months of absence. Not only are brands focusing on richly pigmented lipsticks and glosses on social media, but beauty influencers seem to have grown tired of natural beauty looks and are gradually returning to bolder looks. It's a trend that is usually seen in the fall-winter season, but it lets us look forward to a summer of extravagance. It remains to be seen if it will be possible for everybody to live it to its full extent."
UK beauty buyers have adopted the 'skinimalism' trend as soon as last year,"As the pandemic led to the periodical closure of brick and mortar stores, with prestige beauty sales declining -24% in 2020, the UK market was affected stronger than its European counterparts, including France (-20%) and Germany (-16%), or than the US (-19%). As far as prestige skincare sales are concerned, the fall reached -23% in 2020 in the UK, according to The NPD Group latest data, and the total prestige skincare market was valued at £295 million. According to Pinterest's 2021 Trend Predictions Report, 'skinimalism', which features a pared down skincare and make-up routine which adopts a minimalist, back-to-basics approach, will be one of the biggest beauty trends this year. However, NPD's research suggests that UK consumers appear to have embraced this attitude in their skincare buying habits as soon as last year. According to The NPD Group, three skincare subsegments demonstrated the early adoption of the 'skinimalism' trend among UK consumers by reporting a decline in sales less than the total category: in 2020 sales of prestige face cream declined 20%, prestige face cleansers declined 17% and facial exfoliators declined 3%. ""Face cream, facial cleanser and facial exfoliators are the three sub-segments where consumers have gone back to basics whilst some 'additional steps' such as eye treatments and masks have declined in importance in face skincare as consumers have 'skinimised' what products they're using,"" commented Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty. In 2018 and 2019, sales of eye treatment products have represented the third largest subsegment (in value) within prestige skincare, however, in 2020 facial cleansers reported more value sales than eye treatments, reinforcing the trend for a pared down skincare regime. Sales of anti-acne serums increased by 51% in value in 2020 as mask wearing created new needs and consumers focused on skin specific remedies to reveal their glowing skin. ""As the pandemic hit, our skincare routine remained consistent when the country went into lockdown. However, consumer confidence has been hit, and people are more reluctant to spend. At the same time consumers focus on sustainability also means that Skinimalism has become very topical. Beauty buyers seem to be purchasing less products, and the products that they are opting for are more targeted. We have also seen an increase in beauty brands concentrate their messaging on the active ingredients in their products. Just some examples of brands that we have observed doing this include Estee Lauder with its latest Advanced Night Repair Serum re-launch, Origins New Multi-powered Youth Serum and in Makeup, Charlotte Tilbury's new Lip Launch called Hyaluronic Happikiss,"" added Emma Fishwick."
Brazil: Sales of cosmetics and hygiene products grew by 5.8% in 2020,"The 5.8% annual growth (ex-factory price) is well above the 1.1% forecasted in August. According to ABIHPEC, this impressive rise can be explained by several factors, starting with the intensification of hygiene habits in order to reduce the risk of contamination by the new coronavirus. With sales up 808% compared to 2019, sanitizing hand gels are the best illustration of what the trade association calls the ""Covid-19 basket"", which also includes paper tissues (+77%), kitchen towels (+33.2%), liquid soap (+22.3%), bar soaps (+9.5%) and toilet paper (+12.7%). Other product categories, also linked to hygiene habits, took advantage of the situation, such as bath products. However the performance of the skincare category, for body and face, is one of the most surprising, with sales up 21.9% from 2019. Indeed, all the products in this segment recorded a double-digit growth! Facials and face care masks recorded growth of 91% and, for body care, scrubs performed the best, with an increase of 153.2%. Sales of the perfume category increased by 8.4% in 2020 (ex-factory price again) compared to the previous year. Despite a relatively long shutdown and the operating restrictions to which they have been subjected, perfumeries have been able to reinvent themselves and invest in alternative sales channels to attract distance buyers. Online shopping, experience sharing on social networks and virtual interaction with brands, have allowed perfumery shops to keep in touch with consumers. The other explanatory factor for the growth of perfume sales is the increased interest in in local brands. On the one hand, restrictions on foreign travel have limited the opportunities for duty free shopping and, on the other hand, the increase in the price of imported items, linked to the rise of the dollar against the Brazilian currency, boosted the competitiveness of local brands. The intensification of personal hygiene habits also led Brazilian consumers to increase the frequency of baths and showers and, consequently, the occasions for washing their hair. According to ABIHPEC, sales of shampoos increased by 7.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. Sales of conditioners increased by 18.6% and those of hair care products by 12.6%. Note that the Brazilian cosmetics and hygiene industry recorded its first trade surplus in 2020 (USD 23.4 million), after a decade of deficit."
Zoom era sees pandemic boom in US plastic surgeries,"He knew he would have time to recuperate in the privacy of his own home. And Young suddenly found himself face-to-face with his own image while participating in an increased amount of video calls. ""It's something new when you have to stare at your face for a couple of hours a day and there's only so much you can do with good lighting and good angles,"" he said. Young, 52, already had been a fan of Botox injections but went under the scalpel for the first time in October. He had a lower face and neck lift, upper and lower eyelid surgery and laser resurfacing. ""You first discover that with Zoom when you see yourself and you're like, Oh, yikes!"" the trainee real estate agent explained, as Dr Michael Somenek examined his barely visible scars. Young is far from the only one who has found themselves disappointed with the reflection they have seen in the webcam over the past year. Virtual consultations for cosmetic procedures have risen 64 percent for surgeons in the United States since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, which lists Botox injections, dermal fillers, breast augmentation and liposuction as among the most popular services. ""We have absolutely seen an increase in the number of surgical cosmetic procedures that people have been seeking directly related to Zoom,"" said Somenek, who has seen a 50 to 60 percent increase. ""The number one procedure that people have been coming in for is either their upper eyelids or their neck. Because they see (their neck) either hanging on the camera or looking like a double chin."" A similar phenomenon was observed in Brazil, the world leader in plastic surgery procedures, with 13 percent of the global market, according to figures from the International Society of Plastic Surgery. And the reasons were quite the same. ""I think the pandemic in general has given everyone time to like, sit back and take care of those things that we've been pushing further and further along,"" explained Ana Caceres, who was able to work from home after undergoing a plastic surgery operation she had wanted for a long time. She recovered at her parents' house outside Washington after a December breast reconstruction and lift that helped her deal with a source of insecurity she has had since adolescence. ""I didn't have to take off all this time, because I still was able to work from my bed with my laptop,"" the 25-year-old said. ""When life is going on and you have places to be, it's so easy to push things along further and further,"" Caceres said, sporting a top she says she now has the confidence to wear. And she has scheduled arm liposuction for the end of this month. Her surgeon, Dr Catherine Hannan, says consultations at her clinic in the US capital have nearly doubled since the beginning of the pandemic. ""Our patients have more frown lines, because they've been so stressed for the last year,"" she said. And Hannan says a face or body change can have a psychological impact, too. ""This is a way that patients are saying, I can't travel, I can't see my family, this is something I can do to make myself feel more confident right now."""
The Chinese men's cosmetics market is getting polarized,"""There is a 'soft' representation of men (in advertisement as well as TV series and movies) targeting women – the Little Fresh Meat 'poppy dogs', these prepubescent looking men with flawless skin, wearing make-up, with sophisticated hairstyles, projecting the ideal, sensitive and romantic boyfriend,"" explains Laurence Lim Dally, CEO of Hong-Kong-based intercultural branding agency Cherry Blossoms. To her, the trend in China is more about representing Little Fresh Meat to promote female cosmetics, which both Chinese and Western brands would do. Most cosmetic brands would target men with products men and women can both use. However, this representation of masculinity, partly influenced by the South-Korean pop culture, also seems to have an impact on the men's market. Already the first in the world, the Chinese men's cosmetics market was estimated at 12.5 billion yuans (1.9 billion USD) in 2020 by market research company Mintel, and should rise by 50% to reach 18.5 billion yuans in 2025. The object of everyone's desire, this dynamism triggered the emergence of local brands, like Coen (科恩), Just A Cool Brand (JACB), or Make Essense (理然), which are seeking to capture this market, still dominated by major groups. According to Mintel, L'Oréal, Beiersdorf, and Japanese group Rohto share 60% of the men's cosmetics market in China. Press agency Reuters says six new Chinese brands managed to raise over 300 million yuans thanks to investors. They aim to get as successful as compatriot Perfect Diary, who achieved a meteoric rise among the young Chinese women generation with playful, affordable cosmetics and countless promotional campaigns. In light of these new players, other advertising imagery might make a comeback. According to Laurence Lim Dally, ""the representation of masculinity in China remains dual. At the opposite of the Little Fresh Meat, brands targeting men still represent more 'macho', traditional representations of masculinity."" ""With the rise of national pride, fueled by the successful management of the Covid-19 crisis by China, more 'manly' representations of men emerge, notably through patriotic action movies embodying China's superpower"", she adds. Patriotism may have also revived the polemic against men wearing make-up or earrings, called 'Sissy pants' by China's influential state media Xinhua, in 2018. ""Possibly for that reason, we see some Little Fresh Meat celebrities evolve from 'poppy dogs' to 'wolf dogs'. They keep their flawless skin but grow muscles, wear lighter make-up, street style and adopt a more mature and 'manly' body language,"" says Laurence Lim Dally. In fact, the men's facial skincare market has embarked on a journey of growth transformation, with male consumers polarizing, explains Alice Li, Senior Beauty & Personal Care analyst at Mintel. Some men have started to expand their routines with a wider range of facial skincare products, from facial masks to suncare products. ""Mintel data shows that in 2020, Chinese men use 2.3 types of facial skincare products on average, up from 1.7 types in 2017,"" she adds. ""Here is the potential to encourage men's usage with skincare bundles that include a range of different products."" However, a growing proportion of men are still struggling to understand the need for facial skincare and have dropped out of the category over the past few years. The percentage of men who have not used any facial skincare products in the past six months has increased in the past three years, from 12% in 2017 to 21% in 2019 and 25% in 2020. 25-29-year-olds and tier-one city consumers are more likely to stop using facial skincare products. ""This indicates that some men still take facial skincare as a dispensable and optional category; they do not think it is necessary to use facial skincare products and just drop out after a few trials,"" analyzes Alice Li. After revolutionizing the market, in particular with the Chanel Boy makeup range in 2018, and then the unisex Givenchy Mister range, how can Western brands position themselves on this complex market? ""As Western brands may be more at ease with inclusive representations of gender, they may have a card to play to forge new aspirational masculinities in China, which would stay away from the Little Fresh Meat persona, while expressing more gender fluidity,"" suggests Laurence Lim Dally. ""Chinese brands might remain more conservative when representing masculinity for the male gaze,"" she concludes."
Mintel's four key beauty and personal care trends for 2021,"In a recent report [1], Mintel announced four key consumer trends set to impact the global beauty and personal care industry during 2021. Beautiful Mind: Brands have an opportunity to build normality in uncertain times through routines using products that protect, bring value, and rebuild trusting relationships. ""Brands that successfully highlight the use of beauty routines as a way to combat stress and anxiety will drive long-term value for consumers. Brands will need to create strategies for third-party experts to educate consumers about the future of holistic wellness with self-care that touches on the mind-body-spirit connection,"" said Sharon Kwek, Associate Director, Global Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. Beauty Re(Valued): As spending comes under scrutiny, product functionality and purpose will drive usage. Value will be measured in quality, convenience, and impact rather than currency. While experiences will become more valuable than tangible products, brands wishing to encourage consumers to trade-up will need to redefine value, beyond just cost, but through the impact of purchase . Channel Changers: Robust ecommerce strategies will allow brands to win with a true omnichannel approach that pushes the boundaries, engages all of the senses, and offers new layers of digital experience. ""Brands will need to develop strategies that drive commerce to own-brand sites that advocate authenticity, as well as challenge big marketplaces that have yet to provide clear supply chain transparency,"" added Kwek. Beauty Eco-lution: As consumers emerge from COVID-19 confinement, they will re-evaluate priorities with eco-ethical considerations driving more purchases. As many consumers will continue shopping local with less focus on price, collaborating with and supporting local businesses will be an important long-term strategy. ""The next evolution of 'clean' will be created by marrying ethics with safety to cater to the conscious and careful beauty consumer focused on avoiding undue risk inside and outside the box,"" concluded Sharon Kwek."
Brazil's ABIHPEC is optimistic for 2021 despite very uncertain times,"""Things could have been much worse,"" said João Carlos Basilio about the year 2020. With market growth expected to reach about 6% last year, the beauty industry in Brazil has had to reinvent itself to address the challenges - and the opportunities - that emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. To date, the exact results of the year are yet to be unveiled, but according to João Carlos Basilio, ""the growth of the sector should be significant, given the difficulties that have arisen in 2020."" ""With regard to the pandemic, it has been crutial that our sector be considered essential for the country, in particular by the federal government. Our factories have not stopped. As a result, it has been possible to maintain the production and the jobs of the population, as well as the growth of the market."" Sales of items pertaining to the so-called ""Covid basket"", such as hand sanitizers and liquid soaps, have sky-rocketed. However, other categories - such as body care - also rose sharply in 2020. ""With Brazilians spending more time at home, figures show consumers focused on products enabling them to perform mini spa rituals at home."" From January to October 2020, sales of the body care segment increased by 17.1% (ex-factory price), compared to the same period in 2019. Sales of exfoliators soared 159.9 %. ""These data show the strong ritualization of the bathing time, consumers have transformed it as a moment of relaxation and disconnection from the stress of everyday life"", emphasizes João Carlos Basilio. A similar phenomenon has occurred for facial skin care. The category saw an increase of 30.9% between January and October 2020. Skin care masks were the most sought after, with an increase of 102.6%. ""Facial masks were already very popular with Brazilians, even before the pandemic, and as people were spending more time at home their interest grew even further."" In Brazil too, e-commerce was one of the main winners of the pandemic. ""According to a survey carried out by Go2Mob in November 2020, 35% of Brazilians have started to buy online or have increased the volume of their online purchases after the start of the pandemic and this is a shift that will last."" Digital platforms have notably made it possible to meet consumer expectations during major annual festivities such as Mother's Day, Lover's Day, Father's Day, Black Friday in November and Christmas. ""The current environment is still very uncertain, but we are still optimistic about 2021, after all, despite all the difficulties encountered throughout 2020, we have seen a V-shaped economic recovery curve materialize"" , says João Carlos Basilio. According to him, the waffling of the government regarding income-support for households and businesses, especially SMEs, as well as uncertainties about ""structural reforms that the country urgently needs, encourage to remain cautious."""
"Germany prestige beauty sales declined 16% in 2020, reports The NPD Group","Germany prestige beauty market generated EUR 2,7 billion in sales during 2020 and reported a 16% decline compared to 2019, found to The NPD Group [1]. Germany is the only country, along the five largest European markets for prestige beauty, with an overall decline in sales below 20%. For instance, the prestige beauty market posted a 20% drop in France and a 24% decline in the United Kingdom. According to the market research firm, Germany's performance is mainly due to shorter lockdown periods, as well as the industry's online channel maturity. Online sales in Germany saw a 25% increase in 2020. However, as in the other European countries, this rise could not compensate the declines from brick-and-mortar stores. The e-commerce channel registered almost one quarter of all prestige beauty sales in 2020 compared to 16% in 2019. The EUR 1.4 billion fragrances category decreased by 14% but still represents the largest share of prestige beauty sales in Germany. Juices showed double-digit decline but overall showed a better performance in the market compared to gift sets and ancillaries. Retail lockdowns in Germany happened during Easter and Christmas, two key consumption periods for fragrances. Also, during Mother's Day, the category suffered as it took place three weeks after the spring lockdown. The skincare category, the second largest category in Germany's beauty market, posted an 11% drop and showed the best resilience among the three main categories. According to The NPD Group, the key factor contributing to skincare's annual performance is the higher percentage of online sales even before the retail lockdown. E-commerce now represents 27 percent of the category sales. The other main explanation is the trend towards more beauty ""me-time"" at home. With a 27% drop, makeup reported the biggest impact from the pandemic. Reduced social life during and after lockdown, as well as mandatory mask wearing contributed to the decline. This was noteworthy for the sales of lip products, which declined by 40%. Eye products such as mascara and eyebrow resisted better than the rest of the category. Within face products, blushes and highlighters had a difficult year, while tinted moisturizer and setting sprays were less affected."
"U.S. prestige beauty sales declined 19% in 2020, reports NPD","The U.S. prestige beauty industry generated $16.1 billion in 2020, a 19% sales decline compared to 2019, according to The NPD Group. By category, makeup sales were down (-34%) for the year followed by skincare (-11%) and fragrance (-8%), while hair grew 7%. Shifting consumer priorities toward self-care and little luxuries, and broader lifestyle changes due to the pandemic moved the needle in unprecedented ways, creating pockets of growth amidst the industry's overall sales decline. Self-care became essential in 2020, with the winning areas of the market being those that helped to create a spa environment at home. The top market share gainers for the year touched on all categories, including hair treatments and masks; fragrance candles; face exfoliators; body creams/lotions, cleansers, and oils; and nail care. Despite the tight race between makeup and skincare throughout the year, makeup ultimately maintained its position as the largest beauty category based on dollar sales for 2020; however, it has also been the most negatively impacted by the pandemic, as it was the case in France and in the UK. Face remained the largest segment in makeup and sales declined faster than the overall category, but some products increased their market share including setting spray/powder, tinted moisturizer, bronzer, and concealer. Eye makeup gained share while lip saw the steepest declines, a shift that has, in part, been a byproduct of mask wearing. Nail was the only segment of makeup to grow in 2020 as consumers took nail care into their own hands. In skincare, the areas of growth were not enough to compensate for the declines across the largest areas of the market: face cream, face serum, and eye treatment. Most of skincare's growth stemmed from body products, including body creams/lotions, exfoliators, cleansers, serums, and devices. With clinics closed and elective surgeries placed on hold, consumers turned to at-home microdermabrasion and body sculpting-type products to achieve results. Fragrance, while down for the year, declined at the slowest rate thanks to a second half rebound, similarly to what happened in France and in the UK. Although the brick-and-mortar channel remained challenged, the rate of decline decelerated to a great extent during the second half of the year, allowing the accelerated online growth to offset that loss. In terms of the bright spots that helped fragrance overperform compared to the other categories, parfum sales grew double digits for the year, as consumers are showing a greater affinity towards longer lasting scents. Parfums also tend to be more expensive, which further helped boost dollar volumes for the category. In addition, home scents, which have been on the uptick for the last few years, saw accelerated growth in 2020 as consumers brought the meaning of comfort at home to another level."
"Prestige beauty sales in the UK down 24% in 2020, reports The NPD Group","COVID-19 has changed consumer buying habits, with many adopting a digital approach to their shopping. On the one hand, sales of prestige beauty products in brick and mortar stores declined 44% in 2020 when stores were forced to close intermittently due to government restrictions, according to The NPD Group. On the other hand, prestige beauty sales online increased 47% in 2020, up 21% points compared to 2019. Actually, the pandemic has accelerated a trend that was already well established, since the prestige beauty market online has reported double digit growth in the UK for several years. Despite a harsh context, fragrance demonstrated its resilience in 2020 and was one of the best performing categories in prestige beauty. In 2020 total prestige fragrance sales declined 17%, seven points less than the overall prestige beauty market. The first lockdown had a negative impact on sales in the fragrance market and 50% of the year's total losses can be attributed to the period from April to June. When stores reopened, recovery was in sight, and the market showed promising signs, performing positively in November, growing 2%, despite the second lockdown. In 2019, 52% of fragrance sales occurred in the last three months of the year. October to December 2020 accounted for 57% mix of full year sales, confirming that fragrances remain one of the most important Christmas gifts for consumers. The NPD Group made similar observations for prestige fragrance sales in France. Skincare came into sharp focus in 2020. It was the most resilient prestige beauty category during the first lockdown as consumers maintained their skincare routine. The skincare category declined 21% in 2020, but sales of anti-acne serums increased by 51% in value in 2020 as mask wearing created new needs among British consumers. Sales of prestige hand soaps grew 38% in 2020 compared to 2019. Furthermore, following the #selfcare trend, prestige bodycare gained more than 1% of market share due to the popularity of body creams, lotions and spray as consumers turned to spa-at-home routines. Make-up, one of the pillars of the UK beauty market, was the most challenged category in 2020. Sales of prestige makeup in the UK declined 40% compared to 2019. Remote-working, reduced social life and the trend for natural makeup led to a decrease in demand. For example, sales of lip make-up declined 50%, due to the government regulations to wear face masks. ""The UK's prestige beauty industry has been hugely challenged in 2020, however brands and retailers remain resilient and the trends we witnessed in previous years have accelerated during the pandemic. This includes the growth of online sales, the importance of a multi-channel retail approach, and the influence of social media on a consumers path to purchase,"" said Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty. Earlier this month, The NPD Group published similar figures regarding the French prestige beauty market which posted an unprecedented 20% drop. However, brick and mortar stores were less impacted in France (-26%) and online sales (+52%) performed even better that in the UK."
"Skin protection: Consumers want more, according to Mintel","As the year went by, it became inevitable to increasingly use screens to work, do shopping, and even socialize. But this extended exposure to blue light provokes skin and eye damage. A study by Unilever exposed its effect on our skin, saying 30 hours of exposure to blue light from smartphone or laptop screens can increase the inflammation level in skin cells by 40%. This risk should be taken into account, because the habits related to screens have become widespread. In the US, 67% of consumers think group video chats will still be a popular way to socialise after social distancing ends. And this data boosts cosmetic innovation. Truly Blueberry Kush CBD Body Oil is designed to moisturise, detoxify and calm skin, while working as a natural shield against blue light and supporting the skin's barrier function. Likewise, Dr. Nassif Firming Neck Treatment is an anti-ageing cream said to help resist the ""tech neck"" wrinkles caused by using a phone or laptop for hours every day. In addition, as they are coping with the sanitary crisis, consumers also want additional protection against bacteria and external particles. This expectation should actually last and become widespread once sanitary measures have been lightened. The notion of protection against pollution also remains relevant despite the short lockdown relief. According to Mintel, in the UK, 42% of adults are worried about the level of air pollution they are exposed to. And yet, in 2020, 56% of launches containing protection against pollution were face care products; 11% were body care products, and 8% sunscreens – two segments for which consumers expect the same claims as part of a holistic vision. The UV protection added to skincare products is beneficial in many regions. It accounts for a large part of launches – 46% between October 2019 and September 2020. Still, for consumers who long remained locked down indoors, Mintel recommends innovations focused on sun products with skincare or cosmetic advantages, while keeping the same basic protection message. For example, Fenty Beauty has now launched the Hydra Vizor Broad Spectrum Sunscreen, containing niacinamide and hyaluronic acid for additional beauty benefits."
French exports of cosmetic products decreased for the first time since 2009,"During what has been a harsh year, marked by a global health and economic crisis, France exported more than EUR 15.7 billion of cosmetic products, a decrease of 11.8% compared to 2019, according to figures released Friday by the French Federation of the beauty industry (FEBEA). ""Despite the troubled context, French cosmetics now hold 24% of the world market share. The 'Made in France' label remains an essential asset for the sector and for our economy as a whole,"" said Patrick O'Quin, president of FEBEA. According to French customs, this is the first decline in French exports of perfumes and cosmetics since 2009, and only the second in the last 20 years. This drop is to be compared with that of exports from other French manufacturing sectors, all on a downward trend in 2020, with the exception of pharmaceutical products (+ 4.7%). On the other hand, exports of French cosmetics to China grew by nearly 20.7% in 2020. Even if the pace is slowing down compared to 2019 (+48%), this sharp increase marks the growing importance of the country for the French perfume and cosmetics industry. Indeed, the Asian giant is now the number one market for the French cosmetics industry, ahead of Germany and the United States. For instance, China is ""by far the leading buyer of French lipsticks, with more than one in four exported the country,"" said the FEBEA. Skin care and even face makeup are ""very popular with Chinese consumers,"" added the trade organisation. During this very atypical year, sales of soaps performed very well, all over the world with an increase of 11.3% in value compared to 2019. It is in Asia that this progression was the strongest (+22%), ahead of Europe (+19%). On the other hand, French exports of perfumes fell by 16% and those of eau de toilette fell by 27.9% over the year, due in particular to a reduced number of launches, but also to the halt to travel retail."
Luxury perfumes: How the pandemic is revolutionizing the shopping experience,"No more testers, no more solo olfactory wanderings: now, customers must ask shop assistants when they want to smell perfumes. Masks and social distancing also have an influence on the shopping experience. All this has largely contributed to the rise of online sales and the emergence of digital technologies. ""The recovery we experienced online actually saved us. The public's appetite incited us to reinvent ourselves in the digital world,"" explains François Hénin, founder of Jovoy, the Embassy of Rare Perfumes. However, the current situation does not seem to have altered perfumistas' curiosity too strongly. ""In this slowdown context favourable to discovery, some people want to purchase the same perfumes, while enthusiasts are eager for new launches,"" adds François Hénin. Brands and the media do their best to feed this appetite with new fragrances, some of which are only available online, while promotional games flourish on social media. However, "" boxes are the best new perfume boosters,"" says François Hénin. ""Thanks to regular newsletters, they gained the public's buy-in: when they fall in love with a perfume, people tend to buy a bottle online"". For Jovoy, it is a way to transpose their generous sample policy to the digital sphere – a significant advantage in this tricky period punctuated by lockdowns and other restrictive measures for physical stores. With this in mind, Jovoy also made boxes structured around different themes (seasons, materials, events). Boxes being a more intimate and serene discovery method, they are now on a roll. For example, ""taking in account both subscriptions and unit sales"", sales on the Auparfum website ""rose by 20% compared to last year,"" says Lucile Rives, of the Nez team. The website's e-shop (shop.bynez.com), which displays books, candles, and games, actually saw sales increase by 40%, compared to 2019. ""We need to keep surprising people and innovating, even online,"" explains François Hénin. ""For example, in our boxes, we slip scented papers which provide information about the fragrance, including the olfactory pyramid. We want people to have fun."" To re-enchant online shopping, Jovoy also offers various gifts with purchase. For a 100 ml bottle, you get one of these small gifts of all sorts: testing doses of perfumed detergent by pH Fragrances, flasks of the Nosy Be vanilla absolute by Parfumeurs Sans Frontières, a 15 ml new BDK perfume to discover… Brands are definitely willing to play the game, hoping to gain some visibility. New virtual experiences are also welcome. Since the information provided in the press is not enough for perfume lovers, Instagram lives and other videos are getting widespread. ""We are going to organize an online competition. Web users' most beautiful descriptions will be posted on our website, and winners will get bottles,"" François Hénin eagerly reveals. To get rid of the trouble related to social distancing rules in stores and offset the decline of physical traffic, Jovoy offers private consultation sessions in small groups of two to three people – an opportunity for customers fond of this luxury cocoon to experience a special moment. In North America, LuckyScent offers to make an appointment to get the same advice as in stores. ""These initiatives encourage concept stores to develop new analytical skills – and customer loyalty,"" explains François Hénin. Brands and major groups also take action. Puig multiplies innovative initiatives to re-enchant the shopping experience in stores. To comply with sanitary rules, the group developed a tool derived from Wikiparfum, AILICE, to be able to visualize a fragrance before smelling it thanks to a QR code on customers' smartphones. When scanning a perfume's bottle or packaging, AILICE automatically analyses the information and retrieves the relevant content in a perfume database (olfactory family, main ingredients, etc.). For now, this new technology has been deployed in Penhaligon's stores in the UK and Asia. In the same vein, Puig partnered with Air Parfum to devise a diffuser which perfectly renders the complexity of trails. Thanks to this tool, in summer 2020, they unveiled Paco Rabanne's PaCollection in ""3D"" at the Sephora store of the La Défense shopping mall, west of Paris. In South America, Natura recently fitted their stores with the MultiScent 20 scented tablets. This technology developed by Brazilian startup Noar is now brought to fragrance players and retailers all around the world by the Orlandi group. There is little doubt this type of technologies will soon become a perfume shopping basic. Perfectly aware of these stakes, the Paris PCD show organizers partnered with Coty to make the ESP and ESEPAC students work on innovative perfume testing solutions. Curator journals like Nez, websites and blogs specialized in perfumes, as well as boxes and sample sets are likely to get increasingly popular in terms of perfume discovery. Still, what impact will the context have on creation, but also on our relationship with perfumes, in the long run?"
Skincare trends: Blue-light protection and at-home treatments on the up,"In the space of a year, women's beauty concerns have been shaken up completely by the covid-19 pandemic, with mask wearing, the switch to home working and successive lockdowns. Right now, skincare is all about going back to basics, protecting skin from the harm it can face day to day, and deep treatments that don't involve leaving the house - no matter where in the world you may be. The blue light emitted by screens can be harmful for skin cell renewal, and can affect skin's natural radiance and accentuate wrinkles. So it's no surprise that internet users have been searching for skincare to combat this phenomenon. The global search platform Stylight notes a +136% increase in Google search interest for ""blue light skincare"" since the beginning of 2019, peaking at +336% in May 2020, during lockdown. [1] Faced with these gloomy times of lockdowns and face masks, internet users are also looking to boost their skin with products rich in vitamin C. On Stylight, clicks for the top vitamin C serums rose sharply (over 1,000%) in late 2020 to early 2021, compared to the same period last year. Another notable trend of early 2021 is at-home beauty treatments. While it's currently still possible, in some countries, to go to beauty salons for favorite treatments, consumers seem to be looking for home-based alternatives. As a result, chemical peels — which can be applied at home — are popular right now. According to Stylight, clicks on top BHA/AHA peels increased by over 1,000% at the end of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Similarly, eyebrow dyes and eyelash growth serums are gaining ground (+1,000%), showing growing uptake among some beauty fans for the kinds of treatments usually carried out by specialists in salons. Other top trends include celebrity skincare brands, which are still riding high. After bursting onto the scene a few years ago, this trend has gone from strength to strength, and the pandemic hasn't put paid to that. KORA Organics by Miranda Kerr (+485%), Fenty Skin by Rihanna (+300%) and Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty (+181%) are among the most popular brands. Note too, the growing popularity of pharmacy staples and newfound interest in age-old Ayurvedic wellness practices and tools — two trends to watch closely."
France: Sales of prestige cosmetics record unprecedented 20% fall,"According to The NPD Group, sales of prestige beauty products fell by 20% in France in 2020, under the impact of restrictions linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. Brick and mortar prestige beauty stores (perfumeries, department stores) recorded a 26% drop in sales. The main reasons are: three months of compulsory closure, curfews and travel restrictions. Of course, consumers often turned to e-commerce over the period. As a result, sales of prestige beauty products in the online channel rose 52% and e-commerce now account for 16% of prestige beauty sales in France (vs. 8% in 2019) However, the shift did not compensate all the losses of physical stores. According to The NPD Group it absorbed only 18% of the loss. In December, The NPD Group had already noted the resistance of the perfume category between January and the end of October 2020. Despite the second lockdown in November, the end of year celebrations boosted the category, with a 17% increase in perfume sales between November 30 and December 27, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, confirming how much prestige fragrances remain a popular Christmas gift in France. As a result, sales of prestige fragrances dropped 15% in 2020. For its part, the skincare category has experienced contrasting developments. The facials segment fell 25% in 2020. However, sales of acne and blemish products jumped 32% in value, in response to the new needs created by wearing masks. In contrast, prestige body care products gained over 1% market share, driven by the popularity of creams, lotions, and other body sprays used by consumers in their home spa routine. The makeup category suffered the most in 2020, with a drop of 35% compared to 2019. The reduction of social interactions, linked to the rise of teleworking and the growing popularity of the nude trend both contributed to lower the demand. The need to wear facial covering also had a huge impact on certain products. Sales of lipsticks, for instance, fell by 53%. In contrast to the general trend, the prestige haircare category recorded impressive growth in 2020, with sales rising 27%. However, this category is underdeveloped in the selective channel and sales are mostly made online (59%) where the offer is larger than in brick-and-mortar stores. This unprecedented decline is confirmed by Procos, the French federation of specialized retailers, whose panel recorded an 18% drop of beauty & health retails in 2020. For its part, the LVMH group announced a 22% drop in sales of its perfumes and cosmetics business. This situation could lead to a rapid repositioning of the major distribution chains. Germany-based retailer Douglas, for instance, announced its decision to close 62 stores in France, and around 500 in Europe, out of a total of 2,400 stores, in order to focus investments on digital sales."
Top 5 beauty predictions for 2021 (and beyond),"From transparency to radical traceability As trust is the new currency, safety and wellness become key; therefore, brands will need to explore radical traceability solutions. Transparency is a prerequisite of conscious consumption, and 2020 has reinforced the need to make a safe choice for anything applied on skin. Moreover, reaching global wellbeing implies ethical decisions, especially in luxury. IPSOS Luxury survey shows that 90% of the affluent Chinese expect brands to have an ethical/ecological commitment, and 88% expect them to respect animal wellbeing. More than words, consumers call for facts. According to the UEBT 2020 survey, consumers expect more information on packaging: 82% want to know the origin of ingredients, and 78% wish to know the social impact of sourcing local ingredients. In 2020, the discussion on ethical sourcing accelerated. In the USA, Beautycounter has made a massive communication on responsible sourcing, pointing out the ""clean"" origing of their Mica and the urgency to fight against hidden forced labor. British E-Retailer, Cult, has cooperated with the blockchain technology platform Provenance to collect information about the source, ingredients, craftsmanship, and requirements of its products, and then use evidence to prove the authenticity of this information From ""skinification"" to augmented ""healthification"" ""Skinification"" was the major trend in 2020, as consumers shifted from makeup to the ""pandemic-proof"" skincare market. But what 2020 has taught us is the importance of prevention for our health. According to Innova's Consumer Survey 2020, ""six out of ten global consumers are increasingly looking for F&B products that support their immune health. One in three says that concerns about immune health increased in 2020 over 2019"". Sales of vitamins, supplements, and even homeopathic remedies experienced unprecedented levels during the April coronavirus pandemic in the US. We have seen skincare transitioning to self-care, as consumers were spending more time at home. Interest in wellness has increased, and new brands are taking the stand to answer this new need. Disciple offers a holistic approach to stress-relief and answers to anxiety-related skin issues such as acne. The British wellness brand Nue Co. launched Forest Lungs, a fragrance ""supplement"" intended to ""deliver the healing effects of nature to the body [and] support the reduction of everyday stress."" From skintellectualization to ""Science Inside"" The ""skintellectualization"" of Beauty has emerged as a significant trend in 2020, propelled by Gen Z. Empowered by digital tools, these consumers are armed with in-depth Beauty knowledge and are now ""ingredient wizards"", even more attentive to INCI. Online, they are building a digital Beauty library, thanks to all the knowledge passed on forums and social media. Simultaneously, a new generation of influencers such as skincare guru Hyram in the US or Secret de Peau in France, deciphers every product. Ready to make the next leap, ingredient-focused brand Inkey List drives the trend with a pedagogical approach to imperfections, specific protocols, and a radical education of consumers. While recent years' fascination for mystical wellness was key, led by gurus such as Gwyneth Paltrow, we now see a renewed quest for scientific legitimacy. 2020 was the year of the emergence of scientific expert brands such as Dr. Barbara Sturm. From sustainability to eco celebration The recent sanitary crisis led to an acceleration of the expectation of consumers for purpose-driven and sustainable solutions. Mc Kinsey mentions ""sustainability first"", while 57% of consumers in Germany and the UK declared, ""they had made significant changes to their lifestyles to lessen their environmental impact."" From zero-waste dining restaurants, zero-waste design, second-hand fashion or trashion (fashion with trash), innovation with eco-friendly solutions have accelerated, pushing brands to rethink packaging, product-delivery system, and delivery. New refill solutions (ex Unilever, Clarins Eco-Bar, Shiseido) have propelled the concept of zero waste beyond Indie. In the USA, Clean retailer Credo has sped up their Clean 2.O philosophy prioritizing sustainability and a ban on in store single-use packaging. From lockdown beauty to unleashing freedom Lockdowns have transformed homes into safe life-spaces and wellness sanctuaries. This ""home-hubbing"" behavior created new needs, like self-care, intimate skincare, or the quest for minimalism. Lockdown was also an opportunity to self-experiment. Makeup became a powerful tool to fight boredom and fuel personal creativity. From maximalist nudes to extreme color payoffs, ""lockdown looks"", we witnessed the rise of highly creative looks shared on social media. Some 46% of women and 41% of men said they've spent more time on social media during the pandemic (Business.com). Instagram story, Tik Tok, and Twitch thus became the perfect platforms to boost self-expression, fight boredom, and seek inspiration. These platforms privilege movement, fun, freedom, far away from the lavish looks of Instagram and the hybridization of the virtual and real world. Shining example: the collaboration Travis Scott x Byredo gave birth to the Space Rage perfume, which encapsulates the essence of space to fly from home. The virtual gathering also increased to connect meaningfully, express creativity, and feel alive. Beauty brands surfed the trend: Morphe collaborated with the d'Amelio sisters on TikTok, and ELF created ASMR-like videos for their new Mint Collection. New into cosmetics market, Twitch might also impact the make-up market… The Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation, Consulting and forecasting agency, specialist of the beauty world, just launched its latest Inspiration Makeup USA trend book.

US consumers urgently demand wider diversity in haircare products,"Haircare brands need to make 2021 the year they step up and meet the untapped needs of those with non-straight textured hair. According to Mintel, the majority (56%) of US adults do not have straight hair texture, and when it comes to products available for consumers with wavy, curly, or coily textured hair, options are limited. ""Hair diversity needs to be a key focus for haircare brands in 2021. Despite the presence of Black-owned haircare brands targeting those with coily or curly hair, bigger brands have been slow to create products for this market and face difficulties with authenticity perceptions. Just as in skincare and color cosmetics, consumers are demanding a wider variety of haircare products for different hair textures,"" said Andrew McDougall, Global Beauty & Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Consumers have even stronger expectations as they do not feel confident with their hair skills. Most of them think they lack the advanced skills needed to recreate certain hair styles as well as a professional stylist. For instance, 68% of Black Americans describe their skill level at using hair products as ""basic"" or ""intermediate"". This compares to less than half (46%) who feel confident about their skills. According to Mintel, there is an opportunity for brands to help bridge the gap between skill and confidence when it comes to creating the right look. ""For many, hair is more than just a style statement, it is a key part of their identity. Brands need to recognize the specific needs of consumers with, for example, curly or Afro-textured hair and validate the motivation behind the look. In turn, they will become a trusted source to help consumers achieve their desired look,"" continued Andrew McDougall. During the pandemic, increased interest in overall wellbeing has led many consumers paying closer attention to their hair health as they opt for natural hairstyles and the products that support them. Indeed, one in three (34%) Brazilian women describe their current hairstyle as ""natural,"" i.e. without coloring or treatment, while almost nine in 10 (88%) Black American women think health is the ultimate beauty accessory. But more needs to be done here; curly- and coily-textured hair is very fragile and 58% of Black American women agree that not everyone can wear natural hairstyles as a result. ""One opportunity brands can act on now to help those with wavy or curly hair embrace a natural look is to stop the narrative that curly hair presents a problem. There are still issues around the stereotype that curly textures are 'difficult.' And while some brands are beginning to challenge this, more needs to be done to relieve the pressure women feel to constantly control their hair,"" concluded Andrew McDougall."
At home hair dyeing: A first for one in three US women during quarantine,"""With so many people turning to at-home hair color during the shutdown, we wanted to ensure they had somewhere to turn for help. We utilized our social channels to share tutorial content as well as details of Garnier's various educational tools, such as our Virtual Shade Selector. We want to continue to be a resource and provide info wherever someone may be searching for it,"" says Greg Hui, Senior Vice President of Marketing for Garnier USA. According to research, the average American woman feels that she has aged almost four years over the course of 2020 due to stress from the pandemic. This added stress manifested itself in many ways, including the appearance of new gray hair. – Nearly half of the women polled (42%) reported discovering new gray hair during quarantine. – With more than half of women (52.32%) agreeing that they have gone gray faster during quarantine than they would have otherwise. Half of the women surveyed (50.37%) reported that they dyed their hair during quarantine to cover up grays. Why and how women chose to color their hair at home during quarantine varied. – Respondents reported various reasons for coloring their hair at home during quarantine, including grown out roots (17.86%) and color fade (15.36%), One in five women also reported that they colored their hair during quarantine for some needed change. – Four out of five women dyed their hair themselves for the first-time during quarantine (80%). – Women turned to various sources to learn how to color their hair at home for the first time, including Instagram (30.49%), online websites (29.2%), and YouTube (23.5%). With quarantine lasting longer than many expected, women had to do their best to determine when and how often to color their hair at home. – Since the start of quarantine, more than half (88%) of women say they have dyed their hair at home multiple times (more than once). – Women were eager to maintain their color early into quarantine, with one in three women (31%) first dying their hair at home between 3 and 4 weeks at home, about a quarter (25.04%) first dying at 5 to 6 weeks in, and one-fifth (19.08%) of women holding out until 7 and 8 weeks. Oftentimes, the most difficult part of coloring hair at home is determining the right product. – Women used their time at home to try new products and shades they might not have otherwise. Nearly half of respondents (42.7%) reported trying a new brand of at-home hair dye than they have used before, and about a third of women (37.2%) reported that they tried a color that they might not have otherwise because they were at home. – Various factors are considered when deciding on what brand of hair color to use at home. First and foremost, nearly half of women considered the price and value of the brand (48.9%) followed by how long the color would last (44.5%). Next, about a third of women looked for brands with a large range in color options (39.5%), brands that would not damage their hair (36.4%), how available and easy it would be to get the product (34.6%) and the level of chemicals found in the formula (33.7%). – Women shared concerns about coloring hair at home for the first time. Nearly half of women shared concerns about if the end results would be as desired (47.8%) and if they were selecting the right shade (42.7%), while a third of women (33.6%) were concerned about damaging their hair. Quarantine has proven to be a time for experimentation among women as well, especially when it came to their hair color. – During quarantine, a quarter of women (25.54%) reported using a color care mask, and another quarter of women (24.44%) tried at-home hair color for the first time. About one-third of women reported dying their hair with bleach or going blonde. – Some experimented a bit more with daring shades. More than half (54.55%) of women who dyed their hair during quarantine decided to try a new, bold shade for the first time. – Respondents found inspiration from a number of people and places, including social media (30.4%) and celebrities (40.83%), while others (42.18%) reported utilizing the opportunity to try something new since they did not need to leave the house. – This unexpected opportunity to go bold may have even inspired some women to stick to their new, bold shades, with two-thirds (62.45%) of respondents reporting they would be likely to turn to a bold color again next year. With many women coloring their hair for the first time or reaching for shades outside of their typical choices during quarantine, it will be interesting to see how hair color behavior continues to shift once life returns to ""normal"" after quarantine. – Most respondents plan to keep their hair color more traditional shades, such as brown (25.27%), black (20.65%), blonde (10.98%), and red (8.76%). – More than two-thirds (66.75%) of women plan to continue to dye their hair at home, with one in three (31.99%) planning to exclusively color their hair at home."
Growth in natural personal care products market continues despite the pandemic,"Initially stemming from Europe and North America, consumer demand for natural and organic products has spread to every continent. The highest growth in the last decade has been in Asia, notes Ecovia Intelligence in the second edition of their report on The Global Market for Natural & Organic Personal Care Products [1]. Many Asian brands are launching natural and organic products to meet growing consumer appetite for 'clean beauty' products. China is now the largest market in Asia for this segment, in spite of it being boycotted by many ethical brands, due to the almost compulsory need for animal tests to import cosmetic products in the country. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the North American market the most, finds Ecovia Intelligence. Emergency measures introduced during lockdowns has led to the temporary closure of department stores, beauty retailers, as well as salons and spas. Such outlets generate over a third of natural and organic personal care product sales in the US and Canada. However, Natural food shops like Whole Foods Market and Natural Grocers generate most sales. The European market has also been adversely affected by the pandemic. Although many retailers and professional outlets have been temporarily closed during the pandemic, there has been an increase from specialist retailers, drugstores and pharmacies, and online retailers. The largest market remains Germany where natural and organic products now have 10 percent market share. Ecovia Intelligence finds the adoption rate of standards varies between regions. There are now over 30 standards for natural and organic personal care products. The highest number, as well as adoption rates, is in Europe. ""Over 70% of natural and organic personal care products are certified in Germany and France. COSMOS and Natrue are the most popular standards,"" says the market research firm. However, the adoption rates of standards are increasing in almost every region as they provide assurance to consumers that products do not contain contentious chemicals. In North America, sustainability schemes like Non-GMO Project are also gaining popularity."
Yves Rocher and The Body Shop are the most searched beauty brands on the web,"Launched in 2019, the 'Cosmetify Index' ranks the world's biggest beauty brands on factors such as their social reach and engagement as well as searches on the comparison platform and on the web. While Huda Beauty, Anastasia Beverly Hills and MAC Cosmetics continue to top the list of the global hottest brands, the pandemic has impacted the pandemic had a significant impact on the desirability of several brands compared to the last refresh of the Index, which came just as the coronavirus outbreak was taking hold. Five major factors were taken into account to reveal the 200 hottest beauty brands of 2020: increase in search interest as shown on Google Trends, overall brand searches each month, number of Instagram tags and followers, and the brand's 'engagement rate' on the social platform. Globally, the top 10 hottest brands in Q3 2020 are: 1. Huda Beauty 2. Anastasia Beverly Hills 3. MAC Cosmetics 4. The Body Shop 5. Florence by Mills 6. L'Oréal Paris 7. Yves Rocher 8. ColourPop Cosmetics 9. PÜR 10. Morphe The report also reveals every country's favourite beauty brand based on search volume. While in previous years, the picture has largely been dominated by Yves Rocher, this time around it was an even split between the French brand and The Body Shop, which were both the top brand in 31 different countries around the world. ColourPop was the favourite beauty brand of 2020 in the United States, while Glossier was at the top of the list in 2019. In Brazil, Foreo is the favourite of 2020, while it was Maybelline in 2019. France's 2020 favourite is Yves Rocher and UK's 2020 favourite is The Body Shop. Most Searched Brands of Q3 2020 1. The Body Shop 2. Yves Rocher 3. Lush 4. Rituals 5. ColourPop Cosmetics 6. Morphe 7. Olaplex 8. Clinique 9. Kiehl's 10. Estée Lauder The year has been tough for all kinds of industries, not just beauty, but searches for cosmetics have been down across the board. However, there are still some companies which have seen interest on the up in the last quarter and not only hygiene and health related names! PÜR Cosmetics saw an increase of 337.9% - the biggest spike in searches throughout Q3, while Kitsch, who are best known for their designer hair products, saw interest grow by more than double. Merci Handy, who had the biggest increase in popularity in the last edition of the index, is still benefitting from the current situation. Their colourful hand gels made using clean ingredients, have understandably been in high demand over the last couple of months. Huda Beauty remains by far the most followed beauty brand on Instagram. At the latest count, the brand had over 47.9 million followers, steadily closing in on the 50 million mark after adding around 4 million new followers since the last edition of the index. Once again, they're followed by Kylie Cosmetics (24.8 million) and M·A·C Cosmetics (23.4 million). Huda Beauty also takes the crown when it comes to the highest number of hashtag mentions on Instagram, with over 27 million people posting about Huda and her products. That's an increase of about 2 million from quarter 1. Anastasia Beverly Hills and M·A·C Cosmetics are ranked 2nd and 3rd, respectively. Read the full report: Cosmetify Index Q3 2020"
Pandemic lockdown fuels plastic surgery boom in Brazil,"Regiane de Oliveira Sousa, a 38-year-old sales representative from São Paulo, has used her stint of working from home to improve her personal beauty. Over the past six months she has had time to get cosmetic skin peels, breast reduction surgery, liposuction to remove unwanted fat, and facial harmonization treatment. ""Friends of mine have also taken advantage of teleworking to do these surgeries,"" she told AFP. ""When we stay at home, we have more time to look at ourselves in the mirror, because we no longer have this hectic life, where we move around constantly,"" said de Oliveira Sousa, who is about to receive a lip-plumping acid injection at a clinic in an upscale São Paulo neighborhood. Cost of the procedure: 3,800 reais (around $730), or almost four times the monthly minimum wage in Brazil. Her surgeon, Cintia Rios, said there has been a significant increase in cosmetic operations this year, about 40 percent more compared to what was done before the pandemic. ""I had to lengthen my work hours and I hired three employees. Beauty is not in crisis, thank God!"" According to Rios, otoplasties - cosmetic ear surgeries - are also popular because people feel that wearing a face mask makes their ears stick out. Usually such surgery is for children around the ages of eight or nine, ""but this year, many adults are doing it."" Lips are also important, adds de Oliveira Sousa, ""because during telework videoconferences we see each other permanently on the screen."" Rios's clinic was forced to close from March to May due to strict lockdown measures to control the spread of the coronavirus. Today, however, business at the clinic is booming. ""We had the impression that it was the end of the world,"" said orthodontist Thiago Aragaki, referring to the lockdown period. Aside from his dental work he performs simple cosmetic procedures, such as botox injections to eliminate wrinkles, at his office in a working class neighborhood east of São Paulo. ""We reopened in June, with all the necessary precautions. Some patients have stopped coming, but we've had new requests,"" especially for lip augmentation injections, he said. That's exactly what Rita Monteiro Meireles, 34, came to his office to do. She sees the confinement as a chance to use her savings to carry out cosmetic surgery enhancements that she has dreamed of since her divorce three years ago. ""I didn't like my face, and after getting a bichectomy (surgery to remove cheek fat) I was the happiest person in the world,"" she said. Monteiro Meireles smiled as she looked at her new face in a handheld mirror, her lips still swollen after the botox injection. Plastic surgery may serve as a palliative during times of anxiety and uncertainty, said Henriette Morato, a psychologist at the University of Sao Paulo. ""It's a way of demonstrating more control over your own life, to change what is still possible,"" she said. Even though some cosmetic surgery clinics have seen demand for their services increase, ""not everything is rose colored,"" said Denis Calazans, head of the Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgeons - especially because of the multi-week lockdown earlier in the year. ""It's an atypical year,"" he said. ""We should be showing figures lower than those before the pandemic"" for the entire sector, he said, even if clinics offering simple procedures have done well. Working at home and saving on money otherwise spent on travel or outings has allowed well-off Brazilians ""to invest in themselves,"" he said. Brazil is the world leader in plastic surgery procedures, with 13 percent of the global market, according to figures from the International Society of Plastic Surgery. But when all cosmetic procedures - including non-surgical procedures such as botox injections - are included, it comes in behind the United States."
Towards a return to basics for the world of beauty in 2021?,"2020 was the year beauty went natural, with makeup giving way to minimalist beauty looks. Out went foundation, lipstick and assorted highlighters, as lockdowns gave many people the chance to give their skin a break, to let it breathe, and to pamper it with self-care rituals. And it feels like there's no going back. So, the natural beauty trend seems to be here to stay in 2021. Tendrils of neon yellow, blue, pink or orange hair was supposed to be the major incoming hair trend of the year, seen over and again on the runways of fashion's four capitals, and adopted in advance by various models and influencers. But that was before covid-19 hit and the pandemic turned everything upside-down. When hair salons were forced to close in the springtime, people weren't panicking about a lack of neon hair dye, but simply the prospect of facing the dreaded ""badger stripe"" of gray roots that were sure to grow back during lockdown. From Europe to the USA, people flocked to the internet to seek advice on dealing with hair at home. In fact, Google's top trending ""beauty how-to"" searches in the US this year include ""How to cut men's hair at home"" and ""How to color your hair at home."" With tutorials, video calls and over-the-phone appointments, hairstylists went out of their way to help as many people as possible get stuck into home coloration. But, in the end, many people ultimately decided to go with the gray. Like Helen Mirren, Isabel Marant and Demi Moore, many women chose not to rush back to the salon when lockdown ended, transforming what the collective imagination once considered a ""flaw"" into a stylish feature. After making tentative inroads for a few seasons, the trend - which is in tune with the wider ""body positive"" movement - looks like it's here to stay. Makeup is the (beauty) segment that's been hit the hardest by covid-19. While lipstick, in various forms and evolving textures, remained popular in many regions in 2019, this year, consumers in many countries have completely turned away from it this year. With the mask a daily reality, lipstick seems to no longer be a beauty essential, with sales plummeting by as much as 50% year on year by mid-year in the US, down 49% between August and October in the UK, and lip makeup products plunging in the spring in Japan (down 22% in March). That proved a tough blow for brands, which had gone all out on dark shades and bold brights - from raspberry pink to deep plum and browns - as well as matte textures this year. It turned out to be a total flop total that no-one saw coming, and looks set to change the game for 2021. The same goes for facial makeup. In 2020, it was supposed to be all about glow, but, in the end, everything went minimalist. The multiple layers of foundation, highlighter and powder are gone - over - as people now look for a natural, healthy kind of glow, preferring to take care of their skin rather than try to hide imperfections. And with covid-19 putting us all in face masks, facial and lip makeup took a backseat while eyes moved center stage as the focus of attention. So while 2020 was supposed to big up bushy brows, women ultimately opted for perfectly groomed lines — a surprise trend that became (virtually) inevitable when face masks were made mandatory in public places in many global locations. Anti-pollution, anti-waste and natural personal care products were destined to be big news in 2020, according to the various predictions of industry players and search platforms. And, as it happens, they weren't entirely wrong. In terms of skincare, solid, natural, vegan and organic products gained further popularity this year. But in terms of trends, these were outstripped by maskne. Maskne (or mascne) - aka mask acne - burst onto the beauty scene in 2020 as a new term to describe the irritation, spots and other blemishes caused by wearing face masks. Without the global public health crisis, products for treating acne wouldn't have had such a bumper year. Internet searches about ""maskne"" saw a huge surge in June, up by as much as 811% and interest in premium solutions, including tools, among men and women has been registered in the US, India, France and other countries. And while maskne should logically disappear with the disappearance of face masks — unless we're destined to spend the rest of our lives hidden away behind facial protection — this perceived need to take care of our skin has nevertheless given rise to another new trend, dubbed ""skip-care."" Straight from South Korea, ""skip-care"" is all about ""skinimalism,"" stripping back beauty routines to the bare essentials to avoid endless layers of product. Put simply, it comes down to doing things better, differently and with less, letting skin breathe and getting back in touch with a more natural, more authentic kind of beauty. Probably one of the key beauty mantras as we head into 2021."
TikTok fuels Gen Z appetite for miracle beauty products and fragrance dupes,"While makeup has waned for many during the pandemic, ""miracle products"" - must-have beauty products that promise to zap wrinkles and blemishes in an instant - have been buzzing on TikTok, stirring up a real appetite for these seemingly ""revolutionary"" formulations. The Cicapair skincare line from Dr.Jart+ proved a particular hit this year. Certain products in the line promise to even out skin tone and immediately reduce inflammation and redness. These products, in particular, have been popular with Gen Z, with videos on the subject flourishing this year. Stylight confirms that clicks for the Dr.Jart+ brand grew over 1,000% in November on the platform, while Google searches for the terms ""Dr.Jart+ Cicapair"" were up 809% over the last two weeks of October. Other miracle products proving a hit with young people include the Revlon Pro Collection Salon One-Step hairdryer and volumizer, with Google search interest up 170% over the course of November 2020, and Gisou Hair Oil (+300% Google search interest over November 2020). Why buy a US$300 fragrance when you can pick up a dupe [1] for a fraction of the price? That's another key trend on Tiktok, where users share tips and tricks for finding low-cost scents that smell just like big-name fragrances. The Baccarat Rouge 540 fragrance from Maison Francis Kurkdjian, for instance, has been a hit on the web, with Google Trends reporting a 100% increase in searches over the course of November. But, according to Stylight, TikTok users discovered that the Cloud by Ariana Grande scent smells very similar, driving keen interest in the American singer's considerably cheaper fragrance, with Google search interest growing 213% over the course of November. In terms of skincare, TikTok users looked to natural ingredients, simplicity and cruelty-free formulations with enthusiasm for the brands CeraVe (1,000% more clicks for CeraVe products on Stylight in November 2020 vs 2019), The Ordinary (+407%) and Paula's Choice (+100%). The Stylight report is based on the platform's internal data collected from the 12 million monthly users across its international platforms. Clicks on different brands & product categories, over the period from November 1 to November 30, 2020, were analyzed and compared the results to the same period in 2019. Whenever the selected timeframe of analysis may refer to another period, or the data may originate from an external source, it was duly referenced in the body of the report."
France: Prestige fragrances prove more resilient to the crisis than makeup,"Sales of prestige fragrances were less impacted by the closure of beauty salons, perfumeries, and department stores than sales of prestige skincare and makeup, reports The NPD Group. With a turnover of 1.21 billion euros between January and the end of October 2020, the prestige fragrance market recorded a drop of 18% in value in France compared to the same period in 2019. A significant drop but lower than that of the overall prestige beauty market (-22%). Despite two compulsory lockdowns, French women did not give up their favourite fragrances as much as one might fear. However, prestige make-up and skin and body care products showed less resilience. According to The NPD Group, online stores have clearly driven sales in the fragrance category, this channel representing 13% of overall sales made between January and the end of October (compared to 7% in 2019). Over the first ten months of the year, online sales of high-end fragrances climbed 41%, a much stronger performance than the overall online prestige beauty market (+34%). Furthermore, online sales of have accelerated their growth at the end of the first lockdown. From August to October 2020, they grew by 46% in value, confirming increased consumer confidence when it is about to buy their favourite scent online. Perfume gift sets were particularly popular with the French with sales increasing by 98% compared to the same period a year earlier. ""During the recent months, brands and retailers have demonstrated their ability to adapt very fast and with agility by offering new ways to test perfumes at home and by developing online or phone advice, click-and-collect and live streaming solutions. Consumers are discovering new ways to shop, their habits are changing and we anticipate good performance in online sales during the 2020 holiday season, a trend that will continue in 2021,"" comments Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. Despite new services and the implementation of stringent sanitary measures, sales in brick-and-mortar stores were strongly impacted between August and October 2020, with a drop in sales of -9% compared to the same period in 2019."
Virtual stores: a relevant solution between physical and digital shopping,"A few days before the November lockdown in France, Clarins launched a first virtual store before spreading the concept across Asia and in Dubai. In just a few clicks, web users are immersed in the brand's world, surfing as they wish, just like they would in a physical store. ""With virtual stores, it is possible to create experiences much more focused on strolling and discovery than standard e-shop product displays. Users rediscover the pleasure of walking around, and there is a form of sensoriality, with a notion of volumes, textures, and materials. In addition, you get to be more active and satisfy your curiosity as you discover the store's different departments, just like in a shop,"" says Laure Braive, an independent consultant specialized in customer experience and marketing content. Just like with the brand's new flagship store in Neuilly-sur-Seine, west of Paris, the objective is indeed to highlight proximity by creating tailor-made user-friendly spaces. Clarins learnt from the pop-up store in which they invited customers to share expectations for this future store and new merchandising. Deploying this new concept in the virtual store before physical stores is also an opportunity to test it. One can discover the Skin Atelier, get informed about the ingredients used in Clarins formulas, by clicking on the plant wall, get a beauty consultation, test a lipstick in augmented reality, or purchase one of the brand's iconic products by directly connecting on the e-shop. Parfums Christian Dior has adopted the same concept with a virtual visit of the Champs-Élysées store, plus an access to product descriptions, links to the e-shop, and video content. ""For brands in general, it is also a way to make their world accessible to all. For Dior, it makes it possible for customers who could not visit it to discover the Parisian flagship store. Plus, it is a way to leave room for messages which cannot not always be passed on through physical retail, usually due to space efficiency issues, sustainable commitments, or the brand's heritage,"" adds Laure Braive. As regards personalization, the strategy adopted by Charlotte Tilbury is a reference: a large virtual discovery space in line with the brand's world, multiple meeting points where users can walk around, a welcoming message by the creator, which make the experience more human, makeup tests in augmented reality, and shopping directly on the website, without having to get on the e-shop. ""It more or less combines the best of the two worlds. Given the current situation, it is a concept that will definitely develop. It is in line with the whole virtual shopping renewal dynamics, which, through digital technologies, is aimed to get customers increasingly involved. Other trends are emerging, like Live Video Shopping, or one-to-one appointments on the phone or via videoconference. All these dimensions are reinventing e-commerce."" Charlotte Tilbury recently launched a video consultation campaign with the brand's makeup artists and consumers. In November, Clarins offered several consultation solutions by phone, for 15 or 20 minutes, with a personal shopper or a beauty coach. The pre-determined themes, ""A beautiful skin, even with a mask"", or ""It's all about my eyes"", and many others, resulted in free, personalized exchanges to guide customers and give them advice. ""It is really differentiating to mix virtual stores with personalized services. When you go shopping in a physical store, you also expect experts to give you advice. This is what remains to be developed in this concept,"" concludes Laure Braive."
Skinimalism and cocooning are going to be the biggest beauty trends in 2021,"Forget heavy foundation, contouring and other layers of product building up on the face: beauty in 2021 will be all about minimalism. It's basically a continuation of 2020, but without the constraints and the forced nature of this year's trends - i.e., face masks and lockdowns - or at least, we hope. Men and women look set to embrace the latest ""skip-care"" trend from South Korea, which involves limiting beauty routines to just a handful of products. It's simply about doing things better, differently and with less - letting skin breathe and returning to a more natural kind of beauty. This is one of the key trends of 2021 outlined in the annual Pinterest Predicts report, published Friday, December 11 by the image-based social media network. It reveals how web searches are now focusing on products and techniques that give a natural glow without going overboard. Year-on-year, searches for ""glowing skin how to get naturally"" have quadrupled, as have searches for ""face yoga exercises."" Web users have also been searching for ""homemade skin care"" (+110%) and for ""aloe vera face mask"" (+115%). The covid-19 pandemic - and especially the related lockdowns - has allowed many people to try out simple things entirely for their own personal well-being. And that's a trend that's set to continue in 2021, according to Pinterest. Bathing rituals, in particular, are having a moment as the new stay-at-home spa days, with an uptick in searches for ""spiritual cleansing bath"" (+180%), ""full moon bath ritual"" (+90%), not to mention ""bath tea recipe"" (+60%). The same goes for fashion, where cozy, protective, comfortable clothing looks set to ride high above more sophisticated designs. Year-on-year, searches for ""quilted clothes"" have quadrupled, while searches for ""cozy aesthetic outfits"" and ""home dress women"" have both doubled. Searches for ""cocoon sweater"" are also on the up (+155%), as well as ""fluffy slippers"" (+90%). Here too, the pandemic seems to have shaken up people's habits completely, with potentially long-term effects. Despite going back to basics and focusing on natural beauty, people could be tempted to add a bold touch to their day-to-day looks after such a morose year. In the beauty world, that could pave the way for bright colors and motifs on body parts like nails and eyes. According to Pinterest, searches for ""indie nails"" were up 21 times year-on-year, while ""smiley face nails"" were up nine times and ""butterfly eye makeup"" was up six times. It looks like brows are also going bold with standout styles like goth eyebrows (+120%) and bleached brows (+160%) proving popular. The Pinterest Predicts 2021 report is based on Pinterest internal data on global searches, comparing searches carried out between October 2018 and September 2019 to searches carried out between October 2019 and September 2020."
How did the Covid-19 pandemic change the Asia-Pacific beauty marketplace?,"The recently published Mintel's annual Asia Pacific: Beauty and Personal Landscape has focused on the evolution of consumer trends in the region and market opportunities for brands. ""The beauty and personal care industry in Asia Pacific has taken a hard hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumer attitudes and behaviours have shifted as a result and the industry has faced unprecedented challenges, but also opportunities. Innovation is also flourishing in the sector,"" said Angelia Teo, Research Manager, Mintel Beauty & Personal Care, Asia Pacific. Key highlights of the annual report include: Growing consumer interest in sustainability and health The outbreak of COVID-19 has further heightened consumers' awareness of sustainability and health. According to Mintel's Global COVID-19 Tracker, 87% of Indian consumers have indicated that environmental issues have become a higher or lower priority for them– second only to eating healthily. Meanwhile, Mintel Global Consumer research shows that 78% of South Korean consumers would like to see more innovative environment-friendly products, and 90% of consumers in Japan think it is important to manage their emotional wellbeing. ""Therefore, how to share and showcase sustainability initiatives and precisely respond to consumer's health needs is one of the most important factors for brands to engage consumers now and in the years to come,"" explained Mintel. Haircare, clean and green beauty drive innovation and new experiences Regardless of how the market changes, consumers are always ready to embrace new concepts and experience new products. China's haircare market has maintained steady growth over the past five years with a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8%, according to Mintel research. Haircare products' import value in the first half of the year increased 21%, compared with the same period the previous year. Interest in haircare is continuously growing among Chinese consumers, with many haircare brands taking inspiration from the skincare industry and innovating around textures and ingredients. Moreover, Mintel Global Consumer research indicates that 75% of consumers in Australia and New Zealand love trying new experiences. As competition for clean and green beauty continues to grow, especially from Western markets, ANZ beauty brands should work harder for their consumers and lean into expertise to stand out in the congested beauty market, rather than just focusing on clean or proving dermatological efficacy or safety.

"""The Travel Retail market will adjust"", David Dayan","Premium Beauty News - What can you say about the situation in travel retail? David Dayan - Before Covid, travel retail was a key driver for perfume and cosmetics luxury brands. This sector achieved two-digit growths for ten years and brands worked hard to be present in airports. Due to the sharp decline of air traffic, airport shops have lost between 75% and 85% of their turnover on average. I am still positive, I am sure we will recover: there are actually a few encouraging signs. But I think it will take five to ten years to reach the same results as in 2019. Our business segment is definitely capable of reacting increasingly faster when it comes to finding solutions and alternatives. We need to adjust. Premium Beauty News - How? David Dayan - We implemented solutions as soon as February 2020, such as the click&collect and call&collect options. Travellers can check on the Internet whether a product is available in our duty free stores, at the airport or in border shops in their destination countries. They only need to make an order on the phone or online. Then, before they fly or pass the border, they collect their shopping, which has been prepared and kept safe, and of course, they benefit from tax-free prices. We are also working with a few African governments to create specific collection points for duty free shopping upon arrival. Premium Beauty News - What is at stake in terms of sales? David Dayan - There are about ten operators around the world, the most well-known being Dufry, Heinemann and Lagardère, to name just a few. In airports, they take care of everything that is called ""non-air"" and purchase concessions over several years. Then, these concessions are turned into stores or restaurants. As an example, in Paris, in 2018, ""non-air"" revenues were higher than air revenues. Asians were quick to understand the craze for duty free shopping in these stores. The Beijing airport spreads across 300,000 m2, including a 200,000 m2 area occupied by stores and restaurants. Likewise, governments have understood it is profitable to open downtown duty free stores for tourists. To give you a concrete example, a month ago, during the Golden Week on the duty free island of Sanya, in southern China, travellers bought for more than 1.2 billion USD in this type of store! How come? First, there are no taxes. Secondly, consumers are sure the product is authentic – there are many counterfeit products on these markets. Then, foreign currencies are used. And lastly, with Travel Retail Exclusives, there are products or offers you can only find in airports or downtown duty free stores. Of course, the same goes for Africa. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how big is the Duty Free market in Africa? David Dayan - Over the past ten years, many African countries have managed to develop and highlight their own specificities to attract tourists. Rwanda is an eco-destination, Tanzania and Mozambique focused on safaris, and Western Africa chose seaside tourism. The most prominent airlines started signing agreements with these countries, like Emirates Airlines, which now serves over 60 countries in Africa. Many African airports are equivalent to European airports in terms of infrastructures and service quality. They are often the most beautiful places to buy luxury products. Between 2018 and 2020, about 15 new airports were opened in Africa. Three quarters of them were built by Chinese companies, which triggered a flow of Asian tourists, whose share rose from 12% to 18% in ten years. The brands that outsource distribution to Beauté Luxe – Puig, L'Oréal, including Lancôme and Yves Saint Laurent, Hermès, and many others – are guaranteed that their price, merchandising, and image guidelines will be complied with. But our role also consists in animating this network, choosing the best spots, creating attractive shop windows, making promotional offers, playing with podiums and exclusivities, and regularly visiting points of sale. This field work is done by our teams on a daily basis. Premium Beauty News - Do you think the beauty market will do well on this continent? David Dayan - African markets used to lag behind in many fields, but many countries managed to catch up. Wages increased by over 20% in Africa, and beauty is one of the largest items of expenditure for African women. The future is bright."
Could smart mirrors transform the post-pandemic shopping experience?,"While Japanese manufacturer AGC recently introduced a smart mirror that can help users try out makeup virtually while also getting expert advice from beauty pros, will these tools will these tools become more common in beauty shops in the wake of new hygiene requirements linked to the Covid-19 pandemic? When implemented in an outlet, this kind of innovation allows virtual product testing and could help limit physical contact while renewing the shopping experience. In the age of social distancing, brands and manufacturers of all kinds have been getting creative to develop tools that bring the services customers used to enjoy in stores into people's homes. As a result, the beauty world has flourished with a host of applications dedicated entirely to hair colouring or virtual makeup, offering a helping hand to those who haven't been able to test products in real life during covid-19 lockdowns. Beyond makeup and skincare, new digital solutions are also making their way in the world of perfumes. The Multiscent20 solution from the Brazilian start-up Noar, for instance, has been implemented by Natura in their new phygital concept store in São Paulo and is now marketed worldwide by Orlandi. Whether it's Meitu's Magic Mirror or the YouCam virtual reality solutions developed by Perfect Corp, virtual testing is already well established in the makeup world. Now, the Japanese manufacturer AGC is going even further with a new smart mirror that could be used to transform the shopping experience in department stores or standalone beauty stores. The device, called Mirroria, uses artificial intelligence to bring users virtual advice from beauty pros. It takes the form of a classic mirror placed on top of a built-in monitor, using an optical technology to create a mirror that doesn't require metal film. This is what makes Mirroria different from other smart mirrors, an AGC official told Nikkei Asia, and this apparently improves image sharpness both on the mirror and on the screen. When used with specific applications, the mirror also lets users try out all kinds of makeup to see the results virtually before making a purchase. According to the Japanese business publication, this innovation - designed to limit face-to-face contact with in-store beauty advisors in pandemic times - is expected to go on sale from the first half of 2021. The market for smart mirrors is currently booming and is expected to achieve a compound annual growth rate of between 12% and 14% by 2025, according to several analysts. In any case, these devices look set to soon join the wealth of beauty innovations available in stores, especially since their potential field of application is very wide. Based on the innovations presented at the latest CES in Las Vegas, in 2019 and 2020, as well as makeup, smart mirrors could be used to help customers make choices on hair colors, contact lenses, or even tattoos."
Top six beauty trends spotted at Cosmoprof Asia Digital Week,"With more time spent at home, consumers are indulging in, and mastering, beauty treatments enhanced by the latest augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including devices complemented by virtual consultations and personalised data. The A.I. Vibration Therapy by Waveon (South Korea) features AI-enabled vibration massage with multi-functions to deliver moisture and nutrients deep into the skin. Users can carry out their entire skin care routine with it, from cleansing to prepping the skin, reducing pore size and preventing moisture loss. Meanwhile, the AR Beauty Mirror Solution by Frontis (South Korea) allows consumers to consult for skin problems and obtain recommendations on skincare products via skin analysis, AR and AI chatbot; while the Laser Hair Growth Comb by Zhongshan Cenci Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (China) uses high frequency vibration to massage the scalp and infrared light to promote hair growth. Many products claim ingredients and products unique to particular regions and bearing certifications attesting to their authenticity, in support of local economies and celebrating uniqueness globally. The Waphyto Regena Toner by St. Louis International, Inc. (Japan) is a rich moisturising lotion made from five natural ingredients, namely mulberry, Japanese calendula, gotu kola, mugwort and horsetail, grown in the Mikawa region in Central Japan. Meanwhile, the Luxom collection by OMECS Cosmetic & Surgery (Italy) revitalises and purifies the skin, thanks to its hero ingredient, the Sicilian saffron flower. KH Bio Gentle Shampoo by SOCO (Italy) contains pomegranate centrifugate rich in vitamins, polyphenols and antioxidants for hello to silky smooth hair. Physio Natura Perse - Breast Emulgel by PDT Cosmetici (Italy) is designed to improve breast tone and volume with a formula that contains hexapeptide-38, cyclodextrins, and African Kigella extract which protects capillaries, improves microcirculation and prevents skin sagging. This year, brands are taking hygiene to the next level of sophistication through innovative products that do more than simply banishing germs. They include self-cleaning packaging and multitasking products such as gels, mists, lotions and nail polish that nourish the skin while guarding against germs. The UVC Disinfection Case by Belle Cosmic Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Hong Kong SAR, China) is a portable, UV disinfecting case that kills 99 percent of bacteria, viruses, and mould on items that are placed inside it. The case provides an ideal way to sterilize objects while travelling as no chemicals, liquid or heat are needed. Another illustration of the trend is the Sanitizing Hand Cream by Farmaceutici Dott. Ciccarelli (Italy) that prevents skin dryness, redness and chapping due to frequent use of alcohol-based products by nourishing and protecting the skin barrier. In addition, the product contains tea tree oil which is known for its antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. Eventually, the Wellfare Hand Serum Moisturizing & Sanitizing by Universal Beauty Products (Italy) is a hand serum that nourishes the skin while delivering purifying and sanitizing benefits. Thanks to Active Oxygen in its formula, the serum is as potent as a hand gel that delivers 70 percent alcohol. New discoveries and advancement in science has made possible the creation of novel skincare and cosmetic products with enhanced absorption, efficacy and safety, as well as multiple functions. For example, the Lyophilized Double Effect Eye Mask by Changzhou Weibo Hi-Tech Biotechnology Co., Ltd (China) is created using the isol® cream freeze-drying technology which promotes transdermal absorption and potency of ingredients. Meanwhile, the W.Skin Laboratory A.M. (Anti-Melasma) Cream by J&J Company (South Korea) is a multi-cream that addresses freckles, wrinkles, pigment, skin tone, and dark circles. The product has undergone 10 different clinical testing and contains EWG green level ingredients. Face-lifting device Homethera by Attibe Beauty Co., Ltd (South Korea) features high- intensity focused ultrasound technology that promotes skin regeneration through stimulating collagen and elastin production, enabling professional face treatments to be experienced at home. Powerhouse ingredients from nature are satisfying the demand for efficacious, environmentally friendly, plant-based formulas that enhances health and boost immunity. For instance, Green For Skin by Floslek Cosmetic Laboratory (Poland) is a line of eco-friendly cosmetics with replaceable refills that are 100 percent recyclable. This vegan skincare line contains a variety of vegetables including parsley extract, cucumber extract, celery seed extract and pea extract to provide deep hydration to the skin and render it naturally beautiful. The ION Intensive Reducer Set by 01Skin Digital (Spain) features iontophoresis technology patches that are patented worldwide, and a nutricosmetic shot containing natural ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, Centella Asiatica, green coffee and horsetail. The iontophoresis technology enables the ingredients to penetrate into the deepest layers of the skin where fat is localized. According to the company, clinical studies demonstrate that cellulite can be reduced by 80 percent over the course of two months. Skincare gems under this section are the Superfood For Skin Pink Vera Soothing Cream by Farmskin Inc. (South Korea), which moisturises, and soothes irritated skin; Truly Nourishing Ginseng With Honey by Back At One (South Korea), which helps to restore skin radiance and clarity; Anti-Age Elixir Restorative Night Serum Bakuchiol & Avocado by OnlyBio.life (Poland), which accelerates skin repair and increases skin firmness; and The Youth Lift Express Mask by Pollen Botanicals (Australia), which lifts the skin and smooths out fine lines in only 10 minutes thanks to its content of hyaluronic acid, bentonite clay and organic herbal extracts. The use of face masks has dramatically impacted beauty routines leading to the development of transfer-resistant colour cosmetics and specially formulated skin care products that address mask irritation. The Art Complexion No Transfer Wet Compact Foundation by B.Kolormakeup & Skincare is a new-generation hybrid powder made with a clean, vegan formulation that achieves zero transfer when used wet, while providing optimal adhesion, lightness and long- lastingness. Its hybrid technology delivers a bouncy consistency and velvety touch to the skin. Enriched with hyaluronic acid microspheres, Art Cosmetics (Italy)'s Lady Vain No- Transfer LS is a long-lasting and no-transfer blurring matte lipstick that creates a soft focus and a faded make-up effect. An external lab test showed that the product does not fade or release its colours on masks.

"Online beauty purchases are appealing, under certain conditions","This survey was conducted among 2,000 British and American consumers aged between 16 and 35 [1], generations Y and Z indeed. The report shows that 44% of respondents bought more beauty and skincare products online than in store over the past six months, compared to the pre-lockdown period. However, 56% of total consumers (62% of female respondents) acknowledged turning to familiar products and brands rather than trying new ones when buying online. ""In an industry that prides itself on face-to-face interactions - from personalized consultations to in-store product sampling - the shift to digital experiences could signal growth challenges for Beauty and Skincare brands,"" write the authors of the report. Indeed, before choosing the perfect shade for their skin tone, buying the cream that best suits their needs, or making sure that a serum is effective, consumers look for more guarantee and advice and need reassurance. The e-commerce shopping experience totally is different from the in-store experience. The report shows that a vast majority of consumers (74%) are more likely to buy online when the website includes customer reviews, which is often the case. Female buyers are even more likely to consult customer opinions (80%) than men. When physical stores closed due to pandemic restrictions, brands and retailers therefore have had to be even more inventive, to make their e-shops more attractive and allow consumers to shop with confidence. There are many factors that can convince internet users to click buy. For instance, receiving free samples of the product to try before purchasing it motivates 72% of respondents; 66% of those surveyed are likely to buy if the site personalizes product recommendations based on the client's searches. The use of virtual reality or artificial intelligence tools that let shoppers 'try-on' a product also encourages 45% of users surveyed. While the covid-19 pandemic encouraged consumers to go digital, it has also made consumers think about how they consume. In the past few months, many studies have shown increasing interest in sustainable and ethical products in every sector. The Nosto report shows that the words ""clean"" (68%) and ""cruelty free"" (65%) drive online sales. However, the term ""vegan"" applied to skincare spurs sales to a lesser extent (41%)."
"In 2020, beauty is more digital, more hygiene-focused and at home","""While some of the more extreme limitations on everyday life seen in 2020 may be rare occurrences going forward, there is no doubt that many aspects of consumer behaviour have shifted for the long-term,"" writes Lisa Holmes, Global Consumer Insights Expert at Euromonitor, in the market research firm's Beauty Survey 2020 report. Euromonitor sums up the shifts into three key trends: the rise of online beauty among consumers' habits, the importance of personal hygiene, especially for hand hygiene, and the rise of the time dedicated to at-home treatments and indulgences. 2020 has been characterised by a rapid shift to online shopping. According to findings from Euromonitor's annual beauty survey - fielded in June and July 2020 - 34% of consumers can now be considered ""digital beauty"" shoppers, meaning that they purchase hair, skin or colour cosmetic products through online retailers and are influenced by digital media, online user-generated, or expert-generated content when shopping for or using beauty and personal care products. One the main consequence of the pandemic is that beauty consumers are growing more comfortable buying skin care, hair care and cosmetics without first testing or examining them in person. E-commerce developments have also helped brands gain access to new markets, thus increasing the competition between heritage and emerging brands. Indeed, online platforms are creating a common digital shelf where global, local, private label and independent brands all compete for consumer attention and spending. While hand washing and sanitising have always played a large role in the daily hygiene habits for most consumers, these habits have been magnified in 2020. Euromonitor's beauty survey findings show that nearly all consumers (93%) wash their hands at least twice a day and over half of them do so five or more times. Use rates vary by age group, with the youngest washing their hands less frequently. They also depend on product categories, with alcohol-based disinfectants being especially popular outside the home. Furthermore, the renewed focus on hand hygiene among global consumers fuelled increased needs for hand care products, particularly lotion and creams to heal dry or chapped skin caused by frequent washing. ""For many consumers in 2020, focus has shifted from out-of-home treats such as salon visits, to 'self-care' activities that can be done from the comfort and safety of home,"" writes Lisa Holmes. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, many factors have driven the growth of self-care at home: hair salons and beauty parlours closed, concerns about contamination risks, more time available, need to save money. ""Even indulgences such as spa treatments have shifted to home environments in 2020. Self-care in the beauty and personal care space is now frequently associated with activities such as hot baths, home manicure and pedicures and self-applied face masks,"" adds Holmes. Euromonitor's data show that over half of women (55%) paint their nails monthly as a minimum, and that nearly two-thirds of women and one-third of men apply a face mask at home at least monthly. The most common types of at-home face masks are cream-based, gel and peel-offs, though sheet masks have consistently grown in popularity over the past five years. ""In 2015 only 22% of face mask users turned to sheet masks, which jumped to 27% in 2017 and now stands at 35% in 2020,"" highlights Holmes. Even when consumers venture back into salons and spas, at-home self-care habits will persist, forecasts Euromonitor. Indeed, many consumers now seek lower-cost and more convenient options for indulgence. Read the full report here."
"U.S. beauty market to surpass $128.7 billion by 2030, finds P&S Intelligence","According to P&S Intelligence, there were 312.3 million internet users in the U.S. in 2019 and e-commerce accounted for 16.0% of all retail sales in the nation. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, these numbers were consistently increasing. ""The growing e-commerce industry bodes well for the U.S. beauty and personal care products market, as fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs), including beauty products, are some of the most-purchased commodities via online platforms,"" explains P&S Intelligence. Actually, a wide variety of beauty products, including clean beauty products and hyper-personalized skincare products, is available online at reasonable rates and, sometimes, at substantial discounts. This abundant offer has helped increase their penetration in the country, according to P&S Intelligence. Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a negative impact on the market. ""Sales of actual beauty products have reduced due to subdued manufacturing and supply, lower wages, and widespread unemployment,"" explains the market research firm. For instance, L'Oréal has recorded 4.8% lower sales in North America during the pandemic. However, not every section in the market has reported disappointing statistics. The demand for toiletries, including soaps and sanitizers, has soared in the country, as regular washing of hands is being considered one of the best ways to protect oneself against the virus. Furthermore, as stores were closed, the sales from online channels have increased. According to P&S Intelligence, the cotinuous growth of on-line sales is one of the primary reasons the U.S. beauty and personal care products market is set to grow from $81.1 billion in 2019 to $128.7 billion in 2030, at a steady 4.8% CAGR during 2020-2030. In the coming years, the U.S. beauty and personal care products market is predicted to witness the most-rapid advance in the click & collect category, under segmentation by mode of purchase. In this mode, people pay for the products online and then collect them from a designated store. ""This mode saves the time of people otherwise spent in long queues at hypermarkets,"" highlights the market research firm."
"""Sustainability is the post-COVID era's key challenge"", finds industry summit","Seventeen national beauty associations and fifteen trade organizations participated in the first Opeanstreams Global Beauty Industry Summit, hosted by the Openstreams Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to education and collaboration in the global beauty sector, created by beauty trend platform Beautystreams. Originally slated to take place at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the event included video interviews and a lived Q&A session. ""By understanding the industry's current challenges, we can better determine which key topics to focus on globally. We hope that by openly sharing ideas, perspectives, and priorities, we can create an ongoing movement towards positive change and collaboration,"" said Lan Vu, founder and CEO of Beautystreams and the Openstreams Foundation. The future of retail was one of the first topic emerging from the discussions. The pandemic has dealt retail a severe blow this year, with consumers dialing back their spending across all product categories and expressing a marked preference for online shopping. Kunto Widarto, of the Indonesian beauty association PERKOSMI and senior executive at the Martha Tilaar Group, said the pandemic ""basically changes everything, with a significant decrease in the overall market spending and consumption, especially for color cosmetics."" Participants discussed the substitution of in-store interaction with personalized virtual appointments, as well as brands' development of experiential content through livestreaming, and the need to reassure shoppers by boosting safety precautions in stores. Deeply impacted by the pandemic, trade shows are also focused on further developing their digital experience. Enrico Zannini, Show Director of Cosmoprof Bologna, remarked ""It is important to re-invent our activity, in order to better support the industry in a global restart. Digital tools and new technologies can be helpful to improve the experience of operators and exhibitors."" Many participants questioned the future of in-person events at a time when much of the world is masked and working remotely, while acknowledging that trade shows offer tangible benefits. ""We recently conducted a survey of more than 4,000 professionals which explored the impact of COVID-19 on the exhibitions industry. More than two-thirds of respondents said that in a post-pandemic world, the face-to- face interaction that can only be had at physical shows will be just as, or more important than pre-COVID-19,"" said Elaine O'Connell, Show Director at Beautyworld Middle East. Participants also highlighted the urgency surrounding sustainable industry practices, spurred by an increase in environmental activism worldwide - a trend that the pandemic has further accentuated. Consumers are rewarding businesses with a more explicitly ""purpose over profit"" model, while companies are working to reduce excess packaging, avoid unethical ingredients and overcome the longstanding notion that environmental-friendly products are necessarily more expensive. ""Investing in sustainability in the context with which we are living can benefit the company both in terms of revenue and reputation,"" said Renato Ancorotti, President of Cosmetica Italia. Carlotta Jacobson, President of CEW in the USA, noted the evolution of the clean product trend towards product safety. ""When you go through a pandemic, naturally you place importance on what's safe."" However, she emphasized the need for clear communications, ""there is a lot of misinformation and a lot of women are very confused about it."" Christophe Masson, CEO of France's Cosmetic Valley, described a nascent awareness among consumers of the relationship between cosmetics and biodiversity, which he suggested the industry should promote. Patrick O'Quin, President of FEBEA in France, agreed. ""The crisis shows that we need to think differently. And thinking differently means certainly to have a broader vision of sustainability, and of biodiversity,"" which has often garnered less attention than developing a circular economy or reducing humans' carbon footprint. Indirectly related, but affecting sustainability, is how companies have changed office policy, allowing employees to work from home temporarily or permanently. ""We've already seen, for example, just the stay-at-home orders that have taken place around the world have resulted in better air quality in many cities, and this is a reminder that our transition to a low-carbon economy could have many public health benefits, including cleaner air,"" observed Francine Lamoriello, EVP Global Strategies for the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) in the United States. And on the COVID-19 crisis, Matteo Moretti, President of Polo della Cosmesi in Italy, conveyed a positive perspective, ""I believe with every difficult period, there are also unique opportunities."" The success of the first Openstreams Global Beauty Summit has led organizers to cast their eyes toward a second event in 2021. ""It quickly became apparent that there was a lot of desire for this kind of dialogue in the industry,"" said Lan Vu. On November 25, the Openstreams Foundation will release the Openstreams Global Beauty Industry Summit Official Report 2020, a compendium of key insights from the first Summit, as well as the results of an exclusive survey of individual professionals from throughout the beauty supply chain. The report will be complimentary to all beauty industry professionals worldwide."
China's biggest spending spree under close scrutiny,"The marathon spending spree has for more than a decade seen China's army of shoppers shell out colossal amounts of cash that has dwarfed the incomes of many small nations. And this year was no exception. While ""Single's Day"" - so-called for its annual 11.11 date - has long-been a 24-hour event, e-commerce giant Alibaba - which created the event in 2009 before being imitated by all of its competitors, including JD.com and Pinduoduo - has expanded it to an 11-day promotion beginning November 1. According to Alibaba, as of Tuesday night, the group's platforms had already processed 372.3 billion yuan ($56.5 billion) in sales over that period, more than the GDP of Iceland, Lebanon and Georgia combined. This year's shopping is being closely followed around the world as a guide to the state of China's crucial consumer sector, which is increasingly more important to the future of the world's biggest economy. To date, Alibaba has not provided a comparison with last year's sales, while many economists hoped to read these figures as confirmation of the recovery of the Chinese economy after the shutdown suffered in beginning of the year due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Last year, ""Single's Day"" sales on Alibaba platforms alone for the 24-hour period totalled $38.4 billion, a rise of 26% compared to the previous year. ""Single's Day originally focused on sales of certain items like beauty products and electronics,"" said Melanie Sanders, Asia-Pacific head of retail for consultancy Bain & Company. ""But e-commerce in China has expanded to include just about anything a consumer might purchase, including groceries, as digitally savvy Chinese opt for the convenience of online shopping. The pandemic, which has made many Chinese wary of crowds, is furthering this trend,"" she said. ""We're expecting it to be another very, very strong year, another record,"" Sanders said. ""Retail in China is largely getting back now to last year's levels."" As the country emerges from the effects of the virus and tight lockdowns, China is expected to be the only major global economy to post positive growth this year, according to the IMF. However, the recovery in retail sales has lagged that seen in industrial sectors, but is gaining pace, analysts said. As Alibaba, JD.com, and Pinduoduo compete aggressively for Single's Day, Chinese regulators cast a gloom over the biggest e-commerce stretch of the year by announcing draft antitrust rules that signal a looming crackdown on high-flying internet giants. The texts published on Tuesday outlined plans to prevent ""monopolistic behaviour"" among internet companies, which tend to develop captive ecosystems. Alibaba's Taobao platform, for example, supports payments via its own Alipay rather, but not the WeChat Pay technology of rival Tencent. Chinese tech shares tumbled for a second day Wednesday. Alibaba shed more than eight percent in Hong Kong - just a week after regulators halted an enormous IPO by its Ant Group financial arm - and rival JD.com fell a similar amount."
Holistic beauty and e-commerce redefine post-COVID Asia beauty markets,"In Asia, the personal care sector has rebounded relatively quickly following the height of the pandemic. In China, before COVID-19 hit, the personal care market was forecast to grow 9% in 2020, but is now on track for a -5% decline. In South Korea, the market should shrink by -8%, compared with expected growth of 4.8%. The impact has been lower in Thailand, where the sector was expected to remain flat, but has declined by -2.1%, according to Kantar. However, according to Kantar, COVID-19 pressed 'fast forward' on developments that were expected to take five years to unroll. Increased concerns around health have changed consumers' expectations of beauty: they expect brands to help them feel and live better, not just look better. Priorities have shifted from fixing issues - such as erasing wrinkles - to building a strong foundation. ""Consumers want personal care products to be highly effective, and offer more sophisticated functions,"" says Ashley Kang, Head of Beauty, Kantar Worldpanel. ""Already gaining in popularity before the outbreak, derma-care products have gained further traction, and the trend is spilling over from skincare into body care and make-up. The leading country for derma is Korea, with 56% penetration."" Clean beauty has also risen in importance, with brands expected to be safe and environmentally responsible. Consumers are looking for natural, gentle and vegan ingredients. Restrictions on physical movement have forced a shift in spend from offline to online platforms. Kantar does not expects Asian consumers to move away from online channels now they're able to visit stores again, as they've 'tasted' advantages such as convenience, greater accessibility and lower prices. Offline channels remain important, however - in Thailand, offline traffic is still 19 times higher than online traffic - and this channel is recovering, albeit slowly. In markets where ecommerce is more mature, whereas shoppers once used one or two platforms for their beauty purchases, the landscape is diversifying with different platforms catering for different shopping missions. According to Kantar, the rapid development of ecommerce has given smaller brands greater reach, and helped them gain traction. These include local brands, which have excelled due to being 'ecommerce ready', combined with their understanding of local consumers' needs: 70% of China's top growing cosmetics brands are domestic in origin. With the pandemic hitting incomes hard, most Asian consumers are paying more attention to getting maximum value for their personal care spend. ""This doesn't mean they'll go for the cheapest option, however; they evaluate their choices based on benefits,"" highlights Kantar. Whereas premium beauty was on the rise before coronavirus, mass and masstige brands are now growing their market share. However, despite increased price sensitivity, demand for luxury has remained strong in some markets due to the fact that ""the highest income consumers have been least affected by COVID-19""."
Towards a new idea of luxury perfumes?,"The tone had been set by initiatives like Michelle Pfeiffer's brand Henry Rose, a pioneer as regards ingredient transparency, recycled glass bottles, and cradle-to-cradle-certified formulas, and by pH Fragrance, who developed the clean perfumery concept in France. More recently, CK Everyone and My Way by Armani also left their marks on people's minds with ethical concepts involving natural ingredients, refillable bottles, and quantified and quantifiable targets about the product's impact. These examples show that perfumery is gradually adopting a new form of creation better in line with the market's ecoresponsible trends. As an example, three new high-end brands are emerging this fall, and they have a common point: a global strategy for improving the environmental impact of both their juices and containers, including samples. Aemium, Nout, and Obvious have reshaped perfumery to make it match a new idea of luxury. Born from Emmanuel Roche's motivation and the talent of two perfumers at Maison Robertet, Karine Vinchon Spehner and Serge De Oliveira, Aemium has developed a range of high-end perfumes certified natural or organic by Ecocert/Cosmos and containing over 99.9% natural ingredients. They are composed of 13% to 17% 100% natural perfume extracts made in Grasse, 74% organic wheat alcohol, some water, and vitamin E derived from French sunflower to protect formulas from oxidation. The bottles, whose elegance is inspired from old perfumery, are based on lightened glass and are refillable – and recyclable, of course. The caps are made of aluminium with no plastic insert, so they can also be recycled. Secondary cases traditionally made of cardboard filled with Cellophane were replaced with light wooden boxes derived from poplar groves located in France. Plastic is even banned in sample caps, which are made of cork. The whole range is made in France. It consists of seven unisex 100 ml fragrances and of a discovery box containing the samples. It offers uncommon original notes – liquorice, almond, pink pepper – and a few bold combinations. The perfumes are available on the online shop, and will soon be in alternative perfume shops for EUR 137 (100 ml bottles). David Frossard had already created Différentes Latitudes, which launched some of the greatest alternative perfume brands in the 2000s, founded the Liquides perfume bar, and co-founded the brand Liquides Imaginaires. This time, he wanted to provide perfumes with a new vision of olfactory luxury. To him, conveying respect for the living with a range was just obvious. Here, the juices created by Amélie Bourgeois and Anne-Sophie Behaghel, of Flair Paris, are mostly short, natural formulas with an organic alcohol base. They do not demonize synthesis, provided it is clean. The bottle is made of partly recycled glass with an unscrewable pump for recycling, the cap is made of cork (from offcuts derived from cap productions, and it has no plastic insert, so it can be recycled), serigraphy is based on resin free from any volatile organic compound (VOC), and the case is made of FSC-certified cellophane-free paper. The range counts seven 100 ml fragrances sold for the recommended retail price of EUR 110 at Liquides and at the Bon Marché department store. Using her ecological awareness and taste for beautiful things, Laurence Lecoq, Nout's founder, created a range of six luxury Eaux de parfum whose organic and vegan, Cosmos Organic-certified formulas are claimed to be ethically, ecoconsciously sensorial. Composed by nose Laure Jacquet, of Robertet, the juices only contain natural and organic ingredients derived from ethical sourcing to obtain formulas concentrated in essential oils, isolates, and organic wheat alcohol. The white glass bottles are topped with an SFC/PEFC-certified wooden cap derived from sustainably managed French forests. The whole product can be recycled and is showcased in a pouch made of unbleached, organic recycled cotton. Here, again, remanence and bold notes are very subtle so they can compete with conventional perfumes with powerful base notes, like cedar, patchouli, tonka bean, and benzoin. Nout perfumes are available on the e-shop and will soon be in a selection of perfume shops, for EUR 155 or EUR 165. These three new approaches to perfume do present a few variants, but they are all mainly focused on respect, without compromising on an exceptional trail."
"USA: Professional hair products sales almost recovered 2019 level, found Kline","Professional hair product sales in June 2020 were 98% of the same month totals a year ago, according to the most recent findings from Kline PRO, Kline's salon retail products and services database. In fact, shampoos and conditioners were ahead of last year at +6% and +12%, respectively. According to Kline, this is welcome news for an industry that had a nearly complete shutdown from mid-March through most of May. While it is not business as usual quite yet, the data are revealing the types of products and services that have the best performance compared to pre-COVID times. Hair care products that provide color care benefits have always had the highest category share but saw a bump in the second quarter to 34.0% of the market, peaking in April at 43.7%. Since most salon doors were shuttered at this time, ordering online and curbside pickup from salons became a lifeline. Data shows that kits and multipacks of items for color care surged in this timeframe to 134% over YAG [1] as stockpiling products became a reality. Regional shifts in product sales are evident, as the operational status of salons was left to state governments. The Midwest region, consisting of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, fared the best of all five regions. Quarterly market share rose from 20.8% YAG to 25.2%. Midwestern salons posted a remarkable performance in June product sales with an increase of almost 26% over last June. While salon product sales are important, the crux of salons' survival rests with services, which comprise 94% of their revenues. Concern has been high within the industry regarding what business will be like post-COVID. Will clients return? And if they do, will new regulations and procedures allow salons to operate at the same volume as before? The final answer remains to be seen, but early data shows that clients are willing to begin returning to their stylists in the salon, at least for certain services. Services are not recovering at the same rate as products. Service revenues were essentially non-existent in April. Kline's PRO Pulse: U.S. Independent Salon Market Performance Index shows improvement each month of the quarter, culminating with an index for the quarter of 35.2 compared to Q2 2019. June, however, was very promising at an index of 75.7. ""Services that are rebounding the best are those that are more high-tech and require the expertise of a professional stylist,"" says Paula Gottdiner, Kline PRO Project Manager. ""Personally, I had no hesitation in returning to my salon for a color service when it re-opened. Evidently, I was not alone in doing so, as hair coloring revenues in June were up nearly 2% over a year ago."" Other services that saw increases in revenue include straightening/smoothing with a haircut, color and treatment, and thinning hair treatment. As noted by Gottdiner, these are services highly valued by clients and not ones easy to perform as an at-home DIY. ""Based on what we are seeing with Kline PRO, the salon industry is on track to recover,"" says Gottdiner. ""We are in the midst of processing the transactions from the third quarter and expect to publish the data in the next couple of months. It will be interesting to measure the recovery and be able to analyze both the product and service components of the industry."""
Pandemic pushes millions of shoppers online in Latin America,"""Covid-19 has been an accelerator of trends, and in electronic commerce it has been very powerful,"" said Oscar Silva, an expert in global strategies with the consultancy firm KPMG in Mexico. ""More than 10 million Latin Americans who had never bought online now do so regularly,"" he told AFP. The dominant regional force is not Amazon or eBay but Mercado Libre, which has a similar business model and is present in 18 countries. Despite the economic turmoil unleashed by the pandemic, the Argentinian company doubled its sales in the second quarter of this year thanks to a 45 percent rise in the number of customers to 51.1 million. Its market capitalization reached $55 billion, challenging Brazilian mining giant Vale for the title of Latin America's most valuable company. The tectonic shift in consumer habits is likely to endure, said Silva. ""People were afraid of fraud or that the product wouldn't be what they expected. It's very likely that a large percentage of these customers will stay after realizing how easy and efficient online commerce is,"" he said. David Geisen, head of Mercado Libre's Mexican arm, said that ""loyal users now buy in 12 days what they bought before in 17, frequent users in 24 days what they bought in 79, and sporadic users in 29 days what they bought in almost a year."" At the start of the pandemic, top sellers included face masks, antibacterial gel, thermometers and oximeters, but demand gradually spread to other goods and services. The boom even reached Cuba's tightly controlled economy, with sales soaring on the government's tuenvio.com platform, which struggled to meet the expectations of some customers. ""I've made around 40 purchases and I've had about 40 problems,"" Jorge Noris, a 34-year-old IT worker, told AFP in Havana. There have also been hiccups in Mexico. One man who tried to buy a cellphone online complained he received a soft drink instead, although the store - part of Mexican magnate Carlos Slim's empire - eventually sent him the right order. Many businesses have gone bankrupt because they had a poor online offering or none at all, Silva said. ""The big platforms are the winners, but we also see neighborhood businesses that keep their customers or win new ones using something as simple as WhatsApp,"" he said. According to the firm AppsFlyer, downloads of e-commerce mobile applications grew 93 percent in the second quarter of the year in Latin America, with Brazil and Mexico leading the way. Brazil, the region's biggest economy, saw online commerce grow nearly 57 percent between January and August, with 135,000 new online stores, according to the Brazilian Association of Electronic Commerce. Governments in the region are eyeing the online boom as a source of tax income to fund increased public spending during the pandemic. New jobs are also being created, replacing some of those lost during the economic downturn. While unemployment stalks millions around the region, Sergio Garcia is optimistic about his future after a year as a parcel courier for a global e-commerce giant. ""Demand has grown a lot during the pandemic,"" said the 60-year-old, who earns the equivalent of about $0.30 for each package he delivers on foot. ""It doesn't sound like much, but it's more than other jobs,"" he said."
How far will Clean Beauty go?,"Awareness of the need to develop the notion of clean beauty emerged in the United States as a response to a regulatory gap in cosmetics formulation. Then, it soon reached European markets, although the latter were already subject to more restrictive regulations. Who triggered this phenomenon? Increasingly watchful consumers who paid attention to what they purchased and had lost confidence in brands. According to a recent study conducted by Kantar Worldpanel, in late 2019, 44% of French people said they paid attention to the composition of hygiene-beauty products, compared to less than 40% in late 2012. As for confidence, out of an average of 88 brands continuously followed up over several years, it declined from 32% to 27% between 2013 and 2019. ""Consumers are watchful and statistics prove it,"" confirms Anaïs Dupuy, Business Development Manager at Kantar. These statistics include evaluation applications, which have been increasingly seducing the public since they appeared. 5.1 million consumers scanned the composition of hygiene-beauty products in September 2019. Meanwhile, small brands boomed to become part of the biggest new customer recruiters: DIY, bulk products… But most of all, this is due to the constant progress made by organic and natural cosmetics which, in 2019, still represented 8.6% of hygiene-beauty volumes, i.e. 3.4 points more than in 2015. ""If, in early 2020, the hygiene-beauty market started slowing down with a weaker growth rate and a decline in the average basket value, organic and natural cosmetics resisted and kept recruiting new shoppers,"" adds Anaïs Dupuy. Last May, almost 60% of French people said they had purchased organic/natural hygiene-beauty products at least once over the previous 12 months, while they were only 52% in early 2019. Cosmetics viewed as clean have obviously become a growth driver on this market, and no doubt the new post-COVID era will strengthen this phenomenon. ""Clean beauty was born out of a health concern and a will to create non-toxic cosmetics – whether synthetic or natural – free from any suspicious ingredients. The sanitary crisis intensifies this will,"" claims Candice Colin, creator of the Clean Beauty application and of Beautylitic, and founder of Officinea, the organic, natural, endocrine disruptor-free cosmetics brand. ""As a consequence, we noticed the situation has changed in sectors which had not made progress yet. I think the main clean beauty triggering factor in this COVID period is luxury, whereas the two concepts were still recently opposed. Luxury brands have been making significant modifications to their formulas, because they can no longer overlook this phenomenon: clean beauty does not question efficacy. There is no reason why there would be an offering in supermarkets and not in the luxury segment,"" adds Candice Colin. Pascale Brousse, founder of the Trendsourcing agency, shares the same opinion. ""Luxury was still standing apart a few months ago, but they no longer have a choice. Who will buy a EUR 150 cream if the composition is not in line with the excellence they highlight?"" she asks. As a matter of fact, categories like makeup and haircare, and even hair colouration, in the luxury segment, have been innovating and multiplying launches, as can be seen with the Le Rouge Français and La Bouche Rouge lipsticks, Kure Bazaar nail polish, and very recently, the new Respect hair care range by high-end hairdresser David Lucas. From the smallest brands to giant groups, the prospects related to more conscious beauty are much positive for the future. In addition, the lack of any legal and official definition of clean beauty makes it possible to adopt all sorts of approaches: clean, organic, natural formulas; ecodesigned, refillable packaging; bulk, solid, powder products… Anything is possible to make clean cosmetics progress. New players are emerging, and those that had adopted it right from the beginning go even farther. We cannot but be delighted.

The French cosmetics industry is planning a return to normal in 2022,"According to the study, carried out on behalf of the French beauty federation (FEBEA), the turnover of cosmetics sector dropped by 10% during the first six months of the year, however, sales recorded strong disparities between product categories. Indeed, while sales of beauty products have fallen by 25%, those of hygiene products have doubled, driven by the health concerns linked to the outbreak. As far as French exports are concerned, the drop reached 14% in the first half of the year for cosmetic products, compared to 18% on average at the national level. Over the entire year, the cosmetics sector should suffer less than the French economy as a whole, according to Asterès. Indeed, the consulting firm anticipates a 5% drop of the industry's net sales in 2020. A figure to be compared to the decline of total household consumption in France, which is estimated at 7%. In detail, hygiene products could register an annual increase of 30%, while sales of beauty products could fall by 17%. Regarding investments, the drop reached 12% for cosmetics on the first half, versus 16% on average at the national level. As for cosmetics exports, they could fall by 9% in 2020, less than total French exports (-17%), the study forecasts. In this area also, there are strong disparities since French exports of cosmetic products might drop by 10% in the Americas but are expected to rise by 3% in China. Th situation is also at a stalemate in travel retail, in the wake of the collapse of air transport. According to Asterès, sales of cosmetics in travel retail outlets should register a fall of at least 65% in the year 2020. In the end, the French cosmetics market is expected to return to its pre-crisis level in 2022. However, as far as exports are concerned, the rebound could be slower, especially in the most affected regions (the United States and India, in particular), with a return to the 2019 level expected only in 2023. If the French cosmetics sector as a whole benefits from an overall solidity, ""very small businesses and SMEs, which represent 85% of the cosmetics sector, are clearly more vulnerable"", notes the FEBEA. Very small businesses, in particular, suffered a 54% drop in turnover, compared to 35% for large companies, during the first half of 2020. Beauty salons and prestige retailers (perfumeries and department stores) are also among the most impacted sectors. According to Asterès, they should see their annual sales fall by 25% and 23% respectively. On the other hand, sales in supermarkets and drugstores, fully benefiting from the boom of hygiene products, are expected to grow by 2%. In addition, online sales are expected to skyrocket (+38%), but their weight remains too low to impact the entire sector. Despite the sector's strengths, the FEBEA therefore insists on the importance that public policies will have to limit damages and ensure a fast recovery of the most vulnerable companies. The trade organisation therefore pleads for a tax credit supporting the digitization of production tools. According to Asterès estimates, in the cosmetics industry just one more robot per company would increase the overall productivity by 3.5%. For Patrick O'Quin, president of FEBEA: ""The cosmetics industry remains a high-performance sector, with all the assets needed to face the crisis and accelerate its transformation. However, the sector's SMEs, which create a great deal of employment throughout France, deserve specific support during this period."""
Will the cosmetics industry become addicted to powder?,"Founded by Hélène Azancot, General Manager of various brands of the L'Oréal group over the course of her career, young brand Yodi Beauty offers face and hair care products in the form of powder. ""We aim to reach consumers who want to consume beauty differently and help them turn to conscious beauty. I felt like putting my expertise and knowledge in the service of new cosmetics based on transparency, education, and minimalist formulas, and with which science progress helps achieve new things,"" she says. To make things different, Hélène Azancot's idea is to remove, not add. ""Remove anything unnecessary, anything that is not pure efficacy, like preservatives, additives, allergens. And to remove preservatives, the first thing to get rid of is actually water!"" she explains. According to the creator, the anhydrous powder solution is in line with objectives of efficacy, protection, but also sharing and eco-design. Easier to use by the whole family and lighter than solid products, powders can be easily taken everywhere. For now, the range counts two nourishing shampoos, Nutritive Argan and Douceur de Lait d'Amande, and three face cleansers, Vitamine C et Fleurs d'Hibiscus, Charbon Purifiant, and Trio d'Huiles. Formulated with a base concentrated in natural actives and enriched with a prebiotic, these products suit all skin or scalp types, and both men and women. ""We worked on our formulas for two years. It is a real detox. Thanks to powders, we revive products with fewer, but just as efficient ingredients. We remove, without losing,"" adds the founder. As for packs, the brand's commitment to eco-design is respected, as they chose aluminium bottles covered with recyclable and compostable bioplastics labels. In line with current trends, including DIY, powder is making progress and gaining ground on unexpected segments, just like oils did a few years back. ""Consumers in search of new gestures like powders. They boast a strong environmental dimension, and they are easy to apply and use,"" explains Anne Rutigliano, Marketing Director of the Anjac group, whose Aircos company, leader of cosmetic powder manufacturing, has just launched a range of six skincare, cleansing, and exfoliating products. ""These formulas offer many ecological advantages, since they do not contain any water. As regards efficacy, the lipophilic actives associated with powders are those with the best affinity and intradermal penetration, and powders also offer very good adhesion to the skin for a cleansing action,"" she adds. Based on a dermocosmetics approach to suit all skin types, the range includes a cleanser and an exfoliating product for oily, dry, and highly sensitive skins, in addition to an ""all skin type"" version. Products are talc-free, since it is a controversial material suspected of being potentially carcinogenic, and contain up to 95% of ingredients of natural origin. ""Right now, our only constraint lies in the fact that the actives currently available are mainly hydrophilic, so they mix with water. We have a limited choice of (lipophilic) ingredients for dry products. But our Aircos R&D has managed to add hydrophilic ingredients to our water-free powders,"" explains Anne Rutigliano. ""Also, for mass production, and in particular packaging, powders require adaptations to ensure the right dosage and preserve the quality of the formula and the powder thinness,"" she adds. Yet another evidence of the cosmetic potential of powders, over the summer, Aircos opened a sales office in California, and a laboratory will be inaugurated in early 2021, to pave the way for these products. Renowned for their know-how and industrial capacity in this segment, the Technature laboratory has been working, since its creation, on a water-free approach to face care with masks and cleansers. They are now launching a hygiene range with shower gels, shampoos, a conditioner, and a hair mask based on argan oil, goji berries, and avocado. ""With this product type, we aim to both keep up with the clean beauty trend with more natural formulas free from any controversial ingredients and simplify the list of ingredients. We have been making powders for a long time, but we have reviewed our packaging so that the general public likes them,"" explains Communication and Marketing Director Anne-Claire Roudaut. All formulas contain over 97.7%, and up to 99.7% ingredients of natural origin, and are available in two versions: either as a powder compact with direct application on the skin or hair, or as a bottle with a powder to rehydrate. ""It is the 'I make my own shampoo and shower gel' version. Consumers keep their own bottle and purchase refill bags: it is a simple gesture, they save money, they adopt an ecoresponsible behaviour, and the formulas are natural, so it is a win-win,"" adds Sales Manager Rachel Roger Mazurié. Other than environmental impact reduction, the absence of preservatives, and the pleasure to make your own product, Anne-Claire Roudaut highlights a sensorial advantage. ""Our products feel very soft and velvety. Plus, they do not make the skin feel tight, compared to fluid products,"" she says. Given its technological expertise, Technature has almost no limits in terms of manufacturing. ""We have the right technology to add both oily and aqueous extracts to our powders,"" claims Anne-Claire Roudaut. Anhydrous powder cosmetics are more environmentally friendly than others in many ways. And brands and consumers have already understood that."
"Fragrance leads recovery in UK prestige beauty market, reports The NPD Group","In very challenging circumstances during Covid-19, fragrance performance has improved from -67% during lockdown (12 weeks from 22 March 2020 to 13 June 2020) compared to the same period in 2019 to -13% post-lockdown (12 Weeks from 14 June 2020 to 5 September 2020) compared to the same period in 2019. According to The NPD Group, fragrance is outperforming the entire prestige beauty market, helping to lead the market recovery. Post lockdown (12 weeks, from 14 June 2020 to 5 September 2020), fragrance reported a -13% decline in sales, versus the same period in 2019, compared to the whole of the prestige beauty market which is down -24%. This weak performance in prestige beauty is attributed in part to the ongoing challenges faced by the make-up sector. ""The popularity of fragrance can be attributed to a number of factors. Fragrance doesn't require touch when applying or appreciating it. Retailers are also utilising unsold giftsets to encourage consumers back into store using price promotion, and as a result fragrance giftsets have reported in positive growth of +32% post-lockdown (12 Weeks from 14 June 2020 to 5 September 2020) compared to the same period in 2019. Consumers are now increasingly price conscious and opting for products that are perceived as value for money,"" said Emma Fishwick, Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. Mintel, for his part, noted last week a strong dynamism in sales of facial care products in the United Kingdom."
Nine ways COVID-19 will boost the greening of the cosmetics industry,"Hosted by Ecovia Intelligence on an online platform on 2-5th November 2020, the next European edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will discuss the sustainability implications of the coronavirus pandemic on the cosmetics industry, with a focus on nine key issues: Skin health and the human virome. The human virome (or virobiota) is the total collection of viruses in and on the human body. The pandemic has elevated consumer interest in anti-viral products, such as hand sanitisers, hand washes, and cleaning products. John Jiménez, Senior Exploration Scientist at Belcorp, will give an introduction to the human virome and discuss its relationship with skin health. How does the skin microbiome interact with the virome? What are the implications to the cosmetics and personal care industry? Will we see new personal care products designed to create a healthy virome, as we currently have for the skin biome? Natural ingredients for skin immunity. Consumer demand for health and natural products has increased since the virus outbreak; many consumers are buying such products as they look to boost their personal immunity. Dr. Anne Marie Fine, medical doctor and author, will give details of natural ingredients that can be used in personal care formulations to improve skin immunity. How can personal care products help build skin immunity? What ingredients can boost the skin's natural defence against microbial pathogens? Evolution of sustainability issues. The sustainability agenda has changed considerably this year. The pandemic has highlighted social inequality with citizens in developing countries unable to get the same level of healthcare and treatment as those in the western world. The Black Lives Matter movement has shown how racial discrimination and prejudices exist in society. Although climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental pollution remain pressing issues, they risk being overlooked as governments and organisations grapple with the coronavirus crisis. A number of speakers will discuss the changing sustainability agenda in the cosmetics industry. What green issues are likely to be most important in a post- COVID world? Disruption of raw material supply. Lockdowns and emergency measures introduced during the pandemic have disrupted the supply of raw materials to the cosmetics industry. Natural ingredients, especially those from developing countries, have been particularly affected. Higher freight costs, longer transportation times, as well as quarantine measures at ports have caused disruption. The pandemic is leading to some cosmetic and ingredient firms to start setting up regional and local supply networks. Such developments will be featured in a dedicated session (Supply Chains). Upcycling food ingredients. Food side streams (by products) are increasingly being used as a source of cosmetic ingredients. Some companies are upcycling as they turn to sustainable sources of raw materials. Others are doing so as they look to re-direct waste from landfill and develop circular systems. Case studies will be given of operators making natural ingredients by upcycling, including product innovations. Sustainable palm oil and rainforest ingredients. Palm kernel oil is widely used in the personal care industry, however questions remain about sustainable sourcing. Peter Becker, Sustainability Senior Manager at Evonik, will give details on a new cross-industry initiative - Action for Sustainable Derivatives - that encourage transparency in supply chains and zero deforestation. Its aim is to positively transform the industry by sustainable sourcing and production of palm oil derivatives. Some argue the solution to deforestation lies in commercialisation of rainforest ingredients. Forestwise will show how the organisation is working with indigenous communities in Borneo (South-East Asia) to collect wild harvested rainforest ingredients. With more than half of Borneo's rainforest lost in the last 50 years, its mission is to preserve what remains. Forestwise will give details on how it has set up supply networks for illipe butter, kukui nut oil, and other rainforest ingredients. Social value of cosmetics. Although sustainability is now entrenched in the cosmetics industry, few operators are focusing on social issues. Stefan Siemer, Head of Corporate Sustainability at Weleda, will explain how brands should address their social impacts. The company will highlight its Diversity Wins programme, which provided employment to refugees coming into Europe. Retailing implications. The coronavirus pandemic could change the face of retailing forever. Online retailers reported a sales surge as many physical stores closed during lockdowns. Although most have re-opened, social distancing measures and weak consumer sentiment are leading to sluggish sales. Stephanie Yaguer from Red Ant will give insights from its Safe Retail Initiative, showing how consumers feel about retailing of beauty products. Marketing to the post-COVID consumer. COVID-19 is having a profound effect on consumer behaviour, changing the way we greet, work, shop, and use cosmetics & personal care products. A futurist will discuss the long-term implications on these changes: how will the post-COVD consumer behave? What are the marketing implications to brands and retailers?

"UK: Facial skincare usage surges in COVID-age, says Mintel","Following a dip in usage in 2018/19, facial cleansing is well and truly back in vogue among British women. According to Mintel, over the last 12 months [1], usage of these products rose from 50% in 2019 to 55% in 2020 in the United Kingdom. There's also been an increased use of micellar water (from 25% to 29%) and usage of toner has risen from 25% to 31%. And it's not just cleansing which has witnessed a COVID boost, moisturising has proved popular too. According to the market research firm, usage of moisturisers saw a decline in 2019 as women cut back on their beauty repertoires, but 2020 has seen renewed popularity. Day cream/lotion is proving to be the cream of the crop, as the number of Brits dipping into these has shot up from 60% in 2019 to 67% in 2020. Night cream usage has also flourished, increasing from 44% to 47% over the same period. Women surveyed by Mintel about their beauty routines during lockdown [2] confirmed the shift. Overall, 30% of facial skincare users said they had moisturised more since the outbreak of COVID-19, (rising to 41% of 16-24s), while one in five (18%) facial skincare users spent longer on their routine and one in seven (14%) had used more facial treatment products such as face masks. Overall, attention to hygiene including hand washing increased significantly at the beginning of April [3] when 81% of Brits said they had washed their hands more often. ""In this COVID age, consumers are seeking physical and mental wellness, and facial skincare has benefited from the wellbeing benefits of following a beauty routine,"" explains Roshida Khanom, Head of Beauty and Personal Care, Mintel. According to Mintel, the British women's facial skincare market has enjoyed value growth in recent years, increasing by 1.4% in value in 2019 to reach £1.18 billion. Star performers include the cleansing (including cleansers, toners and makeup removers) and skincare face mask segments - which both saw a 9% rise in value in the twelve-month period ending June 2020. The mandatory use of face masks/coverings in a number of public places in 2020 could boost prospects for facial skincare, with new product development (NPD) in skincare products to soothe irritated skin. Skincare brands can also extend their ranges to release comfortable face coverings to reduce skin issues. Increased hygiene also presents future NPD opportunities for gentle facial cleansers designed to be used multiple times a day, or cleansing formats that can be used on the go, while including antibacterial claims could also appeal. While facial skincare remains a focus for women, there has been a 5% decline in colour cosmetics sales - falling to £1.76 billion last year. According to Mintel, 55% of female facial skincare users have reduced how frequently they wear makeup. While the trend was well established before the pandemic, in particular in the wake of the success of Korean beauty routines, the outbreak of COVID-19 may well have played a significant part too with frequency of makeup usage down. ""Makeup usage will fall further throughout 2020, as social distancing measures remain and working from home becomes the next normal for many. Makeup/skincare hybrid products, such as BB/CC creams, could have more appeal as women cut back on using heavy foundation. The category has already seen NPD from makeup brands entering skincare in 2020 which will continue,"" added Roshida Khanom. Finally, just as face coverings in public places have become the new norm, facial skincare masks in the home have seen a boost in popularity. Usage of peel-off or wash-off masks rose from 25% in 2019 to 32% in 2020, while sheet leave-on mask usage increased from 15% to 22%. These masks have particularly captured the interest of young 16-24s - almost two thirds (62%) of whom enjoyed the luxury of a peel-off or wash-off mask in 2020. ""The face mask segment has benefited, with the lockdown giving people more time to themselves. Sheet masks have also seen NPD in biodegradable formats, targeting sustainability concerns,"" concluded Ms Khanom."

Covid-19 pandemic gives major boost to e-commerce,"The trend was brought into sharp relief on August 18, when British high street mainstay Marks & Spencer announced it was culling 7,000 staff. Hours later, in contrast, online behemoth Amazon said it was hiring 3,500 in the United States. However, the M&S slimdown is only one part of the picture in the UK, with 2,500 more job losses announced at department store Debenhams, which in April entered administration for the second time in a year. Hundreds more jobs are also to be lost at other well-known British high street chains. By contrast, Britain's largest supermarket chain Tesco placed a sizeable feather in its online cap by saying it was creating 16,000 permanent jobs to deal with strong growth in its online activities. ""It is very clear that the digitisation of commerce, (even) if in place for a long time, is accelerating enormously,"" said Hervé Gilg, managing director and distribution specialist at Alvarez & Marsal corporate transformation services. The benefits are being reaped by those companies which were already carrying out a sizeable chunk of their activities online. That troupe is led by Amazon, which doubled its net profits in the second quarter of this virus-challenged year. Following was Germany's fashion and lifestyle e-commerce heavyweight Zalando, which saw its active customer base rise 20 percent in first half 2020 to 34 million. US giant Walmart, although not an online ""pure player"", has also shifted in that direction to benefit from the upswing in virtual commerce in the US and its second-quarter results soared past estimates on an e-sales jump of 97 percent. ""COVID-19 has seen a lot of consumer purchasing behaviour move towards e-commerce due to necessity, with isolation and shops being closed,"" said Sam Murrant, Lead Payments Analyst at GlobalData. Actually, global e-commerce grew 41 percent ""in only three months compared with 22 percent growth for 2020 as a whole to date,"" said market research firm Kantar. In France, the United Kingdom, Spain and China, the average market share of e-commerce went from 8.8 percent of value (in 2019) to 12.4 percent in second quarter 2020, added Kantar. It highlighted that in China, online shopping already amounts to ""a quarter of expenditure on mass consumer products."" The trend was already under way before Covid-19 began to batter the global economy. But the brutal falloff in out-of-home spending has had ""a major knock-on effect for non-food commerce dependent on physical sale points"", Gilg said. The unprecedented development has ""made all retail actors understand or else confirm that it is indispensable to have an online presence and to be as competitive as possible there,"" says Stephane Charveriat, senior associate director with the Boston Consulting Group. ""Even companies well-advanced in e-commerce have understood they lacked capacities to meet the demand they faced during the lockdown and are still facing in the context of the epidemic,"" adds Mr. Gilg. That has meant evolution, which ""requires significant means and investments,"" observes Charveriat. But that need comes at a time when company coffers are relatively bare and money placed aside for online purposes is cash which does not therefore flow to the physical business. These transformations will take place under the pressure of already well established global heavyweights, such as Amazon. ""Clearly, it is a sizeable challenge to confront large platforms,"" says Charveriat. He says French firms must define an internet strategy, be it in the form of alliances with others, in order to compete in the digital marketplace with existing big hitters. Still, Gilg says the existing physical presence of distribution brands can be a major asset in that regard, for example, catering to visiting international tourists who may want to experience what a brand has to offer on-site when post-Covid tourism does eventually take off again. ""Apple has shown very effectively how a shop can act as a stage,"" to show off its wares, Gilg said, adding that while commercial clicks have their value, retail mortar can provide physical brand ""authenticity."""
UK beauty market expected to decline 10% in 2020,"""Cosmetics and toiletries are losing out in the COVID-19-driven decision between what is essential and what is dispensable, particularly as almost half (43%) of UK consumers plan to socialize outside of the home less frequently in future [1]. This will contribute to the forecasted -10% (£1.7bn) value decline in the UK cosmetics and toiletries industry in 2020 [2],"" explains GlobalData. As consumers have fewer out-of-home occasions, the cosmetics market has taken a backseat. ""Even when consumers do venture outdoors, the wearing of masks is further diminishing the need for cosmetics,"" comments Lia Neophytou, Consumer Analyst at the data and analytics company. As a consequence, sectors such as fragrances and make-up that are most suited to out-of-home occasions will see greater decline than skincare and oral hygiene that are generally used irrespective of plans to socialize. These latter categories will also see comparatively less decline as people have a heightened awareness of personal cleanliness amid the pandemic. ""Brands operating in the skincare and personal hygiene categories are in a better position than most - though a degree of innovation is still required to mitigate the extent of sector decline and speed up recovery. Investing in marketing campaigns and re-positioning products typically used out-of-home to align with the at-home occasion would be wise,"" adds Neophytou. For example, combining hand sanitising and skin moisturising - as Unilever's Vaseline brand recently did with their new range of products - may be a good idea. However, among the most affected categories some segments may also successfully navigate through the crisis. Eye make-up, for instance, increased its share of the prestige make-up market by 3% in the UK, during and after lockdown, according to The NPD Group. ""Pre-lockdown, eye make-up accounted for 22% of total prestige makeup sales and increased to 24% of prestige make-up sales during lockdown. Once lockdown was eased, eye make-up increased its share to 25% of total prestige make-up sales,"" explains the market research firm. According to The NPD Group, mascara and eye shadow sales drove the increase in share during this period. However, the focus on eye products is also evident in the brow segment, since brow products increased their market share in makeup from 4% pre-lock-down to 5% post-lockdown. On the contrary, as consumers are required to wear face coverings in shops, on public transport and other public spaces, the lip segment has declined in share, driven largely by a decline in demand of lip colour. While all sectors in the cosmetics and toiletries industry are expected to return to growth in 2021, they will not recuperate their pre-COVID-19 value immediately. Shifts in consuming habits and priorities will play a role in the difficulties of the beauty demand to return to post-crisis levels. However, according to GolbalData, economic and financial uncertainty will further contribute toward this. Indeed, 25% of UK consumers that are earning less due to COVID-19 will purchase beauty and grooming products at the lower end of the price range in future, compared with the UK average of 20% [3]."
Brazil: ABIHPEC anticipates sales of cosmetic products to grow 1.1% in 2020,"For manufacturers of personal hygiene, perfumery and cosmetics, the most critical months of the Covid-19 crisis in Brazil have passed. In any case, this is what announces João Carlos Basilio, executive president of ABIHPEC, who has just published the sales figures for the sector from January to May 2020. Compared to the same period last year, the Brazilian market has increased by 0.6% in turnover and 2.8% in volume. Although modest, this growth is very good news for ABIHPEC. ""For our sector, it is a very positive asset to stay in the green,"" said João Carlos Basilio. ""Much of this result is a reflection of the significant increase in purchases of products that make up what is called the 'COVID-19 shopping basket', such as hand sanitizers and liquid or solid soaps. This group of products contributed 21% of the total growth of market (in value, based on ex-factory prices) during the first five months of the year,"" he explained. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the products that have recorded the fastest growth. Due to the lack of a products on the market, many cosmetic companies quickly reacted and adapted their production facilities to address the demand. Others, who already offered these items, stepped up production. As a result, more than 6,300 tons have already been sold. An increase of 3127% (volume / tonne) as sales did not exceed 200 tonnes during the same period in 2019. Liquid soap, another key product for hand hygiene, recorded an 18.9% increase in sales (ex-factory value). ""Brazilians are used to take care of themselves and their personal hygiene. Amid the pandemic, we have noticed several changes in purchasing habits and preferences between the different segments of the sector,"" explains Basilio. Sales of shampoos and conditioners, for instance, respectively grew by 2.9% and 9.2% (ex-works value). ""Such figures make us think that consumers probably take more baths and wash their hair more often,"" said the president of ABIHPEC. The skincare category, especially for adult skins, also met a significant success during the first five months of the year. Sales of anti-wrinkle and anti-aging cosmetic products increased by 13.4% over the period. Additionally, despite social distancing measures and the use of facial masks, sales of lipsticks grew 12% in volume. ""We believe that despite the context, people continued to dress and wear make-up at home, in particular to participate in virtual social events, such virtual happy hours and professional video meetings,"" adds João Carlos Basilio. For the president of ABIHPEC, in addition to behavioural changes, the industry's good figures can also be a consequence of the price cuts made by cosmetics manufacturers in recent months. ""This shows how the sector was able to react quickly. By offering products at a lower price, the industry was able to adapt its offer to the new reality. Price cuts helped to create purchasing opportunities for Brazilians who did not have to give up consuming our products."" According to João Carlos Basilio, ABIHPEC forecasts a growth of 1.1% in 2020 for the entire perfume, cosmetics and hygiene sector in Brazil. ""We are very careful when we talk about recovery. The pace will perhaps be slower, because the economic context is still quite complex,"" he underlined. However, according to the Executive Chairman of ABIHPEC, the business community has received with great enthusiasm the results of this first part of the year. ""For many of them, June was a very positive month, with demand picking up, apparently continuing the process of sectorial recovery already seen in the May figures,"" he concluded."
Germany records smallest decline in prestige beauty sales during lockdown,"Within the five biggest European prestige beauty markets, Germany shows the smallest decline in year-to-date value sales as of the end of May 2020, performing better than UK, Spain, France, and Italy, according to market research firm The NPD Group. Due to the closure of the majority of retail stores during the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced retail traffic right before and after the closure, the selective beauty market in Germany registers a loss of -23 per cent over the first five months of 2020 (Jan.-May). [1] The brick and mortar closure of five weeks from March 16 to April 19th was the shortest closure period compared to the other four European countries. Additionally, thanks to the drugstore channel in Germany that remained open, as well as the maturity of the e-commerce channel, the sales declined -65 per cent during the five-week closure in Germany. In comparison, France declined -88%, Spain -87%, and Italy -86% during their respective store closure period, according to The NPD Group. Up to week 11 (March 15th, 2020) the German selective beauty market was flat compared to last year. Fragrances and hair categories registered growth while makeup and skincare showed a negative performance compared to the same period in 2019. For calendar year 2019, the online channel showed a +14 per cent growth, brick and mortar, which stands for 84 per cent of the value sales recorded a -3 per cent result. During the closure of the majority of the brick and mortar stores in Germany (March 16th - April 19th, 2020), the market changed its dynamics. E-commerce climbed up to almost 60 per cent of the sales weight and more than doubled growth pace. Thanks to the high e-commerce weight before the closure and the rising home-spa trend, the skincare category was able to show a better resilience compared to the total beauty market. ""While E-commerce has a higher growth rate when compared to brick and mortar, it only accounted for 18 per cent of the German prestige beauty market before the brick and mortar closure,"" said Samantha Grand, Director of Beauty Prestige Germany at The NPD Group. Furthermore, even five weeks after re-opening of brick and mortar, the weight of prestige beauty sales in e-commerce was still higher than in the brick and mortar channel. ""The main question is how much of the brick and mortar decline will be compensated by the online dynamism, and how resilient could the prestige beauty industry be towards the new prioritization of consumers spend. Another question is if the 'new normal' will drive a change in assortment, pricing and promotion. The beauty industry will have to engage with consumers in more creative ways, involve new technologies, and find ways to make the shopping experience appealing and enjoyable during these changing times,"" concluded Grand."
"For Brazilian women, price is the key factor when buying make-up products","However, only 8 out of these 22 products are used on a regular basis. According to Picodi, this can be explained by the fact that 39% of the women who answered the survey buy their cosmetics when they are on sale, while 32% wait they are finished and 29% whenever they want. A large majority of the women who participated in the survey (77%) said price is as the key buying factor for make-up. The brand is crucial for 55% of them while 30% said their choice is based on their own preferences. Less important buying factors are: recommendation from influencers (28%), expert opinions (20%), the list of ingredients (18%) and the opinion of friends (16%). Therefore, it is not surprising that only 15% of Brazilian women said they prefer high-end cosmetics rather than their less expensive counterparts. However, 45% of them indulge themselves in buying prestige cosmetics occasionally, while 40% said they never buy such products. The price is also a decisive factor for the choice between traditional and ecofriendly cosmetics. The majority of women surveyed (54%) stated that they buy ecofriendly cosmetics only when the price is reasonable. However, 38% always buy eco-friendly cosmetics while only 8% said they have no interest in this kind of beauty products. For many Brazilian women, makeup is part of the daily beauty routine. However, 13.9% of Brazilian women surveyed do not wear makeup. Among those who do, 37% wear makeup daily, while the majority (44%) wear make-up occasionally and 19% only on special occasions. Statistically, the makeup case of a typical Brazilian woman contains: 8 lipsticks, 3 lip liners, 3 blushes, 4 mascaras, 7 eyeshadows and 9 nail polishes. Compared to other countries in Latin America, Brazilian women spend more on make-up than Mexican women (USD 290) and Argentine women (about USD 236 per year)."
Ten trends spotted at China Beauty Expo 2020,"""CBE 2020 played a vital role in driving and leading a recovery not just for the beauty sector but for the entire economy,"" said Sang Jingmin, founder and chairman of China Beauty Expo. Each edition of CBE gathers the latest technologies and products from leading companies and brands. This year also saw a remarkable showcase of new concepts, ideas and technologies. Here is a selection of the main trends spotted during the show. 1. Growing consumer interest in technology During this year's expo, CBE teamed up with Alimama (Alibaba Group's digital marketing platform) to release the 2020 Meiyi White Paper, which identifies major consumer profiles and market segments for accurate targeting. According to the report, which was released on July 8 at the 2020 International Cosmetics Technology Conference hosted by CBE and Supply World, a growing number of Chinese consumer groups have keen interest in the benefits of technology in beauty products, which in turn is driving the need for technological innovation to bring the cosmetics sector to a new height. From the design of their pavilion to the products showcased, Proya was a good illustration on how cosmetic brands explore high-tech solutions to provide new aesthetic benefits to their customers. It's foreseeable that technologies will be a key focus for Chinese brands in search for growth opportunities in the future. 2. Content marketing continues to attract attention Currently, content marketing is indisputably the best form of marketing for brands to communicate with consumers in China. At CBE 2020, different brands adopted various forms of content marketing to increase their visibility, including recommendations by key opinion leaders (KOLs), content planning and topic discussions. 3. Anti-aging and sensitive skin repair products are gaining popularity As far as skin care is concerned, anti-aging and sensitive skin repair products were the most eye-catching items showcased at CBE 2020. Efficacy is a key factor of success for skincare as consumers are increasingly demanding. Herborist Derma, a sub-brand of Shanghai Jahwa, presented three freeze-dried ampoule products, one of which was 77 Polypeptide Firming Freeze-Dried Powder made from three anti-aging ingredients including polypeptide, ginseng extract and retinol using the freeze-drying technology to deliver benefits such as firming, filling and fine line correcting. The growing popularity of anti-aging and repair solutions were also manifest in the latest technologies showcased by upstream businesses. 4. Consumer differentiation calls for accurate targeting of user by the brands According to the China's Meiyi Science and Technology White Paper, there are eight types of cosmetics consumers, each with distinctive preferences. Therefore, it's important for brands to focus on key groups to launch relevant products. At CBE, the Huanya pavilion highlighted a collection of 11 different brands - such as Face Ideas, Ausperi, Mor and Moina - conceived to better target different market segments and explore new consumer needs. 5. International giants expand their presence Over the years, international brands have been one of the major highlights of CBE. Hall N5 and E8 gathered Japanese and Korean Brands, Hall E2 was dedicated to international pavilions and imported products, Hall E3 and Hall E7 to international brands. These international exhibitors contributed to attract vast numbers of visitors and buyers. There were also a large number of niche brands on display at CBE 2020 such as Chuan Xi. Some of them will have to join forces with partners to be more successful on the huge Chinese market. 6. Consumer demands changed as a result of COVID-19 In the wake of the pandemic, consumers are more concerned about health and safety than ever. As a result, cosmetics with natural ingredients are preferred as they are generally considered as safer. Hola, a natural skincare brand with ingredients sourced in Australia, showcased its top product lines including the Instant Soothing Repair series, which received a warm response. Pien Tze Huang launched a new collection of moisturizing products based on traditional Chinese medicine and focusing the ""Beauty of Health."" Japan's Polystar, in Hall N5 also featured the theme of ""Beauty and Health"", signaling efforts to add ""healthy"" elements to communicate a lifestyle of external beauty and internal wellbeing to Chinese consumers. 7. Increased integration of online and offline retail channels New distribution channels such as social e-commerce and live streaming have been important contributors to sales growth in recent years in China. In line with this key trend, CBE 2020 conducted live streaming throughout the event to help brands combining both online and offline channels to expand their customer base. At the expo, Kafellon demonstrated the use of mini app streaming and mini app stores to empower retailing. 8. Experience and service remain key retail goals During the expo, brands and retailers introduced new or improved retail approaches based on the current market ecosystem. Cogi Formula, for instance, introduced a formula experience center focusing on professional instruments and products, and Xcheng emphasized the creation of an omnichannel interaction retail platform. However, the ultimate purpose of these new retail approaches is still about experience and service. 9. Skincare still a hot trend It is worth noting that upstream OEM/ODM companies such as Intercos, Kolmar, Nox Bellcow and 3INS are increasing investments into the skincare lines. According to Intercos, color cosmetics and skincare products used to represent around 50% of the company's business revenue respectively. However, these days, the revenue from skincare products has accounted for 75% of the total, exceeding that of color cosmetics. Kolmar also made greater efforts to promote its skincare lines during the expo by launching five skincare products with different claims. 10. Upstream businesses shift more attention to interaction with consumers At CBE this year, more and more upstream businesses highlighted trendy and fun elements to showcase how their products interact with consumers. For example, Cosmax created a ""brands supermarket"" to showcase 20 concept-brands that are well-developed in terms of product offerings, trademark and selling points. Baho's booth design was characterized by a fusion of technology and art. It used state-of-the-art technologies, 3D mapping in particular, to visually present its facial mask products and culture, as well as its development and innovation processes. Easycare, in designing its booth, focused on trendy and fun elements appealing to young consumers. For instance, it featured a themed area incorporating bathroom items into the setting of a bar. The next edition of China Beauty Expo is scheduled to take place from May 12-14, 2021. The organizers are looking to introduce more digital service offerings to further enhance the show."
Global anti-racism protests confront India to its dark-skin bias,"When Chandana Hiran was a child, she was urged to lighten her skin. Today the Indian student is leading a campaign against whitening creams and achieved her first victory when cosmetics giant Unilever dropped the word ""fair"" from its popular Fair & Lovely skin-lightening cream. L'Oréal and Johnson & Johnson announced similar initiatives. ""They have been thriving on selling insecurities to women,"" 22-year-old Hiran, who launched an online petition against Fair & Lovely, told AFP. ""The narrative is that if you are dark-skinned, you cannot achieve anything in life. So being a dark-skinned girl I've always felt that maybe... I need to be fair."" Beauty giants have long profited from the society's bias to sale whitening products, by advertising the message that beauty, success and love are linked to pale-skins. Unilever made $500 million from Fair & Lovely sales in India last year, according to Bloomberg. Now, after mounting outrage sparked by the Black Lives Matter protests in Western cities, companies like Unilever say they ""want to lead the celebration of a more diverse portrayal of beauty"". But campaigners warn their fight has just begun and that, without greater efforts to counter entrenched bias against darker skin, the rebranding remains superficial. Colourism - prejudice against darker skin tones - in India is pervasive. While British colonialism helped fuel colourism, the bias is deeply rooted in India's ancient caste hierarchies, experts say. ""The assumption is the higher castes are fairer than the lower castes,"" sociologist Suparna Kar of Bangalore's Christ University told AFP. As a result, many associate pale skin with wealth and beauty - a prejudice bolstered by Bollywood films which rarely make darker-complexioned women the star and frequently portray successful city-dwellers as fair-skinned. Actress Tannishtha Chatterjee, long vocal about colourism, told AFP: ""When I have been cast in urban roles, a make-up artist would come and tell me that it's an 'upmarket' role, so 'should I make the skin tone two shades lighter?'"" Many Indian women start using whitening products as children. Seema, a 29-year-old domestic worker in New Delhi, has used Fair & Lovely since she was 14. Most of her female relatives use it - including her 12-year-old daughter. ""When I look at the fairness-cream commercials it looks like a good product... they show that when people become fairer, they get jobs, they get proposals for marriage,"" she told AFP. Indeed, newspaper adverts for arranged marriages regularly call for brides with ""milky white"" complexions. Beyond India, the obsession is also widespread in Southeast Asia. ""Having a whiter skin is seen as... part of what is euphemistically called (a) 'pleasing personality',"" University of the Philippines' medical anthropologist Gideon Lasco told AFP. Such prejudices have exposed generations to self-loathing and low self-esteem, experts say. Furthermore, some adulterated products pose significant health risks: they may contain hazardous levels of mercury or hydroquinone. In Indonesia, the pursuit of ""white skin"" has led to the sale of toxic, unregulated products, prompting a government crackdown. But activists say it will take time to alter such ingrained biases. In India, a nation of 1.3 billion people, whitening products make up about half the skincare market. But change is coming, and several campaigners believe future generations will see the world - and themselves - differently."
Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020 will be held under one roof,"While last year's edition has been impacted by the political situation in Hong Kong, Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020 have to cope with the economic and sanitary uncertainties linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a consequence, joint organisers BolognaFiere Group and Informa Markets have decided to collocate both events under one roof at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) from 11-13 November. While the situation related to the Covid-19 has greatly improved in Hong Kong, with several consecutive days and weeks of 0 to near 0 newly reported cases of the disease, and an improving trajectory of recovery in neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Japan, and Malaysia, travel restrictions are expected to be eased in the region. However, with many countries and regions still not reaching similar levels of stability yet, the organisers have proactively decided to combine the two fairs typically held at Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) and AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE) all under the roof of HKCEC for 2020. Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020 will also see the first-time debut of a Digital Week held right after the physical event. This initiative is a virtual extension of the event which will enable travel restricted beauty professionals worldwide to participate in Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020. The fair's Digital Week will include virtual presence for select exhibitors, real-time online business matchmaking for sellers and buyers, and a host of content rich recorded and live sessions including seminars and footage from the fair. ""Cosmopack and Cosmoprof Asia 2020 will be an important recovery platform for the international beauty industry,"" said David Bondi, Senior Vice President – Asia of Informa Markets and Director of Cosmoprof Asia Ltd. ""Our decision to move the two fairs into one venue as well as launching a virtual experience apart from the live event is to create an inclusive opportunity. Our Digital Week is also a good experiment to see how we can continuously improve our offerings and services for the future."" Finally, with regards to onsite health and safety measures, organisers say they have adopted ""the highest standards along with following local/federal and global health protocols and working closely with the venue operators to provide an optimally secure and safe environment."""
Sales of nail polishes expected to fall by 17% in 2020 in Brazil,"The almost global temporary closure of beauty salons and cosmetic stores due to the Covid-19 pandemic did not impact all beauty categories the same way. While perfumes and makeup generally suffered more than others, skin care products were less impacted and gained market shares. ""In the United States and in some European countries, the nail category benefited from Covid-19,"" explains Fernanda Soro, LATAM marketing manager at Sensient Technologies. Referring to recent media reports, Fernanda Soro says figures are impressive. ""During the first week of the lockdown, British women bought 18% more nail polish than they usually do. Sales of bases and topcoats were even higher,"" she highlights. According to McKinsey, the nails category was one of the main winners in March and April 2020 in the United States, in particular in the ""Do it yourself"" (DIY) segment. Compared to the same period in 2019, sales increased by more than 200%. ""Based on this information, it was believed that the nail category could follow an identical trajectory in Brazil, or at least that it would remain stagnant during the pandemic. But, unfortunately, that did not happen,"" laments Soro. GlobalData, which has been updating its forecasts for the Brazilian cosmetics market every 15 days, since the very beginning of the pandemic, now expects a sharp drop in sales for the nail care category in 2020. According to the research company, the market could drop by -17% compared to last year. Before the pandemic, the average scenario predicted sales of nail products to grow by 3% in Brazil. ""This serves as a warning. We have to be more and more creative to try to reverse this figure,"" says Fernanda Soro. According to her, several reasons can explain the differences between the Brazil and other countries regarding nail care sales. ""At the start of the crisis, we thought that following the international example, Brazilian consumers would buy nail varnishes online and would have their nails done at home. Unfortunately, it did not happen like that."" Brazilian consumers are not as comfortable as one might think with online shopping, they are suspicious about the quality of service and are reluctant to record their personal data on the internet. The recession in Brazil is also mentioned among the possible causes. ""The entire world has been affected by the Covid-19 epidemic. But the situation here is even worse. Our unemployment rate was already huge and we are still facing a political crisis,"" she adds. However, Fernanda Soro remains confident and expects a gradual recovery of Brazil's nail market. According to GlobalData figures, the category is expected to grow by 3.9% per year on average by 2024, the fastest growth rate among all decorative cosmetics. ""When our lives return to normal, the category will return to a robust growth. Brazilian women like to go to their beauty salon every week, it's part of our culture. It is a moment of relaxation and social relationships. You feel good with your nails done, it improves your self-esteem,"" she concludes."
Beauty brands on racism: a calculated decision?,"Major companies usually stay apart from social and political conflicts, especially in a polarized time. They tend to be afraid of offending their customers and associating their brands with sensitive subjects. But in some cases, they are forced to make a stance or even to change their practices. In the context of the death of George Floyd and anti-racism protests, cosmetic brands came under fire regarding the stereotypes their products may convey. Criticisms pointed out ""colourism"", the belief that lighter skin is somehow better. A belief that cosmetic brands have been accused of perpetuating with their skin-lightening products and marketing practices. Hindustan Lever, the Indian arm of consumer giant Unilever, therefore announced it would rename its ""Fair & Lovely"" skin-lightening creams, in order to make it more inclusive and to celebrate ""all skin tones"". In a statement published on June 27, French cosmetics giant L'Oréal announced it will be removing certain words - including 'white/whitening', 'fair/fairness' and 'light/lightening' from all its 'skin evening' products"". The company did not give any further information on the time frame of the change, nor the specific products or markets included. Meanwhile, US-based Johnson & Johnson has decided to move a step further and said it would stop selling some Neutrogena and Clean & Clear products, in Asia and the Middle East. ""Conversations over the past few weeks highlighted that some product names or claims on our Neutrogena and Clean & Clear dark-spot reducer products represent fairness or white as better than your own unique skin tone,"" the company said in a statement. The company also committed US$10 million over three years to help fight racism in the U.S. However, whether spontaneous or not, corporate initiatives are far from being always successful in increasing personal connections between brands and their customers. Sometimes, they can generate as much criticism as the initial situation. This is how French activist Rokhaya Diallo questioned the very fact of selling cosmetics intended to lighten dark skins. ""So is it ok to continue making money on this disaster,"" she lamented on Twitter about the L'Oréal group's decision. Fashion and beauty brands that have embraced the themes of inclusiveness and diversity in recent years are now discovering that these subjects are at least as sensitive as environmental themes, and the words 'diversity washing' are now used to point out the brands making more communication than real efforts. When at the beginning of June, L'Oréal claimed standing ""in solidarity with the black community, and against any form of injustice of any kind"", their message was perceived as pure newsjacking: a technique which consists in rapidly launching a communication campaign to bounce back on highly publicized events. And they were accused of hypocrisy by model and transgender activist Munroe Bergdorf. Bergdorf was hired by the beauty company in August 2017 but was fired days later after a controversy over comments she posted on Facebook in response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. L'Oréal finally apologized and rehired Munroe Bergdorf. To avoid being at odds with public opinion, companies must act on these issues on a daily basis and not only when they make the headlines. Facts are more important than words: according to a 2019 report from the Boston Consulting Group, only three African-Americans and 24 women head the 500 largest U.S. companies."
Perfumes: beautiful sleeping brands rising from their ashes,"As soon as the early 2000s, niche perfumes' growth facilitated the return on the market of old French companies that had disappeared after the 1929 economic crisis and World War Two. Most of these beautiful sleeping brands are houses that had their hour of glory under the Ancien Régime or in the golden age of modern perfumery, before sinking or falling into oblivion after the Roaring Twenties. At the dawn of the third millennium, a few entrepreneurs managed to give them a new lease of life by joining the search for rarity and craftsmanship – either real or mythologized. Among others, this trend lives on a need for roots and legitimacy which the history of an old house actually meets, analyzes Diane Thalheimer, expert in perfumes and founder of consulting agency Red Berry. ""It is easier to launch a brand with a base than starting from scratch."" On the other hand, the retro movement is on a roll, conveying a reassuring message. However, to be successful, the marketing arguments and olfactory experience should be consistent. ""Santa Maria Novella is a perfect example of this: the design and perfumes ideally embrace the DNA of this old Italian house from Florence"" – the creations are signed by great names and the style is polished, in line with the brand's spirit. No doubt the Lubin house, a pioneer of this movement, is now one of the most acknowledged. Its creator, Pierre-François Lubin, became the Perfumer of the French Royal Court in 1815, and it did well until the war's aftermath. In 2003, as the brand was about to disappear, Gilles Thévenin purchased it from Mülhens. And if it slowly took off again starting from 2005, since then, the brand has definitely broadened its range with re-releases and new launches. It has also opened its own store in the quarter of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in Paris. There is also Teo Cabanel, a small perfume house born at the dawn of modern perfumery – and a favourite of the Duchess of Windsor's in the 1930s. Fallen into abeyance during the 20th century, it rose from its ashes in 2005. Today, the brand counts more than ten references with rich, sophisticated formulas. Another icon of the genre, Houbigant, the renowned house that lived through the French Revolution, saw its prestige fade after WWII and started declining in the 1980s. Reborn in the 2000s, it settled in several prestigious addresses of the niche, collaborating with famous perfumers, like Jean-Claude Ellena. The opening of points of sale specialized in perfumery intensified this phenomenon, as it offered companies more visibility: the revival of iconic 1920s brand Jovoy by François Hénin was followed by the inauguration of a luxurious store for the public to (re)discover old houses, like Isabey, Lubin, Maison d'Orsay, or Le Galion, a house founded in 1936 that met success thanks to Paul Vacher, Miss Dior's legendary perfumer, and resurrected by Nicolas Chabaud in 2014. These brands open out more easily in this ideal environment than a department store, where niche and selective brands are mixed. The situation is much different for young arrivals: there are limited places in physical points of sale. In addition, old houses also count among the brands that most radically implement the codes of modernity, massively turning to digital networks for both communication and distribution. For example, when three young graduates of the French École Supérieure du Parfum decided to breathe new life into Violet, with the help of perfumer Nathalie Lorson, they quickly chose to mix the traditional channel with online selling. Plus, their collection covers different genres combining inspirations from old formulas revisited with a palette of current ingredients and, more recently, limited editions with a modern style launched through crowdfunding. The same goes for Marcelle Dormoy, a house whose history was written in the early 1920s. Created by an independent dressmaker whose creations included perfumes, the brand disappeared in the aftermath of the war, unable to find any rescuer. It was eventually brought out of oblivion by Louise du Bessey, who was seduced by the creator's avant-garde feminism. She revived the brand with three new fragrances signed by Karine Chevalier. From the very beginning, Louise du Bessey banked on the digital channel, where ""small brands enjoy more proximity with the public"". She also made this choice because she noticed ""a deceleration of traditional distribution: Millennials no longer identify with it, and stores are ill-adapted to small brands."" If online selling made new concepts successful, like Sillages Paris, which was entirely designed for this particular distribution channel, it may seem a bit bold for brands that capitalize on their old roots. And yet, paradoxically, it may be less risky for them than traditional distribution, in particular due to the better margin it can offer. According to Louise du Bessey, the idea is to ""offer qualitative perfumes for an affordable price"". In addition, the social media game actually gives small players more chances than traditional channels. Rarity, beautiful materials, the search for meaning, originality, and alternative distribution are the main drivers for these brands' revival, as they pick up elements from their heritages to enhance their creations and storytelling, while using modern tools."
"Brits ready to return into beauty shops, but not with just any condition","Are British beauty addicts prepared for the reopening of brick and mortar beauty stores? According to The NPD Group, 29% of UK consumers would not queue to buy beauty products. The Global information company said results from its COVID-19 Consumer Sentiment Pulse Survey also show that 35% are not prepared to wait when testing a beauty product and 26% would not line up to pay. ""6% would be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more to enter the store, test a product and pay. A wait of 10 minutes appears to be the preferred time that would-be shoppers are prepared to wait in line, with 29% happy to wait this long to enter a store, 26% to test a product and 28% to pay,"" found the survey. A part of consumers do expect to return to bricks and mortar stores. Almost one third (32%) would be prepared to shop in town or a city centre, 22% would visit a retail park or shopping centre, and just 15% would shop in a small store. However, shopping from home is the most popular option: 43% said they would visit an online shopping site for their beauty essentials. Furthermore, shoppers are less inclined to casually shop and browse, as one third of consumers said it is very unlikely they will go shopping without a specific purchase or product in mind. Hygiene and social distancing will be paramount. As bricks and mortar stores reopen, the in-store experience need to be adapted, particularly the testing process for products. Indeed, 82% of respondents said they were apprehensive about trying a beauty product in-store. Brands and supplier have therefore already provided makeup or perfume tests compliant with sanitary requirements and are working on touchless solutions. In addition, 59% buyers expect stores to enforce social distancing during the shopping experience. 54% believe increased hand sanitisation options in retail outlets are a must. 48% believe that disposable testers are essential, and 46% expect that counter staff to wear face coverings. There is some optimism in the study as nearly 70% of consumers believe their financial situation will remain the same or improve in six months-time. There is greater optimism amongst 18-34 year old's who felt positive about their financial situation in six months compared to 33% of 35-54 year old's and 13% in the 55+ age group. Making up for lost time, 25% of consumers plan to purchase prestige beauty to make-up for missed occasions like birthdays for friends and family or to celebrate the end of lockdown. ""Visiting bricks and mortar stores is an exciting prospect for many consumers and queuing and social distancing will become the norm. Beauty buyers in our survey are willing to queue but ensuring a short wait time will be critical to benefit the maximum number of people who want to shop,"" said Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty."
"After hygiene, solid products are revolutionizing skincare","Stick foundations, highlighters, blushes, concealers… makeup already offers many solid products for their functional, travel-size, and easy-to-use qualities. Non-deformable and totally or almost totally deprived of water, solid cosmetics are also gaining ground in the hygiene category, due to the no pack movement. Solid shampoos, shower gels, and toothpaste have conquered cosmetics departments, initially driven by small independent brands with a natural and organic profile, before the trend was followed by mass market giants: N.A.E. for Henkel, Love Beauty and Planet for Unilever, L'Oréal… And yet, it is still hard to assess the size of this market. ""In the United States, for example, most of the brands that have entered this market are indie brands that do not appear in Nielsen or NPD statistics. In Europe, it is estimated that this market represents 5% of the cosmetics market, but according to the current forecasts, it will soon achieve a strong growth. In France, solid cosmetics make up a very dynamic market with different brand typologies: there are independent (Respire, Umaï), professional (Christophe Robin, Cut by Fred), but also masstige brands (Yes To, Sephora…)"", explains Stéphanie Reymond, founder and Director of Effervescience, a technical and marketing consulting agency specialized in beauty. French independent pioneer brand Lamazuna perfectly embodies this boom. Initially focused on the zero waste concept applied to the bathroom, Lamazuna was launched ten years ago with reusable cleansing wipes. Then, starting from 2014, they developed solid cosmetics: toothpaste, deodorants, shampoos, and conditioners with 100% natural and vegan formulas. The COSMOS-Organic-labelled solid conditioner was released in May 2020. Today, the brand counts over 50 references and achieves a 10-million-euro turnover with 30% export sales. ""We used to be a small natural and organic brand and we have become a consumer brand,"" says founder Laëtitia van de Walle. It only took a few years for solid products to reach new consumer profiles. ""In 2015, our consumers were mostly young urban girls. Now, there are as many men as there are women, and no more age limits,"" adds the creator. ""Demand evolves at the same pace as consumers change the way they make a purchase, taking action for the environment. These new consumer-actors make the offering evolve towards new proposals,"" confirms Stéphanie Reymond. Laëtitia van de Walle reveals she now aims to focus her innovation work on the skincare segment. There are countless galenic possibilities, most of which are inspired from makeup: stick serums and sun products already exist, as well as cleansing or exfoliating powders, pebbles… but the trend can still evolve if things are considered from other angles. ""Drivers include raw materials, formulas, technology transfers derived from other industries, packaging… but solid cosmetics could also grow by entering the luxury market,"" explains Stéphanie Reymond. The movement emerged a while ago. For example, in 2018, the Sicaf laboratory, which belongs to the Anjac group, focused their R&D strategy for solid cosmetics on the prestige market. ""We wanted to develop solid products for premium brands, while guaranteeing the sensoriality and efficacy of a standard cosmetic product. It was a huge challenge because it did not exist,"" explains Béatrice Anthouard, Formulation & Prospective Director of Sicaf. In 2019, the laboratory introduced a first range at Cosmetagora which won the formulation award. This range reproduced all standard skincare gestures in sticks: cleansers, masks, scrubs, serums, creams, eye contours… ""Starting from that moment, we noticed a real craze among our customers and prospects, not only from the natural segment, but also premium brands,"" says Béatrice Anthouard. To preserve sensoriality, the laboratory has not completely got rid of water in their formulas: they turn gel textures and emulsions into solid formulas. ""It is definitely possible to obtain a stick with water. It is a technical feat we have just industrialized,"" adds the Director. The second generation to be launched next autumn does not comprise any pack, this time, and the formulas are exclusively anhydrous in order to reduce water consumption, in line with the Blue Beauty movement. ""It is a real challenge to offer solid face care products without any packaging, while preserving sensoriality and performance. The formulas need to be designed with actives that provide interesting results, but which can also resist high temperatures for several hours,"" says Béatrice Anthouard. For this five- to six-product face care range, the laboratory worked on solid formulas and on the ergonomics of finished products by drawing inspiration from facialist techniques, which have come back to the fore. ""Consumers will need to get used to these new gestures, but the Covid crisis is actually a positive catalyser,"" adds Anne Rutigliano, Marketing and Communication Director of the Anjac Group, to which the Sicaf laboratory belongs. This differentiating approach has already seduced several brands: according to Sicaf, they are already discussing future launches based on the concept. Simple, but efficient gestures, the return to basics, health security… all these consumption criteria related to the current crisis will also boost the development of solid formulas in cosmetics. To accelerate innovation in this field, next autumn, the Effervescience agency will launch the STAR (Solid Technical Accelerator Responsible) Cosmetic Programme in partnership with Tectic. The idea is to create and coordinate a network of players in this segment, decipher and analyze the market, trends, and scientific and technical challenges, and inspire opportunities and insights in relation to solid cosmetics."
"Demand for sun protection products to remain strong, despite COVID-19 impact","According to Fact.MR, the Covid-19 pandemic has shrunk the growth of the sun care products market in several regions. During stringent lockdown, North America and some countries of Europe have witnessed a sluggish demand for sun protection products. In the United States, for instance, sales declined by nearly 20% by the end of March 2020 owing to prevalence of work from home conditions. However, in countries like Indonesia, China, Japan, and in other Asian countries, demand has remained intact. Fact-MR expects the impact of the pandemic to remain for the first two quarters and to recover by the end of the third quarter. The market research firm thus maintains its forecasts: – The global market of sun protection products is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 7% during 2020-2030. – The North American market is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 7% during 2020-2030 owing to the growing per capita spending on cosmeceutical products. – Self-tanning care products are expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 7% by 2020-2030, owing to per capita spending for self-tanning products in regions like Europe and Asia. – East Asia is set to clock an absolute $ opportunity of nearly US $ 3 Bn. during 2020-2030, owing to the rising demand for products with anti-aging and anti-pollution ingredients. – The European market for natural oil as a sun protection product is expected to grow by 2X during 2020-2030, owing to the convenience of applying the product. North America and Europe presently account for nearly one third of the global sun protection product consumption, with new opportunities linked to a large number of people suffering from sensitive skin issues and rising demand for clean beauty trends. In recent years, players of the sun protection products market have therefore shifted to natural oil ingredients (commonly extracted from carrot seeds, coconut oil, raspberry seeds, and several other natural products) as a solution to attract consumers with a growing preference for organic products. However, according to Fact.MR, East Asia and South Asian markets are among the most lucrative regions in the market and are expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 8% during 2020-2030. Per capita spending in this region is expected to increase in markets like China, India, Japan and Indonesia owing to higher expenditure on sun protection products for hair and skin."
"Online sales of prestige beauty soar in France, driven by skin care","Despite the closure of beauty salons, perfumeries, and department stores, French women have not completely suspended their skincare routine during the quarantine period. Indeed, online sales took over and allowed some of them to transform their bathroom into a real at-home beauty salon. According to the latest report from The NPD Group, online sales of prestige cosmetics [1] generated 21.6 million euros in April 2020, with a total of 491,000 units sold, representing an increase of 73% in value and 69% in units compared to the same period a year earlier. Skin care is the category that most appealed to French women during the compulsory social distancing period. Face and body care products accounted for 37% of online purchases of prestige beauty products in April 2020 (while in April 2019 they accounted for 29% of online purchases and 18% of total purchases in the selective channel), while online sales more than doubled. As far as face care products are concerned, online sales thus rose by 3.4 million euros compared to April 2019, a rise of 153%. In this category, the big winners are face care creams, serums, exfoliators and masks. The sunny weather during April 2020 in France also boosted online sales of sunscreen products, which increased 223% compared to April 2019. Regarding body care products the rise was even more impressive with online sales skyrocketing by 225% in April, mainly driven by scrubs, oils and food supplements. During the very first weeks of the lockdown, online sales struggled to take over from physical stores. However, the interest of consumers for at home well-being products - which was pointed out by Pinterest, for instance - finally materialized in e-commerce during the second phase of confinement, in France as in most developed countries, as found by Contentsquare. ""After the shock that followed the announcement of the lockdown and first quarantine measures, consumers have adapted their purchasing behaviour and online sales have accelerated week after week. The period that we have just passed did not fundamentally turn trends upside-down but had an accelerating effect on phenomena which began to emerge before the crisis such as the replacement of makeup routines by skincare ones,"" said Mathilde Lion, beauty expert Europe at The NDP Group."
"Waxed chests, face masks, beard oil: Indian millennials defy gender norms","After exfoliating his face and buffing his nails, Lakshay Narula crossed another grooming frontier - applying hair removal cream to his chest and with it, upending India's rigid gender norms. ""I spend 15 minutes on my hair alone and a day prior to shoots, I exfoliate my face and use traditional herbal face packs,"" Mumbai-based television anchor Narula told AFP. ""I am a man and am doing it for myself to feel confident."" Hair removal cream did not seem like a radical step, the 29-year-old said. ""It felt fantastic,"" he told AFP, adding that it was time to drop the idea of men ""grooming (themselves) only to impress women."" From charcoal face scrubs to beard oils to tinted moisturisers, Indian start-ups are hoping to capture the attention of appearance-conscious professionals like Narula. With one in four Indians owning a smartphone - the majority of them male - social media is a key battleground for pushing products challenging symbols of masculinity from an earlier era, like the 1990s Bollywood 'action hero' covered in sweat and grime. Today, the movies are more likely to feature stars who never have a hair out of place, even as they deploy flying kicks to beat up bad guys. Advertising styling gel, as Bollywood star Ranveer Singh has done, is a natural next step. Veet, a brand owned by British giant Reckitt Benckiser, turned to heart-throb Kartik Aaryan to flog its hair removal cream to more adventurous customers. Popular actor Ayushmann Khurrana even bought a stake in beauty start-up The Man Company (TMC), whose competitors have recruited social media influencers for endorsements. But creating a market for previously unheard-of products often requires extra effort. ""When we launched a charcoal peel-off mask, we made explainer videos"" for men unfamiliar with the product, TMC founder Hitesh Dhingra told AFP. The firm also uses Instagram to encourage customers to share selfies with their products, he added. The model seems to be working - Narula says the same friends who earlier mocked his skincare regimen are now asking him for product recommendations. Even the coronavirus pandemic hasn't deterred Narula, who says he is taking advantage of hair salons being closed during the lockdown to try new hairdos for video conferences and work calls. As well as giving him confidence when he goes live on Instagram, ""the whole process is very therapeutic amid the rising stress levels,"" he said. According to research firm EuroMonitor International, India's male grooming industry grew 10 percent between 2017 and 2018, with sales topping 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion). Traditional consumer giants are also hopping on the bandwagon by investing in grooming start-ups. India's Emami Group conglomerate purchased a 30 percent stake in TMC, while Colgate-Palmolive and Mumbai-based Marico Limited both own stakes in rival start-ups Bombay Shaving Company and Beardo. N. Chandramouli, chief of brand insights agency TRA Research, told AFP large firms were supporting start-ups instead of trying to market their own products ""because they feel that these smaller players have a sense of intimacy with the consumer"". ""A lot of brands are now speaking directly to men,"" Che Kurrien, editor of GQ India, told AFP. ""So, exposure levels are very high, and it's very hard not to get influenced."" With prices starting at 150 rupees ($2) for face wash, the products are relatively affordable and even self-described ""low maintenance"" men - those who followed a soap-and-shave routine - have switched gears. ""Grooming helps men land better jobs, have better romantic prospects or get access to nightclubs,"" Mumbai-based communications executive Suraj Balakrishnan, 30, whose regimen includes oils for his beard, body and hair, told AFP. ""When you look good, you tend to feel good... looking well-groomed and well-dressed gives you an edge."" Savvy entrepreneurs have also latched on to the trend by launching beauty salons targeting men and offering services from facials to manicures to waxing. Unlike their corporate counterparts, niche grooming brands are not shy about tackling controversial issues. A TMC social media campaign for Valentine's Day featured a gay couple, a man applying lipstick, and a father struggling with body image issues. It garnered 16,000 likes on Instagram - with users applauding the company for shooting down toxic masculinity norms. Like South Korea and Japan, which boast thriving markets for male beauty products, India's grooming industry exists against the backdrop of a notoriously sexist culture. Many wonder whether the changes it posits are merely skin-deep. ""We are still in the throes of change,"" said Balakrishnan. ""Grooming physically does not mean you're shifting lifelong attitudes completely. Transition takes time."""
Online beauty shopping is becoming an even more usual habit amid coronavirus,"Following an initial drop off in traffic, in France and the United Kingdom, online beauty retailers have seen an impressive increase in visits and an uplift in the amount of time being spent on their sites, as well as a strong rise of transactions, throughout the lockdown period. Despite this global uplift in online sales, some countries have been slower to benefit. In France, online sales of cosmetics have been longer to return to their pre-epidemic level and have not increased as much as in the UK and US. According to Contentsquare, the gradual upturn in online beauty sales corresponds to the evolution of consumers' priorities during the period. After an initial focus on basic necessities (food, health products, etc.), consumers directed their purchases towards equipping their home for its new functionalities (office, school, leisure) with a rise in technological products, media, decoration ... Once these questions were settled, beauty, fashion and luxury returned to their position in the mind of online shoppers. ""With so many countries going into lockdown and people being advised to stay home, it would be easy to assume that consumers aren't going to worry about their morning beauty routines. In fact, the opposite is true. Consumers are focused on their personal well-being. Many are finding they have more time to devote to beauty and health goals they've had for a while and often these activities provide stress relief as well,"" said Aimee Stone Munsell, CMO at Contentsquare. Reflecting both the closure of brick-and-mortar businesses and this desire to indulge oneself, luxury cosmetic have been acclaimed online. ""Renewed interest in beauty products may also reflect the way many players in the beauty industry have been focusing their promotions. We've seen many brands offering discounts and pushing luxury hand soaps and other necessities to the front of their homepages. This is helping to combine health, beauty and wellbeing in the minds of consumers,"" concluded Aimee Stone Munsell."
"""Our exhibitors will be visible online"", Sandra Maguarian, MakeUp in Paris","Premium Beauty News - The MakeUp in Paris trade show, which was due to be held in June, will eventually take place under a 100% digital format. Sandra Maguarian - Yes, it was really with great sadness that we had to make the decision to cancel MakeUp in Paris 2020 because, on the one hand, of a government decree, and because, on the other hand, and as we can witness today in France, health conditions are still not optimal for the organization of an event of this size. In this context, we wish to offer our community a means of developing its activity and of maintaining dynamic links between the various players in the market. Hence, in addition to our shows, we are launching a platform that fits perfectly into our ecosystem in order to continue our mission as a beauty service provider for the industry. This platform will give exhibitors and visitors facing budget restrictions and/or busy agendas the chance to always be visible, to successfully conclude negotiations, meet new partners, boost their business, etc. Our VVs (Virtual Visitors) will be able to both contact their usual suppliers and identify new ones, discover novelties, participate to online conferences, listen to replays, read articles on upcoming trends... Registration for visitors will be free and filtered/moderated by our teams. An exceptional video-conference will mark the launch of this platform, which will be operational all year round, and whose name will be www.Beauteamatch.com. Premium Beauty News - How do your exhibitors feel about this future digital experience? Sandra Maguarian - Well paradoxically, all those with whom I had the opportunity to speak to assured me that their factories/laboratories were running, whether in France or abroad. Often for the manufacturing of essential products for the medical staff but also to fulfil the orders of many brands who mostly sell online. My doubts are more on a one-year term, even if I remain convinced that the make-up/hybrid shift will be the keystone of the new make-up consumption trend which, unlike the skincare segment, will suffer more from this Covid19 period. But our exhibitors are full of resources, they innovate continuously and actually most of them have already positioned themselves on our platform. Premium Beauty News – As for the other events, MakeUp in Shanghai should take place in July and MakeUp in New York in September. How are the prospects? Sandra Maguarian - The recovery in China reinforces the idea that MakeUp in Shanghai will take place in the best possible conditions in early July. We have recorded no cancellations from Chinese exhibitors. They will all take part to the event and I wish to thank them for that. Actually new exhibitors have even showed up, shortly after the lock-down was lifted by Chinese authorities. Of course visitors from outside China will not make the trip, but Chinese visors alone should suffice to satisfy our exhibitors. As for MakeUp in New York, we remain vigilant and if the slightest security doubt persists, we will make the necessary decisions. One of the reasons for the positioning of our shows in different markets is to limit long distance trips and to satisfy local markets. This is why the impact of the possible disaffection of foreign visitors is relatively low. Premium Beauty News - In New York, if things turn out right, you are supposed to inaugurate a new venue, the Javits Center. Can you give us a sneak preview of what this edition will look like? Sandra Maguarian - Yes, we hesitated for a long time before embarking on this new adventure at the very famous Javits Center. One of the halls of this exhibition centre is unparalleled in New York with a huge glass roof that offers a beautiful luminosity. The Javits has become in a few years ""the place to be"", certainly thanks to the total rehabilitation of the Hudson Yards quarter, not to mention the subway station at the foot of the building. We can't wait to show it to you. Premium Beauty News - Finally, you have planned to launch a new event dedicated to Clean Beauty in London. What are the prospects like? Sandra Maguarian - It's an extraordinary impetus that has driven us to create this very first event dedicated to Clean Beauty, a must. Suppliers are showing a great deal of interest and are registering spontaneously to the event, as for brands they almost blamed us for not having launched this event earlier! We created a Steering Committee consisting of international personalities and organizations in connection with the Clean Beauty movement. Committee members will meet in the coming days.... by video-conference of course!"
"Hit hard, the luxury industry will emerge from the crisis with a new face","Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many luxury companies have pivoted to address urgent public-health needs: factories that produced scarves and perfumes now manufacture face masks and hand sanitizers, and many luxury groups have made monetary or product donations to hospitals and other not-for-profit organizations. In a longer-term, with millions of people relying on the luxury-goods industry to make a living, this unprecedented crisis forces luxury players to jump into the future now. With 20 to 30 percent of revenues generated by consumers making luxury purchases outside their home countries, the industry is heavily dependent on ""global shoppers"". [1] The suspension of most international travels therefore had an immediate effect on sales, and the impact was amplified by the closure of shops and the great confinement which followed the global spread of the virus. As the pandemic is shaking some of the foundational aspects of the luxury industry sales are set to contract between 20-35% in 2020 according to Bain & Company. [2] Actually, according to the market research firm, after strong start to the year in all key regions (Mainland China, Europe, America), the collapse of tourism and the imposition of lockdowns led to an estimated 25 percent drop of sales in the first quarter of 2020. Luxury sales in Japan and the rest of Asia also declined, albeit at a slightly slower pace. For its part, Euromonitor estimates the fall in sales of luxury goods to 18% in 2020, with no category being immune to the pandemic. [3] Most of the main luxury markets will be impacted: -25% for North America, -22% for mainland China (but only -5% in Japan and -1% in South Korea), between -15% ( United Kingdom) and -26% (Switzerland) in Western Europe, where the German market is expected to decline by 23%, France and Italy by 20%. From the start of the crisis, online sales have remained resilient. When stores are closed, e-commerce is a crucial channel for keeping sales up, communicating with customers, and forging a sense of community around a brand? For the future, McKinsey therefore recommends brands to accelerate their digital investments and shift media spending to online channels. According to Bain & Company, the online channel, already experiencing double-digit growth in 2019, will continue to gain share and account for up to 30 percent of the market by 2025. This goes hand-in-hand with the younger generations (Gen Y and Gen Z) becoming the majority of the luxury market. Furthermore, as China has begun to lead the way toward a recovery, Chinese consumers are set to cement their status as crucial drivers of the industry, accounting for nearly half of all purchases worldwide by 2025, according to Bain. As a region, mainland China will account for 28 percent of the luxury market, up from 11 percent in 2019. ""There will be a recovery for the luxury market but the industry will be profoundly transformed,"" said Claudia D'Arpizio, a Bain & Company partner and lead author of the study. However, it will take time for the market to recover. Bain & Company anticipates that a recovery to 2019 levels will not occur until 2022 or 2023. Market growth will resume gradually from then on, reaching an estimated EUR 320-330 billion by 2025."
"""Less is More"": the new normal after Covid-19 in the USA?","During the confinement, life in the big cities reorganizes, public transports are free but one must enter the bus through the door in the middle of the bus and not approach the driver. Gym classes and religious services moved on-line. In New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, the quarantine started late... women wanted to get their hair and nails done before solitary confinement. There was +3% growth in the two months of January and February, with skin care outperforming perfume and makeup (NPD). The National Retail Association had a provision of $350 billion dollars to protect small businesses. Their employees would benefit from 39 weeks of unemployment (instead of the usual 26) and they would receive an additional aid of 600$ per week. Finally, a tax credit of 15 billion dollars was allocated to those businesses that did not fire their workers. Today, the authorities in New York announced a return to the 'new normal' by mid May at best, and Chanel has guaranteed wages for its Beauty Advisors working for their company at Saks until that date. Three companies that are doing well during the crisis are Amazon, Walmart, & Target – they've rarely done better. Early in the pandemic, they put in place services to help elderly or handicapped clients. They managed to keep prices down for ""essential"" and ""non-essential"" products, while in stores in towns, prices rose. Walmart opened their Super Centers an hour earlier, and limited the number of customers by taking appointments in order to help those with reduced mobility. Scooters were made available for clients, as well as employees who would assist each client with their shopping list and a cart. Aisles were made into one-way traffic in order to limit people passing each other and to help make shopping faster. All the goods were loaded into peoples' cars or delivered to their homes. Walmart pharmacies, which usually had long waiting lines, opened a 24/24 exclusively drive through with very good results. At the beginning of the crisis, Amazon was hiring 100,000 employees, Walmart 10,000, and Target 9,000. Target and Walmart also announced they were looking for more local brands as well as local suppliers for their stores. During their confinement, American women were determined not to give up their beauty regimes: haircare, nail-care, and eyelash extensions were not to be abandoned. On March 13, the government asked dermatologists to reschedule all non-essential appointments until further order. Some have decided to take a break from intensive dermatologist treatments, certainly not for acne. Dermatologists have seen an important rise in irritations due to intensive use of hydro-alcoholic gels. Kline has announced a severe recession, a 2.5% fall in beauty care products - all the way to 80% for certain brands. Hygiene and haircare are already coming out ahead. Most likely quality will replace quantity regarding products. ""Less is more"", will become the new normal."
UK beauty addicts indulge themselves with nail products during lockdown,"Historically, the ""lipstick theory"" has proven true, with lipsticks (during the four recessions from 1973 through 2001) and eye makeup (in the most recent 2008-2009 recession) performing exceptionally well during recessionary times. With the global economy heading towards what is likely to be a historic recession, will nail colours - and more generally nail care products - be the beauty product consumers choose to indulge themselves during difficult times? Amidst the Covid-19 epidemic, sales of online nail products reported double-digit growth in the UK's first weeks of lockdown, according to The NPD Group. Sales of prestige nail products online increased 12% in the week beginning 16th March 2020, when the general public were instructed to work from home, avoid pubs and restaurants and implement social distancing. In the week beginning 23rd March 2020, following the government order for all non-essential businesses to close, online sales of prestige nail products increased 24% compared to the same period in 2019. ""With nail salons and beauty businesses closed, UK consumers turned to at-home manicure rituals to maintain their nails and boost their mood,"" commented The NPD Group in a statement. Of course, the total value of online sales alone remains modest compared to total sales during normal times. In the week beginning 23rd March 2020 consumers spent £23,000 online buying prestige nail colour (average price £14.69). Sales of base coats/topcoats increased 102%, sales of colour enamel increased 18% and sales of nail care increased 13%. During this phase of lockdown, pink, red and beige were the top three most popular shades. As far as brands and products are concerned, the best-selling nail colours of the period are (The NPD Group): Top Five Best-Selling Prestige Nail Colours (in alphabetical order) Chanel - Le Vernis Long Wear 18 Rouge Noir Chanel - Le Vernis Long Wear 504 Organdi Chanel - Le Vernis Long Wear 562 Coralium Dior - Vernis Rouge 999 YSL - La Laque Couture 01 Rouge Pop Art ""The increase in sales of nail products online, particularly intense nail enamel shades, indicates that nail care could be the 'Covid-19 Lipstick Effect'. Consumers are increasingly turning to self-care and home based beauty treatments like at-home manicures to improve wellbeing and boost their mood. An application of nail polish is quick, simple and provides an instant result,"" said Emma Fishwick, account manager, NPD UK Beauty."
"The U.S. beauty market could decline by 2.5%, the steepest drop ever","The recession due to the Covid-19 pandemic will resemble nothing known since WW2. Previously forecast to grow at a CAGR of 3.8% through 2023, Kline has revised its forecasts for the USD 75 billion U.S. market due to the unfolding crisis. New forecasts, published by Kline last week in a special report on the topic [1], indicate a decline of 2.5% in 2020 as the most likely outcome, with the best-case scenario reflecting a 1.5% gain and the worst-case scenario at an 8.1% drop. Such a drop has no precedent. So far, the 0.8% drop in 2009 during the last recession is the biggest market dip ever reported by Kline. The only other time Kline noted a market decrease was a 0.3% falloff in 1991 amid another recession. ""Given the unprecedented situation that is unfolding globally as both a health crisis as well as a financial one, it is not surprising that the beauty market should experience its worst performance now,"" says Carrie Mellage, Vice President of Kline's Consumer Products Practice. ""Even our worst-case scenario of -8% probably does not feel steep enough given the dark days we are all living, but there are enough essential categories in the mix to keep the market stable."" Indeed, Kline's forecasting analysis clusters beauty categories into four groups: – Rescue categories, such as hand sanitizers and liquid hand soaps, that will experience spiked levels; – Everyday basics, like shampoos and deodorants, which consumers are expected to more or less use as usual; – Soothing solutions, such as facial skin care and nail polishes, which are expected to decline near term but may benefit from consumers turning to them as a treat and/or to maintain or establish a part of their routine they can still control; – Can-wait categories, including fragrances and colour cosmetics, which are expected to decline sharply during social distancing of the health crisis and continue to suffer during the economic fallout in the years to come. ""The cosmetics market will undoubtedly suffer in 2020 and in the years to come, but we expect it to recover within three to five years as it has in all past recessions,"" says Mellage. ""Compared to other industries, the beauty market is fairly recession-proof, and its products will continue to be desired by consumers - both for meeting basic needs as well as an indulgence."" Historically, the ""lipstick theory"" has proven true, with lipsticks (during the four recessions from 1973 through 2001) and eye makeup (in the most recent 2008-2009 recession) performing exceptionally well during recessionary times. ""Perhaps we'll have another winner in the mix this time too,"" concludes Mellage."
Cosmetic dermatology: Five key trends spotted at IMCAS 2020,"The global medical aesthetics market is projected to reach USD 17.07 billion by 2023 from USD10.30 billion in 2018. ""Botox and fillers"" remains the leading category in terms of value (51.5%) in 2019. That's an estimated increase of 9.2% yearly until 2023. On the other hand, invasive surgical treatments have fallen by 14.5% over the past year. Artificial intelligence and the integration of robotics propelling the industry to another level, was the biggest message coming from the lectures and the exhibitions. Robotics and AI with visions systems are increasingly going to be assisting in aesthetic procedures. The highlight of the show, no doubt, was the world premiere of NextMotion, a 'world first' AI managed injector robot. A robotic arm equipped with a vision system and artificial intelligence that allows it to autonomously deliver the treatment plans decided by doctors. Combined with an electronic syringe it can steadily deliver calibrated doses to the thousand of a millimetre, with a very high accuracy, both in the positioning of the points as in the injected volumes. Virtual reality was another strong theme. The days of patients having to visit a doctor face to face in a clinic setting are not a necessity. Increasingly, consultations will be delivered in a virtual world model with a new type of clinician, the ""virtualist"" through web-based portals. It is already effective at skincheckonline.com: patients can upload selfies of themselves and the doctor uses AI to acts as its eyes. In cosmeceuticals, AI for skincare is growing. Universkin provides skincare customized by doctors using AI. Using an AI digital assistant and a very thorough dermatological questionnaire which is verified by image analysis, Universkin is able to create a personalized treatment plan. It's no longer about being masculine or feminine. There is a move away from extreme femininity and masculinity, in favour of an androgynous look. The male metrosexual is fading away, as male patients are becoming increasingly interested in women's procedures. Chin augmentation and jaw reshaping, high cheekbones, smooth skin, a thin and straight nose and a plump and luscious mouth are the new desires from men. A drive for female features that are slightly masculine are the new desire for women. A slightly masculine jaw and a straight nose. It's like having a tattoo. They want to express themselves. A recent overhaul in regulations in Europe has resulted in more rigorous scrutiny of medical device manufacturers and greater emphasis on patient safety. Specifically, the new regulation will demand that manufacturers of medical devices for sale within the EU must adhere to strict guidelines to ensure that their products are safe to use and ensure patient safety. A growth in procedures to challenge typical beauty norms was another strong theme at IMCAS. Recreating looks and giving patients the freedom to do that. A perfect example of this was Strōma Medical that uses lasers to disintegrate eye pigments, turning dark eyes into blue ones, although it turns out more of a green. But there is no way to reverse it as its permanent. The Strōma technology is not yet commercially available and is subject to more clinical trials. The brand messaging and imagery displayed by aesthetic brands at IMCAS was all about redefining attitudes, towards the accessibility and acceptability of aesthetic procedures in people across all ages and genders. In summary Consumer demand continues to drive non-invasive procedures to the top of all aesthetic procedures. The Aesthetic market is fully part of the mainstream, and appeals to all genders and ages. Androgynous looks are coming. No gender stereotypes anymore, as males are attracted to female features and women are attracted to male features. The use of technology will play an increasingly significant role across all areas of aesthetic medicine, but will not replace doctors. It will be used as an essential tool to improve patients safety and outcomes. Regulations within the industry are much needed, and we can expect that similar regulations to the ones that we see coming to Europe will expand globally in the not too distant future. With other global regions following the MDR lead."
Skincare and fragrances drive prestige beauty sales in Germany,"Within the five largest countries for sales of prestige beauty products in Europe, which are tracked by The NPD Group, Germany has the biggest prestige beauty market in value sales, after UK and France. Among these three markets, Germany is the only country that didn't show an overall decline in sales in 2019, thanks to a dynamic e-commerce channel. With sales of prestige beauty products reaching EUR 3.2 billion, the German prestige beauty market remained flat in 2019 compared to the previous year [1], with fragrances and skincare increasing by 1 percent and 3 percent, respectively, and makeup declining 4 percent. [2] With net sales totalling EUR 1.7 billion, fragrances still represent the biggest prestige beauty category in Germany. As in other developed markets, sales continue to be propelled by the growth in stronger concentrations: perfumes grew by +38 percent while eau de parfums increased by +10 percent. However, these segments only account for a small share in overall fragrance sales. ""While juices overall continued to grow in the market, gift sets declined after last year's stable result. We also see a slight decline in brick and mortar for fragrances while online continues to grow, especially driven by bigger fragrances sizes in e-commerce,"" added The NPD Group. Skincare, the second largest category in Europe's prestige beauty market, grew faster compared to fragrances. According to The NPD Group, a key factor contributing to skincare's annual performance in Germany is the double-digit growth of online sales. Indeed, e-commerce now reaches 20 percent of the category sales, while the growth of brick and mortar sales was slightly negative in 2019. In total, the category brought in EUR 0.8 billion this year, with 'German' and / or 'natural' brands as the top growth contributors. Looking at specific segments of the market, facial moisturizers and anti-aging, especially through products such as serums, grew in value sales. Also, beauty supplements continue to be a trend that's contributing to growth in Germany's prestige skincare market. Makeup had a tough year in 2019. According to The NPD Group, with a total result of EUR 0.7 billion sales in 2019, the category lost EUR 28 million compared to the previous year. Eye products, especially eye shadow palettes, were under pressure, but the face and lip segments did not escape the drop in sales. ""My one word to characterize the beauty industry in 2019 was 'consciousness' - the beauty consumer becomes more and more aware of the ingredients, environmentally friendly production and reputation of a beauty product"", said Samantha Grand, Germany Beauty Executive Director at The NPD Group. ""Transparency and sustainability become more important, and consumers focus on the social and environmental impacts of their beauty products. This could be a benefit for G-Beauty brands [3] - brands that are manufactured and designed here in Germany, as well as it will be for any brands with natural or green positioning."" A report published last year by Naturkosmetik Konzepte already highlighted the dynamic growth of natural cosmetics in Germany which had gained more than a million consumers, all distribution channels combined, in 2018."
Beyond the crisis: COVID-19's effect on consumer behaviour?,"The implementation of social distancing measures, including the encouragement to working from home, closure of bars, restaurants and most shops, have an immediate impact on consumption. As far as beauty products are concerned, the consumption of certain categories will certainly decline in the short term. In China, where people first experimented compulsory lockdowns, Kantar Worldpanel observed a drop in hair washing frequency and #nohairwash being a popular hash tag in social media. [1] ""We can foresee that in a short period, the related categories, such as hair shampoo, conditioner, will see a drop in purchasing. But in the medium to long term, with the relief of epidemic situation and people returning to work the hair care category will soon start to pick up,"" said the market research firm. In China, Kantar also noted a huge short term impact on make-up products, with a strong decrease in the frequency of use. However, as far as these products are concerned, a return to pre-epidemic habits might be more difficult. However, the increasing popularity of video conferencing, video dating, selfies and livestreaming on social networks mean many consumers - in particular the youngest ones – are still wearing makeup but they have adapted. In China and other Asian countries, some sophisticated females even invented ""face mask makeup styles"" focusing on eye makeup. In the short term, Kantar also notes a collapse in the use of fragrances during the lockdown period, since their use is strongly linked to social occasions. Nobody knows how long and how stringent lockdown measures will last in Europe and the Americas, it is pretty sure however that social distancing and hygiene habits (including frequent hand washing and the wearing of masks) will last. Led by hand wash / sanitizer, body cleansing is surely a hero category during the epidemic outbreak. The high level of use is due to continue as consumers will continue to focus on hygiene. And with the increasing frequency of washing hands, there will be an increased need for hand cream. The increased focus on cleanliness may also impact the way consumers consider ingredient safety. According to Mintel, the pandemic will have implications on the evolution of clean beauty. Prior to Covid-19, consumers were increasingly reluctant regarding ingredients such as preservatives and artificial ingredients in their beauty products due to perceived health risks. In the future, ""consumers will be more willing to accept these ingredients as long as brands provide evidence of efficacy and safety, both from a health and environmental perspective."" [2] As the arrival of the novel coronavirus will further push the notion that ""natural isn't always better"" , it could also have an impact on emerging concerns such as the cutaneous and hair microbiome. ""As consumers become more aware about viruses and germs living on surfaces, BPC products packaged in ways that eliminate the need to touch one's face will stand out. Spray and stick formats in both cosmetics and facial skincare have been increasing in popularity, and with the arrival of COVID-19, ""touchless"" beauty products will see increased demand,"" found Mintel. However, sustainability issues, as well as concerns related to shorter supply chains, and local productions, should also gain popularity, especially in Europe and North America. According to Mintel, this will encourage beauty makers to formulate without water. By offering products in a powder form, for instance, brands will appeal to consumers' safety and environmental concerns. ""Not only do waterless formulas reduce the need for preservatives, they also minimize waste,"" said the trends agency. Finally, while the lockdown period is the occasion for new age categories and demographics to test both DIY and online shopping, the impact on traditional retail channels could be severe ..."
Skincare: Consumers love superfoods and high-tech beauty,"Health benefits of superfoods are well known and their success among consumers is now extending to skin care. Indeed, beauty products enriched with these ""miracle"" grains and fruits are becoming more and more popular with consumers. This development has been highlighted by the latest Stylight, which also noted a growing enthusiasm for high-tech beauty products, CBD infused skincare, clean beauty and anti-pollution products.] report on beauty trends for 2020. For example, there was a dramatic increase of 1,650% in clicks for Beekman 1802's Pure Goat Milk Soap at the end of last month and a surge in interest in Peter Thomas Roth's Pumpkin Enzyme Face Mask, which has been saved no less than 36,000 times in Sephora wishlists. So-called ""clean beauty"" products, which feature organic, natural or - at least - non controversial ingredients, are also increasingly sought-after by consumers. In particular, Stylight highlights an upsurge of interest in brands that are tagged as ""clean,"" most notably Briogeo, whose natural hair products recorded an increase of 800% in clicks over the last five months, and The Ordinary brand which registered an increase of 260% in clicks at the end of February. For some years now, high-tech has exerted a growing influence in the world of beauty, much to the delight of beauty addicts who now benefit from more effective home-care treatments. Facial cleansing brushes are particularly popular, notably those made by the Foreo brand, which saw a 465% increase in clicks at the beginning of 2020. Last but not least, in an extension of the trend for natural, vegan and protective treatments, there has been an increase in searches, clicks and purchases of cannabis-infused and anti-pollution products. To compile its report, Stylight analyzed data from October 2019 to February 2020, on the behavior of its users who together purchase more than 100,000 beauty products per month, via Stylight online platforms in Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom. Stylight searches 1,300 online shops at once and compare prices of more than 27 million products."
The coronavirus pandemic pushes the world economy into uncertainty,"The coronavirus pandemic is leading to a historic drop in equity markets globally, shut borders and disrupted daily life around the world, as governments took increasingly drastic measures to try to reduce the severity of the global outbreak. Far from having been contained in China, the viral outbreak has now caused more deaths outside the country than inside. Spain and France imposed severe lockdowns over the weekend, now followed by other European countries and by the United States. ""The problem of technical disruptions in certain production chains has become a secondary issue. We are facing a brutal supply and demand breakdown that impacts multiple channels,"" said Olivier Passet, Director of Research at Xerfi. If many economists expect a violent but temporary shock with a recession over two quarters, depending on the area, the damage could nevertheless be significant. Beyond the transport and leisure industries, which are massively impacted, some start-ups that have not yet demonstrated their profitability could be the first to fail. ""We can estimate that 10 to 15% of the economy could end up in a dire situation, with powerful ripple effects on a third of the economy,"" said Olivier Passet. As a result, the global financial situation is also tightening. ""Measures of economic uncertainty such as equity market volatility increased sharply in countries around the world,"" said the IMF. ""Credit spreads have widened broadly across markets as investors are reallocating from relatively risky to safer assets."" Finally, with borders being back, the pandemic could mark the entry into a new phase of re-localisation. With increased concerns related to ethics, sustainability, costs, speed and flexibility, proximity had already became a key factor of success for many players, in particular in the high-end packaging industry. In addition to this natural shift, the question is: will the pandemic-linked recession amplify the recent trade wars or lead to a greater international co-operation?"
"U.S.A: Prestige beauty sales remained flat in 2019, said The NPD Group","The USD 7.6 billion makeup category still represents the largest share of beauty sales. A key factor contributing to makeup's annual performance (-7%) is the overall decline in makeup usage. Indeed, nearly one-quarter of women in the U.S. are using much/somewhat less makeup today, found The NPD Group in The Changing Face of Makeup, the market research firm's latest report in conjunction with CivicScience. The findings show that casualization is factoring into this, with more women working from home and also embracing a more natural look. ""'Natural' is a big buzz word in many industries, especially beauty – in terms of product ingredients as well as consumers looking to achieve a more natural look. How makeup responds to this movement will be key to its revival,"" said Larissa Jensen, vice president and beauty industry advisor, The NPD Group. ""Historically, NPD data has detected a shift between makeup and skincare every four to five years. Based on this, and the slowdown in makeup that began to take hold in 2017, I anticipate we'll see makeup rebound in the next one to two years."" Skincare brought in USD 5.9 billion for the year, and natural was the top growth contributor. Natural brands represented 30% of total skincare and sales grew by 14% over 2018. Looking at specific segments of the market, staples such as cleansers and moisturizers grew and more targeted treatments were among the top performers, including acne treatments, brighteners, exfoliators, and lip treatments. Eventually, fragrance sales totaled USD 4.5 billion and this was propelled by the growth in stronger concentrations - perfumes (+49%) and eaux de parfums (+9%). While artisanal fragrances continued to grow at the fastest rate, it is the success of top ranked designer brands that captured the largest share of category sales, which has driven the sales performance. ""My one word to characterize the beauty industry in 2019 was 'disruption;' my word for 2020 is 'connection' – not in terms of technology and devices, but the human connection we have to each other, to brands, and to the environment,"" said Jensen. ""As topics such as transparency and sustainability become more mainstream, consumers are putting the social and environmental impacts of their purchase decisions front and center, and brands will need to act accordingly."""
Cosmoprof rescheduled for September as WHO labels coronavirus a 'pandemic',"The outbreak of Covid-19 continues to turn the annual calendar of international trade fairs upside down. The organizers of the Cosmoprof show in Bologna, Italy, have just announced a new postponement of the event, which will finally take place from September 3 to 7, 2020. ""Since the beginning of the emergency linked to the outbreak of Coronavirus in Italy on 23 February, we have been constantly monitoring the situation, with the aim of identifying the best solutions to support the cosmetic industry,"" said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. ""The restrictions affecting our country and the limitations on international travels announced by other nations do not currently create the necessary preconditions for the business and networking activities at the basis of a global event such as Cosmoprof. The decision to further postpone the show in September, also based on evident prudential reasons related to the health emergency, is the result of a responsible dialogue with associations and institutions, with the common goal of creating the best scenario for the relaunch of the sector."" The World Health Organization called the new coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday. The number of cases across the globe has risen to more than 124,000 with 4,500 deaths, including a jump in fatalities in Iran and Italy in particular, according to an AFP tally. Signs of a widening European crisis emerged Wednesday, with Ireland, Albania, Belgium, Sweden and Bulgaria registering their first deaths, while Italy clocked more than 2,300 new cases in the last 24 hours and infections in Spain jumped by a quarter to more than 2,100. Cuba, Brunei, Honduras, Bolivia, Ivory Coast and Turkey have announced the diagnosis of the first cases on their territory. The United States saw the first signs of an emergency footing with the New York government forming a containment zone around the suburb of New Rochelle at the centre of an outbreak. At the same time, President Donald Trump announced that he will close its borders for 30 days to travellers from most European countries. ""Cosmoprof is an international event, which every year attracts over 265,000 operators from 150 countries to Bologna. The actual restrictions are limiting the presence in Italy of buyers, distributors and retailers from the main markets in Europe, Asia and America for the next few months, thus draining the lifeblood of our event as well,"" explained Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof SpA. Wall Street stocks dove deeper into the red in afternoon trading Wednesday. More generally, disruption to supply chains from China, flagging demand and wildly fluctuating stock markets have sparked a series of profit warnings from companies. Yesterday, the organizers of the Esxence show in Milan also announced a second postponement of the event."
The French beauty cosmetics market remains fragile,"According to Kantar, sales of beauty and hygiene products recorded a paradoxical growth in 2019. Indeed, ""hygiene-beauty occasions"" (the number of uses per individual and per week) continued to decrease, down from 44.2 in 2018 to 44.1 in 2019. Even if it seems a minor decrease, in particular compared to the previous years (the index was at 49.1 in 2015), it shows that buyers are still in a de-consumption mood. ""This phenomenon is explained by a continuous simplification of beauty routines,"" explained Anaïs Dupuy, Business development Manager at Kantar. In such a context, the rise in sales recorded in 2019 is mainly explained by the impact of sales promotions which encouraged consumers to buy more products and stock them, highlights Kantar warning about a potential backlash this year. In 2019, consumers bought 51 products on average, compared to just over 50 in 2018. This resurgence of sales is not due to the 25-34 year old, who tend to reduce their purchases, but to senior buyers - especially the 50+. The most dynamic categories are hygiene products, with hair and shower products (+4% by volume) performing well, while makeup is the category that suffered the most with a decline of 5.5% in volume compared to the previous year. For their purchases, French consumers visit more and more retail channels: 3.38 on average in 2019, compared to 3.25 in 2015. However, perfumeries, super and hyper markets continue to lose market shares, while discount shops and hard discounters are progressing. According to Kantar, these figures show that French are looking for good deals and good prices, and are therefore ready to visit more outlets. Finally, the success of green cosmetics continues unabated. According to Kantar, the category has gained nearly 8.1 million consumers since 2015, and buyers of these products spend more and more frequently. ""All indicators are green for this trend,"" concluded Anaïs Dupuy. As far as prestige beauty products are concerned, sales continued to decrease in 2019 (-1%), for the fifth consecutive year. ""Since 2015, the French prestige beauty market has lost 4% in value,"" said Mathilde Lyon, Europe Beauty Expert at The NPD Group. However, sales during the fourth quarter were very strong and compensated a large part of the losses recorded during from Q1 to Q3. In particular, there was a sharp increase of sales during the Black Friday week (+22% compared to 2018) which is now the second best performing week of the year, with 82% of sales made with a discount. The French market has also benefited from a surge in the number of tourists in 2019. According to The NPD Group, Global Shoppers - who do not buy only in duty-free - represent 8% of the French prestige beauty market, up 13% compared to 2018. As in other countries sales of prestige make-up declined strongly, however contrary to other markets the skincare category did not take over in France and sales remained flat."
"Bologna, Barcelona, Düsseldorf... the coronavirus impacts major beauty fairs","The postponement of the Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna show, one of the main events in the global cosmetics industry, had the effect of a bombshell. The fair should normally take place from 11 to 15 June 2020, provided that the situation evolves positively in Italy. A few days later, the organizers of the in-cosmetics Global show, which was to be held at the end of the month in Barcelona, were also forced to announce the postponement of the event from June 30 to July 2, 2020. Several other trade shows have also been postponed: – PCHI China, the first to be rescheduled, should eventually be held from 02-04 June 2020 in Shanghai, – Beauty Düsseldorf and Top Hair - Die Messe Düsseldorf will be held on 18-20 September 2020, – originally scheduled for 08-09 April 2020, MakeUp in Shanghai and Luxe Pack Shanghai, should take place on 07-08 July 2020 at the Shanghai Exhibition Center, – The 12th edition of Esxence - The Art Perfumery Event in Milan has been postponed from May 30 to June 2, as well as the Experience Lab fair. – the M.A.D.E. Paris show, initially scheduled for March 17 and 18, is postponed to May 13 and 14, 2020, Furthermore, the TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition & Conference was due to be held in Singapore on May 10-14 has been cancelled. However, the organizers of the World Perfumery Congress (WPC), which is to be held from June 02 to 04, 2020 at the Miami Beach Convention Center, have announced will be held as scheduled. In a context where many large companies have decided to limit travels of their staffs, trade show postponements are disrupting the communication of suppliers. While Cosmoprof Asia was disrupted by protests in Hong Kong in November, access to innovations is further complicated. Of course, postponing or canceling international trade shows is just one of the many problems associated with the Covid-19 outbreak. More than 110,000 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in over 100 countries since the epidemic erupted in December in Wuhan, China. According to an AFP toll based on official sources, the outbreak killed 3,862 people, with the vast majority of fatalities being in China. Italy - Europe's worst-affected country - reported 97 more deaths on Monday, bringing its toll to 463 and pushing Europe's total past 500. The situation disorganizes many supply chains and has a massive impact on sales in travel retail and luxury goods. The health emergency is thus coupled with an economic alert. European stock markets slumped dramatically, following a dramatic downturn in Asia, with indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt falling by seven percent or more."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna postponed to June,"With more than 265,000 visitors and more than 3,000 exhibiting companies in 2019, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is one of the most important trade fairs for the global cosmetic industry. Initially scheduled on March 12-15, the show is postponed to June 11-15, 2020. ""The latest news concerning novel corona virus in Italy have forced us to review our positions,"" said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere in a statement. ""In agreement with the Regional Government of Emilia Romagna and with the Municipality of Bologna, we have assessed the situation, and postponing the event is currently the most correct solution, to support Italian institutions engaged today in protecting our health."" The 2020 program and special initiatives will not undergo substantial changes, added the organizers. Almost at the same time, the organizers of Luxe Pack Shanghai also announced the postponement of their event. Originally scheduled for April 8 and 9, 2020, Luxe Pack Shanghai should finally be held on July 7 and 8, 2020 at the Shanghai Exhibition Center. When the first cases emerged in China, the PCHI trade show, focusing on personal care ingredients, had already been postponed before being finally rescheduled on June 2 and 4 in Shanghai. The World Health Organization on Monday said the new coronavirus epidemic had ""peaked"" in China with new cases declining steadily there, but warned that a surge in cases elsewhere was ""deeply concerning"" and all countries should prepare for a ""potential pandemic"". Recent developments also caused falls of more than three-percent in several European stock markets - with Milan plunging 5.4 percent - amid fears the epidemic could hit the global economy. The International Monetary Fund has already lowered its growth forecast for China in 2020 by 0.4 points to 5.6%. With China being the world's second largest economy, this decline should cost 0.1 point of growth to global GDP. The crisis is not only impacting global tourism and sales of consumer goods, especially luxury goods, but is also disrupting value chains, with many production sites closed or idling in China."
"Dave Lackie, Sarah Berryman and Hannah Ween named top three beauty influencers on Twitter","Dave Lackie (@davelackie), editor and founder at Beauty Departure magazine, was revealed as the top influencer during the fourth quarter of 2019.

Among the companies, Sephora has emerged as the most discussed company among the beauty experts, followed by Clarins and Boots UK, respectively. The conversations about Sephora were led by its winter beauty product collection, which includes Winter time eye & face palette with warm neutrals, crystal face palettes and earth eye palettes. According to GlobalData, in Q4 2019, 'Makeup' emerged as the top trend discussed among the industry experts, followed by 'Skin Care', 'Lipstick' and 'Eye Shadow'. The conversation about make-up was largely driven by the latest collection of makeup products launched by different companies in the market."
France: Perfumes and cosmetics exports passed the 15 billion euro mark in 2019,"French exports of cosmetic products continued to grow in 2019, with an increase of more than 9%, according to figures released by French Customs on February 7. For more than 10 years, exports have driven the growth of the French perfumes and cosmetics industry and reached 15.7 billion euros in 2019. The cosmetics industry remains a major pillar of the French foreign trade, the second most performant sector after the aeronautics. Moreover, French cosmetics also attract tourists: out of 5 cosmetic products sold in France, 1 product is bought by a foreign visitor. In total, more than 50% of the French production is exported. Europe remains the number one destination for French cosmetics exports, followed by the United States and Asia. The latter is growing in importance, with exports to China skyrocketing (+48% in 2019 compared to 2018). China , which was the 7th market in 2018 for French cosmetics now ranks 4th. Exports to South Korea (+26%) and Singapore (+16%) also sharply increased. Today, one out of five French cosmetic products is sold in Asia. After an average increase of 10% per year since 2013, exports of cosmetics have enabled France to maintain its position as world leader with an estimated market share of 23%. Skin care is the main product category among French cosmetics exports, it represents more than 7.3 billion euros, an increase of more than 46% over the last five years. Perfumes and toilet waters also perform extremely well with sales abroad reaching more than 4.8 billion euros, up by 23% over the last five years. While the makeup category only comes in third position, exports of coloured products for the lips have increased by almost 80% over the last five years to reach more than 730 million euros in 2019. It is therefore not surprising that Hermès chose this category for its first foray into the make-up sector. According to FEBEA, the trade organization gathering French cosmetics makers, this success is based on solid positions in ""all the levels of the value chain"". For instance, the cosmetics industry's R&D is the most efficient in France, with 3.6 patents filed per million euros spent. ""This success is also based on the entrepreneurial dynamism of the sector,"" added Patrick O'Quin, FEBEA president. ""Each year, 170 new cosmetic companies are created in France, fuelled by the sector's abundant innovation. Alongside major internationally recognized groups, our sector brings together almost 85% of SMEs, spread across France. In particular, in the territories which found ways to enhance their historical know-how in the field of perfumes - Provence for example - or their natural resources, Brittany in particular, thanks to the success of marine cosmetic ingredients."""
"""Independence restores the meaning to the art of perfumer,"" Nathalie Feisthauer","Premium Beauty News - You worked for large perfume houses before becoming independent?

Then I joined Symrise. I was fortunate enough to discover the creative process when times were very different from now and to meet in teams or brands, fascinating personalities.

Nathalie Feisthauer - Today it would be impossible to launch a perfume like Poison de Dior, for example. Brand interlocutors now mostly have a marketing approach. Furthermore, to alleviate the burden and responsibility of a launch, we now work with ten teammates on the development of a fragrance before it is tested. We are not looking for the best fragrance, but for one that will not displease anyone. We work for two years on finding an audacious accord for which we spend two years more smoothing. It's very frustrating. This approach leaves little room for artistic creation. Perfume has become a product like any other. Premium Beauty News - Hence the desire to leave this system? Nathalie Feisthauer - Yes. I suddenly realized, I had had enough of this context, which is blatant from a marketing point of view: we programme best-sellers that don't sell, with a limited lifespan. Besides, with the exception of J'adore by Dior, great successes rarely pass consumer tests, like Coco Mademoiselle, Angel, Light Blue, Terre d'Hermès… The system has become complete nonsense. So I wanted to find meaning by founding my own laboratory. The question is not so much how to create an original or popular perfume, but rather how to follow a project in its entirety. Premium Beauty News - Have you found a new lease of life in niche perfumery? Nathalie Feisthauer - Yes. A bit like a disillusioned chef who decides to open his little inn to reconnect with fine products and people who appreciate them. I also reconnected with some aspects of the trade that I like, by being in direct contact with the client. In the beginning when I was working in a large perfume house, I used to exchange with clients, even if contacts took place with marketers. Over time, my role was limited to the formulation of accords that I no longer presented in meetings. Today, assessors are the ones who choose the tests to propose to brands, sometimes by tapping into old projects that won't necessarily fit to the brief. You therefore no longer have the possibility to choose or to explain your creative process. It is, once again, very frustrating. Fortunately, as a freelance perfumer, I discovered the much-appreciated freedom of being able to choose the accords that I propose. Premium Beauty News - What does your customer base look like today? Nathalie Feisthauer - I work with the Gulf countries, especially the United Arab Emirates, but also with Russia, the United States and many European countries. So I work on a wide variety of projects, whether they are won, lost or in progress, which is pleasant. In Dubai, many customers want to interact directly with the perfumer, which opens up opportunities. This diversity nourishes me. Premium Beauty News - You are also very popular in Russia! Nathalie Feisthauer - Yes, for the past three years, my work has been very appreciated over there. I won two FIFI Awards over there last November, and I regularly receive masterclasses of Russian perfume students wishing to improve their skills in France. It is a fun country, where people intensely love perfume. It is also a very open market, where small players are more visible. And this is also true for Iran or the United Arab Emirates. Premium Beauty News - Tell us more about Fluo_ral by Nomenclature, which was singled out at the last FIFI Awards in Russia. Nathalie Feisthauer - The brand Nomenclature was created by Karl Bradl and Carlos Quintero from the Aedes de Venustas boutique in New York. The idea was to divert calone from its iodized, marine side, to reveal it in a darker light. To illustrate the packaging of Fluo_Ral I drew inspiration from the photo of a sea in a dark night in which some fluorescent algae sparkled. I dressed it with rhubarb, blackcurrant, pink berries and floral notes against a woody base, dominated by incense. An interesting exercise, with an innovative rendering. Premium Beauty News - Did you observe that olfactory preferences changed according to the markets? Nathalie Feisthauer - Not specifically. If oud wood remains unavoidable in the Gulf, the region has opened up to other, more classic influences. The offer is therefore very varied in the area, this significant gap being propitious to an evolution in tastes. In Russia, the offer is also very wide. The market has also evolved a lot in France over the past ten years, particularly under the influence of Middle East customers. Premium Beauty News - What is your viewpoint on the evolution of the niche perfume market? Nathalie Feisthauer - Originally, niche perfumery was born from a quest for meaning and originality. For me, the niche is a perfume shop that adopts the artistic vision of a creator, far from the more homogeneous proposition of the selective circuit. This is what I like, to transcribe a story, with an olfactory bias. But today, niche perfumery has evolved considerably. Niche brands have multiplied, resulting in an effect that I would describe as a ""false niche"": that is to say, pioneer houses who today depend on large groups. On the other hand, we see emerging some small, highly technical alternative brands, but who cannot compete financially and struggle to impose themselves in terms of distribution. Not to mention big perfume houses in the selective, which almost all have a prestigious exclusive collection featuring the codes of the niche. A context, in which this perfumery, which intends to be more personal, born in the shades of a commercial approach, returns in the hands of large groups, in terms of distribution. It's a rather ironic development when you look at. Niche perfumery is difficult to describe because it is multiple, the positive side being that there is currently room for every desire, every project."
Novel coronavirus sends shockwaves through the travel retail industry,"The impact of the current health crisis on several economic sectors, including tourism, luxury goods, and prestige fashion and beauty retails, is likely to be worse than during the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003 or the swine flu crisis in 2009, simply because so many more Chinese people travel abroad and buy these products than back then. In this context, high-end fashion and beauty brands are logically displaying support to their key market in Asia, pledging millions of dollars to support the fight against the novel coronavirus. The Kering Group, parent company of brands including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, and Ulysse Nardin, announced on Tuesday that it would donate CNY 7.5 million (USD 1.08 million) to the Red Cross Foundation in Hubei. On Monday, Paris-based fashion conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy, which owns Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Celine, and Christian Dior, pledged CNY 16 million (USD 2.3 million) to the Chinese Red Cross Foundation. French personal care company L'Oréal pledged to donate CNY 5 million, while U.S. cosmetics company Estée Lauder promised CNY 2 million; and Austrian producer of glass Swarovski CNY 3 million. The travel industry is the first to be impacted. Mainland China with its 1.3 billion inhabitants is the top contributor to world tourism numbers with 159 million foreign trips in 2019 according to GlobalData. Most Chinese tourists go elsewhere in Asia, most often to Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. When they venture further afield it's usually to Europe, the United States or Australia. France is their top destination in Europe, with 2.2 million Chinese visitors in 2018, followed by Germany, Italy and the UK. The detrimental impact of the outbreak on air passenger numbers will also cause concern for airport retailers. ""Over the last few years airport retailers, especially those in Europe, have tailored their propositions, integrated Chinese payment solutions and invested in Mandarin-speaking staff to target Chinese passengers and maximize sales growth opportunities,"" says Honor Strachan, Principal Analyst at GlobalData. In 2003, SARS caused tourism spend in China to collapse while visitor numbers to Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong significantly dropped off, causing airlines to ground planes and reduce flight schedules. Coronavirus has already dented retail and leisure spending across the Chinese New Year holiday due to consumers being encouraged, and in some cases forced, to stay in and avoid travel. In response to the crisis, retailers are considering closing stores, with the China Duty Free Group closing its mall in Haitang Bay – impacting the APAC duty free market in 2020. ""Asia Pacific is forecast to be the fastest performing region for airport retail spend in 2020, with sales rising 8.4% to US$21.7bn - 45.1% of the global channel. If the coronavirus continues to spread globally over the course of 2020 its impact on tourism and economies, particularly across APAC, could be severe,"" adds Strachan. And the crisis effects will be felt beyond airports, hotels, restaurants and tourist sites. As tourists, and specifically Chinese tourists are also big spenders, the shockwaves will probably impact most luxury and premium brands. Actually, the crisis has already sent Japan's key Nikkei index plunging, with stock in Shiseido falling more than five percent on Monday."

All brands participating in the event will be gathered and promoted under one single roof. Panel discussions featuring brand founders will also be held, concomitant to skincare, makeup and hair masterclasses.

"Convenience and personal control to top 2020 global consumer trends, according to Euromonitor International","This year again, Euromonitor International. They try to strike a balance between the two and that not always easy as sometimes these are complimentary desires, but they may also conflict with each other. For instance, to achieve greater convenience, consumers may be required to relinquish personal control. The amount of data and privacy consumers will exchange for these desirable benefits will vary by culture, territory and individual. According to Euromonitor, brands must find the right balance between building trust, providing security and delivering products and services that add value to outweigh consumer concerns in the year ahead.] takes stock of the changing expectations and behaviours of consumers.

Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2020 to explore the new frontiers of beauty,"From 12 to 15 March with Cosmopack and Cosmo|Perfumery & Cosmetics and from 13 to 16 March with Cosmo|Hair, Nail & Beauty Salon, the B2B event will host experts to share the possible factors that, from now until 2030, will characterize the evolution of beauty worldwide and how the industry will have to adapt to phenomena such as the digital revolution, new forms of socialization, attention to sustainability and environmental resources, and the multicultural evolution of our society. At the main entrance of the show, a dedicated area will host 32 start-ups specialized in online platforms, digital solutions, virtual apps for product testing, e-make-up and 3D make-up services, software and services for customization, new solutions for retail stores, and interactive digital platforms. This ""beauty tech"" area will be located within the Garden of Innovation, managed by the beauty trends agency Beautystreams and dedicated to the megatrends that will influence the society in the future and to the innovations that will characterize the beauty sector in the next 10 years. The start-ups will participate in Cosmoprof Next - a pitch competition that will promote the best projects. As industry players, from global leaders to indie brands, are increasing relying on the know-how of the cosmetics supply chain, Cosmopack, the part of the show dedicated to contract manufacturing and private labels, process and packaging machinery, primary and secondary packaging, applicators, ingredients and raw materials, is gaining momentum. In addition to pavilions 20, 15, 15A and 18, Cosmopack expands its presence in 19PK, part of hall 19. To optimize the visit routes, the development of Cosmopack foresees an increasingly marked division between the different specialties of the supply chain, and in 2021 an entire pavilion will be dedicated exclusively to machinery. Hall 15 will host international manufacturers specialized in full services for the industry. Focus of the hall 18 will once again be the OEM and packaging companies. In addition, this year, The Factory (the live presentation of the manufacturing process of a specific cosmetic product) will present a face-foundation suitable for multiple skin tones, thus answering to a new approach focused on diversity and multicultural society. Also opening from Thursday 12 to Sunday 15 March, Cosmo|Perfumery & Cosmetics, the part of the show dedicated to finished beauty products sold through retail channels, will feature a special area focusing on the transformation affecting the beauty universe. In addition, a ""Garden of Fragrances"", in partnership with Nez la Revue Olfactive, will imagine the place of perfumes in 2030 not as objects but as a part of a broader olfactory culture. Also in the Cosmo|Perfumery & Cosmetics section, the Cosmoprime zone will gather young brands and the Zoom On Emerging Prime will host young companies entering the international business of Cosmoprof for the first time. In addition, the Extraordinary Gallery will focus on the most innovative Indie Beauty brands. Exhibiting companies will have the possibility to participate in the Cosmoprof & Cosmopack Awards 2020. A jury made of 50 opinion leaders, representing trend experts, managers and R&D, designers, journalists and influencers, will select the most innovative entries. For Cosmoprof Awards, there are five categories dedicated to the best proposals in finished product: Skin Saviors, New Kid, Hair Industry breakthrough, Make-up and Nail game-changer of the year, Nature Miracles. The Cosmopack Awards will celebrate the excellence in the supply chain, following 5 categories: The Fountain of Youth: the ageless Skincare formula, Luminary make-up packaging, Designers' delight in packaging, The make-up formula transformer, Champion of sustainability. Winners will be announced on March, Friday 13, at the Service Center."
"Cosme Tokyo to spotlight ""made in Japan"" and natural products","After breaking its previous records last year, with 762 exhibitors from 30 countries and 25,627 visitors, the organizers of the three day show announce almost 900 exhibitors from 35 countries and expect 30 000 visitors this year. The show is held at the same time and under the same roof than two other events: Cosme Tech Tokyo, dedicated to the development of cosmetic products and gathering packaging and ingredients suppliers, and Inner Beauty Tokyo, dedicated to beauty and health foods. The three events form the Cosme Week Tokyo, concomitant to the Life Style Week which features eight specialized trade fairs focusing on gifts, baby and kid products, stationary, homeware and fashion. This unrivalled conjunction of events helps to attract a large number of visitors. With the J-Beauty label being one of the most attractive trend around the globe - certifying both quality and technology - visitors from the rest of Asia-Pacific region, but also from North America and Europe come to visit the show in order to source innovative products or get inspiration from local trends. ""Recently, we have seen the rise of Japanese cosmetic products using regional and traditional ingredients such as horse oil, salmon collagen, mild rice bran water from Kyoto or Mt Fuji water,"" explain the organizers. Reflecting the continued growth of the organic/natural beauty market in Japan and Asia, this segment now accounts for an important part of the show floor. As far as ""made in Japan"" products are concerned, the use of local ingredients is a predominant trend for natural and organic products too, in particular local botanicals, or typically Japanese substances such as SakeKasu (Japanese sake extract). With Japan being the world's second largest cosmetics market, the show also attracts numbers of international exhibitors. About 35 countries should participate in the 2020 show, mostly from Europe - including France, Italy, Poland and Germany - and the USA. Exhibitors from other Asian countries, in particular from Korea, and from Middle East also showcase their products. Cosme Tokyo January 20 to 22, 2020 Makuhari Messe, Japan Website: cosmetokyo.jp"
Veganism was one of the hottest beauty trends in 2019,"Prestige skincare brand CeraVe already sells animal product-free products in the UK and multiple other countries, but the company announced plans this year to make its products more vegan-friendly in the US and Canada. Back in February, the L'Oréal-owned label set itself the target of making its offerings in North America more than 90 percent vegan by the year 2021, and told Allure that it was working on replacing one of its ingredients, a type of cholesterol derived from sheep's wool, with a vegan version. Another L'Oreal-owned label, Dermablend Professional, also took steps towards championing animal welfare this year by becoming certified cruelty-free by PETA and announcing plans to cut animal-derived ingredients from its formulas to ensure that they are 100% vegan. ""People are looking for brands that align with their values and our goal is to empower our consumers with the confidence and knowledge they need to make the best decisions for their beauty routines,"" said Malena Higuera, General Manager at Dermablend Professional, at the time. Avon was another titan to pivot towards veganism, unveiling a five-piece skincare collection called 'The Distillery' in September. Free from animal products and harmful chemicals, the products also featured low-water formulas and recycling packaging, where possible. Besides the new lines and new orientations global beauty giants in the way they are approaching the use of animal-derived ingredients, 2019 also saw the arrival of several new, vegan beauty brands. From Millie Bobby Brown's 'Florence By Mills' line to Kesha's label 'Kesha Rose Beauty,' the industry's hottest new additions were noticeably free of animal products, suggesting that vegan beauty is here to stay."
Skincare sales on the rise in Spain as women opt for a more natural look and young men get more interested in beauty products,"According to Kantar's latest study on beauty, hygiene and personal care habits [1], 72% of Spanish women claim to use little make-up and prefer a more natural look, as opposed to 62% of women worldwide. Such results translate into a long-term decline of make-up, while facial moisturising products that help skin look healthy are added to the routine. However, purchasing behaviours vary according to age. The youngest group, from 17 to 24 years, associates a more natural look with a well-groomed look. They achieve this by using make-up products such as powders, concealers and foundations, in that order. On the other hand, older women prefer to wear no make-up on their face, showing their natural beauty. Furthermore, Kantar notes the natural look trend in Spain has been able to coexist with other apparently opposing fashions, such as elaborate hairstyles and decorated nails. The number of people using professional manicure services for example, has grown by 4 percentage points in the last year. Another trend that is fast on the rise in the country is the growth of the men's beauty and hygiene market. According to Kantar, the number of Spanish men who say they are well informed of the latest trends and fashions in personal care is 34%, 10 points above the European average. The upshot is that men now make up 4 out of every 10 cases of weekly product use, half of which is from the 25 to 54 age bracket. At the purchase level, the industry has bounced back slightly in the past year, billing 1.3% higher than in 2018, but 14% less than ten years ago. However, retail traffic remains at a standstill."
How beauty brands addressed sustainability in 2019,"Dove hit the headlines in October, when it announced plans to replace its plastic bottles with recycled ones and reduce its virgin plastic use by more than 20,500 tonnes per year. The Unilever-owned beauty giant will start the process of launching new, 100% recycled plastic bottles (where possible), across all its product ranges in North America and Europe by the end of this year. The Procter & Gamble-owned personal care brand Gillette made all its disposable razors and replaceable-blade cartridge units recyclable in Canada this year. The brand also rolled out a program with waste management company TerraCycle, making it easier for Canadian consumers to recycle their old razors. P&G-owned haircare label Herbal Essences marked World Water Day in March with a series of recyclable shampoo and conditioner bottles comprising 25% beach plastic. The limited-edition bottles, which were created in partnership with TerraCycle, were available through June 2019. The L'Occitane Group, which counts the beauty brands L'Occitane en Provence, Melvita, and Erborian as part of its portfolio, teamed up with the sustainable plastic innovator Loop Industries this year to get more eco-friendly with its packaging. The group plans to incorporate Loop PET plastic (which is 100% sustainable) into its product packaging from the year 2022. British luxury retailer Selfridges announced in November that it is banning single-use, plastic-based beauty wipes from its store shelves, in a bid to encourage more sustainable purchases instead. It is estimated that the wipes can take up to 100 years to fully degrade. In July Brazil-based beauty giant Natura & Co, which owns the brands Natura, Aesop and The Body Shop, pledged to limit its contribution to global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, as part of the ""Business Ambition for 1.5°C: Our Only Future"" campaign. The group also committed to reaching net-zero emissions by the year 2050. Garnier USA marked Earth Day by encouraging people to recycle their beauty empties and offering shoppers a free recycling bin. The brand, which has an ongoing partnership with the with waste management company TerraCycle, claims to have diverted more than 11.9 Million empties from landfills. L'Oréal has been working on making beauty packaging more environmentally-friendly with the packaging company Albéa. The duo announced the invention of a carton-based cosmetic tube in October, which sees plastic for the most part replaced with a bio-based, paper-like material. The creation is expected to start going into industrial production in the second half of 2020."
Global Shoppers boost global perfume sales,"Overall, the year 2018 revealed positive trends in the Americas, with a +6% and +10% growth in the US and South America, respectively, while Europe achieved a relatively stable growth at +1%. However, the data released in late September 2019 highlight rebalanced growth dynamics. The North-American market experienced a marked slowdown, with a rate reduced to +1%, and Europe made some progress, with +2%. Still, these improved dynamics in Europe remain driven by the same markets as in 2018, i.e. Southern countries, Spain (+5%), and Italy (+6%), while France and the UK recorded null or negative values. ""It should be said there is a major difference to take into account: perfumes remain the premier category of prestige beauty in Europe, in all countries, contrary to North America, where they are the 3rd category after makeup and skincare. This means Europe is a prominent area on the perfume market. And in terms of turnover, it represents more than twice the US,"" explains Mathilde Lion. If Europe remains a key market, it is also partly due to its counting the most tourists: 767 million in 2018 (+6%, compared to 2017). And these count among the biggest perfume consumers, both in Travel Retail and on local markets. ""This phenomenon cannot but intensify, and it already has a significant effect on the category,"" adds Mathilde Lion. Indeed, beauty is the category that attracts half the visitors in Duty Free areas. And within this category, 67% of consumers turn to women's perfumes, and more than half, 56%, make a purchase, which is the highest conversion rate in Travel Retail. In addition, women's perfumes offer the highest global average buying basket (66USD), which is even higher among Asian travellers: up to 99USD for Chinese tourists. One of the main market changes is the growing potential of e-commerce. ""On the most connected markets, it is really e-commerce that drives perfumes' growth, although the penetration rate is lower than on the other categories. Online skincare has boomed,"" says Mathilde Lion. Perfume penetration rates remain low: in 2018, they reached 17% in the UK, 14% in the US, and only 7% in France, so there is a huge potential to harness. However, there was a slowdown in perfume on this channel in France between January and October 2019, with a 7% growth in this category, compared to 16% in 2018. Secondly, Eaux de Parfum dominate women's perfumes, and this trend has also been intensifying in the men's perfumes category, to the detriment of Eaux de Toilette. ""Higher concentrations are increasingly popular in men's fragrances, and this is going to last,"" foresees the analyst. In Europe, men's Eaux de Parfum launches had increased by 32% in late September 2019, and there was a 4% increase in women's – no change compared to 2018. Third, the lower growth rate of fragrances over 150 euros (fine and niche fragrances, leading brands' exclusive collections…) is worth mentioning. This category grew by 6% in 2019, compared to the two-digit growth rate observed over the past few years. ""There are fewer launches. And if these fragrances still contribute to perfumes' upmarket move, they will not change anything on the global level, because they represent a very limited market share,"" comments Mathilde Lion. Lastly, naturalness is gradually inviting itself in the perfume category. The natural perfume market achieved a very strong growth in 2017 in the US, and then a slowdown in 2018, although ethical and ingredient expectations are still strong. ""This trend still weighs very little on this market: 19 million dollars in the US, i.e. 0.5% of the market. So, there is a gap to bridge,"" explains Mathilde Lion. In conclusion, the growth is maintained, although there are distribution issues to take into account. Consumer expectations change, there are still as many launches, which keeps the category healthy, and the naturalness demand is slowly emerging. We will see what happens during the festive season, which is still likely to influence results in any country."
Information & Inspiration becomes Asia Cosme Lab and broadens Asian market deciphering,"For almost 20 years, Florence Bernardin and her team have been deciphering and analyzing Asian consumers, trends, and cosmetic products. Thanks to an ever-growing expertise, they highlighted flagship products from Korea, like the BB cream and cushions, and deciphered Chinese market expectations. Now, they are focusing on the offering developed in South-East Asia, a region rich in indie, nature-oriented brands. Their approach targeting brands and suppliers unveiled the richness and inventiveness of this area in terms of ingredients, formulas and textures, packaging, and hybrid concepts. Florence Bernardin's skills gradually seduced the greatest global cosmetics leaders, including Asian companies, in search of in-depth knowledge of these markets and their specificities. In the past 16 years, the watch offering got wider from Japan to China, where the annual growth rate reached 21% in the cosmetics industry starting from 2014, and as far as South Korea, which boasts the world's biggest cosmetics consumers, and more recently, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Thailand – dynamic countries whose characteristics (climate, religion, skin types) require extensive analysis. ""We have really made progress with market changes: Korea has become the world's innovation laboratory, and makeup and skincare brands made in and for China have boomed. But we have a sweet tooth, so we increasingly focus on new markets who have been growing from an economic standpoint, and whose beauty offering is now very actively revealing itself to the world, driven by an ever-influencing Korean model which also has firmly anchored local specificities. These markets will keep opening, but they do have specific needs, and we are here to decipher them,"" explains Florence Bernardin. Based in new offices, west of Paris, the team is now composed of ten employees of four different nationalities who are experts of their own country. Information & Inspiration, which became Asia Cosme Lab in October 2019, helps both brands and suppliers enhance various areas of their offering development strategy: market visits, range development, formula assessment, concepts and storytelling validation, comprehensive overview of the local product offering, follow-up of influencers and retail… ""Our expertise is relevant in that we have an external perspective, which is the reason why we count an increasing number of local players among our customers: they ask us for our vision of their own market. From the outside, you always see things more objectively,"" says Florence Bernardin. In the near future, Asia Cosme Lab aims to develop their overview offering on indie brands to conclude financial agreements, analyze the boom of local brands, follow up new formulas, and extensively analyze emerging segments: perfume, men, baby care, senior care, halal beauty… Starting from next year, they will publish a newsletter about the markets mentioned and provide free or payable online access to whole articles on topical issues. These prospects are perfectly in line with the economic and demographic dynamics of Asian countries, whose annual growth rate is estimated at 4% from 2018 to 2020 in the Asia-Pacific region."
"The quest for health and a natural look boosts sales of beauty products in Asia, says Kantar","Sales of beauty product grew by +8% between 2017-18 in Asia, compared to +4% for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) as a whole, finds Kantar in a recent report [1]. According to the market research firm, the quest for health is one of the main key drivers behind this growth. ""Asian people believe health is almost twice as important to their happiness as having more money,"" says Ashley Kang, Head of Beauty Sector at Kantar Worldpanel division. ""They see what they put on their skin as a health supplement - and this has changed the products and benefits they desire. They are extremely knowledgeable too, so brands must be transparent in their communications. The wellness trend is also encouraging certain emerging formats to thrive."" For instance, new sophisticated formats in skincare and makeup that provide derma-care properties are rising in popularity. Derma brands have reached almost 45% penetration in Korea, a massive influx from just over 25% in 2017. Their second highest reach is Taiwan at 40%, an increase from 37.6% in 2017. Derma products can be used to treat specific skin issues, such as eczema or sensitive skin, or emerging issues such as pollution protection. ""With consumer brands launching their own ranges, derma-care is increasingly more mainstream, when it was once a niche segment and a domain of brands with a heritage in pharmaceuticals. Developments in retail and distribution are helping to increase the footprint of these products outside drugstores,"" explains Kantar. Natural glow is the most sought after look in Asia right now, says Kantar. This quest has helped drive sales of serums that promise intense hydration with the highest penetration rate in Korea (61%, rising from 58% in 2017). In China, penetration of serums has increased from 18% in 2017 to nearly 26% today. In addition to hydrating serums, specific makeup products - including liquid foundation, BB creams, and primer/concealer - can help people achieve the right translucent effect. ""All of them are soaring in popularity,"" says Kantar. Kantar predicts that makeup that provides skincare or medicinal benefits will be a key growth area for the future. Various crossover products have already emerged between the skincare and makeup segments, such as toner cream that brightens the skin. ""Positioning these products closer to skincare can be an effective strategy in China, where there remains a perception that the pigments in makeup could be harmful,"" adds the market research firm. The number of men using skincare products is growing steadily across Asia, particularly in China, South Korea, and Thailand. They are buying in more categories as they add more steps to their beauty regime. However, most are still not buying products that have been created specifically for men. Products targeted at men contribute 10% of the total value sales for beauty in the region, but this segment is growing slower than unisex skincare brands. ""Men in their twenties are most likely to buy men-only skincare products, but as they get older they begin to use whatever products they find on the bathroom shelf,"" explains Ashley Kang. ""There is a substantial growth opportunity here for brands that can shift spend from unisex products to men-only variants, and prevent men from 'lapsing' as they get older, particularly for products promising oil control, anti-aging, whitening, and sunscreen benefits."" Eventually, Kantar points out the interest of Asian shoppers in customised products, which are rapidly gaining momentum in both skincare and makeup."
"Consumers' oscillations between nature and science, connection and disconnection to disrupt the global beauty market","Science and nature, on the one hand, connection and disconnection, on the other, form the two beauty and personal care trend spectrums identified by the market intelligence agency in a recent report on global beauty and personal care trends for 2030. ""Over the next 10 years, consumers will explore the push-pull between nature and science. Advances in software, hardware, apps and augmented reality will herald the Fourth Industrial Revolution, significantly changing the way consumers choose, purchase and interact with beauty and personal care products,"" says Sarah Jindal, Senior Global Analyst, Innovation and Insights, Mintel Beauty & Personal Care. Within this ""science and nature"" spectrum, consumers will change their opinions on what is 'natural' or 'clean'. ""As lab-grown products continue to enter the market, consumers' comfort with biotechnology will increase. At the same time, mistrust of 'clean' and 'green' labels will see consumers scrutinize ingredient lists and question product efficacy,"" adds Sarah Jindal. ""We'll see biometrics offer an innovative way for companies to interact more personally with consumers by providing valuable customizations."" In 2030, according to Mintel, the clean beauty industry will just be the beauty industry and the focus will be on transparency and an eco-ethical mission rather than fear marketing. ""Success will only be achieved by the brands that offer full transparency and avoid misunderstanding,"" highlights Jindal. Waste-free, engineered and lab-grown natural ingredients, data, transparency, are some of the key words of this first trend. While toggling between connection and disconnection, consumers will seek out their tribe, with beauty and personal care brands serving as a facilitator. ""We predict the next decade will see even greater polarization with consumers fluctuating across a spectrum of behaviour driven by both information and emotion, connection and disconnection. Expect to see remote-control services bring access to the geographically disconnected, village commerce open once unreachable markets and more consumers 'switch off' as they strive to find real-world connections,"" explains Sarah Jindal. At the same time, consumers are losing the ability to relate to one another on a human level, while access to floods of information has detrimental effects, bringing into question the concept of authenticity. ""Every purchase will be carefully considered as consumers move to a more minimal approach, making investments in high-quality, high-performing products and reusing and upcycling products wherever possible,"" highlights Jindal. Customisation, services, biometrical data, simplified skincare, space-farmed ingredients, variety of cultures and lifestyle are among the key words of this second trend. In a world that becomes more polarised, the next decade is monumental for the global beauty and personal care industry, finds Mintel."
"Huda Beauty is the global hottest beauty brand, according to Cosmetify","Dubai-based Huda Beauty takes the top spot as the global hottest cosmetic brand of the year, according to Cosmetify. To determine the ranking, the comparison platform has taken five factors into account: the increase in consumer interest as shown on Google Trends, the overall brand searches each month, the number of Instagram hashtags and followers, and the brand's 'engagement rate' on the social platform. Based on these criteria, the 10 most popular beauty brands of 2019 are: #1 Huda Beauty #2 Anastasia Beverly Hills #3 MAC Cosmetics #4 Yves Rocher #5 Florence by Mills #6 Kylie Cosmetics #7 Jeffree Star Cosmetics #8 Rude Cosmetics #9 Maybelline #10 Foreo Fronted by founder Huda Kattan, Huda Beauty has seen a meteoric rise in the last six years. Huda has transformed a beauty blog into a now USD 1.2 billion empire for 2019. ""This brand is backed by empowering messages and a strong female role model, perfect for 2019 and beyond,"" commented Cosmetify. Huda Kattan was also named the Most Powerful Individual of Beauty in 2019, before Millie Bobby Brown and Kylie Jenner.

"Value, functionality and ethics top priorities of British people when purchasing beauty products, says Sagentia research","Sagentia commissioned a poll of 2,029 adult Brits [1] to find out what matters most when they're choosing personal care products such as body wash, cleansers, moisturiser or shaving gel. Ethics just as important as sensory features Responses indicate that when people are buying personal care products, ethical and sustainability credentials (34%) are just as important as sensory characteristics, such as fragrance (31%). However, value for money (67%) and functional benefits, such as helping skin or hair problems (54%), are top priorities for most people. Sagentia spokesperson Matt Herd says the findings show how the growing public discussion about climate change is moving mainstream. It's changing how people think about the products they use and what they expect from brands. He believes people want personal care and beauty products that they can feel good about using. ""According to our findings, most people agree that personal care and beauty brands have a responsibility to do more,"" Herd explains. ""However, younger people aged 18-24 seem more inclined to take practical steps in this vein. We found that 33% would like to personalise the way packaging is sourced, for instance to make it more environmentally friendly."" Herd acknowledges that many leading personal care and beauty brands have published sustainability reports and objectives. However, he says the Sagentia research findings indicate that people want to see practical evidence of change, rather than corporate statements. ""It's all very well having a company ethos that talks about sustainability, but it needs to filter down to the products too,"" he says. ""Packaging is one part of this. But it's also important to think about the ingredients used in personal care and beauty products - where do they come from, how they are sourced. This is a complex issue, but consumers expect the brands they trust to tackle it head-on."""
ADF&PCD Paris will take on a new dimension in 2020,"ADF&PCD Paris is to return in January 2020 alongside a brand-new show, PLD: Packaging of Premium & Luxury Drinks. The aim of the organisers is to create a new forum for packaging creators to share ideas and inspiration, and to source new suppliers and products from each other's markets. ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2020 takes place on 29th and 30th January 2020 at Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, Paris, and has been developed around the theme 'Innovate Together'. The theme wants to reflect the show's position as an event covering the closely related markets of drinks, cosmetics and aerosols; and an event for whole teams involved in packaging projects across the design, marketing, packaging development and buying functions within brand owners. ""It is clear that packaging developers, designers and buyers share common challenges across the cosmetics, drinks and aerosol markets - both in terms of technical challenges and brand positioning. The launch of PLD is a direct response to demand from our community for an event that offers the opportunity for packaging creators in the premium and luxury drinks markets to source and share technologies and ideas; and to learn from their colleagues in aligned sectors,"" explains Josh Brooks, event director at ADF&PCD and PLD Paris 2020. This cross-market/cross disciplinary ethos extends to the show floor, which is organised to allow cross-pollination between ADF&PCD and PLD exhibitors. Suppliers that work across multiple verticals are housed in a central avenue that connects all zones. There will be a total of 16 hours of content in total, covering the key themes and challenges in packaging development: technical challenges, sustainability and material choice, consumer and market trends, design inspiration and cross-functional team challenges. This year, the conference agenda has been developed in close partnership with an official Advisory Board, comprising senior people from across the industry. Other highlights include: – The ADF&PCD Paris 2020 Awards: The annual awards celebrating the very best the sector had to offer in 2019. – Visitor tours: Tours on offer to visitors will include the Made in France tour; and Eco-tours, which highlight leading products and suppliers of sustainable packaging solutions. – Innovation & Technology Theatre, which will be the home of new product presentations, launches and insight into the latest technical possibilities in packaging, with sessions themed by product type to make it easier for visitors to find the new products they are looking for."
Cosmoprof Asia 2019 to focus on sustainability and customisation,"Two months before the event, the organizers of Cosmoprof Asia were not hiding their satisfaction. Indeed, the first protests did not dampen the enthusiasm of exhibitors and visitors for a show that has established itself as a must in the Asian region. With an exhibition area of up to 118,900 square meters, over 3,100 exhibitors, 25 country pavilions, the show was boasting a double-digit growth in visitor pre-registrations. Unfortunately, the continuation of protests and some violent clashes with the police led the organizers to adopt several measures to reassure exhibitors and visitors. Security measures have been heightened on both venues (AsiaWorld-Expo for Cosmopack Asia and the Hong Kong Convention Center for brands and finished products), and the number of bus shuttles has been increased. ""The Cosmoprof Asia team has been monitoring the developments in Hong Kong closely and working meticulously with our partners: venue management, contractors, hotels, security, and services providers to create additional measures and plans to enable a seamless trade experience,"" explain the organisers. At the same time, marketing and promotional activities for visitors have been strengthened. More than 10,000 hotel nights will be offered to buyers, each exhibitor can invite two buyers to benefit from this offer. The show's advertising budget was also increased by 50%. However, the organizers said the impact of public incidents on recent Hong Kong trade shows, including September's Hong Kong Jewellery & Gem Fair, has been minimal so far. ""Commercial activities in this dynamic and business-oriented city go on as usual. It is also true that, the public incidents usually take place over the weekend while Cosmoprof Asia is taking place during weekdays which means there is a lesser concern on safety,"" highlights David Bondi, Senior Vice President Asia at Informa Markets. As far as cosmetic products are concerned, Korea is this year's Country of Honour, with more than 630 exhibitors, as well as thematic seminar and live demonstrations showing the power of K-beauty. A common theme for both venues will be sustainability: installations and common areas will emphasize the importance of the respect for the environment and circular economy for the future development of the cosmetics industry worldwide. Visitors of the Cosmopack Asia section will be presented the production steps of MEXME, an all-in-one cosmetic product created thanks to the collaboration of the design agency centdegrés and selected Cosmopack Asia exhibitors including Baralan, Cho Chuang, Red Of View, Wish-Tech and Yecai Paper Products. MEXME is a tool that combines make-up for the eyes (mascara, eyeliner, eyebrow, and brush) and lips (mat gloss, mat lip pencil, lip balm). In line with the customisation trend, visitors will be able to build their own tools according to their needs. Dedicated to the fragrance sector, the 2019 edition of CosmoLab will offer an olfactory journey created in collaboration with Opal Cosmetics. Visitors can test single fragrances, experiencing their personal interactions with them, and choose the notes to use when creating their own fragrance. ""Now more than ever Asia is still a key market for the cosmetic industry worldwide, and Hong Kong is the best gateway for the main markets in the Asia-Pacific region, such as China, Japan and Korea. Hong Kong is really a melting pot of people coming from the whole continent, and a reference trade stage. Thanks to this strategic location, Cosmoprof Asia is the best hub where to observe local trends, be updated on the latest regulations to enter Asian markets and be inspired by new technologies and inspirations,"" points Enrico Zannini, General Manager at Bologna Fiere Cosmoprof."
"Retail: ""With Sources, Carrefour banks on the need for transparency""","Premium Beauty News - What did a general company like Carrefour focus on to launch Sources? Gwenaëlle Ogor - What has been going on in the food industry is now visible in beauty: consumers increasingly use applications to know exactly what they buy. According to a study conducted by Statista, the product composition has become the second buying criterion, after the price. It is now considered more important than product efficacy, and it is a major issue, so we wanted to meet this customer need for reassurance. Premium Beauty News - So, should we talk about transparency and/or clean beauty? Valentine Fournier - It is definitely a store dedicated to transparent beauty. Transparent, because we explain everything about product composition to our consumers – we do not hide anything. Thanks to the Beautylitic tool, we now know everything about every single reference in our selection, so we can signal products containing phenoxyethanol, for example. Of course, we take action for clean beauty and hope that in the long run, the selection will be more significant than it is now: we have decided to ban only 76 controversial ingredients. We have made this choice because we consider than in certain categories, the market is not advanced enough yet for us to offer both efficient and clean products – typically, makeup and sun products. However, 17% of our products have the ""Les Yeux Fermés"" label, which guarantees they contain no controversial ingredient or allergen, according to the Clean Beauty application. So, we can also offer 100% clean products if consumers want us to. Premium Beauty News - What value does the Beautylitic tool add? Candice Colin - This software was designed to carry out a dynamic analysis of thousands of references, i.e. whole departments, in order to manage referencing more efficiently. Taking into account multiple crossed criteria, our algorithms decipher products according to the nature of the ingredients, their use per product category and function, their regulatory aspects, the scientific studies potentially characterizing a solid controversy regarding the very typology of the product concerned… All this is meaningful due to the use of a number of controversial ingredients in most daily products, and not just cosmetics, which creates cocktail and cumulative effects we have no control upon. And as it is managed by our scientific team, our work is fully documented. We provide distributors with essential data for them to understand what they sell. This has become crucial. Generally speaking, there is a huge crisis of confidence going on, and to me, distributors are increasingly considered responsible for the products they offer. Premium Beauty News - As the creator of the Clean Beauty cosmetics deciphering application, are you ""comfortable"" with the fact that all these products are not clean? Candice Colin - Today, although of course, consumers look for products with more and more irreproachable compositions, I think that above all, what they want is transparency, so they can make well-informed, conscious choices. No one can live a 100% clean life, but we can definitely make choices. That is where the strength of the Sources concept lies. The store offers both highly safe and more conventional products, but it is all clear and explained by beauty advisors. That is the message I want to send. Of course, we try and contribute to developing more virtuous chemistry practices, but what is really important is the notion of not taking customers for fools. The crisis of confidence in our industry results from a huge gap between product reality and what advertizing has done with it. Premium Beauty News - Let's talk about Sources again. Beyond the features we have already mentioned, how is the offering positioned? Valentine Fournier - We do not attract customers with the price, but with the composition. And yet, the brand is still affordable. 60% of our selection is also available in Carrefour supermarkets and in our parapharmacies. In addition, we have developed our offering so it meets the needs of every single customer in each category. Lastly, we are keen on discovery. We want to be a real new brand laboratory to provide constant renewal. Plus, we offer many mixed services: barber, beauty enhancement, hairstyling, makeup, and manicure bars, beauty salon for both men and women… Premium Beauty News - Are you going to deploy the concept? Valentine Fournier - It is a pilot store, so we are going to wait for a few months to see how it does and possibly develop the concept. We might also create an online version."
"Despite increased competition, the French cosmetics industry benefits from a strong ecosystem","The numbers probably make salivating some less flourishing industries. With 250,000 jobs for 3,200 companies, from SMEs to global leaders, France has some of the world's most famous beauty brands and is the world's leading exporter of cosmetic products. Depending on the year, the beauty industry is the 2nd or 3rd contributor to the country's trade balance and 60% of its annual turnover (31 billion euros in 2017) is exported. Between 2010 and 2018, foreign sales grew at an average annual rate of 5%, according to a recent study by Asteres for the French federation of the cosmetics industry (FEBEA). ""It's a soft power. With some luxury fashion brands and wines, it is one of the sectors that enjoy worldwide acclaim and build the most of France's reputation abroad. And this is also what will bring tourists,"" Charles-Antoine Schwerer, director of studies at Asteres told AFP. According to the market research firm's study, the France's good reputation in this sector makes it possible to increase the average value of a French cosmetic product by about 30%, compared to a similar product from another country. ""French cosmetics remain the market's benchmark. It is one of the few sectors where most companies, including small ones, operate at a global scale, where there are still business creations, with very low default rates,"" says Patrick O 'Quin, the president of the FEBEA. With a growing demand in Asian markets, where French cosmetics are highly prized by customers, the horizon seems clear, but some clouds could slightly darken the blue sky. At the forefront of which are the recurring consumer concerns regarding product safety, including the possible presence of endocrine disruptors or nanoparticles in some cosmetics. ""There is a real mistrust of the general public regarding the industry, and this also affects the cosmetics industry. But we must remember that France has one the most stringent regulations and product safety requirements,"" said Christophe Masson, general manager of the Cosmetic Valley cluster, which organizes the Cosmetic 360 trade show dedicated to innovation. In response to these concerns, giant cosmetics makers are trying to jump on the natural cosmetics bandwagon by launching their own natural ranges. L'Oréal, for instance, has launched an offensive on organic cosmetics in Western Europe, one of the few segments to resist sluggish sales in the region. However, for Christophe Masson, the main threat on the horizon is rather the competition from major players such as Korea and Japan, under the effect of ambitious public policies. ""The countries competing with France have smartly listed the cosmetics industry as a strategic sector and have consequently allocated strong resources to the sector,"" he says. In this context, ""it is important to allow our companies to work together, to facilitate the creation of links between the academic and the industrial worlds to ensure that new technologies continue to emerge in France."" To boost growth, the sector is multiplying innovations, for instance by riding the ""beauty tech"". Each year, about 650 million euros are spent on research and development by French beauty companies. Thanks to an ecosystem combining research, education and industry, France remains very attractive for cosmetic players. Japan's Shiseido, for example, has chosen France for its global perfume centre and the American group Coty has set up the headquarters of its luxury division in Paris. ""Everything is fine, but we cannot afford to rest on our laurels,"" said Christophe Masson, Cosmetic Valley."
Cosmetic 360: innovation around major contemporary beauty themes,"As for the exhibition itself, the organizer has announced an offering mostly focused on CSR, as will be seen with the innovation totems put forward by the 220 exhibitors. ""CSR is really getting global in our sector. Companies had already made commitments regarding products and ingredients, so now they are deploying their actions on all levels: processes, logistics, consumer experience, Human Resources, packaging… And all this is conveyed by a number of innovations to discover throughout the event,"" explains Franckie Béchereau, the show's Director. As an example, for the first time, a new animation zone will gather the Glass Valley players, who will introduce their own CSR strategy. And the Cosmétopée Zone sponsored by Greentech and focused on new sourcing approaches will offer the public an entertaining and interactive Quiz Challenge. Likewise, the digital offering was strengthened, in particular with Artificial Intelligence systems to analyze consumer needs in real time. The animation created by incubator The Place will highlight the possibilities provided by massive data analysis by manufacturing makeup products in real time based on the information collected on the first day of the show, at the entrance. Innovation again: The Tech Corner area is designed to highlight future technologies. And this year, the Paper Touch developed by the LGP2 laboratory of the French University of Grenoble will be in the spotlight: this innovative process is intended for manufacturing interactive paper for illuminated and communicating packaging applications. Once again, the Startup Zone will be quite busy, with 30 young, less than 5-year-old cosmeto-digital companies coming with new, disruptive solutions. The area will feature the main trends of the exhibition, in particular with a well-represented hair care offering. The Hackathon will again be organized by the LVMH Group and its Maisons: this year, the main theme is ""Sustainable Beauty"", and over 50 young participants are expected. But another trend will also be highlighted: wellbeing associated with notions of positive and inclusive beauty, but also clean beauty and nutricosmetics. ""We will welcome many exhibitors in the field of superfood, like Finnish laboratory VTT, and much will be related to CBD-based products, as the branch is getting structured,"" adds Franckie Béchereau. Lastly, under the banner Activist Beauty"", the paid conference programme will be focused on companies' responsible economic, social, and environmental strategies. This year, networking and contact schemes will be further enhanced through several initiatives. Open Innovation will offer project designers the opportunity to meet six market leaders: Nuxe, Chanel, L'Oréal Research & Innovation, LVMH Research, Rodan + Fields, but also IFF, a player positioned a bit more upstream. Over 200 events are scheduled throughout the show. In addition, Cosmetic 360 has always been the place for global clusters to meet. The 4th annual Cosmetics Clusters Rendez-Vous will gather about a hundred professionals to discuss collaborative projects, especially in the research area. The show's global dimension will also be enhanced, with 30% foreign exhibitors, including from new countries, like Finland, Sweden, or New Zealand. The country in the spotlight this year, the US, will be represented in the US Block through the main trends it conveys. ""So many things come from the US and eventually influence our industry in terms of distribution, social media, indie brands, CBD, wellness, beauty tech, and others,"" says Franckie Béchereau. Visitors will learn more about these themes with the talk shows organized in the central area. On the agenda: for the first time in Europe, the Mink startup will showcase their 3D printer that instantaneously generates its own makeup based on pictures. The private gala marking the show's 5th anniversary will take place at the Lido at the end of the first day, and the Awards ceremony will be held on October 17. Since it was created, Cosmetic 360 has always banked on favouring qualified visitors and selecting exhibitors according to the relevance of their innovations. ""That is how synergies are made possible. Our approach is definitely pyramidal: we invite the highest function of every service and welcome visitors you will never see elsewhere. Likewise, we are very demanding with exhibitors,"" explains the event's Director. ""What satisfies us most is that there is an increasing number of Korean visitors coming separately. That is quite significant, given the importance of innovation in this country"", she concludes."
Cosmoprof Asia 2019 readies to welcome visitors in Hong Kong,"Cosmoprof Asia 2019 will open its doors in less than two months. How many exhibiting companies will showcase in Hong Kong? David Bondi - We are really satisfied by the first numbers recorded by the next edition of Cosmoprof Asia. We have more than 3,100 companies exhibiting in a total show floor up to 118,900 sqm. The exhibition keeps growing, and I really think that this demonstrates the right decision to have two fair venues, one at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center and one in AsiaWorld-Expo. We can now host more companies wishing to do business in Asia, coming from all over the world. This year 24 country and group pavilions will feature small and medium companies showcasing their distinctive offers. We are very glad to welcome the first-ever Russian pavilion too. A special role will be played by Korea, which will be our ""Country of Honour"": Korean beauty will be the key topic for seminars, live demos and special initiatives. Why is it so important for companies and professionals to participate in the exhibition? Enrico Zannini - Cosmoprof Asia was the first international edition of our Cosmoprof platform: thanks to the strength of our Cosmoprof exhibition in Bologna, we could propose ourselves as a reliable partner for companies and professionals interested in new business opportunities abroad. Now more than ever Asia is still a key market for the cosmetic industry worldwide, and Hong Kong is the best gateway for the main markets in the Asia-Pacific region, such as China, Japan and Korea. Hong Kong is really a melting pot of people coming from the whole continent, and a reference trade stage. Thanks to this strategic location, Cosmoprof Asia is the best hub where to observe local trends, be updated on the latest regulations to enter Asian markets and be inspired by new technologies and inspirations. You referred to the two fair venues for Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Asia: is this strategic division important for the constant growth of the show? David Bondi - For sure! Not only can we host more exhibiting companies, but also we are able to offer much more focused contents to attendees for both venues and facilitates specific sourcing need. At AsiaWorld-Expo, all international leaders from the supply chain can show their innovative solutions for the beauty industry, thus providing brands, private labels companies, R&D developers and technicians with the most performing formulations, the most cutting-edge packaging designs and the most avant-garde technologies. This year, more than 950 suppliers will exhibit including industry leaders like Intercos, HCT, Toly Group, Chromavis, Yonwoo to name a few. At the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, we will host around 2,100 companies, specialized in finished products and brands for all the beauty sectors: Perfumery & Cosmetics, Beauty Salon, Nail & Accessories, Hair Salon and Natural & Organic. This venue is really a strategic location for buyers, distributors, retailers and marketers coming from all over the world to discover what is new for the Asian markets. You are working on a lot of special initiatives to offer more contents to your attendees: which are the most important ones? Enrico Zannini - We are working on many initiatives designed to offer new content and suggestions to operators, buyers, R&D managers and entrepreneurs attending our exhibition. Our show combines the possibility to increase your networking and work on new business projects together with the chance to be updated on the main novelties for the beauty sector and be inspired by avant-garde technologies and services. We will select the most impacting and innovative products, thanks to the Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Asia Awards. We will focus on the latest industry trends and cutting-edge solutions with Cosmotalks, seminars and panels with the participation of highly qualified speakers from international trend agencies, market research companies and academies. For an overview of the trends that will influence Asian, trend-scouters, distributors and opinion leaders can refer to CosmoTrends: a veritable trends bible, prepared by the international agency Beautystreams. The great results of Cosmoprof Asia come from the successful collaboration with BolognaFiere Cosmoprof: any plan for the future? David Bondi - For sure, the partnership with BolognaFiere Cosmoprof is the key factor for the success of our show. Our joint venture proves that sharing the knowledge and the expertize of two leading teams, such as Informa Markets and BolognaFiere, is the secret to offer a good service to our clients. For 2020, we are working together on new exhibitions in Asia, thus answering to the constant growth of the beauty sector in the continent. What are the special features of the show and special experience created for attendees? Enrico Zannini - We organised events at both venues to drive innovation and provide customers next level experience. At AWE To enrich the visiting experience of Cosmopack Asia, The Factory, the realization of the production steps of a beauty product, a key initiative of the exhibitions of the Cosmoprof network, will present MEXME in Hong Kong: a highly innovative all-in-one cosmetic product, created with the collaboration of centdegrés and selected Cosmopack companies. Then, CosmoLab will host an olfactory journey created in collaboration with Opal Cosmetics. Visitors can choose the notes with which to create their own fragrance, directly on the showfloor. At Cosmoprof Asia, at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Center, the latest professional developments are at the center of the Cosmoprof Onstage sessions: live demos with hair show, nail art and make up sessions and beauty treatments. For hairstylists and hairdressing salon operators, the reference event is On Hair. The special event is made possible through the collaboration with industry leaders. This year event will be kicked off by the largest professional hairstylists' organization in the world, OMC, bringing along with a series of fascinating hair show and workshop"
"""Chinese consumers feel very strongly about their cultural heritage"", Émilie Coppermann, Symrise","For Emilie Coppermann, Master Perfumer at Symrise and creator of the fragrance, the female Chinese fragrance buyers are ""curious and hyper connected"" and have open their mind to new olfactory codes from the West. However, their main ""references remain mainly rooted in the Asian culture and focused on natural and soft scents."" Boosted by a growing interest from Chinese Millennials, sales of fragrances are booming in China. In this buoyant context, the Jahwa group, owner of the Herborist brand, chose to celebrate its 120th anniversary with the launch of what it wished to become the ""first Chine prestige perfume."" For this ambitious development, far from the habits of the brand, the group has drawn on the experience of global design agency centdegrés, which has taken over the repositioning of Herborist's global image since 2008. For the packaging, the agency imagined a hourglass-shaped bottle, thus expressing the three dimensions of time suspension, as suggested by the tperfume's name. ""This fragrance stops time. It reflects the paradoxical status of time in China, which is both infinite and cyclical, with no beginning or end,"" said Matthew Rochette-Schneider, General Manager Greater China & Southeast Asia at centdegrés. The development of the fragrance has been entrusted to Symrise. To better understand the brand's DNA, Émilie Coppermann travelled to China and visited Herborist's spas and shops. ""I was deeply moved by the brand's minimalist, natural, feminine and sophisticated identity. That's why I wanted a flower that could express these values and be found in China as the main ingredient of perfume. Therefore, I selected magnolia and used both the flower and the leaves,"" explains the fragrance creator. Symrise and centdegrés teams worked in close collaboration during development phase with the aim to achieve ""a truly consistent and unique product"". ""Chinese consumers are increasingly supportive of the creations launched by local brands. In this context, Herborist's Mon Instant was created to be a true Chinese perfume, from the concept to the ingredients. As far as olfactory trends are concerned, I think that natural fragrances will continue to prevail. Furthermore, the current interest of Chinese consumers in their own traditional heritage could pave the way for the development of fragrances based on traditional Chinese ingredients,"" concludes Émilie Coppermann. To meet these expectations, the master perfumer imagined a very feminine and floral natural fragrance, inspired by the values that have been driving the brand for more than twenty years. Please note: Claire Viola, VP Digital Strategy, Fragrance Division at Symrise, will speak at the 3rd Fragrance Innovation Summit, on November 7 in Paris, on the theme: ""Philyra AI-powered perfumer assistant and the millennial generation in Brazil"".

Six avenues towards sustainable cosmetics,"The next edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit will discuss practical approaches to change formulations, packaging, and consumption of cosmetics and personal care products to help prepare for a circular economy. Case studies will be given of operators helping move the industry away from linear models of consumption, focusing on six key avenues: Overhaul in design thinking. Is poor product design responsible for many of the sustainability issues facing the cosmetics industry, such as plastic pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and chemical impacts? According to Professor Dr. Michael Braungart, Co-Founder of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry, cosmetic and personal care products can be designed so that materials can be continuously recycled. Adopting the Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) design approach could be a way to start creating positive impacts (as opposed to reducing negative impacts). Packaging waste innovations. It is estimated that over 7 million tonnes of plastics enter the ocean each year and cosmetics. Unfortunately, personal care products are not minor contributors to packaging waste.

"In uncertain times, Brits Embrace ""mindful beauty""","Sales of prestige lavender-based beauty products in the UK reported an increase of 552% in value sales in the period January 2019 to end of April 2019 according to The NPD Group. Products based on aromatherapeutic ingredients have reported a similar increase in sales in the skincare sector in the period January 2019 to end of April 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. Sales of rose-based beauty products increased 6% and lemongrass infused products increased in by 5%. Frankincense was a stellar performer in this category, where products formulated with this traditional constituent, said to relieve stress and anxiety, increased sales by over 200%. According to The NPD Group, the growth in sales of these aromatherapy-based beauty products demonstrates a return to comforting, nurturing, heritage ingredients which are central to the Mindful Beauty ritual, popular on social media and amongst wellness bloggers. For instance, #mindfulbeauty has been used over 30,000 times on Instagram as people share their mindful rituals which combine 'slow beauty' with mindful gestures, breathing techniques and meditation. These products include (but are not limited to) cleansers, masks, moisturisers and mists to bath and body favourites like soaks, bath and body oils, body and hand creams. ""2019 has been a challenging year for many people and in uncertain times, customers return to natural, heritage ingredients and products that offer a comforting, nurturing effect on skin, body and soul. The emergence of the Mindful Beauty trend is a response to the need to achieve solace and self-care in beauty rituals that calm the mind, cleanse the skin and offer a little 'me-time' during the morning, evening and weekend beauty ritual,"" said June Jensen, Director, NPD UK Beauty. While brands can embrace this trend by infusing their new products with the required ingredients, bricks and mortar retail stores could seize create immersive brand experiences which engage all of the senses."
Cuba falls in love again with the beard - and it's not about Fidel,"Cuba's old guard, for the most part, no longer sport iconic beards, but the youngsters do. Clean-shaven President Miguel Diaz-Canel's government only features one hirsute minister, vice-president Ramiro Valdes, 87. Having a beard these days on the streets of Havana is definitely more a question of style. ""Lately there are a lot of people, especially young guys, who are letting their beards grow - it's a trend,"" said barber David Gonzalez, 31, as he trimmed a customer's goatee in his city center salon. In Old Havana's Rue Obispo, Franco Manso, 24, took scissors to his own beard during a lull in business at his craft shop. ""I saw that it suited me, so as it's the fashion, I decided to keep it,"" he said. Castro told US television in an interview after the revolution: ""My beard means a lot of things for my country. When we have fulfilled our promise of good government, I will shave off the beard."" In the end, he decided to keep it. But Castro's facial hair carried such symbolism that the CIA hatched a plan in the early 1960s to un-beard the revolutionary leader. The plot involved an attempt to put thallium sulphate into his shoes so that his beard would fall out and make him a laughing stock. Castro, however, canceled the trip during which the chemical was to be used. Over the years, the symbolism has diminished, even if young Cubans continue to be surrounded at every turn by images of Fidel and Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos - the revolution's most famous ""barbudos."" But according to clean-shaven journalist and writer Manuel Somoza, there were overwhelmingly practical reasons why beards took such a grip on Cuban culture in the immediate aftermath of the revolution - blades were practically non-existent. Before 1959, Cubans used American Gillette razors, but ""when the embargo began in 1962, everything was complicated,"" says Somoza, 74. ""Beards spread, not only because the beard had a patriotic connotation, but also out of practical need, because the blades of razors were of very poor quality and shaving with them was a nightmare!"" Somoza told AFP. Shaving cream and aftershave quickly became an unattainable luxury, and men had to make do with the cheap soap and scratchy blades acquired with the Cuban ration book, or libreta. Havana thus looked to Soviet-era Czechoslovakia to provide blades under the brand name ""Venceremos"" ('We will Overcome'), sold in boxes bearing the revolutionary slogan ""Patria o Muerte"" ('Homeland or Death'). In time came Soviet-made blades Sputnik and Neva, popularly known in Cuba as ""men's tears"" because they painfully dragged bristle from the skin, rather than cut it. Schoolchildren used them to sharpen their pencils. Relatives abroad often came to the rescue. ""Glued into their letters home were two, three or four Gillette razors,"" says Somoza. ""When they arrived, it was a party!"" When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990, Havana descended into a deep economic crisis that further complicated access to razors until 1993, when Cubans were allowed to use the dollar as currency and modern razors started to appear in shops. ""I think that the young people's beards of today have nothing to do with those that we had... Today the young guys are more connected to world fashion,"" said Somoza. For Alain Gil, a 23-year old employee at the Cuban Cinema Institute, there are some benefits to his newly hirsute appearance. ""My girlfriend likes men with beards, she says it's sexier."""
"""Even in tomorrow's highly connected retail, sales will depend on humans,"" Nathalie Pichard, toPNotes","Premium Beauty News - As physical stores are being challenged by online selling, what becomes of shop assistants? Nathalie Pichard - They are still playing a crucial role, but it is increasingly difficult for them. Today, things are quite confused in points of sale. The perfume market has become very complex. Launches have multiplied without any training work done, and new concepts have emerged without much explanation. For example, a perfume brand based on a vegan concept was recently launched, and in-store, most staff members could not really explain what it actually meant. Much too often, no one has anticipated beauty assistants' perception of the brand, and the issue is raised only when problems arise. Then, it is too easy to criticize shop assistants. It is a demanding job, people are not very highly considered and well-paid: brands do not invest much on them. Premium Beauty News - It is often said that with customers who have become experts, because they get informed on the web, shop assistants are out of their depth. Nathalie Pichard - Again, this is too simplistic. Beauty advisors also get informed online, and the majority of people visiting points of sale are far from being experts. In any case, accurate, well-structured sales arguments definitely have unequalled impact and efficacy and can complete, and even amplify digital marketing actions. However, it is true there is a lot to do. It is still not that common to find ""augmented beauty advisors"" equipped with connected digital tools, and who can provide both expertise and additional experiences. Again, the problem is the lack of investment. To me, although tomorrow's retail will be highly connected, sales will still depend on humans. Premium Beauty News - And yet, training cannot be the only answer, can it? Nathalie Pichard - That is not exactly what I am saying. If training is a powerful tool for brands, it cannot substitute for a good product and strong concept. Still, it can create a favourable environment and boost performance, in particular by ""sticking"" the brand's arguments to people's minds. If the brand cannot sell among shop assistants, it is likely the latter will not engage in their relationships with customers, failing to make them live the brand's famous ""experience"". Training is a long-range, most powerful weapon whose tangible effects and positive impacts are not sufficiently measured right now. Premium Beauty News - What are the key ingredients for successful training? Nathalie Pichard - First, training needs to be continuous. One session every now and then does not really make sense. Being a shop assistant is a difficult job, and like in any trade, weariness and routine sometimes prevail. So, you need to keep feeding stores with information and emotion related to the brand. You need to support your advisors, encourage and help them over time. You need pragmatic arguments and easy-to-use recipes, especially for perfumes, because they are such tricky products to sell. Premium Beauty News - Does a good product that sells well online really need assistants? Nathalie Pichard - Probably not. But you cannot create a brand only with products. A well-designed, well-positioned product can definitely sell very well, almost on its own. But, there is always a risk for the brand to lose its grip, disappear behind the product, and see its story no longer passed on or firmly anchored in consumers' minds. Premium Beauty News - Last August, you celebrated the 10th anniversary of toPNotes, your consulting and training agency dedicated to perfume. What lessons have you learnt from this experience? Nathalie Pichard - The adventure even started a bit earlier, when we launched the toPNotes newsletter dedicated to perfumes, 12 years ago. This tool helped perfume professionals reflect and exchange. It is now published every three months and is also used as a networking, visibility-enhancing tool by players in the perfume world. Plus, it promotes the training and consulting business I created ten years ago. In practice, we offer both sales professionals and perfume brands & suppliers tailor-made materials and workshops. Then, brands can also benefit from complementary activities in marketing and communication writing, in particular focused on the digital world. Our expertise covers the customer journey and in-store experience, selling techniques, the brand's ceremonial, etc. Paradoxically, in a market eager for creation and innovation, sometimes we get too pretentious, trying to get something out of the extraordinary… So, our role also consists in helping brands keep it simple… Our customers are both multinationals and young brands aiming to train their teams, in France and abroad. For example, we recently worked with an Indian distributor who wanted to educate his shop assistants about the niche perfume world and its specific selling techniques. Our added value lies in the fact that we come from the perfume world and have an essential, specific experience of the trade, when many other players are generalists. Almost all our customers work in the perfume industry, although some of our methods can be reproduced in other categories. Fragrance Innovation Summit Nathalie Pichard will deliver a presentation at the next Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris, on November 7, 2019.

Women in the UK want simpler beauty routine,"Over the last year [1], almost three in ten (28%) women have reduced the number of products in their facial skincare routine, with young Millennials aged 20-29 most likely to have simplified their routines. For instance, the proportion of women using just one product to cleanse their face has risen from 25% in 2018 to 28% in 2019. Meanwhile, the proportion of women using four or more products to cleanse has fallen sharply from 26% in 2018 to 18% in 2019. The biggest facial cleansing casualties include facial cleansing wash (from 55% to 50%), as well as facial cleansing wipes (from 54% to 43%) and facial toners (from 29% to 25%). Usage of facial care products has also taken a tumble in the last 12 months. The number of women using day cream/lotion declined from (from 66% to 60%); while night cream/lotion fell from 48% to 44% and blemish balm (BB), colour correct (CC) and daily defence (DD) cream slumped from 21% in 2018 to 15% in 2019. Overall, the women's facial skincare market is expected to decline by nearly 1% in 2019, falling to an estimated £1.16 billion from £1.17 billion in 2018. This comes as Mintel research [2] reveals there has been a decline in the purchase of make-up, potentially led by reduced usage following the trend for naturally radiant skin. Indeed, some 31% of women who wear make-up are buying colour cosmetics less frequently now compared to last year, and 19% have spent less on the category in the last 12 months. ""A growing number of UK women are turning away from the multi-step K-Beauty routine, hoping to reach the same glowing result without having to put the time in. This need for simplicity has pushed them towards minimalist skincare products with more intense active ingredients, such as serums and oils,"" said. Alex Fisher, Global Skincare Analyst at Mintel. ""Disposable wipes have been hit particularly hard as consumers become more aware of the product's negative effects on the environment. As sustainability grows in importance, many beauty consumers are deliberately cutting out these single-use products,"" she adds. In such a context, one bright spot in the UK facial skincare market is face oils and serums. Penetration amongst women has remained at 24% from 2018-19, while usage of other treatments (i.e. eye cream, exfoliator, peel or wash-off masks, sheet or leave-on masks, overnight treatments) have declined. According to Mintel, some 40% of women who use facial caring products associate serums with being nourishing. Serums also have an association with 'glow,' as 20% of female facial skincare users think serums are brightening, representing radiance and luminosity."
"USA: The clean beauty movement gives its imprint to a robust skincare market, reports NPD","U.S. women are increasingly turning to online research to better understand the ingredients in - and the brands behind - their facial skincare products, according to recent data released in the Women's Facial Skincare Consumer Report [2] from The NPD Group. The report noted that nearly 50 percent of women surveyed prefer to research products online prior to buying them in-store, citing online reviews and ratings, as well as social media influencers, as their sources of information. ""Consumers are using their spending power to ensure their voice is heard and supporting brands that commit to natural ingredients and transparency,"" stated Larissa Jensen, executive director and beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. According to NPD, 46 percent of facial skincare users report purchasing products free of sulfates, phthalates and/or gluten, representing a 6 point up-tick over the past two years. In addition, more than half of women look for skincare products made from organic ingredients. The report also found that brands making a public commitment to ingredient transparency have become top-of-mind for consumers, with several of the more well-known transparent brands ranking among the Top 25 in highest awareness-to-purchase conversions. ""Skincare continues to perform well among engaged female consumers, regardless of what generation they are in. The number of consumers who are making purchase decisions primarily based on the price of a product is decreasing; as the significance of knowing exactly what they are putting on their skin becomes more important,"" Jensen added."
"Applying mascara, male bloggers challenge Russia gender norms","The 26-year-old is one of a growing number of young men in Russia who are offering makeup tutorials and beauty advice online — a practice that is not only boosting their profiles and bank balances but also challenging the conservative country's strict gender norms. ""I feel that my work is a 'fun' education that helps people develop in a different way,"" says Gevorg, who goes by just his first name online. He began offering tips on the internet several years ago while working in a beauty store and finding many of his female customers had a limited idea about what they could do with the products. The silver-haired blogger keeps his audience updated with regular Instagram posts and a couple of YouTube videos a week, in which he answers questions from viewers and discusses his latest purchases. Across the two platforms Gevorg has more than 250,000 followers and subscribers, many of them young women, and earns a living not just from sponsored posts but also in-person makeup workshops in cities across Russia. ""My work is to show a wide audience that makeup isn't about looking like a brightly painted escort — it's about looking the way you want and showing that you have a choice, whatever you do in life,"" he says. Male beauty blogging is a global phenomenon that has exploded in popularity in recent years - spawning US stars such as James Charles and Jeffree Star, with some 15 million YouTube subscribers each - and is tied in with major brands like MAC and Maybelline hiring men to front campaigns. But in Russia, where LGBT activism is all but illegal under a controversial ""gay propaganda"" law, and politicians are more likely to praise women's beauty than champion gender equality, the trend has a particular significance. Gevorg admits he found it hard to deal with aggressive online comments when he first started posting about beauty products, which often targeted his Armenian background. ""They said that in Armenian culture you can't look like that, it's not moral,"" says the blogger. ""I used to try to engage with people... now I just hit the block button and it doesn't bother me anymore."" Despite his bright online presence, the stylist says he avoids problems in the street by wearing neutral makeup or none at all. Other top Russian beauty bloggers have reported harassment online and off. Igor Sinyak, who has more than 400,000 Instagram followers, was this year threatened by a group of young people as he was leading a masterclass in a store in the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, some 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) east of Moscow. Videos released on YouTube showed security ushering him out of the building. Russia's most prominent male beauty blogger by numbers, Andrei Petrov, has posted screen grabs of the abuse he receives via Instagram and YouTube. Sergey Naumov, a 27-year-old whose popular Instagram show sees him copy the makeup of an invited guest, agrees his clips could come as a ""shock"" to many in the country. A native of Chelyabinsk, Naumov moved to Moscow as a teenager and found work as a makeup artist, later launching an eponymous line of beauty products which he promotes through his account. While his videos are intended mainly as entertainment, the entrepreneur hopes they are also expanding Russians' ideas about what men are allowed and able to do. ""I don't think the problem's so much that Russia is a naturally conservative country, more that for such a long time there was the Soviet Union,"" Naumov says, an era when conformity was encouraged or enforced. ""You have to wait for people to become more open, more receptive to new ideas and that is quite a difficult thing,"" he adds during an interview in GUM, the Soviet-era department store on Red Square that has since turned into a high-end shopping destination. ""But it's exactly shows like mine, like Andrei Petrov's, like Gevorg's, that do make people a bit more tolerant, not towards gays per se, but towards guys who wear makeup - it shows that it's normal."" Sergey Ostrikov, who makes a claim to being the first male beauty blogger in Russia 12 years ago, says Russians are already much more open than they were to content like his. ""There was a lot of aggression towards me at the very start,"" recalls the 31-year-old from the Siberian city of Abakan, who now manages two of his own cosmetics brands. ""Most of it came from women - they were saying, 'How dare a man get involved in this area that was purely feminine'."" The phenomenon of male beauty blogging has ""undoubtedly"" helped the LGBT community in Russia, he added. ""Now there's a new 'digital native' generation who have seen stuff like this from their childhoods - they take it all very calmly. Everything's changed in the last decade and it's all got easier."""
Retail: Four trends that are changing the face of the beauty sector,"For Adeline Çabale, there is no time to lose: the world of beauty must transform its approach to retail as soon as possible to meet the new consumer expectations. For this former L'Occitane executive, co-founder of the consulting agency the Retail Factory: ""Brands and perfume and cosmetic retail stores are lucky there are not too challenged for the moment by pure internet players, at least in Europe. But, all of them are conscious that the world is undergoing huge changes and that the game play could be very quickly upset."" The North American market was thoroughly upset by the emergence of new brands leveraging on the internet and social networks to develop their notoriety and sales: by building their reputation thanks to the support of influencers and Hollywood stars, like Anastasia Beverly Hills, by imagining a community co-creation model, like Glossier, or by building a personality-driven multi-millionaire pure player business model, like Kylie Jenner or Kim Kardashian, with no physical store (or almost), or by reinventing beauty consumption habits through membership subscriptions, like Beauty Pie. Makeup was the first category impacted, but currently there are now a number of personal care or perfume brands who managed to successfully develop, for a majority of them, digital models. If in retrospect, we can also note that online success can be just as dazzling as it is ephemeral, it cannot be denied that these players have destabilize the balance established and imposed some adjustments to the entire industry. ""The most established brands are fully aware of the challenge and are looking to take the lead,"" highlighted Adeline Çabale. ""Much of our work is to accompany them on this path."" Retail Factory organizes both training courses around the transformation of retail, and retail tours in France and abroad to help its customers ""rethink their POS via an in-store experience and the expertise of sales assistants"". For Adeline Çabale, beauty retail is undergoing major changes around a number of sometimes contradictory trends. ""The most important and most obvious one being the Green/Clean trend,"" she explained. ""In the United States, this involves the development of clean beauty multi-brands like Detox Market, Credo Beauty or Beautycounter."" Beyond ingredients, the eco-responsible trend extends to the packaging sector and to the entire purchasing experience area, including outlets. ""Patagonia, which has long stood as a marginal forerunner, is becoming an example to follow whatever the sector."" Without being incompatible with the desire for naturalness, the other big trend of the moment is, according to the President of Retail Factory, uninhibited luxury. ""People are looking for a casual and intimate relationship to luxury, as can be experienced at Chanel's New York Atelier Beauté in Soho, with its very instagrammable architecture, its scent room to perform blind perfume tests, its digital application that eases the retail experience and where the sales assistant becomes an expert and a prescriber. The act of purchase becomes a mere formality, it is the customer's brand experience that will become paramount"". More generally, Adeline Çabale also notes an overall rise of the frictionless trend. ""This is obvious at Glossier and its showroom boutique where no stock is visible. Once the payment is made, products arrive on an automated wall, in a personalized bag, with the first name of the buyer on it, as if it were common practice."" From this point of view, French and European brands and retailers still seem to be lagging far behind in terms omnichannel issues. ""The click & collect is indeed operational, but retailers did not seize the opportunity to propose complementary sales; and the back and forth between online and physical locations is not always fluid."" Players have really become aware of the issues but still face budget problems to complete the synchronization of their online and offline information systems. ""The most advanced country in the area is undoubtedly China, where - almost - every purchase is done with a smartphone. With the United States not far behind."" Finally, in the longer term, vocal trade should really be ""the trend to follow"", according to Adeline Çabale. ""Shopping with your voice is very intuitive and natural. Voice speakers are more and more present in American homes, there is still a lot to be done in terms of technology, but it's certainly a future trend... and a new emerging distribution channel."" And again, the brands who will know how to impose themselves best in the area should also be the ones changing the rules."
Skin sensitivity boosts skin care sales in Asia,"Data from Mintel shows that 44% of female facial skincare users in China say that having sensitive skin causes them to change or upgrade the skincare products that they use. Meanwhile, a third (34%) of Chinese consumers who use sheet masks will pay more for a sheet mask that's suitable for sensitive skin. In Southeast Asia, as many as 42% of urban Indonesians purchase products for acne or pimples, while two in five (39%) urban Thais purchase products to treat acne, adds the market research firm. And it's not just female beauty consumers who are seeking solutions for their skin sensitivities. According to Mintel, seven in 10 (69%) urban Thai male consumers and 63% of urban Indonesian males are spending more on specific treatment products (e.g. pigment cream, acne patch). ""It is imperative that beauty and personal care players in Asia understand the nature of Asian skin and that it is more prone to sensitivity due to a thinner stratum corneum. In this light, Asian consumers are on the lookout for effective solutions that help relieve or resolve issues caused by skin sensitivity, resulting in a shift in consumer behaviour and consumption habits. The time is now for companies, brands, manufacturers and retailers to be a pillar of support and build trust with consumers living with skin sensitivities,"" said Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation & Insights Analyst, Mintel Beauty & Personal Care. With more and more consumers demanding beauty solutions that help with sensitive skin, Mintel research indicates that they need guidance when choosing the appropriate skincare options. As many as three in four (73%) Chinese beauty and personal care shoppers say that they prefer a beauty advisor who can provide appropriate suggestions on skin issues. ""While Asians may be aware of their skin sensitivities, it is important that companies, brands, manufacturers and retailers support consumers in choosing the skincare that will work best for them - and this encompasses all consumer touchpoints, be it through an official brand website, advertising, in-store shopping experience or social channels. Essentially, consumers are in need of expert advice, something that is highlighted in Mintel Trend 'Return to the Experts' which uncovers how expert human advice is back in fashion"", Sharon continued. Finally, according to Mintel, beauty brands catering to skin sensitivities and the medical industry will have an opportunity to share objectives. Almost half of Indonesian (49%) and Thai (47%) male facial skincare users say that it is important for their facial skincare products to be dermatologist-tested or endorsed by a medical expert. ""To boost their credentials, and hence confidence, among consumers, brands can look at partnering with hospitals or doctors who are either working on or are experts in skin sensitivity"", Sharon concluded."
The Alchemist Atelier challenges bespoke perfume,"As customization and digitalization are all the rage in the world of beauty, and in particular of perfumes, The Alchemist Atelier, the Noustique Perfumes brand, breaks the codes and redefines bespoke perfume. From now on, thanks to the Scent Creator and to an app, perfume fans can become their own perfume-creator at home, or in the first Paris-based Alchemist Atelier store. That is where perfume lovers can directly compose their own 20 ml Eau de Parfum, with the help of a perfume-creator, or attend a one-hour-and-a-half workshop. This new device just the size of a coffee machine results from research work carried out by Alvaro Suarez, one of Noustique founders, and is produced by BSH, the European electrical appliances expert. But what was a real first was that Alvaro decided to partner with a perfume specialist, Puig, to manufacture bases and accords. Beware, no gimmick, quality is guaranteed! The perfume-creators of IFF (Fanny Bal, Juliette Karaguezouglou and Nicolas Beaulieu) and Puig (Elizabeth Vidal, Camille Latron and Bérénice Watteau) worked hand in hand to design 16 bases and 18 accords that can all be combined. In addition, the Alchemist Atelier app provides help with the creative process, by illustrating the formula under development with superb pictures of ingredients. This way, the budding perfume-creators can modify their formulas, with the nose or the eye. The inventions are then produced by the Scent Creator, fitted with highly accurate dosing mechanisms, before being automatically recorded by the device and stored for future purposes. For the four Noustique founders (Alvaro Suarez, Hugo Lasala, Kuba Jedlinski, Albert Casademont), all aged over 30, the fragrance itself no longer matters to perfume brands. ""In all perfume stores, there is a fight between brands and packaging, and the juice no longer plays a role!"" explains Alvaro Suarez. Each of the founders carries within himself the desire to restore perfume's prestige. And thanks to technology, they are considering creating a unique perfume, and even providing consumers with value and technology, while creating new business models. Of course, all this also involves a connected experience which federates a community of perfume lovers. What for? To help beginners acquire a common vocabulary and invite them to share their formulas with the Alchemist Atelier community, exchanging them as they would a cooking recipe! In short, The Alchemist Atelier makes it possible for anyone to discover the old, complex art of perfume creation, thanks to the Scent Creator, a most modern, unique tool. Partnerships with brands, including L'Artisan Parfumeur, are already being discussed. In the future, this service may be offered in the Puig group brands' stores. Rates: Workshops from €59 to €119 – Scent Creator €599 with a free workshop Bases & accords from €18 to €26. The Alchemist Atelier: 36 Rue Etienne Marcel 75002 Paris. Open from Mondays to Saturdays, from 11:30am to 8pm."
Men's fragrances: French males increasingly interested in higher concentrations,"The men's fragrance market is far from being negligible in France. By way of comparison, the value of this segment is practically two times lower in the United Kingdom over the same period (116 million euros). As already noted by The NPD Group in the United States, there is a growing interest on the part of French male consumers for higher concentrated essences and launches on this segment have multiplied. While less concentrated eaux de toilette (toilet waters) remain the most coveted category for men, accounting for two-thirds of global sales, the study shows a growing interest in more concentrated, and therefore more intense, perfumes. Sales of men's eaux de parfum - which are more intense than toilet waters - rose by 28% between January and May 2019, representing a value of 50 million euros. Even more concentrated, extracts have seen their sales level to double compared to the same period in 2018. And prices, much higher for the most intense categories (74 euros on average for an eau de parfum, 94 euros for an extract, compared to 65 euros on average for all men's fragrances) do not seem to be a key factor for French male consumers. ""Price does not seem to hamper the interest of consumers looking for more intense and longer-lasting formulas. This enthusiasm for more concentrated fragrances within the men's fragrance category brings back value and participates in the upscaling of the category"", explains Mathilde Lion, expert beauty Europe at The NPD Group. Top 5 men's perfume launches - January to May 2019 (in alphabetical order) – Terre D'Hermès Eau Intense Vétiver – Montblanc Explorer – Invictus Legend – Emporio Armani Stronger With You Intensely – Yves Saint Laurent Y EDP ""Just look at the top 5 men's fragrance launches at the end of May 2019, it's enough to understand the extent of the phenomenon: for the first time all of the 5 best new launches are eaux de parfums,"" concludes Mathilde Lion."
Young men transform British hair colourants market,"Usage of in-home hair colourants is soaring among Britain's star-struck young males, as they take inspiration from celebrities and social media personalities. According to the latest research from Mintel, the number of 16-24-year-old men using hair colourants has grown from 38% in 2018 to a colourful 46% in 2019 [1]. Celebrities and social media personalities seem to play a significant part in the choice of hair colours by young British males: one in five (19%) male in-home colour users say they took inspiration from social media personalities for their latest hair colour choice, while a further 14% drew inspiration from celebrities/models. This compares to the mere 7% of female users who say the same. Showing their adventurous side, just a quarter (25%) of men used the same colour they have always used when they last dyed their hair. ""Major celebrities like Zac Efron and Zayn Malik, and 2019 Love Island contestant Jordan Hames have debuted bleached or vibrant coloured hair recently, which has resulted in young men feeling encouraged to express their individualism through their hair colour,"" said Alex Fisher, Associate Director for Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. While Britain's young men are experimenting with their locks, it seems the nation's more mature ladies are going 'au naturel' as usage of at-home colourants among women aged 65 and over reduced from 36% in 2018 to just 27% in 2019. UK in-home hair colourants market: Key figures – 46% of British men aged 16-24 used hair colourants in 2019, up from 38% in 2018. – 19% of male in-home colourant users took inspiration from social media personalities for their latest hair colour. – Usage of in-home colourants among women aged 65+ reduced from 36% in 2018 to just 27% in 2019. ""At the other end of the age-scale, dissatisfaction with the anti-ageing rhetoric has meant fewer older women are now using colourants, instead, accepting their naturally grey hair. This movement gained momentum in the summer of 2017 when Allure magazine announced it would no longer use the term 'anti-aging'. Since then, a number of celebrities have spoken out about embracing ageing including Salma Hayek, Helen Mirren and Daniel Craig,"" added Alex Fisher. Actually, overall sales of in-home colourants are far from bright. According to the figures revealed by Mintel, the hair colourants market declined in value by 2% falling to £311 million in 2018. The market value of semi-permanent colour grew by 1% from 2017-18 to reach £13.2 million, while permanent colour fell by 2% to £218 million. Natural versus vibrant continues to be an issue as seven in ten (71%) adults think hair colourant brands should use natural ingredients wherever possible, while half (27%) think a vibrant result is important, rising to 43% of 16-24 year olds. ""The growth of temporary colour has not outweighed the decline of permanent colourants. The trend towards ageing naturally means permanent colourants must seek a new heartland, while younger consumers' expectations for exciting and changeable looks give brands the opportunity to become the experts of at-home techniques. Beauty brands are moving towards natural ingredients to replace chemicals that cause concern for their users. However, in a category that relies on end colour result to create consumer satisfaction, formulation is important and can be difficult to change without affecting efficacy. While semi-permanent dyes can seem less damaging, many consumers are bleaching their hair underneath to get these vibrant results, causing a lot of damage by itself. Many colourants brands are incorporating natural claims where possible, without interfering with the basic chemical reactions that create the vibrant results people want,"" concluded Alex Fisher."
Men's niche and premium scents boost U.S. prestige sales,"For instance, men's fragrance sales grew by 10 percent - representative of a nearly USD 8.0 million gain - during the two weeks leading up to Father's Day in 2018 [2]. ""The men's fragrance business continues to enjoy steady growth and not only during times of gift-giving,"" stated Larissa Jensen, Beauty Industry Analyst, The NPD Group. ""While holidays and new product launches create excitement around men's fragrances, the release of luxury concentrations like perfumes among several of the top-performing brands currently account for what's driving growth in the market."" Actually, male consumers have come to better understand the value of highly concentrated formulations, which tend to be more potent and long-lasting. Based on NPD's Scentiments survey, 35 percent of men indicated that they prefer to wear a scent that not only can they smell, but that others can smell as well [3]. However, according to The NPD Group, growth sales in the men's prestige fragrance segment are not only due to increased demand for luxury concentrations, but also due to increasing interest in artisanal brands. ""These types of brands are growing not only in popularity but also in distribution, giving the consumer even more options this Father's Day than have historically been available,"" Jensen added. During June 2018, the niche artisanal category grew 13 percent, and it continues to be the fastest growing brand type within men's fragrance, up 25 percent year-to-date."
MakeUp in Paris will celebrate its 10th edition on June 20th and 21st,"Premium Beauty News - What are the perspectives for the tenth edition? Sandra Maguarian - We expect this edition to be more dynamic than ever! With a total of 164 exhibitors, all the activities and events appreciated by visitors and exhibitors are returning: the Innovation Tree, the Color Wave project, in partnership with Beautystreams, which announces a year in advance the future star colour in beauty, the MakeUPigments area [1]. For the first time, a trends area will bring together agencies participating in the show. We believe this will create synergies and make it easier for visitors to find what they are looking at. And, of course, we will offer many workshops and conferences on the latest trends and technologies. This year, we have asked Anthony Mathé, semiologist to talk about the 40 and 50-somethings, and because the environment is the big topic of the moment, L'Oréal, Quantis, Elipso and Heinz Glas will present the SPICE initiative (for Sustainable Packaging Initiative for Cosmetics) and how manufacturers make their best to reduce waste. The Comité Français de la Couleur (CFC) will also make a focus on Iconic Beauty Colors: Red, Black & Pink. Premium Beauty News - Are special animations scheduled? Sandra Maguarian - Of course! We have planned a spectacular scenography to welcome the visitors at the entrance and we'll hold an opening and ribbon cutting ceremony with the 15 exhibitors who participated in all the editions since the creation in 2010 [2]. We have also scheduled a charitable operation, which was a key feature of our first editions. The MakeUp Gallery will host seven young artists (painters, graphic designers, photographers) and an auction sale of their works. All proceeds go to fund the CEW Beauty Centers. Last but nt leats, we invite all our exhibitors and some of their clients to a private night tour of the Louvre. Premium Beauty News - What is your personal take of these ten years? Sandra Maguarian - MakeUp in Paris and its North American and Asian spin offs have given great visibility to the makeup category. This show allowed to better highlight the creativity and innovation of all market players. With the MakeUp in shows we created an original concept and set up a platform adapted to the needs of the make-up industry at a time when it was undergoing a considerable transformation. Makeup has emerged as a flagship category in the beauty market, one of the most innovative and dynamic. Finally, I also believe that we have created a family. This is something we can feel at each show. Indeed, the make-up supplier industry is quite small and everyone enjoys meeting several times a year at the different MakeUp in trade shows around the world. This will be the 10th edition of MakeUp in Paris, but also the 33rd MakeUp in show! Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Paris has also become an important landmark in terms of innovation! Sandra Maguarian - MakeUp in Paris has become a reference where exhibitors present innovations, novelties and specific colour palettes. We can also observe the same phenomenon at the New York and Los Angeles editions. It must be said that the market has accelerated with an insatiable need for new products. This is clearly seen in the success of the Innovation Tree, which counts more candidates every year. Premium Beauty News - How are international editions evolving? Sandra Maguarian - In Los Angeles, where the MakeUp in trade show is held alongside Luxe Pack, we are moving to the Convention Center for the 2020 edition. This will allow us to host new exhibitors. Several companies are also on the waiting list in New York, where we also have plans to expand our exhibition area in 2020. As for the Asian shows, they are galvanized by the hyper dynamic trend of the Chinese market in particular and the Southeast Asian region in general.

Mobile barber cuts a dash with Afro-Caribbean Londoners,"In a quiet street in south London's trendy Brixton district, known for its ethnic diversity, 25-year-old Kristian Robertson parks his trailblazing mobile salon. For a little over a year, he has worked for Trim-It - a start-up offering haircuts for people with Afro-Caribbean roots. Opening the customised van's sliding door reveals a silver barber's chair, a large mirror, a hair dryer and drawers overflowing with scissors, clippers and hair products. As he carefully prepared his equipment for the day's first customer, the meticulously groomed Robertson said clients are ""always amazed"" when they see what is inside. ""Appearance is important, whenever you wanna go somewhere or even if you just wanna feel better about yourself, you get a haircut and it changes your whole day, changes your whole week even,"" said Micah Henry, 24, one of Robertson's ten-odd daily customers. Henry, who uses Trim-It about once a month, said it was the ""most convenient"" hairdresser he had come across. Appointments are made via a mobile phone app, summoning a van to where the client is. The start-up's founder, 24-year-old Darren Tenkorang, said the intimate setting of a van helped forge close relationships between hairdressers and their clients. ""The relationship that you have with your barber is a very special one and I feel like this barber shop actually intensifies that because it's so one-on-one so you can use your barber as a therapist,"" he told AFP. ""You can talk to him about everything from your girlfriend issues to football to business."" Born to Ghanaian parents, Tenkorang was accustomed as a boy to visiting Brixton's barber shops regularly with his father. He said the business idea came to him after enduring many long waits. Tenkorang now wants to offer a faster service more adapted to the lifestyles of young people. ""We thought it was a good idea to put a barber shop in the back of a van and for an app to be able to book a barber shop to a location,"" he said. ""For us, it's all about making sure that the service is completely convenient and we sprinkle a little bit of premium (treatment) as well."" The first van launched in February 2018 and the start-up now employs nine people and boasts five mobile salons covering most of London. ""I am just really surprised at how much it has actually taken off,"" said the young entrepreneur. ""We're definitely going to try to conquer London but our goal is to actually just take over the whole of the UK and thereafter, as everybody is saying, world domination!"""
"""Distribution can renew the perfumery landscape,"" Jeanne Doré","Premium Beauty News - What changes has the selective network undergone over the past few years? Jeanne Doré - There have been few changes in perfumes intended for the general public, except for the faster pace at which flankers are launched. Due to consumer tests dictating final choices, sweet notes largely prevail, and creations are less original and more interchangeable. New launches come and go, and one is very much like the next, except for unexpected successes, like Gucci Bloom, which was developed without standardized tests. The perfume is beautiful, and the brand focused its communication strategy on Instagram to reach a younger target. On the one hand, we are trapped in a cycle, on the other, this example offers a glimmer of hope. Premium Beauty News - How is niche perfumery evolving? Jeanne Doré - I will not surprise anyone if I say that the number of brands changes at an extremely fast pace. The landscape is saturated, and niche perfumery is reshaping itself into several categories. On the one hand, many of its greatest names are purchased by groups. On the other, independent brands manage to survive, more or less. And then, small, very alternative, sometimes rather ""DIY"" houses are quite trendy in the US, where the system is not as academic as in France. If these creations can lack structure, some of them do infuse freshness into this saturated market. Another trend was recently observed: that of perfume experts (perfumers, artistic directors…) who launch their own brand, like Chantal Roos, Sylvaine Delacourte, or Alberto Morillas. These personalities are well-established in the industry. They know their job by heart. And then, there are brands emerging that transcend the niche/selective antinomy to focus on digital technologies, as can be seen with Sillages Paris, who want to democratize perfumery, by using niche perfumery's basic codes and digitalizing them through an online and sample purchasing system. Premium Beauty News - How does the selective network react to the boom of niche perfumery? Jeanne Doré - Sales have been declining in this sector, just like in traditional distribution channels, whose model is gradually becoming obsolete as customers change. Customers look for differentiation and leave this channel, because the offering is getting too standardized. As a response, most major brands have been developing exclusive lines using niche codes (communication on raw materials, refined bottles…). And yet, creativity is not always obvious, although there are indeed pretty things. In addition, major groups keep purchasing small brands they deem promising. Premium Beauty News - What are niche brands' advantages to last within this context? Jeanne Doré - Coherence between marketing communication and what the olfactory creation conveys is essential to last. So is patience. And of course, brands should bank on digital technologies, not only because social media have become a key driver, but also to avoid traditional distribution channels. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, and what can be said about distribution? Jeanne Doré - Maybe that is where there are real opportunities to innovate. Distribution as we know it today is obsolete: there are too many go-betweens, too little visibility, and not enough counselling and recommendations, given the teeming offering. Consumers feel lost, which is why I believe in our Box [1]: it turns the spotlight on creators that are very little known or distributed, and it is focused on the exclusive collections of major brands willing to reach a discerning, trend-setting public. It is a way for them to reach customers they would not have attracted otherwise, within an ideal discovery context, but also to educate the public through curation, a role that has become fundamental in this saturated landscape. Perfume reviewing is also essential. I have this dream that one day, people will naturally read a perfume review, just like they do for films or books. I would love to see other initiatives like ours emerge, because it is fundamental to change the market."
Spain: Four years of uninterrupted growth for the cosmetics market,"After a +3.5% rise in 2016, followed by a +2.15% rise in 2017, the Spanish perfume and cosmetics market continues to perform very well. According to figures recently published by the Spanish Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (STANPA), sales of perfumes and cosmetics grew by +2% in 2018. The Spanish market has reached the EUR 6,954 million mark and thus ranking as the fifth European market for beauty products, with a per capita consumption of EUR 150 per year, far above the European average of EUR 137 per person and per year. Exports of perfumes, cosmetics and essential oils are increasing too and have reached EUR 4,680 million in 2018. Export perfumes and cosmetics (excluding essential oils) reached EUR 4,260 million euros in 2018, representing an increase of +10% compared to 2017. Spain has thus established itself as the second largest exporter of perfumes, only lagging behind France, but ahead of Germany and the United States. Exports of this product category have reached 1,820 million euros, which represents 39% of the total. However, Spain also strengthened its position as an exporter of essences and aromas. Exports of essential oils have grown by +8.4% in 2018 to 420 million euros. Citrus oils such as grapefruit, lemon or orange leading the way of the country's exports in this category. Personal hygiene and skincare products are the main categories of the Spanish personal care market. According to STANPA, these categories represent 52% of the country's consumption of personal acre products. Thus, sales of face care products increased by +4% in the past year. A total of 97 million units of these products were sold during 2018 in Spain. The consumption of perfumes represents 20% of the total of the beauty industry and has grown by 4.6% during 2018, with a good performance of men's perfumes (+5% in 2018). The importance of one's image is becoming increasingly important in a hyperconnected world, as reflected by the growth in colour cosmetics sales (+5%), now reaching a market share of almost 10%. Eye makeup grew by +7% in 2018, facial makeup by +5.5% and lipstick by +4.7%."
Three British trends that could shape the future of beauty around the world,"A new research from Mintel highlights the trends driving innovation in skincare, colour cosmetics and haircare in the UK beauty market that could shape the future of beauty across the world. Skin microbiome As consumers around the world are getting increasingly aware of the importance the skin's ecosystem diversity for their health, the UK is leading the way globally for facial skincare launches targeting the skin microbiome. Over 37% of the world's launches in 2018 were in the UK, followed by the US (25%) and France (15%) - according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD). ""British skincare brands have been among the first to understand the importance of the microbiome, the natural bacteria found in and on the body which can be balanced through skincare,"" commented Jane Henderson, Global President - Beauty and Personal Care Division at Mintel. Beyond the skin microbiome, consumers in the UK are embracing a 'treat yourself' mindset, prestige/luxury facial skincare accounted for 71% of launches in the UK in 2018, compared to 54% 10 years ago (in 2008). In contrast, budget and mass facial skincare launches are losing out, slightly declining from 14% of all UK launches in 2008 to just 10% in 2018. Clean colour cosmetics Make-up is a serious business in the UK! The country is the 4th biggest colour cosmetics market globally, valued at an estimated GBP 2.1 billion (EUR 2,45 billion or USD 2.77 billion) in 2018, following beauty powerhouses US, Japan and China. Brits are also the 4th biggest colour cosmetics spenders, with an average per capita spend of GBP 32 per year. In this context, being transparent and ""toxin free"" has never been greater for colour cosmetics brands. According to Mintel, the UK is the European leader for so-called ""clean colour cosmetics"" launches, and second globally only to the US. The market research firm defines clean colour cosmetics as those carrying 'free-from', 'natural' and 'ethical and environmental' claims. According to Mintel, the country accounted for 21% of all global 'clean' colour cosmetics launches in 2018. ""The clean beauty movement started out in skincare and is now quickly moving into colour cosmetics, with the UK leading the way. Consumers are holistically looking to clean up their lifestyles, so clean makeup will become increasingly important in the coming years. Clean beauty is more than a trend, it's a lifestyle, and as such brands must adapt to the changing landscape to secure their place in the future market,"" explained Henderson. The rise of vegan and gluten-free haircare In the wake of the clean beauty trend, British consumers are more broadly embracing beauty with a conscience. Vegan claims, for instance, trebled in haircare between 2014-18 in the UK, rising from 6% of all launches in 2014 to an impressive one in five (20%) in 2018. In comparison, only 10% of haircare launches across the globe carried a vegan claim. Meanwhile, gluten-free claims trebled in haircare between 2016-18 in the UK, rising from 3% of all launches in 2016 to 9% in 2018. In comparison, just 4% of haircare launches across the globe carried a gluten-free claim. ""The UK is a hotbed of beauty innovation, with major global trends emerging and developing. In the next 5-10 years, the skincare industry will expand from simply focusing on the microbiome to also include the exposome, i.e. external environmental factors like pathogens, fungi, pollution and plants that interact with our DNA and affect our health. This will inspire NPD that takes a bespoke and holistic approach to skincare and health, such as exposome-measuring wearable devices, bespoke ingestibles, personalised DNA nutrition, and products that boost skin health and personal air quality,"" concluded Jane Henderson."
"""The trend will be for a more measured consumption,"" Mathilde Lion, The NPD Group","Premium Beauty News - How do you explain this decline, putting aside this year's particular social and economic background? Mathilde Lion - The yellow jackets movement in France and its consequences are not the only reasons for this situation, since we were already last year on a -1% trend. The overall context is no help to favour an upturn in consumption recovery, particularly in the Prestige segment, and this trend can be observed across other sectors. Cosmetic products and fragrances are not basic necessities, allowing consumers to make choices in their budget allocation. Overall, for budgetary or ecological reasons, the trend is towards a more careful or rational consumption. Premium Beauty News - Is there a transfer of selective sales to other channels? Mathilde Lion - Our study covers sales of prestige brands in selective, excluding Private Labels and exclusive brands, as well as on-line sales through e-retail sales of perfumeries and department stores and of some pure players. It is true that on-line sales are continuing to progress with a 17% increase in 2018, it is a significant growth driver but which does not compensate losses in outlets. There are also more and more online players who offer Prestige brands, be they specialists like Notino or Look Fantastic, discounters like Beauté Privée or generalists like Amazon. This offers new alternatives to consumers. To this must be added the development of own sales by brands via their websites or the expansion of their network of owned outlets. All this represents as many possibilities versus purchases performed in perfumeries and department stores. Premium Beauty News - These figures do not take into account retail brands or exclusive brands, does that change the picture? Mathilde Lion - Indeed, by looking at the results for other countries where we also introduce these brand profiles, we noticed a strong development of these specific brands in the medium term. In that regard, we could therefore consider that Prestige finally, is doing pretty well. However, in the UK for example, where exclusive sales and Private Labels acted as a major growth engine, this was no longer the case this year either. Premium Beauty News - What are the most impacted categories? Mathilde Lion - Make-up is at -4%, perfume at -2% and personal care at -1%. Overall, there is a cross-over trend between make-up and personal care with a strong slowdown for make-up with sales estimated to 440 million euros for 2018. It is the smallest category in terms of sales in the selective circuit dominated to the two thirds by perfumes. However, it concerns Prestige traditional brands and not exclusive house brands, very popular in this category. Moreover, the emergent category of applicators for the face, and the lips, is recording good results. Premium Beauty News - Is this decline in selective specific to France? Mathilde Lion - Our studies cover Europe, the UK, Spain, Italy and very soon Germany. Overall, the French market is indeed the one where sales in value were down the most. UK was an important growth driver, but for other reasons, it slowed down significantly in 2018 with less than 1% in value. Conversely, Southern Europe continues to perform well with +4% in Spain and +3% in Italy. Premium Beauty News - How did end of year sales do? Mathilde Lion - The Black Friday week was very positive, but then the momentum slowed down significantly for the reasons we know. The last few months of the year have weighed significantly in the overall drop because they are the busiest months of the year, yet sales did not stall that much during that period. For example, the Paris region managed to stay afloat better than other regions despite store closings every Saturday. Parisians organized themselves differently. Premium Beauty News - What are your forecasts for 2019? Mathilde Lion - The trend will continue, we expect a similar drop of around 2%, more or less for the same reasons. There is no major restructuring underway that could change the game play and it is true that household confidence is currently at its lowest level."
"""In an increasingly competitive market, niche perfume brands must reinvent themselves,"" François Hénin","Premium Beauty News - Today, what are the expectations of buyers of niche perfumes? François Hénin - It's no secret that the proliferation of brands is thoroughly changing market rules. As a result, buyers select brands according to their sales potential, particularly for in the Middle East or Russia, that remain the largest consumer markets for this type of perfumes. This phenomenon is particularly visible in London, at Harrods or Selfridges. The Agarwood note has lost some of its popularity, which doesn't mean it's a has been, and ranges built around this note still remain attractive. Moreover, buyers are also expecting brands to innovate and reinvent themselves to attract a new target: young people and millennials. Premium Beauty News - What are the consumer expectations like today? François Hénin - Brands, for example, must adapt to the wishes and wants of millennials, who have different consumption habits than older age groups, like the Histoires de Parfums brand which proposes small sizes (15 ml), miniature replicas of its perfume bottles. They are cute, market-trendy, and they suit young people's lifestyle. It could be referred to as a 3.0 niche, undergoing major changes. More generally, the public is looking for exclusivity and personalization; this is why customer experience has become essential. So much so that Amazon, for example, is about to open brick and mortar outlets to diversify the buying experience. And the other point is that due to the fact selective perfumery brands have now also made theirs the discourses and codes of the niche, with their exclusive ranges, niche perfume brands must renew themselves to come up with something different to offer customers. Customers have also become more eco-conscious, and sensitive to the use of recyclable materials, a new challenge for brands. Premium Beauty News - Finally, how do retailers adapt to this new game play? What are your expectations, your projects? François Hénin - We are evolving too! As an example, at Jovoy, we had, sadly, to end our partnership with some twenty brands, the ones who did not succeed in attracting their customer base in our outlets, but this decision has nothing to do with the quality of their products... Concerning my customer base, brands who failed to find their place are often those who are still cultivating an obsolete vintage style. The mushrooming of brands forces us to be more selective, even if criteria may vary from one concept store to another. At Jovoy, we are in favour of the ""new wave"", ""new school"" side, to surprise consumers; original concepts such as L'Orchestre Parfum, or the Australian brand Gold Fields and Banks, a line of beautiful fragrances with a simple design. Another of our favourite perfume house is Domaine Privé, which offers perfumes at affordable prices (100ml for 88 euros). This is another good example of brands having to adapt to an ever younger customer base. Quite a challenge for a retail brand like ours!"
Germany: Natural and organic cosmetics gained more than a million new customers in 2018,"The German market for natural and organic cosmetics recorded a 5.9% growth rate in 2018, while the entire cosmetics market was mostly stagnating, unveiled market research and consulting firm Naturkosmetik Konzepte [1]. Sales of natural and organic cosmetics reached 1.26 billion euros. While drugstore remain the main shopping channel for these products, many consumers are purchasing new products online. ""In 2018 alone, more than 1 million additional customers purchased natural and organic cosmetics, with 40 % purchasing this category for the first time,"" highlights Naturkosmetik Konzepte. Foremost younger shoppers are looking for new, trustworthy products. According to Naturkosmetik Konzepte, new shoppers are questioning raw materials and the claims of the cosmetics industry and prefer smaller brands that reflect their own ethic principles by adapting quickly to new trends. ""Climate protection, mindfulness for the own body as well as nature, zero waste and nature-friendly products are on the winning side,"" notes Naturkosmetik Konzepte."
"""One of the main challenges for niche perfumery is to renew the customer experience"", Sylvaine Delacourte","Premium Beauty News - What is your view on the evolution of the perfume market? Sylvaine Delacourte - I think customers feel a little lost today, with the multiplication of flankers in the selective network and the proliferation of brands in niche perfumery. If the latter used to offer a creative revival, in turn, most of what it now produces is déjà vu – or unwearable products. If it has become difficult for the public to know where to start, brands are also struggling to stand out in this saturated landscape. In fact, they need to innovate and differentiate themselves by offering this little extra, like gifts, or hosting workshops or conferences, which help raise consumer awareness through a new experience. The more you educate customers, the better they can identify quality. To me, that is where niche perfumery can play a role. It needs to recreate emotion, before reviving a name. Premium Beauty News - What are consumer expectations today? Sylvaine Delacourte - Just like in the food industry, the public is more and more eager to know what ingredients are used in perfumes. It is not a new phenomenon, as such, but it is intensified by the vegan movement. The advent of apps like Yuka exacerbates this trend. Given this increasingly demanding public, the industry will definitely be compelled to change formulation over the next few years. Cosmetics should be clean, in particular as regards animal well-being. Perfumes cannot escape the rule. If, tomorrow, a brand like mine wants to enrich its range with a perfumed milk, for example, it will have to be clean. We did not have to deal with this issue when I started, 22 years ago. It also highlights a certain curiosity for what lies behind the perfumery scene, especially since this sector was long surrounded with mystery. As soon as I started my blog (espritdeparfum.com), ten years ago, I chose an educational approach focused on raw materials. I am still developing it with my brand's website. We need to communicate and educate people to the essences of perfumery as a way to renew the customer experience. Premium Beauty News - What about distributors? Sylvaine Delacourte - Distributors want us to be present for more closeness with the public. We need to be out there on the field: we are permanently contacted to host workshops and conferences in order to renew the customer experience. Then, ecology is another major challenge to which I already paid much attention when I created my brand in 2016. This issue has become essential to distributors: for example, they require recyclable packaging. Lastly, I would add that, generally speaking, we should now offer a service, beyond a mere product. Premium Beauty News - How do you benefit from your experience in the industry? Sylvaine Delacourte - I have a certain credibility, mainly with distributors, but also with the public, to a lesser extent. It is reassuring to come from one of the greatest perfume houses, like Guerlain. This experience also sharpened my perception, and being demanding is an advantage when you launch your own range."
Online sales boost the British prestige beauty market,"The sale of prestige beauty products online in the UK reported an increase of 13% in the 12 months to the end of 2018 according to The NPD Group. Total beauty sales declined 1% compared to 2017, of which 100% of the losses came from the makeup category which declined 7% compared to 2017. On the other hand, fragrance and skincare finished positively for the year driven by double-digit growth online. The total value of the prestige beauty market in the UK was valued at £2.7 billion in 2018 (vs. £3 billion in 2017). The market for online beauty products continues to grow with a wider range of businesses offering Click & Collect, next day and sometimes same day delivery. Amazon Now through its Prime subscription service offers a two-hour delivery service for a capsule range of beauty products in select postcodes. Ecommerce now accounts for 20% of all sales value in the prestige beauty market, while Bricks and Mortar represents 80% of the market, a decrease of 4% compared to 2017. ""The high street market for prestige beauty has faced many challenges in 2018 from low consumer confidence, a decline in foot fall, businesses falling into administration and Brexit which have all compounded the financial woes on the high street. There are many positives here; Ecommerce is growing, and the high street has responded too, adapting its model to offer more experiential retail opportunities for customers,"" says June Jensen, Director, NPD UK Beauty. The high street remains central to the prestige beauty market accounting for 80% of sales in 2018. High street sales of fragrance increased 1% in December 2018 vs December 2017 helped by a late surge during the week of Christmas Week (week 52) where Bricks and Mortar over performed 51% year-on-year. According to The NPD Group, this demonstrates the continued importance of high street outlets and department stores, as prestige beauty relies on a hands-on, consultant-led approach with demonstrations, sampling, gift with purchase and make-up lessons all part of the retail mix. ""2018 certainly has been a year of upheaval on the high street, but prestige beauty retailers are resilient and are responding accordingly. Strong growth from fragrance late in the year demonstrates that there remains a significant demand for perfume on the high street. Sales were also helped by a late surge in last minute present shopping on Sunday and Monday pre-Christmas Day, and by consumers stocking up on their favourite scent in the Boxing Day sales. Naturally, strong growth online is good news for beauty brands, who are focusing on a multi-channel approach to reach their customer,"" concludes Jensen."
"France: the beauty market remained stable in 2018, according to Kantar Worldpanel","This annual event is the most eagerly awaited by beauty players. Last February 14th, CEW and Kantar WorldPanel unveiled the 2018 figures of the French beauty market in front of a packed audience. To Laurence Moulin, General Manager of CEW France, ""the Beauty Business event provides a mapping of the market to make an update on the previous year and confirm objectives for the next."" In France, the hygiene-beauty category has been ""deprioritized"" for several years in household budgets. ""There is a decline in the beauty budget, which leads to an overall 0.8% market drop in volume (compared to -1.3% in 2017), and a 0.2% drop in value,"" explains Anaïs Dupuy, Business Development Manager of Kantar WorldPanel. Consumers buy fewer products, but these have a higher monetary value. This can be explained by a routine change, as consumers increasingly turn to organic, selective, or new products. As the population rises by 0.4% per year, mechanically, there should be at least a similar rise of the market… which means the 0.2% drop is significant! Although every French person purchased at least one hygiene-beauty product in 2018 (penetration rate of 98.2%), buying acts declined by 0.5 point in three years, and hygiene-beauty opportunities dropped by six per week in six years (51.4 in 2013, 45.2 in 2018). The market has turned to face skincare, the category that recruited the highest number of buyers in 2018. For the first year, the ""face toiletries"" category receded, although it had remained stable until then, thanks to the success of micellar waters over the past years. The ""less is more"" trend, the will to turn to natural skincare, the rise of societal and environmental concerns, with the vegan and zero waste movements, the impact of icons and influencers taking a stand for the no-make-up or deo-free practices… all these factors contribute to simplifying routines. In addition, the market seems to be divided into two. Consumers aged under 50 tend to purchase fewer hygiene-beauty products, while those aged 50+ buy more of them. As a result, it is important to make young consumers reengage in hygiene-beauty, because if they de-consume now and change their routines, they are likely to maintain this behaviour in the future. Hygiene-beauty remains the most ""multichannel"" category of consumer goods: 46% of the money spent in this sector goes to specialized channels (i.e. +1.4 point, compared to 2014). ""The year 2018 highlights a change in the choice of buying channels. French people buy their products using 3.3 channels (3.1 in 2014), which emphasizes the fact that consumers switch back and forth between the various distribution channels,"" explains Anaïs Dupuy. Supermarkets have been losing ground, although 60 units out of 100 are still purchased through mass distribution. However, for the first time, pharmacies have been losing ground, contrary to discount shops (Gifi, Stokomani, Action, etc.), which are continuing their progression. Ultimately, pure players on the web keep growing on the beauty market, with 1.3 million new buyers over a year. Almost one French person out of three purchased hygiene-beauty products online with a budget of about 100 euros per year in 2018. Out of 100 euros spent in e-commerce, 17.90 concern this category, compared to 9 in the traditional channel. It certainly deserves close attention… Despite the weakness of its internal market, the French cosmetics industry remains healthy, thanks to its high export performance. According to the French Federation of Beauty Companies (FEBEA), the year 2018 was actually marked by a new record: export sales exceeded 14.5 billion euros – a 6.3% rise, compared to 2017. ""Beauty Business is aimed to become one of the three main CEW annual events, with the Journée de la Beauté and the Achiever Awards. It is organized in partnership with the industry's leaders, who do us the honour to accept our invitation,"" emphasizes Laurence Moulin, General Manager of CEW France. Next CEW France events: - March 25: Joël Palix, Success story FeelUnique As his professional career is taking a new direction, Joël Palix will think back on the five years he spent as the head of FeelUnique, which became the first European beauty e-shop with him as a Director. – 12 Avril : Wellness is the new beauty Environmental awareness, body-positive movement, a new, more global and more holistic vision of beauty is needed. – June 25: Third CEW France Journée de la Beauté (Beauty Day)"
New export sales record for the French cosmetics industry,"French exports of perfumes and cosmetics broke the 14.5 billion euro mark in 2018 according to figures published by the French trade association representing cosmetic manufacturers (FEBEA). A +6.3% increase compared to 13.6 billion euros in 2017. While the French market itself is still struggling (-0.2% in value in 2018, according to Kantar Worldpanel), exports remain more than ever the main driver of French manufacturers in the sector. Logically, export sales in value exceeded this year again the turnover achieved by the manufacturers on the French market and the trade balance remains largely in surplus (11.2 billion euros, i.e., an increase of nearly 6.6% over 2017). The French cosmetics industry, thus secures its place on the podium of French export champions just behind aeronautics and wines and spirits. Despite the slowing down of the global economy, which hampered the rise of exports (they had increased by +12% between 2016 and 2017), this new record confirms the attractiveness for French cosmetics. ""French cosmetics continue to play a leading role across the world. Admired for its excellence, it innovates constantly to meet the new quests of consumers for well-being: quality and safety of formulations, personalisation of products and environmental commitment,"" enthused Patrick O'Quin, President of the FEBEA. Despite a slowdown, exports to Asia have remained strong, with a 16.6% increase in 2018, and increases of more than 20% in China (+ 22.7%) and Singapore (+24%). Today, more than 20% of French products are exported to Asia, representing more than 2.6 billion euros in value. Meanwhile, exports to North America posted an increase of 6.8%, including a rise in sales of 5.7% in the U.S. This country is the second largest market for French exports. While sales in South America and Central America remained stable. The leading destination for French exports, the European Union is also experiencing sustained growth with a 4.5% rise in sales of Made in France products. The highest increases occurring in Spain (+8.5%) and Italy (+7.2%), two markets that are continuing to close the gap. French manufacturers are watching closely the outcome of Brexit negotiations, as the United Kingdom is the second EU country (after Germany) for French exports of perfumes and cosmetics (more than 1 billion euros, up 3% in 2018). Outside the EU, a strong growth of Russia (+17.8%) is observed. The picture is more contrasted in the Africa zone, with a +16.8% rise in West Africa, but a drop of 6.8% in Central and Southern Africa. North Africa is also declining (-3.7%), mainly due to the ban on imports in Algeria. Finally, a slight drop (-2.1%) in exports can be observed in Near and Middle East markets (Saudi Arabia, down 6.2%), closely linked to oil price variations. Personal care products and perfumes still account for three-quarters of French cosmetic exports: 45% for personal care and 22% for perfumes. Among other leading categories, make-up continues its momentum with exports up (by 4.8% for lip make-up and 3.7% for eye make-up), while haircare preparations and shampoos are not lagging behind with increases of respectively 7.5% and 5.8%."
How is Muslim beauty redefining the Asian cosmetic market?,"Premium Beauty News - How is Muslim beauty redefining the Asian cosmetic market? Florence Bernardin - The majority of Malaysia and Indonesia inhabitants are Muslims (respectively 60% and 87% of the population), and Indonesia is the biggest Muslim country in the world with 225 million Muslims. In these countries, Muslim women are highly observant of their religion and it has a strong impact on their relationship to beauty. Premium Beauty News - Social media also play a role? Florence Bernardin - Young Muslim modern women are redefining the fashion and beauty landscape, by creating modest fashion empires (Fashion Valet by Vivy Yusof, Hijup by Diajeng Lestari) or new halal beauty platforms (Pretty Succi). Muslimah are the new social media influencers, they share their beauty tips, their faith testimonials and their family moments, creating a strong bound with their community of followers. Premium Beauty News - A huge opportunity for Halal beauty? Florence Bernardin - Halal beauty is booming as Halal certification becomes a requirement in Indonesia for every product in 2019, making the 4th most populated country in the world a huge market for Halal beauty and innovation. In parallel, Malaysia appears as an expert in halal certification, attracting foreign companies, like Amore Pacific who plans to open a new manufacturing plant in Malaysia by 2020 to tap into the Halal beauty market. Premium Beauty News - Is Halal the new black in these countries? Florence Bernardin - Halal now goes beyond religious concerns as halal certification requires a strict, clean process of fabrication. By nature, it's free from most animal components and cruelty-free, which makes it appealing to the vegetarian/vegan public and consumers concerned with ethics and safety. Actually, Halal is becoming an equivalent of clean and safe beauty. Premium Beauty News - Is it also an opportunity for indie brands? Florence Bernardin - The past three years saw the emergence of a huge number of local indie brands, who not only introduce make-up that can compete with international brands in terms of quality and colour palette but also advocate local pride and diversity in skin tones and beauty features. Indie brands have also totally submerged the market by promoting their products through influencers like Tara Farysia or Khainina Khalil, and addressing their fans through feminine and edgy Instagram accounts (Dear Me Beauty, Mad for Make Up, dUck Cosmetics).

""With 2,947 exhibitors coming from over 70 countries and more than 250,000 expected visitors, the event confirms its role as the key appointment for the entire cosmetic industry,"" said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere during the press preview of the 2019 edition."
The homemade trend in the spotlight,"Aroma-Zone, one of the pioneers of this concept and an expert in ""homemade"" aromatherapy, has been leading the market for 18 years as a real reference brand. President and Co-Founder Anne Vausselin has observed an assertion of behaviours and of the market itself over the past few years. ""At first, we were seen as UFOs. Today, our offering is in line with a basic trend that has more to do with society than business. For consumers, it corresponds to a need to reappropriate knowledge about the products they consume. It is a need to control things,"" she explains. Initially created in 2000 as an e-shop dedicated to essential oils, Aroma-Zone decided to focus on DIY as soon as 2005, as they gave access to over 1,000 cosmetics recipes to do yourself, thanks to a broad catalogue of raw materials, containers, utensils, and then finished products. A first store opened in 2009, before being extended in 2014 to offer a 500 m2 space, including a workshop and a spa. The year 2018 was marked by the opening of two new points of sale in Paris and Lyon, and 2019 promises an expansion of the network across France, as well as towards bordering countries. As it is gaining ground on conventional cosmetics in terms of market shares, the DIY dynamics has been attracting new players. ""And it is not about to stop, because the offering will get broader,"" predicts Nelly Pitt, creator of the Beautymix brand, whose concept consists in associating ingredients and recipes with a robot for the homemade manufacturing of all bathroom products. ""After cooking and sewing, cosmetics is one of the latest in the homemade field to which consumers increasingly turn. I think it is the future of cosmetics. There should be something for every taste, and this one is not completely satisfied,"" she adds. The homemade trend echoes the expectations of consumers with a greater ethnic, social, age, and sex diversity. ""It has become a fundamental need to take care of yourself and of your close environment with natural products. The purchasing power should also be taken into account: customers want fair prices compared to the value of their products,"" says the President of Aroma-Zone. If the first bloggers and YouTubers rivalled with complex formulas composed of a long list of ingredients, today, the trend is moving towards more simplicity. ""Over the past five years, in particular with the slow and moderate consumption movements, we have found out that consumers want formulas composed of maximum five or six ingredients, and which are easy to make, cheap, and above all, very efficient. We are going back to basics, with a business objective that is far above what it was ten years ago,"" explains Anne Vausselin. This minimalist approach is also the basis of the Beautymix concept: in its catalogue, the brand deliberately offers only 28 multifunctional ingredients, with which the 14 recipes offered can be done. ""Consumers can easily get lost in the huge diversity of raw materials available. The idea is to simplify the approach for beginners and focus on quality ingredients that can fulfil several functions,"" explains the founder. For those that follow the trend, making a cosmetic product themselves, meaning they control its composition, is also a safety guarantee. But to actually ensure the product safety, users should be aware of a number of good hygiene practices and learn how to respect doses and preserve formulas. ""Obviously, the safety of cosmetics requires a dose of good sense as well as raising public awareness, just like it does for cooking,"" explains Anne Vausselin. However, health authorities and the main players have committed to setting up stricter regulations and ensuring safety homogeneously, through all the entities involved. Aroma-Zone has carefully answered all requests from ANSM (French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety): the company made tremendous efforts to demonstrate the safety of its offering, over two years, and by means of considerable investments. ""Today, all our recipes are assessed by toxicologists under the same conditions as cosmetic products placed on the market. All our workshops are also evaluated. We worked extremely hard on all the bases to be personalized: combined with actives or perfume extracts, they represent millions of potential combinations. And we secured these millions of possibilities by developing algorithms,"" explains Anne Vausselin. Same arguments for Beautymix: they have their ingredients and recipes tested by toxicologists to validate their safety. ""We did everything to guarantee comprehensive solutions that support people from the first to the last manufacturing step, by ensuring both safety and traceability throughout the process."" Users register the products manufactured on their mobile Beautymix app, which provides the expiry date and the traceability of the raw materials used. ""It replaces the product label,"" explains Nelly Pitt. ""Initially, the objective was to control market players' practices, and it was commendable, because everyone benefits from a regulatory framework, and the market keeps developing. But, obviously, authorities are less demanding with those that do not play by the rules. We need to follow consumers: they show a real need for freedom, they have expectations. But, of course, it needs to be secured, if only for the concept to last,"" concludes Anne Vausselin."
"Beauty trends: Green, clean… what's next?","Over the past two years, countless other requirements have added up to ""green"" and ""clean"": vegan, halal, cruelty-free, local, seasonal, DIY, handcrafted, small batches, and zero waste - and of course, ""organic"" is at the source of this widespread green movement (we had almost forgotten about it!). In addition to these leading trends, today's consumers want evidence that their products are environmentally friendly: what the product contains is no longer the main issue, nor is efficacy. Instead: where do the ingredients come from? How were they and farmers taken care of? What are the materials contained in the packaging? How are products transported? Etc. All this raises many other questions brands and suppliers need or will need to answer, like: is it meaningful to have ingredients come from the other side of the world? Is it ethical and coherent to boast about using a plant from Amazonia or Okinawa? At least, certainly not without offsetting the carbon emissions produced or ensuring the sustainability of the said ingredient (""giving back to the Earth""). Given the many discussions available online, in public hearings, in focus groups, or in the written press, it will no longer be acceptable. The search for transparency has no limits: the corresponding term is ""Radical Transparency"" (the economic model of DNVBs). Indeed, it is now packaging's turn to be in the spotlight, with the following questions to answer: is the pack used recyclable? Recycled? Biobased? How? Why has the brand chosen to use this material instead of another? What country does it come from? What about transport? The use of single-use plastic is despised, and the era of post-plastic is coming, as can be seen with Lush's Naked range and their three zero plastic stores, and the success of solid cosmetics (Lamazuna have seen their sales boom since COP21), of new bulk cosmetics models, like CoZie, or of DIY, such as the new Typology brand – the first competitor to Aroma-Zone? They use plastic, but they say they have been working hard to get rid of it. Traceability is being implemented throughout the supply chain, because users want and will want to know everything. Hence this key position for brands: state, explain, provide information upstream (before any potential bad buzz)… even if everything is not perfect. Indie brands do that particularly well: ""We are not perfect, but we are working on it!"" To conclude, the equation of 100% virtuous brands is hard to solve, but many initiatives give reason for confidence, as they help manage this huge change – for the planet, which also means for us. Both the main players in the cosmetics and food industries and Indie brands give priority to sustainable development and CSR. And it is getting cross-disciplinary, just like digital technologies were, ten years ago. The fact that a giant like Danone achieves the feat of meeting the B Corp Certification requirements is incredibly inspirational! (In Canada and the US, Emmanuel Faber aims to have Danone Monde get B Corp-certified in the years to come: see the film Après Demain. In the cosmetics industry, Laboratoires Expanscience already have this certificate). The new Loop ""zero waste"" platform to be launched next spring is also an amazing initiative: this e-commerce website federates 25 multinationals and involves a deposit system for flagship consumer products in order to reduce waste. And of course, it is easy-to-use for consumers. As for ADEME (French Agency for the Environment and Energy Management), they have launched the ""Circular economy"" label as the ultimate guarantee. Everyone is active on their own level. ""Be part of it!"", as Stella McCartney exclaimed as she announced the creation of a Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. This article provides a synthesis of the already available study ""Green, what's next?"" conducted by Florence Bernardin, Laurence Caisey, and Hugo Willemin. See the agency's website at www.trendsourcing.com"
"Intelligence is the common thread of top 10 global consumer trends in 2019, finds Euromonitor","""The world feels out of control as we move into 2019. There is much political upheaval in developed markets and fast, totally unprecedented change in developing economies,"" say Euromonitor analysts. In such a context, many of the global consumer trends to watch in 2019 are about taking back control and asserting oneself. ""We need to feel just a bit more powerful amidst the chaos,"" highlights Euromonitor. The top 10 global consumer trends chosen by Euromonitor in 2019 are: – Age Agnostic. Boundaries of old age are shifting. As people live longer and take better care of themselves, older consumers feel and want to be treated as younger. – Back to Basics for Status. Shoppers are searching for authentic products and experiences, moving away from overt materialism to simplicity as well as from generic to higher quality products. – Conscious Consumer. What used to be the domain of ethically-positioned, niche producers is now being embraced by conventional companies. – Digitally Together. High-speed internet and mobile internet are driving live interactive experiences online and facilitating instant collaboration. – Everyone's an Expert. Whereas previously shoppers relied on a certain brand or information source, now companies must constantly innovate to entice more inquisitive shoppers. – Finding My JOMO. The Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) has now given place to the Joy Of Missing Out (JOMO). Consumers want to protect their mental wellbeing, disconnecting from technology and prioritizing what they truly want and enjoy doing. – I Can Look After Myself. As people become more self-sufficient, they take preventative measures against illness, unhappiness and discomfort without consulting a professional. – I Want a Plastic-free World. The push for a plastic-waste-free society has gained momentum. – I Want it Now! Consumers seek instant gratification and frictionless experiences that mesh with their lifestyles, allowing them to dedicate more time to their professional or social lives. – Loner Living. More people – especially older consumers - across the world break the stigma of living alone and embrace their independent lifestyles. ""Intelligence is the common thread linking all trends in 2019. How we live is so centrally dependent on the choices available that the biggest issue is how se make sense of it all. Simplifying your options, having smooth purchasing experiences, being mindful and ultimately opting out altogether are all intrinsic,"" comments Gina Westbrook, Director of Consumer Trends at Euromonitor International.

Organic and natural beauty trends for 2019,"Global demand for natural and organic cosmetics. Initially stemming from Europe and North America, demand for natural and organic cosmetics is becoming increasingly global. Asia's share of the international natural cosmetics market is expected to continue to rise, as its consumers seek products without contentious synthetic chemicals. More natural and organic product launches are likely to be in the Asia-Pacific, as well as other regions. Multinationals launching natural & ethical lines. In the last twelve months, Unilever launched Love, Beauty & Planet, Henkel introduced Nature Box and N.A.E., and L'Oréal launched Seed Phytonutrients and La Provençale Bio. On the launch pad are P&G's Pure by Gillette and Garnier's new organic skin care line. More such product launches are likely as multinationals continue to chase the 'ethical dollar'. Investments and acquisitions. Ecovia expects to see more investments and acquisitions involving natural and organic cosmetic firms in 2019. Some of the notable acquisitions in the last twelve months were Logocos Naturkosmetik by L'Oréal, The Organic Pharmacy by Istituto Ganassini, and Natural Products Group by Groupe Rocher. Reducing packaging impacts. Consumer concerns about plastic pollution in the oceans and landfill is making cosmetic and personal care companies address their packaging impacts. A growing number of companies are looking at sustainable materials and / or eco-design approach. Sustainable sourcing. Cosmetic and ingredient firms will continue to invest in sustainable sourcing of raw materials. More sustainability schemes are likely to be introduced for single ingredients, as well as general sourcing practices. Ethical labels. Ecovia also expects to see more ethical labels on cosmetic & personal care products in 2019. In the last few months, Herbal Essences got Environmental Working Group (EWG) Verification label and Natura Brasil products received Leaping Bunny certification. Other labels making headway include Vegan, Halal, Non-GMO, as well as COSMOS and Natrue (natural & organic labels). Clean beauty retailing. Credo Beauty has already made its mark in the US as a clean beauty retailer. More such retailers are likely to open their doors in North America and Europe. At the same time, more conventional beauty retailers are having 'clean beauty' sections. Sephora and Space NK are two such retailers devoting shelf-space to beauty products without contentious chemicals. Indie brands will continue to gain popularity; Douglas recently announced plans to expand its range of small niche brands in its European retail network. Growing power of millennials. The millennials are already some of the most avid buyers of natural & organic products; they will wield greater influence as their spending power continues to rise. As they buy more from online platforms, Amazon and other eretailers will gain market share for natural & ethical products. Ecovia Intelligence will cover such developments at the following events: – Sustainable Cosmetics Summit North America (8-10 May, New York) – Natural Cosmetics Masterclass: Future Directions (22 May, Paris)"
Cosme Tokyo on tracks for a record breaking edition,"Cosme Tokyo and its two concomitant shows, Cosme Tech, dedicated to the beauty industry supply chain, including ingredients and packaging, and Inner Beauty Tokyo, dedicated to beauty and health foods, will take place on 30-31 January and 1 February 2019 at the Makuhari Messe international convention centre.

Beauty trends: Skincare gets personal for 2019,"As we head into 2019, it is becoming increasingly clear that the world of skincare is about to get very personal indeed. New digital technologies and scientific advances mark the advent of a hyper-personalized era. This paradigm shift is transforming the industry and the way cosmetic products are designed: ingredients can be selected to fits to one's specific skin type, to the local environment, the genetic heritage, or the needs or desires of each. Forget the one-size-fits-all approach to beauty: the products of the future are all about tweaking formulas to work for individual clients. Clinique is leading the way, following the launch of 'Clinique iD', a custom-blend hydrating system that allows shoppers to pick and choose from a range of moisturizing options tailored to their needs. The concept features three 'Dramatically Different' hydration bases that come in the form of a jelly, lotion and gel, into which users then insert one of five active cartridges that focus on the issue of pores, irritation, fatigue, uneven skin tone, and lines and wrinkles. The two ingredients are delivered together in a ratio of 90 percent base to 10 percent cartridge ingredient for a product that better suit each shopper in terms of texture and results. This month, Neutrogena made the headlines at the 2019 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) when it unveiled its 'Neutrogena MaskiD' concept; essentially an app that allows users to order fully customized 3D-printed face masks, by getting them to take a selfie and providing an accurate assessment of their skincare needs and facial measurements. The masks are divided into six different zones that can be imbued with five different ingredients, will be designed to fit each individual face. It isn't just products that are getting smarter — beauty apps are now offering users tailored advice at the tap of a screen. Back in October Avon unveiled its 'Personalized Beauty App,' which lets its six million representatives deliver a more bespoke level of service to clients by helping them perfectly match foundation shades to skin tones, while skincare heavyweight Olay recently unveiled a 'Skin Advisor' platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to offer users personal skincare consultations and advice. And while there are still hardly any smart mirrors in individual bathrooms, they should spread quickly in beauty and hair salons, in spas and in beauty retails. Indeed, the customization trend has also made its way into the beauty aisles: Perfect Corp, the developer behind YouCam, revealed plans for its 'Beauty 3.0' concept at CES 2019 this month, featuring AI and augmented reality (AR) solutions that aim to transform the in-store beauty shopping experience. Some of the concept's features — which include an 'AI Smart Shade Finder' that gives users recommended foundation shades and an 'AI Skin Diagnostic' that tracks dermatological concerns over time — are set to be tested out in select Ulta Beauty retail stores over the course of this year. For its part, Japanese skincare brand SK-II has also been hard at work on a 'Future X Smart Store' that relies on 'phygital' retail experiences incorporating AI technologies to take shoppers on a digital in-store journey, offering individual facial analysis and product recommendation."
Beauty must-haves for the new year,"If customization is the secret garden of natural and niche brands, Clinique has just restored balance with a real innovation and new packaging for its iconic product DDML (Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion) accompanied with a digital app Clinical Reality: an individualized questionnaire to help women customize their beauty regime. This launch will be the biggest since Even Better in 2010. You choose a base - three choices are offered (Hydrating Jelly, Lotion, or Oil-control gel), that you combine with one of five colored cartridges of booster serum that treat five problems: irritation, large pores, skin irregularities, tired skin, and lines and wrinkles. You place the booster serum cartridge in the center of the vial. The two formulas are distributed at the same time by a pump, which produces a blend of 90% base and 10% active ingredient. To respond to the expectations of generation Y, the Clinical Reality digital app will soon be launched. It consists of a questionnaire that will enable women to customize their beauty regime. Right now, Clinique's beauty advisors are analyzing skin and ask dermatological questions about customers' needs. By the end of 2019, other products will be added to the franchise. Clarins launches My Clarins, a new brand of ethical and healthy skin cares, for the great satisfaction of women ages 18 to 29, the target group for this new Eco/vegan-friendly line. Fruit and floral waters and plant extract with a host of benefits: this is the healthy cocktail offered by Clarins for its new beauty brand that it calls ""the new generation of skincare"". With Made with Care, we're taking another step towards Cosmetics 2.0. Created by Jean Michel Karam who made Ioma. M/C is a young, urban, fun brand that targets young women who want skincare but are also health conscious. This new line corrects certain skin problems and helps avoid the first signs of aging. A particular mention is attributed to its engagement in the fight against pollution and especially the dangers of high energy visible or blue light (H.E.V.), a main cause of aging. In 2017, we saw the retirement of our mothers' night creams in favor of Sleeping Masks... and today they're back! Remember, in 2013, Prescriptives launched a super product, Good in Bed Skin Restoring Night Moisturizer, an efficient night cream that was ideal for winter and lightly colored skin tone with a hint of self-tan. Today, Glamglow offers Good in Bed, a real night cream with passion fruit. Its formula is rich and generous. As soon as you open the jar, you are overwhelmed by the scent of passion fruit oil, which does not take away from the effectiveness of its AHA / BHA / PHA formula associated with hyaluronic acid."
10 key trends in natural and organic beauty,"Move from linear to circular design models A number of speakers called for a sea change in design thinking of cosmetic products. According to them, cosmetic and personal care products should be created so that packaging materials can be re-used or upcycled at the end of their lives. Eric Kawabata from TerraCycle said the issue is that most fast-moving consumer goods were designed for single-use, with packaging ending in landfill or incineration. His company aims to eliminate the idea of waste by collecting waste materials and using it to create new products. His organization has already partnered with cosmetic companies such as Garnier, Colgate-Palmolive, and P&G. Growing array of natural ingredients According to Alain Khaiat from Seers Consulting, a range of functional ingredients are now available for natural skin care products; they include humectants, rheology modifiers, emulsifiers, surfactants and emollients. However, according to Barbara Olioso of The Green Chemist Consultancy, the use of such natural ingredients brings formulation issues like stability and performance. Classification of natural and organic ingredients remains a thorny issue. Because of this, DSM has compared popular certification schemes and the ISO 16128 guidelines to come up with three simplified categories: certified organic, verified natural, and natural origin. Sustainable sourcing Greater questions are being asked about the origins, extraction and processing methods of cosmetic raw materials. There is already pressure for agricultural-based materials like palm oil to be sustainably sourced. Case studies were given on how improve the sustainability of supply chains: – Kurt L Nübling, CEO and Founder of PrimaveraLife, gave details of its ethical sourcing projects for organic essential oils. – Temuulen Murun from Shiseido raised the issue about the mineral mica: 75% of global supply comes from north-east India where there are concerns about health risks and child labour. Although just 18% of mica goes to the cosmetics industry, about 20 companies have signed up to the Responsible Mica Initiative. Traceability and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Matthias Lergenmüller from Merck showed how supply chains of cosmetic ingredients can be linked to the SDGs. According to Matthias, traceability can help companies minimise environmental, social and health risks in their supply chains. Plethora of ethical labels Sustainability schemes and ethical standards continue to gain popularity, with a growing number of products brandishing symbols and logos. Amarjit Sahota, Founder and President of Ecovia Intelligence, said the cosmetics industry is going the same way as the food industry where there are over 200 different ethical labelling schemes. As far as the Halal label is concerned, Fabrice Guillemard from DSM believes most prospects are in Asia, considering the region houses 1.5 billion Muslims. Indeed, three-quarters of Halal cosmetic launches last year were in the Asia-Pacific. Indonesia and India are adjudged to have most potential. Product innovations Steven Ko, Founder and President of the Taiwanese brand Hair O' Right showed how the company is formulating products using food side stream ingredients, such as coffee husks and goji berry roots. Matthieu Erre gave insights into how Yves Rocher is integrating sustainability and innovation. The brand has introduced concentrated shower gels, concentrated shampoos, and eco-designed cosmetics. While, Slovenian company Hemptouch gave details on the therapeutic qualities of its cannabis-based skin care products. Resource efficiency to zero-waste Most personal care companies have put resource efficiency into their sustainability programmes. Some like P&G have gone further to set zero-waste targets. Jacques Euler, Sustainability Program Leader from the Beauty Manufacturing Division, says the company is set to reach its target of 100% zero manufacturing waste to landfill from its operations by 2020. Regulations and findings suitable waste partners were cited as major challenges for the company in meeting this target internationally. Tackling ocean plastic The issue of ocean plastic came up several times at the summits. Kenny Harmel, Co-Founder of Galileo Watermark, said his company was compelled to find a solution when it discovered that a third of all plastic packaging ended up in the ocean. Galileo Watermark was the first company to launch a cosmetic product with packaging made from reclaimed ocean plastic. Since the launch of its OCN Cosmetics in December 2017, several companies have started using ocean plastic; these include P&G (Head & Shoulders beach plastic bottle), REN Clean Skincare, and Henkel. Novel green materials Many innovative green ingredients for cosmetic and personal care products were presented at the summits. Clariant gave details of its Genadvance material for sustainable hair conditioning. Covestro introduced Baycusan, used as a sustainable polyurethane for personal care products. DuPont showed how its GENENCARE OSMS BA material is derived from side stream of sugar beet production. Roelmi HPC presented Celus-Bi as a sustainable alternative to polyethylene beads. Plant cell technology Novel actives are being developed for cosmetic & personal care applications according to this new technology. Elodie Mauger from Mibelle Biochemistry thus showed how it has created MossCellTec from biotechnologically produced moss. According to Anna Holefors, Founder and CEO of In Vitro Plant-Tech, plant cell cultivation enables the production of tailor-made actives for the cosmetics industry. There are also sustainability benefits since the technology does not deplete the plant population.

Pink clay masks: the hottest skincare trend in 2019?,"Dior Beauty's version of the pink clay mask doubles up as a cleanser; the mask goes on as clay and then turns into an impurity-removing foam upon contact with water. It is enriched with Jojoba extracts and aims to minimize the appearance of pores in just three minutes. Draw out impurities and exfoliate your complexion at the same time with Herbivore Botanicals' pink clay mask, which contains French pink clay and organic rosehip powder to soften and soothe the skin. Sand & Sky's 'Australian Pink Clay' mask claims to eliminate toxins at the same time as stimulating collagen, for a naturally glowing and healthy-looking complexion. What's more; it comes with its own miniature brush for a mess-free application. Not only does Generation Clay's 'Urban Defence Mask' claim to purify the complexion and reduce the appearance of pores; it also contains aloe vera to calm any redness, and kakadu plum to protect against free radicals. Milk Makeup's brand new 'Watermelon Brightening Face Mask' comes in tube packaging, meaning it can be rolled onto the skin without making the mess often associated with traditional clay masks. The addition of watermelon fruit extract is designed to leave the skin feeling soft and hydrated."
The fashion brands that went big on beauty in 2018,"Spanish fashion stalwart Zara stepped into the beauty arena this month with the launch of a 20-piece lipstick collection in the UK. The series included 12 lipsticks and eight liquid lipsticks, with shades ranging from plums and pinks to deep reds and offering a velvety, matte finish. New | Zara lipsticks. Discover our selection of debut products: 12 velvety, highly pigmented and very comfortable matte lipsticks; 8 unstoppable, one stroke application, full matte liquid lipsticks; a set of the selection of three ULTIMATTE lipstick shades and our very special limited edition lip kit from the behind the scenes at the AW'18 ZARA WOMAN shooting Une publication partagée par ZARA Official (@zara) le 5 Déc. 2018 à 11 :31 PST British fashion chain Topshop brought back its 'Topshop Beauty' brand this fall, to the delight of fans. The new-and-improved line hit the shelves in November, offering eyeshadows, lip products, eyeliners, primers, blushes, bronzers, brushes and much more. Urban Outfitters made a play for the beauty market back in September, when it unveiled 'Ohii', an in-house series spanning skincare, bodycare and colour cosmetics products. The Instagrammable line is packaged simply in minimalist white containers with dashes of baby blue, yellow and pink. Italian label GCDS (an acronym for 'God Can't Destroy Streetwear') made waves with a four-piece lipstick collection that came out in November. The four bullet lip products include two bold lipsticks in matte red and sparkling pink, a clear lip balm and a pH-reactive green colour that transforms into a natural cherry tone when applied complete the lineup.

Colourful mascara, pastel nail polishes and sunset-hued palettes made this one thoroughly irresistible collection."
How inclusive foundation stole the show in 2018,"The movement was arguably kick-started by Rihanna, whose Fenty Beauty debut collection was lauded for its inclusive 40-shade foundation range upon its launch back in September 2017. It didn't take long for other brands to sit up and take notice: in May 2018, Tarte Cosmetics announced that it was expanding its 'Amazonian Clay' foundation range to include 40 different skin tone shades, up from 25, with 10 of the new shades falling into the ""tan to deep"" range. June saw the cult brand Too Faced unveil the results of its collaboration with blogger and influencer Jackie Aina in the form of an expansion of its 'Born This Way' foundation by 11 shades, bringing the total to 35, while Estée Lauder boosted its 'Double Wear' foundation range from 42 to 56 different hues over the summer. There were also plenty of newcomers to the foundation sector that focused on diversity - Marc Jacobs Beauty launched its new ""Shameless Youthful-look 24-h Longwear Foundation"" in February with 29 different shades, with the brand proclaiming that the product ""never appears chalky on camera or ashy on any skin tone."" Natural beauty brand Lush Cosmetics tested out a foundation release in June, with a limited-edition 40-shade strong 'Slap Stick' foundation collection, and NYX Cosmetics unveiled its 45-shade-strong 'Can't Stop Won't Stop' line in August, featuring a precise decimal labelling system that allows shoppers to choose both the perfect shade and undertone for their complexions. Revlon, meanwhile, upped its beauty game with the launch of a new prestige makeup brand, 'Flesh,' over the summer, offering 40 shades of foundation. So has the beauty industry resolved its diversity issues? Not quite, but this year has shown that brands are at least learning fast that, in this day and age, inclusivity sells. When Beautyblender made its first foray into the makeup industry in July with a 32-piece foundation line titled 'Bounce', it was criticized for being too limited in terms of shade ranges. This month, the brand added a further eight shades to its repertoire. Here's to a beautiful - and inclusive - 2019."
'Sub-Zero Waste' is 2019's key beauty and personal care trend,"""If brands don't change their approach now, they won't exist in the future. Beauty and personal care businesses must switch to a whole new paradigm in terms of sustainability and zero waste. Some companies are already discussing totally circumventing packaging. This is not just a trend, it is a movement,"" states Mintel in the introduction of its new report, Sub-Zero Waste' 2019 Global Beauty and Personal Care Trend. According to the market intelligence agency: ""Over the next five years, the focus on sustainability will reach new heights as environmentally conscious consumers look for ways to reduce waste in all aspects of their lives, including their beauty and personal care routines."" All around the world, consumers are already paying a lot more attention to their impact on the planet. For instance: – 44% of US natural/organic personal care consumers, who buy a mix of mainstream and natural/organic brands, say they live sustainably; – 74% of beauty and personal care consumers in Spain are concerned that the ingredients used in natural products are not sustainable; – 54% of Brazilians who are potential buyers of green/ethical products say they purchase sustainable/ environmentally friendly goods because they don't like to waste. The zero waste philosophy is gaining momentum. ""Better informed consumers will no longer tolerate egregious waste like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a direct consequence of years of indiscriminate abuse of single-use plastics,"" states Mintel. Brands that purposely create limited shelf life products or encourage overconsumption run the risk of consumer backlash. Consumers will demand that brands be more environmentally responsible and take accountability for their actions. In such a context, ""focussing efforts on reducing packaging is not enough"". Consumers will expect more ambitious endeavours and 'out-of-the-box' thinking from manufacturers and brands at every stage of the beauty supply chain. ""'Sub-Zero Waste' is not just a trend; it's a movement towards a ground-shaking new archetype for the beauty and personal care industry. Some companies are already discussing completely removing packaging from the equation. Whether reducing or eliminating waste altogether, if brands don't change their approach now, they will become insignificant. Brands that place current profits ahead of making the necessary investment in zero waste and sustainability will not be around in the future,"" says Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst, Mintel Beauty and Personal Care. Some indie brands have built their business practices around ethics and environmentally friendly products. For instance, French colour cosmetics brand La Bouche Rouge Paris, features reusable / refillable luxury lipstick packaging made from leather. But the brand wants to go further and is working to find a viable vegan plastic-free and luxurious alternative to leather to meet all its clients' expectations. And several more established brands have already joined the movement. For its debut foundation range, Lush Cosmetics has launched a 100% plastic-free product. From L'Oréal, to Henkel and Unilever, multinationals are massively jumping on the natural cosmetics bandwagon, simultaneously paying increased attention to the impact of their packaging. In the meantime, suppliers are multiplying eco-friendly options, from recycled glass to post-consumer plastics, and accelerate their investments in ecofriendly processes and products. To support the development of these alternatives, major beauty brands do not hesitate to invest in innovative start-ups. Last week, Finnish producer of wood-based resins Sulapac, announced that Chanel took stake in the company. ""There's no doubt that 'Sub-Zero Waste' will transform the beauty and personal care industry over the next five years and will evolve in ways even we can't predict over the next decade,"" concludes Mintel."
Russia: A fast-changing perfume market,"Specialized distributors still dominate the Russian perfume and cosmetics market (63.2% of sales). In 2018, the country counted 450 perfume, cosmetics, and drugstore chains, i.e. 16,000 points of sale [1]. The number of stores owned by the ten main players rose by about 20% over the past two years – a sign that the sector has recovered. New leader Magnit Cosmetics recorded the most spectacular growth, ahead of L'Etoile. Sales in physical stores have grown again, with a 16% increase, compared to 2014 [2]. As for online sales, they are booming, with a bigger average basket online than in physical stores. E-shops benefit from their ability to deliver products everywhere, across a territory characterized by its immensity and low density. Consumers also enjoy the wealth of information and tips available on the web. Still, the crisis that followed the fall of the rouble did change the game. Within a context of contraction of purchases, specialized chains strengthened their positions with large-scale promotional offers and loyalty programmes. Many of them banked on the development of their private labels to offer more affordable ranges, and opened their counters to local brands that managed to take advantage of this revived competitiveness after the rouble was devaluated. To maintain this sales level, major chains like L'Etoile, Rive Gauche, or Ile de Beauté, started to launch a series of promotional offers, in particular as part of their loyalty programmes, and asked their suppliers to make efforts. This trend significantly affected the premium segment, whose turnover stagnated in 2017. Several middle-range brands suffered a lot from these years of crisis: some of them disappeared from regional distribution channels, where European brands face the competition of Asia. By contrast, the luxury segment was relatively little affected by the crisis. Less present in points of sale owned by major chains, these products are usually distributed by department stores, like Tsum in Moscow, niche brands, or stores owned by the brands themselves. Perfumery remains a flagship category on the Russian market. The 2014 crisis was also overcome in this sector, but it did restructure the market. Today, Russian consumers prefer small sizes (30 ml and 50 ml), and the dividing line between men and women tends to become less marked, as women aspire to other olfactory worlds and are seduced by very trendy mixed perfumes – this trend mainly comes from niche brands. Layering is also on a roll. If consumers mostly shop in physical stores to be able to test products (64%), have an exchange (38%), or because they are used to it (24%), the Internet is attractive because it offers low prices (57%). [3] The public is better and better-informed and shows a real curiosity for the niche segment, a promise of exceptional products. If the niche perfume clientele is rather wealthy, this segment tends to open itself to middle class customers, who do not hesitate to save to be able to buy something qualitative. Consumers are very fond of rarity and novelty, but they mainly search for olfactory diversity. Beyond floral and fruity, and/or gourmand fragrances, very popular in Russia, customers have been opening to other olfactory territories. Fresh and Hesperidia notes remain timeless, but more heady perfumes, like Chypre, woody, and oriental scents have been more and more successful. The public is expecting a more complex perfume offering. To meet these demanding expectations, professionals are also getting more and more technical and rigorous. Again, local brands have managed to seize opportunities. Given the boom of niche stores, chains have been diversifying their offerings. They adapt by creating affordable, but qualitative perfumes, and they do not hesitate to collaborate with renowned perfumers, like Bertrand Duchaufour. Russian assessors, but also perfumers, more and more of whom have been launching their own independent brand, are ready to come study in France, at the GIP in Grasse, or for a two-day training in Paris, to improve and develop know-how. ""There is this will to offer the best quality possible from all perspectives. There is still freedom and curiosity in Russia,"" explains Bertrand Duchaufour. As for niche brands, they had to create alliances to withstand big chain competition, as explains the Director of label SuperCosmetics, which distributes brands like État Libre d'Orange, Olfactive Studio, and Histoires de Parfum, in particular via the Cosmotheca store network. The La Niche project works in a similar way: every year, at the InterCHARM show, it gathers a selection of brands, like Miller Harris, Micaleff, Urban Scents, The Harmonist, Profumi Del Forte, Neemah, Comptoir Sud Pacifique, Mauboussin, and, starting from this year, small Russian perfume houses, to offer them better visibility among distributors. The crisis effects are gradually fading, losing ground to an enthusiastic market which tends to follow Europe in terms of tastes and practices, and where the niche segment has a bright future ahead."

The new alliance will be aimed at developing the business of players in the central European cosmetic markets, thus increasing growth opportunities for more than 500,000 professional operators and 9,000 exhibitors participating in the events offered by the two platforms."
Multinationals jump on natural cosmetics bandwagon,"Clearly, the cosmetics and toiletries market is not meeting current consumer expectations regarding natural and organic products. The gap does fully explain why sales remain flat but certainly significantly contribute to the trend. ""Consumers are turning to natural and organic products as they wish to avoid contentious synthetic chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries. The primary motive is avoidance of parabens, SLS / SLES, and chemicals with associated health risks,"" explains Ecovia Intelligence, a research and consulting company that focuses on the natural and sustainable product industries. As a consequence, giant cosmetics makers are trying to jump on the natural cosmetics bandwagon launching their own natural ranges. With Seed Phytonutrients, which launched in the United States on Earth Day in April 2018, L'Oréal aims to ""plant the seeds of health, well-being, and sustainability for future generations"" thanks to a harmonious balance between the environment, beauty, agriculture, and sustainable business. In Europe, the multinational has bought, in August 2018, Germany's Logocos Naturkosmetik and has launched a new organic cosmetic brand dubbed La Provençale. The group also announced that a new Garnier organic range would hit shelves in France and Western Europe as of early 2019. In a similar move to capitalize on consumer demand for 'clean beauty' products, Unilever has launched the Love, Beauty and Planet brand, while Henkel, known for brands like Schwarzkopf and Dial, is doubling down on vegan beauty with the launch of a new brand dubbed Nature Box. Even more launches of natural products are expected from multinationals, however all may not be successful. ""Prior to the natural product launches route, the favoured mode of entry of multinationals was acquisitions. Yet, not all have provided dividends. In 2007, L'Oreal purchased The Body Shop and the organic cosmetics brand Sanoflore. The former brand was sold off to Natura Brasil last year, whilst Sanoflore remains a 'marginalised' brand. Critics argue that L'Oreal's recent purchase of the Logona and Sante brands will suffer the same fate. Since purchasing the Logocos business in August, some organic food retailers in Germany are considering delisting,"" highlights Ecovia Intelligence. The market research firm sees consumer acceptance as a major challenge for multinationals. According to a recent research consumers identify small / indie brands with green values. ""The same consumers will shun green products of large corporations,"" forecasts Ecovia. The way forward maybe integration whilst differentiation: acquire natural or organic brands yet maintain their independence and core values. Nevertheless, as ethical consumerism becomes mainstream and natural and organic products continue to make inroads in conventional channels, the multinationals cannot ignore this important trend. According to Ecovia Intelligence, global retail sales of natural and organic cosmetics have grown from almost nothing to USD 10.2 billion between 2002 and 2017. ""Large companies like L'Oréal and Unilever will continue to hedge their bets between developing green products and outright acquisitions. Market winners will be those who can successfully align brand values to consumer expectations. Others are likely to underperform as they find the green road is littered with obstacles,"" concludes the market research firm."
"UK shaving and hair removal market lacks innovation, says Mintel","Over the last two years, the popularity of body hair removal has shot up among the British men; in 2018, as many as 46% of all men removed hair from their bodies, up from just over a third (36%) in 2016. Actually, Mintel research reveals that young men aged 16-24 are removing body hair almost as much as young women of the same age, with similar proportions of both (29% of men versus 34% of women) removing hair more frequently in the last 12 months [1]. Young men shave, wax and laser almost all of their body. According to Mintel, a plucky 57% of young males aged 16-24 say they have removed hair from their pubic region, compared to 40% in 2016. Meanwhile, 42% of males aged 16-24 remove hair from their underarms, up from 16% in 2016. Hair removal from the chest has risen from 15% in 2016, doubling to 30% in 2018; while hair removal from the back has increased from 10% in 2016 to 12% in 2018. In comparison, the top three hair removal areas for women aged 16-24 are underarms (90%), legs (90%) and the pubic region (75%). ""Consumers today are feeling the pressure to be hair-free. However, whilst the pressure on women remains higher, we're seeing more and more young men in particular feeling the need to be hair-free too. This year has also seen new product development in the male body hair removal category, notably Nivea's Men's Body Hair Removal range, as well as launches from Veet and Nad's targeting men,"" said Roshida Khanom, Associate Director, Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. It's not just the body that is receiving the hair-free treatment, as facial hair removal among Brits has risen from 73% in 2016 to 80% in 2018. According to Mintel, the number of Brits removing hair from their eyebrows has risen from 33% in 2016 to over four in ten (42%) in 2018. Meanwhile, the number of Brits removing hair from their nose has risen from 11% in 2016 to 20% in 2018. ""While older men have traditionally been less concerned with hair removal (just 12% of men aged over 65 removed hair from their nose in 2016), modern times have seen a shift,"" said the market research firm. In 2018, 31% of men aged over 65 removed hair from their nose, with 32% removing hair from their eyebrows and 34% removing hair from their ears. ""Whilst young men are leading the trend of body hair removal, older men are driving facial hair removal, highlighting that older men are also feeling the pressure to keep up with appearances,"" adds Roshida. However, despite increased grooming around the face, the beard trend shows no evidence of waning. According to Mintel, 44% of men have some stubble, 20% a closely trimmed beard and 7% a thick/full beard. The majority (76%) of adults agree that beards should be well groomed. Finally, while Brits are reaching for their blades, Mintel research reveals a decline in the value of the shaving and hair removal products sector. Sales of shaving and hair removal products declined 4% in 2018 to reach £558 million, from £579 million in 2017. ""As both genders feel the pressure to be hair-free, facial and body hair removal rates have seen a rise; however, the category continues to show a decline in value, with little activity in product innovation encouraging consumers to trade up. The beard trend shows no evidence of waning in 2018, with the razors and blades segment reflecting the impact; whilst savvy shopping behaviours, discounting and the rise in low-cost subscription services have resulted in a more scrupulous shopper,"" concludes Roshida."
Cosmoprof Asia: A first successful try for the new duo Informa / Bologna Fiere,"Premium Beauty News: When the number 3 on the list of global organizers of trade shows buys the number 2, the information does not go unnoticed! David Bondi - It could go unnoticed, because it won't change anything to the future of the different events organized by Informa and Bologna Fiere in Asia, as each of them have their autonomy and life of their own. Of course, exhibitors and visitors will both benefit from certain geographical synergies existing within the portfolio. Because this deal clearly reinforces our mutual presence in Asia. Don't forget that Informa now weighs around GBP 1.4 billion in exhibitions only and that its net margin exceeds 30%. This group is mainly specialized in the production of academic publications, business intelligence, knowledge& networks and exhibitions with 500 b to b events taking place in the world. Our JV with our Italian partner, Bologna Fiere, allows us to expand our influence all over Asia with specialized trade shows dedicated to the Beauty sector in China, Thailand, Japan, India with the launch this year of Cosmoprof India, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, etc. Premium Beauty News - Informa is the owner of the huge China Beauty Expo trade show. Will this new partnership have an impact on Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong? David Bondi - In fact, these two events have little in common except of course of focusing on the beauty sector. Because the first one, China Beauty Expo, is very national-focused, on the world's fastest growing beauty market, while Cosmoprof Asia is very international. We welcome 5% of foreign visitors in Shanghai, while they account for 72 % in Hong Kong. China Beauty Expo is a super-platform to conquer the domestic Chinese market, Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong is the place where brands and suppliers have the opportunity to approach and concentrate on the entire Asian distribution and beyond. Both events are also very strong in the supply chain with Cosmetech in Shanghai and Cosmopack Asia in Hong Kong. In terms of floor space, differences are significant since Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong totals 113,000 m2 and China Beauty Expo in Shanghai 240,000 m2! Yet there is a common point to both events, the growth of the number of exhibitors, between 8% and 10% each year. Premium Beauty News - Your partnership with Bologna Fiere also includes India, where a Cosmoprof event was held for the first time in Mumbai. What was the outcome? David Bondi - And this first edition of Cosmoprof India was a real success, with all the credit going to the teams of Bologna Fiere and to the former UBM Group. Designed as a preview of a larger-scale launch next year, this two-day event hosted 107 exhibiting companies - Indian and international - from 15 countries and was visited by 3,898 professionals from the beauty sector, including importers, exporters, distributors and owners of beauty salons and spas, retailers, manufacturers of packaging and finished products, contract manufacturers and equipment manufacturers. Premium Beauty News - What are your other projects for the future? David Bondi - Of course, we have other projects in the pipeline! And not just in Asia."
Trend: Makeup takes hold of the notion of freedom,"Premium Beauty News - What does the American market tell about this tendency to express our desire for freedom with makeup? Leïla Rochet - This market evolves very fast, driven by the emergence of microniches and indie brands that change the game rules. In the currently pretty tense American society, makeup has never been such a significant source of self-expression, enhanced self-confidence, and empowerment. But it is also a source of asserted freedom through social media, brand positioning, and the product types created. Premium Beauty News - What best illustrates this movement? Leïla Rochet - In our Freedom Beauty report [1], we closely examine six trends related to colours or emotions, for example. One of them, in particular, entitled World's Changers, evokes the brands that really take a stand for or against a change, in tune with consumer involvement. Today, there is an air of freedom on social media, and a few brands have been positioning themselves as real spokespersons for a societal or political choice. We can mention lipsticks, like F*ck Donald Trump, by Lipslut: 50% of its profits are donated to organizations that fight against the current politics. The Lipstick Lobby brand is another example: when they launched their new Fire shade, they staged school shooting survivors in their communications to join the gun control movement. There is a movement that aims to reclaim the African-American culture, with the rise of black empowerment and brands praising a more inclusive representation of femininity. Premium Beauty News - What is the most striking observation you have made? Leïla Rochet - The ""Small is the New Big"" notion, which is visible on different levels. In terms of retail, online sales are still behind sales in physical stores in market share, yet they do drive the market's growth. As for brands, indie (niche) brands are those that best stimulate the market. The same goes for small segments, like primers, glosses, or applicators, which used to be considered secondary and are now key players in this growth. Lastly, the American market is driven by the need to go for diversity, even inclusiveness, as can be seen with the multiplication of shades reflecting the existing diversity. Some brands now offer 50 shades, or even 60, like MAC Cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - How does makeup grow in the US? Leïla Rochet - During the second quarter 2018, the prestige beauty growth rate reached more than 6%, according to NPD, boosted by the +12% growth, while makeup remained stable. This growth reversal shows the market is turning towards more naturalness, and that grooming follows the notion of ""skin deep"" rather than ""skin surface"". The Instagrammer phenomenon in makeup is now reproducing in skincare. It is driven by the wellness movement, which is particularly strong in the US and involves a holistic, rather than superficial vision of beauty. Premium Beauty News - What would be your conclusion for brands? Leïla Rochet - This study shows that consumers try to express a certain freedom through makeup, whether it be related to naturalness, self-expression, or societal choices. It is now important for brands to become partners of this new momentum, by offering products in tune with the search for freedom of expression."
Asia Pacific leads the way in relaxation-focused beauty products,"Beauty buffs in the Asia Pacific region are countering their fast-paced lives with personal care products aimed at reducing stress. According to new research from market intelligence agency Mintel, Asia Pacific accounted for a third (33%) of global beauty and personal care products, launched between January-September 2018, that claim to aid with de-stressing and relaxation [1]. The figure is a significant increase from 2015, when the region was responsible for 26 percent of new global launches. [2] ""The rapid urbanisation and increased speed of life in Asia have left consumers feeling tired and emotionally drained,"" said Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel, speaking at the recent in-cosmetics Asia event, which was held on October 30-31 and November 01, 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand. ""For Asian female consumers, in particular, it is becoming common knowledge that daily lifestyle habits can have an impact on skin. Increasingly, beauty brands and companies are taking notice and are introducing beauty and personal care products that aid in emotional wellbeing. In the years ahead, beauty brands and companies in the region will stand to benefit from launching innovative products that address consumers' mental wellness."" The research found that 30 percent of urban Chinese consumers aged 20-49 are concerned about stress at work in 2018 — up from 25 percent in 2013. Additionally, some 60 percent of urban Indonesians and 5 percent of urban Thais plan to reduce their stress levels for personal health and wellness reasons. A huge 87 percent of urban Chinese females aged 20-49 said that using beauty services was a way of relaxing — paving the way for a booming wellness industry."
Cosmoprof Asia is set to mark new record numbers in Hong Kong,"With around 3,000 exhibitors covering a total exhibition area of up to 113,800 sqm and more than 83,700 expected visitors, the 2018 edition of the show is set to mark new record numbers. This year again, the show will be held on two venues, with a one-day lag in the opening of the two sessions. From 13 to 15 November, Cosmopack Asia at the AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE) will host exhibitors from the supply chain: raw materials and ingredients, machinery and automation, primary and secondary packaging, contract manufacturing and private labels. From 14 to 16 November, Cosmoprof Asia will put the spotlight on finished goods at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) showcasing products across all main cosmetic sectors: perfumery and cosmetics, beauty salon and spa, hair, nail and accessories. New this year, Cosmoprof Asia 2018 will dedicate an entire hall to natural and organic beauty products. Green and eco-friendly companies creating sustainable businesses around natural and organic skincare, cosmetics, beauty products and supplements, will be at the centre of attention in the Natural & Organic zone (Hall 3G, HKCEC). The selection includes brands such as Lovekins, Éminence Organic Skin Care, Pestle & Mortar, Essentiq, Alkemie, Snow White, EPS White PA, Real Saboaria. Created in partnership with international trend agency Beautystreams, the Cosmoprof Asia And Cosmopack Asia Awards will recognise the most outstanding beauty products in each exhibition venue. This year, 529 submissions from 274 companies were received, marking a record-breaking edition: – The Cosmopack Asia Awards celebrates innovation, creativity and design for the supply chain according to 5 categories: Make-Up Formula, Make-Up Packaging Technology and Design, Skincare Formula, Skincare Packaging Technology and Design, Green Packaging and Formula. Winners will be selected by a jury consisting of international experts and key players in the cosmetic industry [1]. – The Cosmoprof Asia Awards recognises the best strategies to build brand awareness and marketability according to 5 categories: Make-up Product, Skincare Product, Nail Product, Hair Product, Natural & Organic.

Genderless trend clashes with Brazilian preference for men's fragrances,"Born out of cultural changes, genderless products targeting both male and female customers are a hot trend in the cosmetics industry. However, unisex products still do not meet the expectations of Brazilian consumers when it comes to fragrances. A recent survey conducted by Mintel revealed three out of four (76%) Brazilian men say they wear gender-specific fragrances. Similarly, 71% of men say they wear gender-specific deodorant, while 31% buy unisex deodorant. Yet the landscape is demonstrably different in personal care categories, including shampoo and conditioner. Mintel's survey reveals that 58% of men use gender-neutral shampoo and conditioner, while 56% buy unisex soap or body wash. A possible explanation for such disparate consumer buying behavior is that the scents used in shampoos and conditioners are less assertive than those used in fragrances, says Juliana Martins, senior Beauty and Personal Care analyst at Mintel. Additionally, men are generally more likely to use gender-specific products. ""Several different surveys show that men are more likely to use gender-specific products than women. Men's fragrances may appeal to some women, but women's fragrances do not appeal to most men,"" she says. A 2017 Mintel study revealed that 52% of men prefer fragrances with woody notes. Fragrances with fresh notes placed second, with 37%. Renata Abelin, marketing director at Drom Fragrances, says consumers are directed towards gender-specific fragrances at the point of sale. ""They find products in a labeled, predetermined universe. Brazilian men still subscribe to the notion that fougère and/or woody notes are masculine, whereas floral and gourmand tones are seen as feminine,"" she says. Gender categorization is likewise observed in the market for personal care products. However, the difference here is that they are usually purchased with the whole family in mind. ""That is why their notes and scents usually highlight the products' ingredients and benefits,"" says Abelin. Nevertheless, the Brazilian market still has plenty of untapped potential. Martins says one way companies could explore this potential is by creating deodorants that target men and women alike, thus adding value to their brands and winning over consumers who already see them as unisex products. In this case, it would be useful to highlight the use of gender-neutral ingredients, such as charcoal, when marketing these products. On the other hand, companies that wish to continue to produce deodorants that target men could boost their portfolio by adding on to their current product lines. Martins provides the example of a line of shampoo and soap for men that can also add a deodorant, all with the same scent. To get men interested in genderless fragrances, she says companies should develop products with ""masculine"" notes and create marketing campaigns that highlight this feature, since it seems to be extremely important to men. ""Companies could try different angles, such as fragrances that can be shared with one's partner (regardless of their gender), or even fragrances with more neutral tones,"" she says. Martins believes that, in the short term, genderless fragrances will continue to be a niche market in Brazil, appealing only to a small number of individuals. This is the case with the fine fragrances category, says Abelin, where there is still a clear distinction between ""feminine"" and ""masculine"" notes. However, she also stresses that genderless fragrances are poised to receive a boost from two fronts: generation Z individuals, who tend to reject labels of any kind, and niche fragrances, which explore olfactory creations per se. A transition to a predominantly genderless fragrance market is likely to happen only in the long term, if at all. ""In Brazil, where over 90% of fragrances are sold in the mass market, behavioral changes take a long time,"" concludes Abelin."
"USA: For their hair, Black women embrace the natural beauty trend","Black women in the U.S. are increasingly opting for chemical-free with no-heat hair styling (40%) and for natural (no chemicals) with heat styling (33%). With the majority (87%) of Black women agreeing that health is the ultimate beauty accessory, more and more consumers today are just as concerned with what's not in their beauty and personal care products as what is included. In fact, 70% of Black women say they prefer to read ingredient labels in haircare products so they can avoid certain chemicals. Increased consumer interest in avoiding damage to their hair has resulted in damaging effects to the category. In fact, total haircare expenditure among Black consumers overall is estimated to reach $2.51 billion in 2018 in the U.S., a -2.3% decrease since 2016, as a result of at-home relaxer sales declining 22.7% over the same period. However, shampoo and conditioner are soaking up sales as Black women prefer caring for and styling their natural hair on their own. As such, spending on shampoo has grown 12.2% in the last two years, while conditioner has grown 7.3%. Actually, the penetration rate of hair care products is much higher among Black women than among any other demographic in the U.S. With regimens and maintenance systems for nearly every hair type and concern, Black women are most likely to say they use five or more haircare products at home (43%). Today, a wide collection of haircare products with specific benefits is commonplace, especially among younger Black women, as those aged 18-34 are the most likely to say they use haircare products such as deep conditioning treatments (59% of 18-24-year-old Black women vs 37% of Black women overall) and edge control (58% vs 26% overall). However, Mintel research indicates women are eager to streamline and personalize their routines with multifunctional options. Looking ahead, the option Black women are most interested in is haircare products for multiple uses (57%). ""Black consumers are more interested in product innovation that addresses their concerns rather than new haircare methods,"" said Toya Mitchell, Multicultural Analyst at Mintel. When it comes to purchasing new products, online shopping is on the rise. Beyond learning about styles, it seems social media is where Black consumers are doing their shopping as well. One third (32%) of Black consumers purchase haircare products online, including one quarter (24%) who shop for haircare products via online-only retailers - a nine percentage point increase over those who did so in 2016. Black consumers are looking for products formulated specifically for their needs and they are more likely to find them online. While mainstream retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Target have expanded their product selection, smaller brands are often offered as online-only exclusives."
Asia and younger generations drive travel retail trends,"Global duty-free and travel retail sales will reach USD 120 billion in 2025, according to a report conducted by research group Generation Research and the European Travel Retail Confederation (ETRC), the industry association for the duty-free and travel retail industry. Perfume and cosmetics is scoring more and more space in airports worldwide, and continues to be an important category in terms of both growth and profit contribution, notes René Weber, Managing Director and Analyst Luxury Goods / Food & Beverage at Zurich-headquartered investment bank Vontobel. For Dufry, for example, the world's leading travel retail company (with 13% market share in the overall market and 20% in airport travel retail), perfume and cosmetics currently represents the highest market share, and has risen from 27.1% in 2012, to 30.7% in 2017. This growth is set to continue, says Weber. According to the ACI World Airport Traffic Forecast for the 2017 – 2024 period, Asia Pacific will continue to host the lion's share of global growth with 52%, ahead of Europe (16 %), North America (11%), the Middle East (11%), Latin American Caribbean (10%) and Africa (2%). ""The Asian market will continue to outperform other markets, and increase its number of passengers for the coming years,"" agrees Vontobel's Weber, adding that the region has experienced double-digit or high single-digit growth every year for the last few years. This could lead to more consolidation in Asia in the near future, predicts the analyst. Along with France and the U.S., China will be one of the main beneficiaries of international arrivals, according to the Euromonitor data. We will also start to see retailers move away from Western European brands, toward Korean brands, in a bid to woo Chinese travellers, Notes Vontobel's Weber. ""Young and urban consumers are seeking out new travel experiences, driving travel and tourism trends along with more targeted services and products than ever,"" notes Nadejda Popova travel industry manager at Euromonitor International. Retailers are also striving to become ""more consumer-oriented,"" observes Weber. ""They will try to understand what kind of consumers are coming in... and when a plane for China is landing, they will try to do all of the advertisements in Chinese."" This move toward a more personalized travel retail experience is pushing retailers in this area to invest in digital marketing strategies in order to connect with their target consumer groups. By 2023, travel intermediaries are forecast to exceed USD2 trillion stimulated by digital advances and the shift to mobile sales representing 70% of travel agents' sales in 2017, according to the Euromonitor data. More and more travellers are doing the whole journey digitally, from researching the trip and checking, browsing and, ultimately, purchasing products, says the group. Unsurprisingly, for these ultra-connected consumers, the airport traditional billboards are no longer cutting it, explains Vontobel's Weber. ""Retailers will need screens which can change every five or ten minutes, in order to attract consumers coming in, and bringing them to the right spots."" ""The sharing economy and digitalization are bringing new business models with consumers becoming more sophisticated and demanding,"" adds Euromonitor's Popova. ""Providing a seamless travel experience is critical for competitive advantage, from the inspiration stage, through search and booking to in-destination services. Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data and cloud computing all help power the drive for personalized and frictionless travel experiences,"" she concludes."
Show review: Pitti Fragranze unveils trends in contemporary fragrance,"La Città delle Fragranze (The City of Fragrances), a calendar of exhibitor-organized events, was new for this edition, and saw the city's museums, gardens, concept stores and boutiques open their doors to fragrance enthusiasts from all over the world, with the goal of increasing awareness of olfactory culture. ""The calendar of events related to olfactory culture, which is increasingly rich and multi-faceted, turns Pitti Fragranze into an observatory on the most topical trends in the world of essences,"" commented Agostino Poletto, General Manager of Pitti Immagine. One such event was the talk, ""Olfactory Culture: A Contemporary Overlook through Insiders' Eyes"". Chaired by Premium Beauty News, the talk welcomed speakers Saskia Wilson-Brown (The Institute for Art and Olfaction), Roberto Drago (PerFumum) and Dominique Brunel (Nez - the Olfactory Magazine). Another highlight was an economic study analysing the market in Italy and Europe. A new initiative, this study was conducted by consulting and economic analysis firm HermesLab, in collaboration with the Centro ModaCult of the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Milano. The first results show that in a context of rapid growth, independent fragrance businesses are called upon to face the difficult challenge of exceeding the boundaries of a niche market. The exhibiting brands on show seemed to share a common desire to explore the relationship between contemporary fragrance, art, music and fashion. In the Spring space (an area dedicated to newcomers), Polish brand Bohoboco Perfume exhibited at the Pitti Fragranze for the first time. Founded in 2016, Bohoboco Perfume is the fragrance arm of its namesake fashion brand, and both are created by designers and Michael Gilbert Lach and Kamil Owczarek. Bohoboco Perfume currently has eight scents, which are all said to be inspired by culinary art and emotions. The composition process plays with contrasts, purposefully using opposing notes such as sea salt and caramel. Italian independent brand Meo Fusciuni aims to create fragrances based on memories. The brand's latest scent, Little Song, blends notes of coffee, Turkish rose and tobacco and is designed to evoke a man's solitude. According to the brand, fragrances must be ""a means to identify an artistic expression."" Pitti Fragranze also showcases some indie brands from the skincare sector. Flying the flag for men's skin care was the Rotterdam-based brand The Grey Men's Skincare. Its founder, professional menswear and lifestyle buyer Gregor Jaspers, created the brand having spotted a gap in the market for a compact men's skincare range with a clean and contemporary aesthetic. It currently has six products which use trendy ingredients such as caffeine and charcoal powder. Day, night and eye care products are combined into one, targeting those who like to travel light."
"""Demand surges for natural cosmetics and for those that are made in Australia"", Cory Watson, Beauty Expo Australia","Premium Beauty News - What are the main features of the Australian beauty market? Cory Watson - Industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized 0.8% over the five years through 2018-19, to $6.5 billion. This includes an expected revenue growth of 0.2% in the current year. The growth is expected to accelerate over the next years and industry revenue is forecast to grow at an annualized 2.6% over the five years through 2023-24, to $7.4 billion. We get about 7,000 beauty industry professionals visiting Beauty Expo Australia each year (over two days). It's a trade-only event, which is important so that our visitors and exhibitors have an environment that's conducive to business. Premium Beauty News - What about Beauty Expo Australia? Cory Watson - The show has grown exponentially! We've experienced a 45 per cent increase in the number of exhibitors at Beauty Expo Australia to reach 260 exhibitors this year, which is exciting. We had a strong year in 2017 too, with a 37 per cent increase in exhibitors from 2016, which suggests our industry continues to thrive. Premium Beauty News - What are the brands that you see emerging and booming? Cory Watson - We have seen a real upturn in the skincare and anti-ageing sectors in recent years. For instance, at Beauty Expo Australia 2017, we had a huge 60 per cent increase in skincare exhibitors from the previous year, which I think is illustrative of how big that area of the beauty industry is growing year-on-year. In terms of brands, we're very excited to have MAC Cosmetics on board for the first time at Beauty Expo Australia this year. Australia skincare brand Ultraceuticals, and technology distributors France Medical and The Global Beauty Group continue to take larger stands at Beauty Expo each year. There's also Lük Beautifood, which is a natural lipstick company founded by food scientist Cindy Lüken, who is joining us at Beauty Expo Australia after exhibiting at Beauty Expo Melbourne 2018 and also the recent Indie Beauty Expo (IBE) in New York. Premium Beauty News - Do you plan to expand to other shows? Cory Watson - We run four events within the Hair & Beauty portfolio at Reed Exhibitions Australia, including Beauty Melbourne, a boutique annual event for the local professional industry that takes place in March; Hair Expo Australia, our three-day event for the hairdressing industry which takes place each June; the Hair Expo Awards, which has been running for over 30 years; and Beauty Expo Australia, which is our national beauty event that takes place annually in Sydney. We get a fair number of visitors travelling interstate, particularly for Hair Expo and Beauty Expo Australia so at this stage there are no plans to expand - but never say never! Premium Beauty News - What are the trends that you have seen growing? Cory Watson - We've seen a shift toward embracing natural and organic products, as well as those that are Australian-made or produced by home-grown companies. This seems to be reflective of a growing consumer preference for products containing natural ingredients, as well as those that are made here in Australia. To address this, we introduced a new initiative at Beauty Expo Australia to offer relevant exhibitors the opportunity to highlight that their products or brands were either ""Proudly Natural"" or ""Proudly Australian"" on their stands. Our exhibitors loved that there was a visual signifier of their alignment with these values, and it made seeking out natural and locally-made products a really gratifying experience for our visitors at the event. We've now implemented this initiative at all our hair and beauty industry events. Premium Beauty News - Could you tell us about the evolution of the different categories in Australia? Cory Watson - Sun care is very important to the Australian market given the strength of the sun here and the associated risk of skin damage. The overall tanning services market has declined, in part due to regulatory changes banning the commercial use of solarium tanning beds. However, the spray tanning services sector has increased in demand over the past five years as consumers seek alternatives for their tanning needs. We are seeing an increase in both makeup and skincare companies that are emphasising natural and/or organic ingredients in their products, as the clean beauty movement continues to gain traction. In saying that, there's also a lot of growth in the anti-ageing sector, as more consumers seek products and technologies that promise a more youthful appearance (which is also mirrored in the proliferation of injectables and other cosmeceuticals). Premium Beauty News - And what are the most successful distribution circuits in Australia for beauty in general? Cory Watson - As we focus on professional distributors, I wouldn't be able to confidently assess the success of distribution circuits for beauty and cosmetics generally. From what I've noticed personally, I would say that the prominence of premium beauty retailers like Mecca and Sephora is growing as more stores open across Australia. Pharmacy chains like Priceline and Chemist Warehouse also provide a vast range of cosmetics for consumers in Australia. And other outlets like Lush, The Body Shop and L'Occitane are also key players in the market. In the professional sphere, some of our exhibitors have marked themselves as very successful distributors for the beauty industry. Professional Beauty Solutions (PBS), for instance, has a portfolio of 12 brands covering everything from LED masks to beauty supplements, to premium skincare products and makeup. MakeupNet is another successful wholesale distributor in Australia selling some of the popular indie makeup brands like Lime Crime and Gerard Cosmetics. Beauty Expo Australia will return in 2019 for another weekend dedicated to everything beauty from 24-25 August at the ICC Sydney. Victorian beauty professionals can look forward to the next state's dedicated boutique event, Beauty Melbourne, which will take place at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC) from 23-24 March 2019. www.beautyexpoaustralia.com.au"
Bold and glowing filtered looks top makeup trends in the US,"While the natural look is a go-to for the majority of women across the US, as current social media trends are influencing women to try their hand at bold makeup looks. According to Mintel, a strong percentage of women who use color cosmetics have tried or are interested in trying more adventurous makeup looks, including a smokey eye (69%), bold lip (55%), winged eyeliner (48%) and strobing (45%). With more than two in five (44%) US women aged 18-34 visiting four or more social media sites every day, the way consumers learn about and master new makeup trends has changed. ""In fact, a trendy one in five (22%) female color cosmetics users agree that social media helps them learn about beauty trends, increasing to nearly half (47%) of those aged 18-24,"" said Mintel. What's more, nearly one quarter (24%) of female color cosmetics users say they watch online video tutorials on YouTube to learn about makeup looks, including the majority (53%) of women aged 18-24. ""Social media influencers and video tutorials are inspiring American women to go for two contradictory makeup looks. While the natural look continues to reign supreme, many women are interested in trying out bold and adventurous makeup looks, such as winged eyeliner and strobing, as a result of what they're seeing online,"" said Alison Gaither, Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. In this context, brands that will develop accessory tools to simplify makeup application will help women to achieve the coveted looks. ""For example, recent eyeliner launches have included tools that claim to make eyeliner application faster and less intimidating and we predict that going forward, other color cosmetics segments will follow suit,"" added Gaither. With HD cameras showing every possible flaw, the obsession with poreless, lineless, glowing skin is leading some consumers to seek out products that imitate the filters they see and use on social media. Young women in particular are driving usage of products that are essential to the 'flawless face' makeup look, including highlighter / illuminator (51% women aged 18-24 vs 23% women overall), which adds a healthy glow to skin, and primer (49% vs 25% overall), which creates a smooth surface for makeup. According to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD), new launches of face makeup in the US with the word 'glow' in the product name grew 115% from 2013-17. ""We predict that highlighters, illuminators and any product that promotes radiance will continue to grow in popularity. There are opportunities to develop color cosmetics products that incorporate skincare ingredients into formulations to give the wearer a long-lasting, glowing complexion and mimic the desired effects of glowing, poreless filters beloved by consumers,"" continued Gaither. While brands are making a conscious effort to introduce more inclusive products, many women of color are still struggling to find their shade. In fact, although 79% of Black women who use facial makeup say that finding a face makeup product that matches their skin tone is an important purchase influencer, nearly three in 10 (29%) struggle to find a shade that matches their skin tone. ""As consumers continue to demand products that promote inclusivity, brands that offer expanded shade ranges and colors are finding more success among women of color. This has ultimately helped brands see their efforts equate to sales success as they encourage product trial among consumers who are typically less likely to use face makeup products due to a lack of inclusivity. Brands that promote a message of inclusivity illustrate how the industry is beginning to recognize and develop new products and shades specifically formulated for multicultural consumers,"" concluded Gaither."
"""Online or offline, every channel has its own place"", William Koeberlé, President of FFPS","For 92% of the people surveyed, stores remain their favourite shopping place for makeup, perfume, body and skincare alike. Among them, 43% of respondents praise the advice, services, and animations they are offered at points of sale, compared to 34% in 2016, when the previous study was conducted. In the same proportions, 44% enjoy the sensorial experience provided: you can see, smell, touch, and test products. ""Compared to the 2016 study, this need to see the products is increasing. It was pointed out by 62% of customers two years ago, compared to 71% today. That is almost 10 points more,"" comments William Koeberlé, President of FFPS. ""Interestingly, it is for the people under 35 that the figure rises the most. They clearly express a renewal of this need,"" he adds. This growing appetite for contact and non-virtual interactions is actually shared by all generations - even the most connected. Thus, 68% of the under 35 say they prefer to visit stores to see the products and actually make a purchase, compared to 61% for the people over 35. Besides, 49% of them appreciate the fact that they can test products and get some tips. At the same time, the practical advantages of online shopping make it competitive. ""Sales are gradually rising online. They represent 8% of total sales, compared to 6% two years ago,"" highlights William Koeberlé. Among web enthusiasts, 47% of the people surveyed, i.e. 8% more than in 2016, praise the convenience of this medium, which makes it possible to do your shopping anytime. In addition, 60% of respondents use the Internet channel for the interesting prices it offers. For 49% of them, it also helps compare prices, in particular when they need to buy products they already have. ""People get informed about prices on the web. So, if a network has no website, they will not be able to make customers come visit their stores,"" analyzes William Koeberlé. Lastly, the Click & Collect system, which combines online shopping and in-store collection, seduces 31% of the people surveyed. ""It is an important point that is clearly related to the boom of mobile phones,"" explains the President of the Federation. ""In 2016, we could have thought these channels competed against each other. Today, this study shows that every channel has its own place, and, more importantly, that they complete each other. Customers search for information online, but they favour the store experience, because they think their needs will be better understood at points of sale,"" he concludes."
Italy: A vigorous cosmetics industry,"While the Italian cosmetics market ranks fourth in Europe after Germany, France and the United Kingdom, the country is the third European exporter (after France and Germany). Make-up is undoubtedly the main asset of the Italian cosmetics industry. ""About 60% of the make-up distributed throughout the world is produced in Italy,"" claims Cosmetica Italia, the trade association representing the peninsula's beauty industry. However, alcoholic perfumery represents an even larger share of Italian exports, in value, while hair products are the third leading category of the Italian cosmetics industry. In 2017, for the eighth consecutive year, exports recorded a substantial increase, exceeding 4.6 billion euros, increasing by 7.1% compared to 2016. According to estimates by Cosmetica Italia, the overall growth of the sector should be 4.5% in 2018, allowing the industry to achieve a global turnover of 11.5 billion euros. Exports should continue to play a key role as export sales are expected to grow by 8% to reach about 5 billion euros. The figures are all the more remarkable as the internal market remains fragile with a growth forecast of 1.9% in 2018. ""Thanks to the quality and efficacy of its offer, the Italian cosmetics industry responds with competitiveness to a domestic and international scenario that is dramatically changing, as regard as the consumer demand and the retail structure,"" said Renato Ancorotti, president of Cosmetica Italia. ""The companies in the sector confirm their capacity to invest in research and innovation, key factors of success in the markets,"" he concluded."
What happened this summer?,"The relatively slow progression of the European cosmetics market encourages brands to find new sources of growth around the world. However, under the presidency of Donald Trump, the United States are apparently determined to give up their traditional role of global growth driver, at least if they do not get economic counterparts from it. Several categories of cosmetics are already impacted by the trade war launched against China and the European Union. This summer, politic and commercial tensions have spread to Turkey, which has imposed 60% customs duties on cosmetics originating from the USA. Despite this tense climate, many market segments remain very dynamic. Taking advantage of the increasing porosity between the two categories, several makeup brands are making forays into the dynamic skin care market. Driven by the growing diversity of beauty markets, foundation was the star category of the summer. In general, Asia continues to offer a steady pace of growth. The boom of the men's beauty market in Korea and China prompted Chanel to launch its very first make-up line dedicated to male consumers. In China, L'Oréal and A.S. Watson are joining forces to roll-out a concept store dedicated to make-up. In parallel, Switzerland's Mibelle announced its entry into the South Korean market with the purchase of dermocosmetics brand Dr. G. It remains to be seen which area would be likely to take over from Asia? With its young and growing population, Africa seems ideal, despite a still massive poverty and poorly regulated markets. As far as trends are concerned, let's note the respective attempts from H&M and Shiseido to transform market codes of the perfumery and makeup markets, respectively. On the acquisitions front, L'Oréal has acquired the German organic beauty brand Logona and the La Roche Posay thermal station in France, while Beiersdorf tapped into the skin microbiome trend through an investment in S-Biomedic. On the supplier side, Arcade Beauty purchased the fragrance business of K Fragrance, while Amcor and Bemis announced their merger. Also noteworthy is the strategic partnership between Givaudan and the Indian company Synthite. Eventually, with regard to brands, let's mention the partnership between L'Oréal and Facebook to develop the virtual make-up tests, or the opening of a L'Occitane en Provence experiential boutique on New York's 5th Avenue."
Is Africa the next Asia?,"In a recent report, Euromonitor International found that Africa will be home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies in the coming years. [1] According to the market research firm: ""Africa's two largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, account for nearly 50% of the continent's GDP in 2017. However, by 2030 these two countries will represent just 37% of Africa's total GDP, demonstrating the rising economic importance of Africa's emerging markets."" In the years to come, the continent's consumer spending will grow faster than the global average. However, this does not mean that all problems will suddenly disappear in the continent: poverty will not be eradicated and consumption levels will remain well below the global average. Data from the World Bank show that Africa's middle class is growing everywhere in the continent. It already represents 26M of the population in Ivory Coast, but only 1% in Ethiopia. ""Given the continent's large population and strongly increasing GDP, Africa is set to be the most dynamic region for various industries, which include packaged food, consumer electronics, and beauty and personal care,"" says Euromonitor. As shown by Jean-Paul Dechesne, Worldwide Director Regulatory Affairs at Colgate Palmolive, during Cosmetics Europe's annual conference, held on June 13 and 14, 2018 in Brussels, the rise in the cosmetics consumption has prompted many African states to adopt regulations aiming at controlling these products, or to consider doing so. While big global beauty brands such as L'Oréal, Unilever, PZ Cussons, Beiersdorf and Procter & Gamble have led the way across the continent, expanding from the two most important African economies (South Africa and Nigeria) to other promising markets such as Kenya, Tanzania, Ivory Coast and Ghana, other international brands are now making significant inroads too."
Skin bleaching in Africa: An 'addiction' with risks,"""It's a mindset that has eaten into society. For a lot of people, it's the path to getting a good job, having a relationship,"" said Dr. Isima Sobande, a 27-year-old Nigerian physician who was immediately confronted with the health problems linked to these practices when she started working at a health centre in Lagos. For many Nigerians, it is a ""standard procedure,"" a gateway to beauty and success, she said. Skin lightening is popular in many parts of the world, including South Asia and the Middle East. But medical experts say that in Africa - a continent where regulations are often lax or scorned - the widening phenomenon is laden with health risks. Cultural watchdogs, for their part, see it as the toxic legacy of colonialism. Where statistics about Africa's skin-bleaching industry exist, they are often old or unreliable. But evidence from the range of products, suppliers and services points to a continent-wide market that may number tens of millions of people and possibly more. Africa is experiencing a ""massive trend of increased use (of skin bleaching), particularly in teenagers and young adults,"" said Lester Davids, a physiology professor at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. ""The older generation used creams - the new generation uses pills and injectables. The horror is that we do not know what these things do in high concentrations over time in the body."" In Nigeria alone, 77 per cent of women - by extrapolation, more than 60 million people - are using lightening products on a ""regular basis"", the World Health Organization (WHO) said in 2011. A market of high interest for major cosmetic and beauty brands. ""More clients want insight on the lightening market,"" said Rubab Abdoolla, a beauty analyst at market researchers Euromonitor International. The rich tend to opt for pricier registered products which are available in standard doses. Others are likely to buy creams, often bootleg concoctions mixed in the back streets, that may be dangerous and are blatantly sold in defiance of official bans or constraints. Ingredients may include hydroquinone, steroids, mercury and lead - the same element that, at high doses, poisoned Elizabethan courtiers who powdered their faces ivory white. In spite of the risks, authorities are struggling to control the market. They have difficulties with the latest bleaching innovations, which include a compound called glutathione, taken as injections or pills. Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya have all banned skin bleaching products with high amounts of hydroquinone and mercury, with the province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa urging people to ""reject all colonial notions of beauty"". In July, Ghana's Food and Drugs Authority issued a statement telling pregnant women not to take glutathione pills to bleach their unborn babies saying that there may be ""serious toxic side effects"" such as ""asthma, renal failure and chest pains."" The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stresses that it has not given approval for any of the injections on the market today. ""These products are potentially unsafe and ineffective, and might contain unknown harmful ingredients or contaminants."" In Africa, however, products remain easily available to most consumers through local markets, the web or specialised clinics. Those who start using skin lightening say they invariably stay with the practice. ""Before you know it, it has become some sort of an addiction where you want to maintain that look,"" said Dabota Lawson, a Lagos socialite and cosmetics entrepreneur. ""Just like with plastic surgery, it begins to feel like it's never enough."" Instagram skincare star Pela Okiemute's Russian White body cream claims to give ""firmness, intense beauty and a mixed race complexion"". His Cleopatra Royal cream, whose label features Elizabeth Taylor in her famous role as the Egyptian queen, promises to ""lighten and radiate"" skin's tone within two weeks. Okiemute says his creams, which include collagen, kojic acid and ""anti-ageing"" snail slime are safe, though he declined to divulge his formula. ""We have a lot of customers who have used a lot of wrong products, they come to us and we give solutions,"" he adds. Intravenous injections and pills of glutathione — an antioxidant naturally found in the body that has a lightening side effect — are the new frontiers of skin bleaching. At his clinic on the outskirts of Lagos, beside an abandoned Chinese restaurant, plastic surgeon Aranmolate Ayobami charges clients 150,000 naira ($415, 350 euros) for a five-week course of glutathione injections. Known as the ""Buttmaster"" for helping patients seeking an hourglass figure, Ayobami buys the injections from companies he trusts in the United Arab Emirates or the United States. He only gives certain dosages for a limited amount of time, he said. But sometimes clients will bring in their own cheaper product that they bought online and urge him to inject them. ""We try to discourage that,"" he said. If many millions of Africans lighten their skin without regret, others are dismayed. ""Skin bleaching is one manifestation of folks trying to get power and privilege aligned with whiteness,"" said Yaba Blay, a researcher at North Carolina Central University. ""We're seeing folks attempt to be perceived as having more value because of their complexion."" Beyond the influent of colonialism, having a whiter skin tone also means having a job not exposed to sun light and of higher social status. Recent black movements are trying to challenge that perception. #Melaninpoppin, a hashtag celebrating black skin, and the smash-hit movie ""Black Panther,"" which featured an almost all-black cast wearing African-inspired outfits and natural hair, are held up as testaments to a shift away from longstanding Eurocentric standards of beauty. But whether the tide of opinion is turning in Africa itself is another question. ""The truth for me was that my beauty was more accepted abroad than at home,"" said Ajuma Nasenyana, a model from northern Kenya, who has walked for Victoria's Secret and Vivienne Westwood. ""In the African industry the lighter your skin tone the more beautiful you are. Hopefully the industry is changing and starting to appreciate darker skin."" Sobande, the doctor, said, ""We're living in a more positive environment than a few years before. But it's going to take a lot of effort to change the mindset."""
British beauty buffs are driving a booming skincare industry in the UK,"A report from market research company Mintel has found that British women spent a whopping £1.15 billion (approximately US$ 1.46 billion) on facial skincare in 2017, a figure that is expected to climb to £1.18 billion for 2018. By 2023, Mintel expects the industry to increase by 15 percent to reach a value of £1.36 billion (approximately US$ 1.73 billion or EUR 1.52 billion). Cleansing appears to be one of the main product categories driving the growth. About 92 percent of British women currently use facial cleansers, be it face wash (55 percent) wipes (54 percent) or micellar water (27 percent). The proportion of women using day cream has also increased over the past year, rising from 59 percent in 2017 to 66 percent in 2018, with night creams also increasing in popularity, from 39 percent to 48 percent in the same timeframe. ""As beauty trends continue to be inspired by Korean facial skincare routines, which can reach as many as 10 steps, British women are adopting multiple cleansing routines and even using different cleansers for different occasions,"" said Roshida Khanom, Associate Director, Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. ""Facial wipes remain popular due to their convenience and are sometimes used instead of a facial cleanser; however, with government plans to eliminate single use products like facial cleansing wipes, the category could be affected."" However, when it comes to sun protection, the report found British beauty buffs to be less enthusiastic, with only 47 percent of the 1,008 women surveyed saying they used facial skincare products containing SPF. Some 40 percent of respondents said they were confused about appropriate levels of daily sun protection. Paradoxically, when questioned about factors that can take a toll on the complexion, 72 percent of skincare users cited sun exposure as having the biggest impact, followed by pollution (41 percent) and cold weather (39 percent). Sleep was considered the biggest internal influencer for 62 percent of participants, followed by diet (54 percent) and water consumption (46 percent). However, only 5 percent were aware of the possibility of damage caused by the blue light and HEVL (high-energy visible light) emitted by mobiles and other electronic devices. ""Exposure to heavy blue light/high energy visible light (HEVL) from electronic devices such as computers and smartphones has become a daily occurrence for many consumers. While there is currently little definitive proof that HEVL exposure can impact the appearance of skin, scientific studies as recent as this year suggest such exposure may accelerate pigmentation changes and add fine lines and wrinkles. It is clear from our research that most consumers are unaware of the damage HEVL is capable of doing to our skin. Brands have an opportunity to rewrite the traditional anti-ageing narrative, and advocate a new set of pro-health skin solutions that are driven by blue light protection,"" concludes Roshida."
Foundation is the beauty hit of summer 2018,"Vegan beauty brand Milk Makeup announced plans last month to add eight new hues to its 'Blur Foundation' series, bringing the total number of foundation shades in the range to 24. The new hues range from the very pale through to the very deep, with plenty of fair, medium and dark hues in between. The new additions are now available at milkmakeup.com and sephora.com, and will launch in-store at Sephora from August 15. Beautyblender made its first foray into the makeup industry in July, with the launch of a 32-piece foundation line titled 'Bounce'. The foundation, which is cruelty-free and formulated without the use of parabens, phthalates, sulfates, and oils, is infused with hyaluronic acid and birch extract, and has been designed to offer a ""velveteen matte finish"" and 24-hour coverage. NYX Cosmetics is also launching a brand new foundation this summer. Dubbed 'Can't Stop Won't Stop,' the 45-shade series is set to release on August 16. Developed in collaboration with the beauty influencer Alissa Ashley, it promises 24-hour coverage and comes with a precise decimal labelling system that allows shoppers to choose both the perfect shade and undertone for their complexions. Natural beauty brand Lush Cosmetics tested out a foundation release in June, when the company's Lush Labs division unveiled a 40-shade strong 'Slap Stick' foundation range for a limited time only. The Slap Sticks, which offered three different undertone hues, contained 45 percent Indonesian coconut oil to hydrate and soften the skin with every application. They also featured a peelable wax skin that meant the foundation could be applied directly to the complexion, or using a brush or fingers, thus avoiding excess packaging. After months of teasing, TooFaced finally unveiled the results of its collaboration with blogger and influencer Jackie Aina in June. The project consisted of expanding the shade range of the label's 'Born This Way' foundation, in order for it to suit a wider variety of dark skin tones. Aina created nine new shades, with an additional two new hues designed by the brand, bringing the total number of colors offered to 35."
China's new online cosmetics stars: men,"When Jiang Cheng first tried a bit of concealer during his first year of university in China it gave him self-confidence and he was instantly hooked. Now he is among hundreds of Chinese men sharing beauty tips online and cashing in on the booming male cosmetics industry. ""I found that putting on make-up is actually quite easy,"" the 24-year-old said as he gently brushed his face with some foundation. ""Women may not fully grasp the concept of male make-up. If a girl puts on my make-up, they may not be able to achieve the effect that I really want,"" Jiang said. Every weekend, Jiang spends a couple of hours in front of his iPhone at his cosy makeshift studio in Beijing trying on the latest balms and blush for hundreds of live viewers, who can simultaneously buy the products he reviews. Online beauty stars form an enormous industry in China, with internet celebrities known as ""wang hong"", or online stars, blurring the line between entertainment and e-commerce. Companies like Alibaba and JD.com have launched live-streaming platforms that allow viewers to purchase on the go while watching videos. The male beauty market is expected to grow 15.2 percent in the next five years in China compared to an 11 percent global increase over the same period, according to research firm Euromonitor. Increasingly, foreign firms like La Mer and Aesop work with video bloggers such as Lan Haoyi, known as Lan Pu Lan online, to promote their products to his nearly 1.4 million followers. The 27-year-old spends up to 10,000 yuan ($1,460) a month on beauty products and says China's ""Little Fresh Meat"" - a term referring to young good-looking men - is spearheading this trend. ""We're seeing more men in the media wearing make-up. This will naturally become the norm,"" Lan said. Beauty and masculinity criteria have thus been transformed among young Chinese men. Despite what appears to be social progress in many of the country's cosmopolitan cities, the video blogger says he still receives hate messages and criticism for appearing in smoky red eyeshadow. ""'Why would a man look like that? Why does a man need to wear make-up?' These are some of messages I get,"" Lan says. But Mo Fei, the executive director for Chetti Rouge, a Chinese cosmetics company targeting men exclusively, says that will change over time. ""There will be more and more men who take more care in how they look and the demands will increase. Men in the East are more accepting,"" Mo told AFP. He opened Chetti Rouge in 2005 with few products. Now the beauty company sells a wide variety of cosmetics ranging from foundation to lipstick solely for men and has moved the entire business online. Furthermore, the company expanded to Thailand three years ago. ""We saw potential in the market very early on,"" Mo added. ""It might be that men have accepted make-up. For men to browse products in shopping malls, may be for some men a little intimidating, hence the best way for them to buy is online, which is why our sales strategy is mainly on the internet."""
Three skincare brands making a move on the makeup industry,"Japanese skincare brand Shiseido is launching an entirely reimagined makeup line this month, putting it firmly back on the beauty map. The refresh, which will launch globally on August 15, comprises 21 new products in 125 different shades, with the series classified into 'Gels', 'Inks', 'Powders' and 'Dews'. ""We are taking an innovative approach to makeup that no other brand has ever done before,"" said Jill Scalamandre, President, bareMinerals, BUXOM and Global Development Shiseido Makeup, of the project, in a statement. Cult skincare brand GlamGlow, which is known for its glittery face masks, put its stamp on the makeup industry earlier this summer. The company unveiled its debut hybrid beauty product, a trio of highlighters dubbed 'GlowPowder', back in June. The GlowPowders will allow beauty fans to improve their complexions while adding a warm glow to their look, thanks to the addition of hyaluronic acid and golden clay, which the brand claims will ""smooth, refine, and enhance"" the skin. Although not a skincare brand, Beautyblender's sponge makeup applicators have reached cult status around the globe. This July, the company made its first foray into the makeup sector, with the launch of a 32-piece foundation line titled 'Bounce'. The brand is also reportedly cooking up new color cosmetics releases for the near future, so watch this space."
YouCam Makeup unveils the favourite lipstick colours around the world,"In honour of #NationalLipstickDay to be celebrated on July 29 in the USA, Perfect Corp., takes a closer look at global user lipstick preferences within the award-winning YouCam Makeup app [1]. Perfect Corp thus took a deep dive into the lipstick preferences of the users of YouCam MakeUp, its flagship app, to reveal the next big lipstick trends and created three exclusive styles for users to experience for themselves. The top five Pantone lip colours of the year, with classic pinks and reds holding their position at the top of the charts, are: #1 Rose Fandango #2 Carmin #3 Rose profond #4 Amarante #5 Cerise Furthermore, according to the data collected by Perfect Corp, a matte finish continues to dominate as the favourite lipstick finish across the globe making up nearly 50% of all lipstick try-ons. The exception: Japan. Japanese user data shows 50% preferred a sheer lipstick finish, as compared to only 18% choosing matte. A closer look at lipstick preferences made by users in New York City and Los Angeles revealed that east coast beauties favoured pink lip colours while west coast beauties opted for reds. Always on the occasion of #NationalLipstickDay, the virtual reality firm is also launching exclusive top trending lipstick styles to experience virtually. With over 10.8 billion global lipstick try-ons in 2017 alone - and nearly 500 million recorded in the US - lipstick remains the most tested item on the app."
USA: The prestige skincare category drives beauty industry growth,"According to recent findings from The NPD Group's 2018 Makeup In-Depth Consumer Report, nearly all U.S. women using makeup, or 90 percent, reported using makeup with skincare benefits. However, the usage of these products does not appear to be replacing or cannibalizing consumers' skincare routines. Indeed, according to the market research firm, two-thirds of women stated they use these makeup products in addition to separate skincare offering the same benefits. ""Makeup continues to perform well, as our study found that more women are using it and they are also using more products, on average, in a typical day compared to two years ago. At the same time, the consumer mindset today places greater emphasis on taking care of the skin in order to prevent flaws, rather than covering up flaws as they appear,"" said Larissa Jensen, executive director, beauty industry analyst at The NPD Group. ""Consumer expectations of makeup products have heightened as a result of skincare's influence on format and efficacy."" A continuation of the trend that began in 2017, the prestige skincare category is driving U.S. beauty industry growth so far this year. Year-to-date through May 2018, skincare sales grew by 13 percent, with segments including facial moisturizer, age specialists, and eye treatments contributing the most dollars gained. Makeup, which continues to be beauty's largest category, experienced a 1 percent increase in sales during these months, driven by concealer, mascara, and foundation. [1] ""Skincare has created a winning story around ingredients, innovation, wellness, and great skin at any age. Makeup brands and manufacturers are tearing a page from skincare's playbook by leveraging skincare positioning in their own product offerings. This is a step in the right direction, as I expect the interaction and shared learning's between these two emotional categories will prove mutually beneficial,"" concluded Jensen."
New formats and e-commerce drive sales of home fragrances in the U.S.,"""This market, especially the candles category, continues to perform well as consumers remain attracted to these products for their beautiful designs, sensory experiences, and giftable aesthetic,"" comments Dana Kreutzer, Senior Analyst in Kline's Consumer Products Practice. ""Moreover, e-commerce and technology are transforming this segment with new user experiences, where luxury brands and small start-ups alike are racing to embrace e-commerce, making this channel even stronger."" In terms of retail distribution, the market continues to see a dynamic shift among brands. Yankee Candle further penetrates the mass market throughout the year, entering Walmart's doors in the spring, and the brand's parent company, Newell Brands, opens it first ever experiential pop-up shop during the holiday season as consumers increasingly crave unique and exclusive shopping experiences. The competition among the large market players and emerging brands continues to strengthen in 2017. Newell Brands quickly becomes the market giant, adding WoodWick and Chesapeake Bay Candle brands to its home fragrance portfolio in 2017, and Bath & Body Works, one of the largest prestige brands, continues to see excellent performance. However, the smaller, luxury players are the market movers, and Voluspa, Nest, Illume, and Paddywax are among the strongest performers with double-digit gains in 2017. The direct sales channel advances at a rate of 10% in 2017, while candle sales through the channel grow above the rate. Candles remain the largest product category in 2017, contributing more than 41% to overall market sales. Driven by luxury candle marketers that record double the category growth, candles are also the fastest growing product form in the market. Several new luxury marketers enter the segment in 2017, such as Gibson & Dehn and HomeWorx by Harry Slatkin, selling its products through another popular direct-selling retailer - home shopping network - QVC. Despite new entrants and strong growth of several prestige brands, Yankee Candle remains the category's market leader. Another segment enjoying consumers' favour is the diffusers category. This category is particularly innovative with the fragrance meeting technology and new smart scent diffusers from brands like Moodo and Aera, giving consumers the ability to control and customize their home scent experiences. New formats, such as the launch of liquidless reed diffusers by Nest and Diptyque, add additional attractivity to the segment."
France: Asian-made beauty products boost prestige skincare sales,"Cushions, BB creams, fabric or rubber masks: for some years now, the K-beauty has invaded the daily beauty rituals of French women, attracting more and more followers every year. Actually, the success of Asian-made beauty products is having a positive impact on the market as sales of prestige face care beauty products have increased by 1% year-on-year on over the period between May 2017 and April 2018, announced The NPD Group on July 4th. According to the market research company, this growth can be partly attributed to the popularity of Korean-inspired beauty products (K-beauty) on the French market. Unsurprisingly, face care masks - one of the Asia's latest innovations - continue to rise in the skincare segment with sales growing by 8% between May 2017 and April 2018 compared to the same period last year. Beyond the traditional cream masks, new product proposals inspired from Asia are driving growth: fabric and paper masks and skincare patches are the best performers with a 78% increase in sales, while sales of clay or mud masks increased by 43%. As far as gel masks are concerned, sales grew by 14%, over the same périod. At the same time, sales of BB cream have decreased by 10% while those of CC creams remained flat. According to The NPD Group, these textures that sparkled the popularity of K-beauty in France, have been losing their popularity over the years. However, other innovations have taken over, including ""cushion"" foundations, with sales increasing by 13% during the period. Sales of lotions and tonics, which are key elements of the Korean beauty routine, jumped by 12% in value. ""Consumers have quickly adopted the new gestures inspired from Asia beauty routines and this is good news! The rise of K-beauty in recent years has broadened skin care routines in France and popularized new textures by diversifying product lines through masks, serums and cushions. Social networks, prestige brands and brands have also supported this trend. Beauty retailers such as Sephora and FeelUnique have recently launched a section dedicated to Korean products,"" explains Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert Europe at The NPD Group. Major Japanese brands have seized the opportunity of the Asian wave sparkled by the K-beauty to give a new impetus to their products in Europe. While Shiseido, Shu Uemura, SK-II, Sensai or Kanebo have been established in the French beauty market for a long time, brands with a wider audience - such as Uniqlo and Muji - have helped to increase the visibility of the Japanese culture. More recently, Japanese-influenced beauty trends have been buzzing on social media, particularly on Instagram, YouTube and among beauty bloggers and influencers. ""The J-beauty trend perfectly fits with new consumer expectations such as simplicity, naturalness and holistic beauty. With a focus on ingredients and long-term care rather than on more ephemeral products, the J-Beauty offers a successful mix of tradition and innovation. In the coming years, we anticipate the entry of more niche Japanese brands into the French beauty market,"" concludes Mathilde Lion. According to The NPD Group, the interest of French women in Asian beauty routines is here to stay!"
The European cosmetics market grew by 1.3% in 2017,"In 2017, the European cosmetics market was valued at 77.6 billion euros, which makes Europe remain the largest market for cosmetic and personal care products in the world. According to Cosmetics Europe, the industry supports over 2 million jobs across the European value chain. Despite the return to a more dynamic growth, the European market remained impacted by low performance of some key markets, in particular: the United Kingdom (-6.8%), The Netherlands (-1.9%) and France (-0.5%). As far as products are concerned, all categories are up from 2016, with the exception of perfumes (-0.4%) and makeup (-0.1%). Skin care and toiletries remain the most important product categories in Europe, followed by hair care and fragrances. In this context of moderate growth, international trade remains a key driver for the European industry. More than 20.2 billion euros of cosmetic products were exported by European countries in 2017 (compared to 18.2 billion in 2016). Total imports amounted to only 5.935 million euros, mainly from the United States, China and Japan (compared to 5.633 million euros in 2016). More than ever, exports appear as the real propeller of the European cosmetics industry's growth."
Show review: MakeUp in Paris 2018 embraces skincare,"The 2018 edition featured 160 exhibitors, flat compared to 2017, 45 of which were new. Visitor numbers were up 2% from last year to 4051 visitors from 57 countries. 2,796 of these visitors came from France, while 1,255 were international. This year, MakeUp in Paris teamed up with trend intelligence group Beautystreams to launch the ColorWave space, providing insight into the shades that we can expect to see influencing the colour palettes of future makeup launches. The show also played host to conferences on hot topics of the moment, such as phygital (physical and digital) retail and the makeup market in the Middle East. Shanghai-headquartered cosmetics manufacturer Thai Ho Group showed its Instagram-friendly, heart-shaped Dual Core Lipstick. The product is comprised of a colour lipstick core, encased by a transparent, glittery outer layer of lip balm. The lipstick is PH sensitive and the colour is gradually revealed after application. It also changes shade according to the skin's PH levels. The group also showed its Hot Pour Powder Eye Shadow, which has a cream-powder consistency and claims to provide highly-pigmented colour. Korea-based manufacturer World Sponge presented its playful Merry-go-round Applicator Container. The applicator rotates 360 degrees and can be manipulated like a games console controller to pick up the formula inside. Malta-based Toly was one exhibitor cashing in on the pearl makeup trend with its new Solar Stars product. Its container is filled with pearls in three different colours, all made with avocado oil. Once released, they mix to form a humid powder which is said to hydrate the skin and illuminate the complexion. American manufacturer of cosmetic brushes and accessories Anisa International, which was attending MakeUp in Paris for the first time, debuted its Heritage collection, which features the group's SQ+ fibres - a synthetic alternative to squirrel hair. It also showed its Buffing collection, comprised of brushes with a curved shape to avoid harsh and visible lines, which aims to cater to those who usually use sponges. Anisa International also presented its Emollient Wing collection, an offshoot of its Wing collection. The Emollient Wing brushes feature slightly smaller heads, designed for the effective and precise application of emollient and cream formulas. As ever, digital was a buzzword this year. For the third year in a row, the show featured the MakeUp in Digital space, which is dedicated to technology in the industry. French connected skincare company Feeligold introduced two of its revamped skincare patches, which have now been boosted with new active ingredients. Its Anti Imperfections patch, which now features cutipure and niacinamide, aims to reduce the overproduction of sebum. Its Anti Dark Spots Patch, which now includes mandelic acid, intends to reduce the size and colour of dark spots. LF Beauty, a division of Fung Group, showed its digital mirrors including its digital frame, which it operates for skincare brand Kiehls, and its My Rouge G mirror which it operates for French brand Guerlain. The My Rouge G allows users to digitally try on the brand's makeup products and offers over 450 combinations from the brand's range. The user can then take a selfie of their favorite makeup look and print it off as a polaroid. The photo can also be sent by email, as can links to shop the products in the photo. LF Beauty's mirrors collect data such as (such as age, sex, the time spent in front of the mirror per consumer and the most popular products and shades). This data can be used to adapt the brand's stock replenishment accordingly. The interactive mirror frame is currently present in eight Kiehls store in Hong Kong. The My Rouge G mirror is currently present in five doors and LF Beauty is planning to test the innovation in some twenty further stores. Keys trends at the show included brushes and applicators geared toward powder-based products, highly-pigmented colour, glitter, gel textures, pearls and playful products which change colour or texture upon application."
Is it time to ban the term 'anti-aging' from the beauty industry?,"Dubbed ""That Age Old Question,"" the report, which was carried out by Great Britain's Royal Society for Public Health in partnership with the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation [1], states that ""anti-ageing narratives"" encourage unrealistic body norms and poor body image that can have a negative effect on women. ""We have seen just how valuable a positive and optimistic outlook on ageing can be to personal health and wellbeing, and yet many everyday conversations, informed by the media, are rife with examples of language that either trivialise, vilify, or catastrophise the ageing process,"" it reads. ""Chief among these is the persistent use of the term 'anti-ageing' within the cosmetics and beauty industry."" As highlighted by The Independent, the report calls on major beauty retailers and the media to eschew the term ""anti-aging,"" emphasizing that: ""the explicit presumption that ageing is something undesirable and to be battled at every turn is as nonsensical as it is dangerous."" While the term remains highly prevalent within the beauty industry, there are signs that attitudes towards ageism are changing. Last December, actress Thandie Newton teamed up with RoC Skincare to shine the spotlight on the problem of ageism. The ""Westworld"" star fronted a social media campaign for the brand, called 'For Your Age,' that drew attention to the potentially negative language and phrasing commonly used in reference to age. Makeup brand CoverGirl also caused a stir when it flouted convention and unveiled 69-year-old model Maye Musk as an ambassador back in September, while L'Oréal Paris's October 2017 fashion week saw brand ambassador Dame Helen Mirren, 72, and Jane Fonda, 79, take to the catwalk in the French capital. Trends experts claim that today, a majority of women over 60 are more in the mood for a well ageing, slow aging or pro aging approach... In short, it is all about supporting the aging process rather than fighting the signs of aging, with skincare products supporting a 'pro-longevity', life enhancers. ""The first positive consequence of this acceptance can be seen in the rehabilitation of some signs of ageing such as bright wrinkles or silver / white hair,"" explains Pascale Brousse, founder of prospective agency Trend Sourcing. ""Women are aware that they have wrinkles and that these won't go away, and like Millennials, they do not want any more over-promises,"" she adds."
"The global cosmetics industry must address digital challenges, but the context remains promising","The strength of the market is also reflected in major global cosmetic and perfume companies' margins over the last five years. The vast majority have seen double-digit average operating margins over the 2013 to 2017 period. According to the market research firm number of factors have allowed perfume and cosmetic groups to ride out the post-crisis with relative ease and many will remain growth drivers in the years to come. Firstly, emerging markets have been behind a large part of global growth over the past few years. Despite their current slowdown, the mere size of the populations combined with growing income means these markets remain extremely valuable. Secondly, as the past has demonstrated, the cosmetic and perfume market benefits from the ""lipstick effect"", meaning that even during belt-tightening periods, consumers often choose to indulge in beauty products over other larger discretionary items, buffering the industry somewhat from economic lows. Demand is additionally spurred by innovation allowing the creation of new or reformulated products. Niche segments such as men's cosmetics, natural cosmetics, or cosmeceuticals, a combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, have particularly seen major growth and are expected to continue to surge, according to Xerfi. An ageing population in many countries with high disposable income is also pushing up demand for anti-ageing products. Last but far from least, digital has opened up new marketing and distribution channels. Indeed, digital is playing an increasingly important role in the industry. Marketing and brand image has always been a major focus of the industry and groups are increasingly recognising the power of digital this regard. ""Cosmetic and perfume groups are therefore generally shifting away from big-spend traditional media campaigns and towards smaller, but more varied and more dynamic digital or multi-channel communication. Such communication is often two-way, involving direct, or semi-direct, interaction with customers, fostering closer relationships, but also allowing data collection and, as a result, advanced behavioural segmentation and personalised promotional campaigns. However, with the ris of digital and, more particularly social media, also comes the challenge of catering to increasingly product-educated customers in a context in which other consumers' opinions and social networks are increasingly integrated into the decision process,"" explains Xerfi."
"Colour cosmetics, skincare, Japan and Southern Asia to drive global beauty sales in 2018, according to Euromonitor","According to Euromonitor International one of the main lessons to be learned from last year's global market evolution is the dynamism of the premium segment, which outpaced its mass counterpart and the overall industry in terms of growth for a third consecutive year. Skin care and colour cosmetics offer the most lucrative prospects within the premium space (7% and 9% growth in 2017, respectively). ""Benefitting from further social media appeal, desire for self-expression and technologically-enabled make-over experiences, colour cosmetics outperformed all other categories globally,"" said Euromonitor. Global sales of make-up products grew by 7% in 2017, the highest on record over the past decade. The trend is expected to continue, with the digital side of the business and the fast-fashion approach to innovation to become always more important for the category. According to Euromonitor, China will be one of the most important boosts to the premium colour cosmetics market. The premium make-up segment was up by 50% in China last year, thanks especially to lipstick products. Despite its much underdeveloped per-capita spend at present, China is set to replace Japan as the second largest colour cosmetics market after the US by 2022. After a few years of subdued results, 2017 saw a resurgence of skin care sales, growing by 6% in value, the highest increase since pre-recession years. The category's expansion is fuelled by a shift towards prevention and prioritisation of healthy skin maintenance, as well as a softer pro-age and health-aligned narrative in anti-agers, which in turn doubled their premium sales growth to an impressive 10% globally. The trend is also spurring innovation around microbiome-inspired product development, clean and pure formulations, and skin protection features (eg air or digital pollution. Total beauty sales in South Korea 2017 grew by a lacklustre 0.9%i n value. By contrast, Japan benefits from a more healthy domestic consumption, the growth in Chinese tourists, following limits imposed on travel to Korea by the Chinese government, and mounting anticipation in the run up to the Olympics in 2020. The surge in popularity for Japanese brands comes on the back of their long-standing credibility with Shiro, Decorté, Three Cosmetics, Tatcha and DHC spreading their influence beyond their home market. ""With a steady pace of strong year-on-year expansion, the markets of India and Indonesia will be among the top 10 absolute growth contributors in the years to 2022,"" wrote Irina Barbalova, Global Lead, Beauty and Personal Care at Euromonitor International. India is set to topple Germany, UK and France to become the fifth largest beauty market by 2022, while Indonesia will be among the top three contributors to actual revenues in skin care in the next five years, only surpassed by US and China. The growth of local brands like Himalaya, Patanjali and Emami in India, as well as Wardah in Indonesia, will reinforce the global potential of traditional local concepts such as Ayurveda, herbal and plant-based ingredients, and halal beauty."
The future of the US beauty industry will be multicultural,"""It's an exciting time for multicultural beauty in America as more and more brands are developing products to fit the unique interests and needs of multicultural consumers. The increasing diversity of the country bodes well for the beauty industry. With new launches from brands like Fenty Beauty, Kylie Cosmetics and FORM that offer more options for varying skin tones and hair types, there is opportunity for product usage to grow. Custom-blended beauty products is one area in particular that shows promise as these products resonate with women who may find it difficult to match their skin color and undertones or find the right products for their hair texture,"" said Toya Mitchell, Multicultural Analyst at Mintel. For instance, two thirds (66%) of Hispanic women say they create complex makeup looks, compared to 51% of US women overall. Hispanic women who perform a beauty routine are also more likely to be interested in multi-purpose beauty products (49% vs 41% women overall), in-shower body products (36% vs 27% women overall) and online beauty tools (31% vs 16% women overall). Meanwhile, Black women are more likely to be interested in trends surrounding natural beauty products (64% vs 45% women overall). A recent Mintel research shows that certain trends are ripe for growth in the US market. One in 10 (9%) women thus say they are interested in following the K-beauty (Korean beauty) trend, with interest rising to 13% of those aged 18-24 and 18% of those aged 25-34. Although half (49%) of US women overall follow a one- or two-step skincare regimen, a dedicated three in 10 (29%) say they have a three or more step skincare routine, indicating multi-step K-beauty regimens have potential to resonate with consumers. Eventually, Mintel observes that beauty devices [1] are the fastest growing segment in the US beauty industry. In fact, despite making up just 4% of the market, total retail sales of beauty devices grew 7.6% between 2016-2017 to reach an estimated $1.6 billion. ""This is the fastest rate of sales growth the category has seen in the last five years (since 2013),"" notes the market research firm. Elsewhere in the category, sales of beauty staples such as colour cosmetics (29% market share) and hair products (28% market share) grew 2.2% in the same timeframe, while skincare (25% market share) grew 1.4%. While skincare device usage is limited, interest is strong. Although just over one third (35%) of women say they use any skincare device, 41% of women say they are interested in trying one, with laser hair removal devices garnering the most interest (46%). ""Future growth is expected to come from new product innovation and the availability of lower-priced skincare devices. We're seeing customization evolve to include tech tools that diagnose hair and skin issues, with brands making it easier for consumers to bring this trend home,"" concluded Alison Gaither, Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel."
Spain: Sales of perfumes and cosmetics still on the rise,"Sales of perfumes and cosmetics grew by 2.15% in 2017 in Spain to reach EUR 6.82 billion. This is the third consecutive year of growth for the country, according to the Spanish Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (STANPA). All product categories have grown, but sales of perfumes and colour cosmetics recorded the most impressive rates: +5.42% and +3.24% respectively. Sales of lipsticks, for instance, have grown by +7.4% in value (+13.5% in volume) in 2017. The per capita consumption is 147 euros per year, more than the European average (137 euros per year) but less than those of France (171 euros per year) and Italy (163 euros per year). The mass market channel, which represents 47% of sales, is the one which increased the most in 2017, rising by 2.9%. The selective channel (prestige) grew by 2.5%. According to STANPA, the Spanish perfume and cosmetics industry also achieved record export sales in 2017 with growth of +10.5% over the previous year to reach 3.9 billion euros. Export sales are growing for all product categories. The sales of fragrance, which account for 40% of the sector's exports, have increased by 11.2% in 2017."
China Beauty Expo continues to move upmarket with the French Touch,"For Jean-Luc Ansel, chief executive of Cosmetic Valley and Franckie Bechereau, export and communication director, ""the links between China and France in the beauty sector began in 2008. Cosmetic Valley has been invited by China to come to the country's largest exhibition, China Beauty Expo. In 2010, the Cosmetic Valley decides to be present for the first time on CBE. Since then, she has renewed the experience every year, in order to promote the France Brand"". From this adventure, many partnerships and projects were born, including the famous BeautéVille, a Chinese clone of the Cosmetic Valley. In 2017, the French cosmetics export market signed a new record at 13.6 billion euros (+12% over one year). French exports of cosmetic products to Asia soared by 25% over one year, with a growth rate of over 30% in China in particular. One out of 5 French cosmetic products now leaves for Asia, according to FEBEA. Care and perfumes still account for 3/4 of French exports in the sector (44.3% for care and 31% for perfumes). The Chinese market is evolving and moving upmarket, as confirmed by the figures published by L'Oréal, where the Luxury Goods and Active Cosmetics divisions are posting solid sales. But China is also a volatile market. The Chinese consumer is increasingly aware and brands that want to succeed in China must create links with their interlocutors; working over the long term remains difficult. Especially since local brands want to assert themselves. The French manufacturers have a real role to play in the development of value creation, in particular through the country's fields of excellence such as lipo chemistry with the ITERG (Institut des Corps Gras) in Bordeaux or the research of bioactive peptides (with the PENERE European project in Caen). ""Our objective is to forge lasting links with companies targeted at different sites in China, including Beauté Ville and Fengxian,"" continues Jean-Luc Ansel. ""France is the country of cosmetic research, our R&D budget is 350 million euros, divided into 300 innovative projects. Throughout France, we have territories of expertise by regions grouped within the Domains of Strategic Territorial Excellence (DEST). The France brand is a symbol of performance, safety and know-how. The quality of French products is recognized throughout the world; we deliver healthy, validated and safe products. Another asset is training: we have an important card to play in China. France is a country where training is well developed and of high quality. Our know-how in this field is undeniable thanks to our engineering schools, our aesthetic training... China is in demand, it is up to us to respond."" This year, for the first time, the Cosmetic Valley has two pavilions at China Beauty Expo: one 420 m2 in hall E2 and the other 104 m2 in hall N4 which groups together the entire supply chain for the cosmetics sector COSMETECH (packaging, formulations, ingredients, accessories and services), i.e. a third of the total exhibition space with over 1000 exhibitors. COSMETECH is representing the largest Beauty Factory in the world with 7 halls dedicated to supply chain. According to Claudia Bonfiglioli - General Manager of Informa Beauty ""COSMETECH give the largest opportunity ever to brands to search new qualified suppliers in each category. Since two years COSMETECH has an ingredient advanced science in beauty project in Collaboration with IFSCC to bring R&D expert to the platform."" This N4 supply chain hall now includes these companies specializing in fields as varied as knowledge of skin physiology used for efficacy tests as know-how in glassware or R&D in formulation with Roval Cosmétiques, full service and custom solutions. The Pochet Group, an independent family business for over four centuries, French leader in luxury packaging will exhibit its latest creations. This company aims to become a world leader in multi-material luxury packaging for the beauty sector. To its credit, the last bottle of Chanel's Gabrielle perfume or the ""stiletto"" of Louboutin nail polish. For Franckie Bechereau, ""France has a varied choice of subcontracting companies, each with their often unique specialities, for the Chinese market. Among them, present under CV flag, VTA France represents the know-how of the French glassworks, specialist manufacturer of the glass bottle in tube drawn to measure, of caps type roll-on, capsule, dropper, pump...and of decorations (on glass in metallization, frosting, screen printing enamel or organic). It also manufactures and packages, in full service, samples of perfumes. Another field is testing with Bioalternatives, a company specializing in the evaluation of cosmetics, which offers more than 300 in vitro and ex vivo efficacy tests."" The ""premiumisation"" of the market is forcing Chinese brands to look for cutting-edge know-how, both in the technical and creative fields. ""Our expertise in French brand creation fascinates the Chinese,"" Françoise Barthélémy from the Carlin Paris agency, who has been supporting Chinese brands in the lingerie sector for over 25 years. ""The Occitane brand is the ultimate model for the Chinese. Even if trends in China differ from those in the West, the search for naturality, ecology and the weight of labels and references remain a foundation on which brands can be built. Cosmetics is a relatively young market in China. The care habits are still summary, with the exception of body care where rituals are more developed with the use of oils. As for skin care, the Chinese mainly seek to act on the color of their complexion by making it less yellow."" The other important point is regulatory. The CFDA (China Food and Drug Administration) has revised its cosmetic regulations, adopted since 2016. China is willing to adapt to European regulations, even if specificities remain, such as the compulsory approval for a new ingredient or the long and complex registration allowing cosmetics to be exported to China. This being the case, French companies that depend on European legislation are already well established during the year.

China: Meitu wants to impose itself as a brand partner,"Founded in 2008 in Xiamen, Fujian Province, Meitu (美图, ""beautiful image"") has enjoyed staggering growth with its photo editing application. ""53.5% of photos shared on mainstream China social media are processed by Meitu,"" emphasized Jade Zhou. The Group which is listed at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has changed to ""a Beauty ecosystem"" by developing child applications such as BeautyCam (improved selfies), Meipai (sharing of short videos and live-streaming) and MakeupPlus. The latter uses artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) to offer skin diagnostics as well as the online virtual testing of make-up products from different brands. ""So far, Meitu has already cooperated with more than 100 of the top makeup brands such as L'Oréal Paris, Guerlain, Lancôme, Maybelline New York, Clinique, Estée Lauder, and Shiseido to name a few. These brands have helped to offer more than 2,000 makeup products on MakeupPlus,"" said Jade Zhou, who added that the app did not sell products directly but linked back to e-commerce platforms such as Tmall. Urban Decay is not established in China but the L'Oréal's make-up brand has managed to take advantage of MakeupPlus to raise its profile in the country, which according to US estimates is expected to become the leading market for skincare and cosmetics products in 5 to 10 years. Urban Decay worked with the MakeupPlus app inside which we created 3 Urban Decay look filters so that the user could try on the looks virtually. Urban Decay also worked with Meipai for content marketing, so that influencers who are active on Meipai, talk about Urban Decay products organically. ""Make up look virtual try on in MakeupPlus APP - Makeup look filters were downloaded about 23 million times. Both collaborations worked well and the Urban Decay NAKED HEAT palette was sold out in key travel retail channels in APAC,"" said Jade Zhou. The collaboration can also take place in brick and mortar shops, like with Lancôme who installed in January 2017 in its flagship store in Canton, six ""magic mirrors"" incorporating the virtual makeup technology of the MakeupPlus app. ""It was also MakeupPlus app first AI attempt to be implemented in brand stores,"" highlighted Jade Zhou. These virtual makeup test screens were also used by the Nars brand at its launch press conference in China last year. The other applications of the Group are also put to use. ""At the beginning of 2018, our flagship and first app, Meitu, worked with GUCCI to jointly launch a series of 7 exclusive AR filters, to bring a luxurious makeover experience to them"", continued Jade Zhou. Additionally, before the eve of Valentine's Day, one of our popular selfie apps, BeautyCam, made a special promotion with Dior, to roll out a new customized user interface (UI) design, ""Miss Dior"", where a pink perfume bottle icon became the instant camera button. ""The new UI has driven a surge of exposure outreach to nearly 250 million audience and gained about 2.5 million clicks in just the first 2 days,"" detailed Jade Zhou. By choosing the Valentine's Day, an originally Western celebration, Meitu stakes its ambitions, which are not limited to the Chinese market. Out of 1.5 billion unique users announced - including 481.3 million active users each month - the Group claims a third - 500 million - are located outside China and thus intends to deploy localization strategies implemented by its teams based in India, Brazil, the United States, Singapore and Japan, to continue its global expansion."
UAE perfumers carve their niche in US$50 billion global fragrance industry,"Two UAE perfumers with a passion for fine fragrances are carving their own niche in a US$50 billion global fragrance industry, with their latest creations on show at the Middle East's largest beauty and wellness trade fair this May in Dubai. Abduljabar Al Harthi, the CEO and 'Nose' of Jealous Group, will launch two collections of niche perfumes that both pay homage to his country of birth, and also articulate the ""common human qualities amongst nations"". Abdulla Saleh Al Hammadi, Brand Owner and brainchild of The Code Voyage, meanwhile will unveil his brand concept, inspired from his childhood fascination for collecting exquisite perfume bottles and their potions within, during his numerous family vacations around the world. The two collections are among more than 20 brands that will be on display at Quintessence - an exclusive showcase of niche perfumes at Beautyworld Middle East, which runs from 8-10 May 2018 at Dubai International Convention and Exhibition Centre. Al Harthi said his Jealous Eau de Parfum Collection of four fragrances was designed to commemorate the UAE: ""It was born out of immense admiration for a nation that has given so much to its citizens,"" said Al Harthi. ""I wanted to create a product that would mirror my country's history and long record of milestones."" His other Eter Story Collection of five perfumes called Peace, Salam, Hipeng, Mir, and Erini wave various stories around the message of love, understanding and communication between different races and cultures. ""Eter Story is not a story of a fragrance as much as it is a message that gives people a common space for rapprochement and mutual understanding through a shared experience and a unique diversity that distinguishes them,"" said Al Harthi. Al Harthi's passion for niche fragrances and the stories behind his creations are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, who're seeking more personalisation than what mass-produced perfumes bearing the names of global fashion houses appear to offer. The rise of niche perfumes - distinguished by the raw ingredients that go into creating a scent, combined with the vivid stories of the perfumers behind them - has been borne out by the popularity of Quintessence, which was first introduced at Beautyworld Middle East in 2016. Code Voyage is participating for the first time at the exclusive showcase in 2018. Al Hammadi said he wants to share the brand's concept with potential 'co-voyagers': ""Code Voyage Perfumes celebrate the generosity, hospitality, unity and victories that we all share and experience in our daily lives. Everybody loves having something special, no matter where you come from, and niche brands offer that 'something special', whether in the concept and creativity, the packaging or the juice itself. And, particularly in the Middle East, there's a customer base with a high disposable income, a desire to be unique, and most of all, it's a customer that has for many centuries been surrounded by fragrances and incense."" Al Hammadi added his brand is rooted in traditional values, reflected in classic shapes used in the packaging: ""Although the brand's values are based on the traditions and way of life of ancient Arab tribes and their experiences, human values and success remain universal and alive: resonating with every human being."" Al Harthi said Middle East consumers have always searched for the highest quality and most unique items, with fragrances being no exception: ""The art of perfumery has been in the region since before the creation of perfume as we know it today and it has always been an important part of this region's cultural heritage. Over the next few years, niche fragrance trends will continue to focus on personalisation. Brands will try to stand out from the crowd by using more unique, rare ingredients that can become their own signature."" Quintessence - the Art of Perfume Quintessence is one of more than eight value-added features at the 23rd edition of Beautyworld Middle East in 2018. Ahmed Pauwels, CEO of the exhibition's organiser Messe Frankfurt Middle East, said the UAE has a long association with fragrances, with the niche element becoming increasingly popular: ""UAE consumers spent US$2.2 billion on beauty and personal care in 2017, of which US$674 million went towards fragrances, an increase of nearly six percent over 2016. The Gulf country is one of the highest per-capita spenders in the world on perfumes and has always traditionally been a very strong perfume market. Now what we're seeing is a major shift whereby consumers want to know more about the artistry, creativity, and inspiration behind their favourite fragrances. They want to learn about the nuances of perfume families such as Amber, Gourmand, Fougere, or Chypre, or how oriental scents mix with Oud. The niche segment answers this demand, and customers are now very sensitive about the perfumer behind the brands they purchase."" Other niche brands at Quintessence in 2018 include Antonio Croce, Coquillete, and Teaology from Italy; the Art of Scent from Switzerland; Poland's Bohoboca; Dofta from Sweden; House of Potentia, Odin, and Ulrich Lang from the USA; Rebatchi Prive from France; Germany's The Oriental Perfumery; and Areej Le Dore from Thailand. Aside from Quintessence, Beautyworld Middle East 2018 returns with other popular highlights that attract thousands of professionals every year, such as Centre Stage by Nazih Group; Nail It! by Artistic Nail Design & OPI; and the Battle of the Barbers. New this year is the Innovation Zone, Blend it! in collaboration with centdegres, and the Advanced Aesthetic Therapist Conference and Workshop. The annual three-day event will feature more than 1,600 exhibitors from 60 countries covering the five product groups of Hair, Nails & Salon Supplies; Cosmetics & Skincare; Machinery, Packaging, Raw Materials & Contract Manufacturing; Fragrance Compounds & Finished Fragrances; Personal Care & Hygiene, and for the first time in 2018, Natural and Organic. Its strong international flavour will be highlighted by 21 country pavilions from Argentina, Bulgaria, Brazil, China, Japan, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, the USA, and for the first time in 2018, Russia, and Peru.

Middle East: The rise of local brands is transforming the beauty market,"The beauty industry in the Middle East is undergoing huge changes: the end of a cycle of domination by international brands, now challenged by emerging independent players. These companies, refocusing on traditional and cultural values, are adapting to new consumers: an ultra-connected and demanding young consumer groups. A public looking for a personalized, targeted and sophisticated offer. Very active on social networks where some real experts have emerged, this age group takes advice from beautystas, who enjoy strong media clout, like the female blogger Huda Katan, now at the head the makeup brand Huda Beauty. This new landscape benefits to independent local players, digitally very present, (e-commerce platforms, social networks) who are able to meet these expectations combining tradition, innovation and personalization. ""Digital and e-commerce have thoroughly modified the beauty world of GCC. [..] New local beauty players have understood the essence of needs of Gulf customers and are challenging traditional businesses. By shaking up the industry, forcing it to think outside the box and be more consumer-centric, they have a significant and very positive impact. The Chalhoub Group is opening to these independent beauty brands which the region needs and welcomes them. We are very proud to have contributed to their international expansion and to see them succeed today,"" said Anthony Chalhoub, co-CEO of Chalhoub Group. To adapt to this new landscape, the Chalhoub Group recommends several strategies. Design personalized products, develop digital strategies, renew the authentic link with this new generation through a unique shopping experience and enrich the online offering. But also support these new local players, mostly present on the web, by offering them visibility in brick and mortar shops. A key evolution, considering that the beauty market in Gulf countries has dropped by 5%, with sales totaling USD 1.9 billion in 2016 against 1.8 bn last year. In a difficult macroeconomic context, international groups have reduced their marketing budgets. Institutional brands are struggling to adapt, thus contributing to the success of local small-scale designers who fully embrace the needs of a new generation looking for a customer centric offer, via digital and social networks. Hence the Chalhoub Group is seeking to revisit shopping experiences with new retail concepts and own brands. An all the more relevant bias in these Gulf countries where beauty rituals, like perfuming but also making-up, punctuate every moment of life. In a context where women are veiled, it is essential in particular, to design a wide range of eye makeup products (eye shadows, kohl, mascaras, false eyelashes, pencils, gels, brow powders...). Between tradition and modernity, local brands are developing ancestral rituals (perfumes built around oud and incense, kohl for the eyes) to adapt them to the current needs of modern and connected young people. ""GCC consumers have evolved. They have now become more assertive, curious, determined, and particularly influenced by their relatives and friends on social networks. In terms of beauty, they focus on makeup and look for originality, fun and color. [...] An increasing number of local entrepreneurs are undertaking relevant initiatives for their own community. They are changing the beauty scene of GCC and creating a new momentum. They are challenging established players and forcing them to rethink their strategy,"" added Patrick Chalhoub, co-CEO of Chalhoub Group. In a region where makeup and olfactory rituals have always been closely linked to women's culture, the Chalhoub Group supports many cosmetic niche brands to better identify, renew and welcome today's beauty."
"Global colour cosmetics sales to grow 6% in 2018, forecasts Mintel","Global sales of colour cosmetics are expected to reach US$ 48.3 billion in 2018, up 6% from US$ 45.5 billion in 2017, according to new research from Mintel. The US (US$ 12.1 billion), Japan (US$ 6.4 billion), China (US$ 5.1 billion), the UK (US$ 2.7 billion) and South Korea (US$ 2.2 billion) are forecast to be the top five colour cosmetics markets in 2018. Mintel has identified four macro-trends in the category: social media, sustainability, transparency, and hybridisation. Social media As the success of influencers has shown that people buy personality, and not simply the products, it has become more important for brands to have a personality. – 41% of Chinese colour cosmetics users are influenced by celebrity beauty bloggers and vloggers to buy products – 31% of German make-up users aged 16-24 wear make-up to feel trendy – 66% of UK women aged 16-24 say it's easy to learn new beauty techniques from the internet Social media gives brands a way to build a more intimate relation with consumers. They also encourage makeup users to adopt new habits. ""As fashions change, new 'selfie-friendly' zones of the face are receiving more attention,"" says Charlotte Libby, Mintel's Global Colour Cosmetics Analyst. Sustainability The whole beauty industry is shifting towards natural and organic products. Colour cosmetics makes no exception with an increased attention on product origin and quality of ingredients. In such a context, brands will be expected to demonstrate their ethical policies and consideration of resources and alternatives. – 66% of UK female beauty buyers aged 16-24 want retailers to give them more information about which beauty products are environmentally-friendly – 24% of Italian women have bought natural and organic make-up in the past year ""Consumers are drawn to brands that act responsibly. Attempting to reduce the carbon footprint by tackling waste is an area in which colour cosmetics brands can innovate. Alternative materials like bamboo, coconut husk and rice bran have been a growing trend in packaging,"" says Charlotte Libby. Transparency Young consumers want to be sure the companies and brands they buy from align with their personal views. – 34% of Brazilian Millennials aged 19-35 say they prefer to buy from brands that support social causes – 39% of US women aged 18-34 think brands that support charities are trying to make themselves look better Brands need to convince consumers their positioning is genuine. ""A strategy involving charitable donations needs to be long term and treated appropriately, becoming part of the core business of the company,"" adds Charlotte. Hybridisation As consumer demand for make-up with skincare benefits increases, there is more opportunity for brands to develop hybridisation between categories. – 67% of Chinese women want to minimise make-up steps – 41% of US female beauty buyers would be interested in multi-purpose beauty products – 41% of French women think that the environment (eg pollution, cold weather) affects the appearance of the skin ""As part of growing concerns around pollution, face make-up can act as another layer of protection. Hence, it is important that colour cosmetics incorporate skincare benefits such as hydration and UV protection. Probiotics also have a chance to grow; a prominent trend in skincare, connecting good bacteria to healthy skin, they are increasingly being used in colour cosmetics too,"" concludes Charlotte Libby."
"Pro ageing: ""Let me be me!""","Apart from some interventionists, a minority of consumers looking for immediate results provided by aesthetic medicine or surgery, the out-and-out youth-cultivating era is over. Most women choose this beautification attitude and look for natural alternatives. The first positive consequence of this acceptance can be seen in the rehabilitation of some signs of ageing such as bright wrinkles or silver / white hair. Worn by the journalist Sophie Fontanel, assumed white hair is trendy and currently making the buzz on Instagram. New muses are making the headlines like May Musk, mother of the founder of Tesla, who at 69 was walking down the runways during the New York Fashion Week and posed for Covergirl. Not to speak of models like the popular Iris Apfel with her asserted bold free and unique style, despite her 96 years of age. Another finding, the taboos of illness and menopause are becoming more and more conspicuous. The Même Cosmetics brand, dedicated to women affected by cancer, was recently approached by Laboratoires Pierre Fabre. In the United States, Hynt products boast a carcinoma free criterion, with no endocrine disruptors. According to the 2015 Deloitte Ifop barometer, 75% of French people would be interested in a coaching proposed by their health insurance and dedicated to well-ageing. Today our perception of seniors is different. It is at the age of 68 that, with no particular reason, the feeling of being a senior takes hold of us, but the paradox is that we always see ourselves younger than we are and this feeling increases with age. Recently, the media coverage on Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French President, has stirred things up, and will possibly change the way we look at women this age. Finally, if the cult of appearance is still very present in the media, we are moving towards the notion of 'age to enhance', what Americans call life enhancing. The representation of women in cosmetics is also changing. There are also more products proposed for women over 50 or even over 60. Asserted products and described as such. The Japanese brands were the first to offer products specifically dedicated to women aged 60+, L'Oréal also focused on the subject. Today, Lisa Eldridge, Lancôme makeup artist successfully enhances mature skins in her Youtube makeup tutorials. The site Look Fabulous Forever, which fights against the dictates of age, will roll out its make up brand in 24 countries. Things are changing with more adapted claims coming from brands. There is an intergenerational influence. Juniors, which are always show-offing on the Internet are whetting the appetite of the older generations. Beauty then becomes more integrative, it will globalize well-being, the silhouette, the lifestyle, our sleep or relaxing practices... resulting in a freer feminine look expecting new codes and expressions. Aging women no longer want to epitomize a set beauty, like Linda Rodin creator of Olio Lusso, described as the chic emblem of aging well. Women are aware that they have wrinkles and that these won't go away, and like Millennials, they do not want any more over-promises. ""No bullshit marketing!"" They are going to take action to preserve their tonicity, elegance, silhouette. The silhouette is more important than facial features; attention is focused on nutrition, a regular activity, slenderness. Mobility and tonicity prevail. In this quest for mindful beauty radiance, what mature women expect from cosmetics is emotional pleasure, sensoriality but with new and smart products. For this reason, we can anticipate a true coming back of cosmetics targeting this population. After targeting Millennials, brands will now focus on the 60+ again. First because they have a real purchasing power but also and mostly because sensoriality and lucidity are also areas to develop for them.

China Beauty Expo 2018 to put Japan and perfumes under the spotlights,"Japan will be the country of honour at this year's China Beauty Expo (CBE). In order to support this initiative, Japanese brands will be highlighted and the Japanese cosmetics knowhow shared to the visitors. ""Though Chinese brands are starting to focus on technology, they are still at a disadvantage compared with Japanese brands,"" says Dr. Yang Jianzhong, President of the Japan-China Cosmetic Exchange Association. In cooperation with the organisers of CBE 2018, Dr. Yang Jianzhong, a noted skincare expert, is inviting 25 top scientists, including Dr. Ronald Marks, a 38-year Shiseido veteran who specializes in anti-aging and skin whitening research. They will share their latest research results and trends in their respective fields. ""During CBE 2018, we will also organize a new product-matching event that focuses on popular Japanese and Korean imported brands. CBE will also create opportunities for Japan's top retailers to meet with Chinese channels and retail groups during its China Cosmetics Retail Summit,"" emphasis Mrs Ying Sang, Deputy General Manager at CBE. Another focus will be staged in Hall N5, where are gathered major international make-up brands, such as Maybelline, Max Factor, Red Earth, Can Make, Tony Moly, Memebox or City color. The hall will host the Perfume Village organized in collaboration with Cent Degrès China. The Village will comprise an exhibition held with the International Perfume Museum of Grasse, France, and a showcase of premium beauty Chinese and international fragrance brands. The idea is to promote perfumes and to highlight their emotional values and ingredients specific to the Chinese culture connected to ancestral Chinese medicinal techniques and values. ""The section is designed as a district with a garden, where you will find high-end perfume brands. The N5 fashion district's sensory garden is likely to be a surprise winner at CBE 2018. This display of perfume innovation comes at a time when the global perfume market is expected to reach US$5.6billions, according to GIA. China and other Asian markets also offer huge potential,"" says Matthieu Rochette, General Manager of Cent Degrés China. To further celebrate the art of perfumer, Nez La Revue will also collaborate with Cent Degrés and CBE and will print a special issue in Chinese (5000 copies) in order to support the development of the local fragrance market. ""Chinese consumers are more and more knowledgeable about perfume and are looking for qualitative content on perfume practices, history and general knowledge but also on raw materials and new creative trends. The aim of this special issue is to compare the Chinese culture related to smell, perfume gesture and local tradition with the occidental contemporary culture of perfume,"" says Dominique Brunel, publisher of Nez La Revue. CBE in figures For the 2018 edition, CBE is expecting 3,500 exhibitors on over 260,000 sqm of exhibition space and more than 450,000 visitors. Exhibitors will include more than 1,200 international brands from 26 countries and regions (increased by 90% over last two years), including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, UK and USA to name a few. The supply chain representing one third of the exhibition's space will gather over 1,000 exhibitors in 2018 with packaging, formulation, ingredients, accessories and services to Beauty Brands. To support the growth of this sector, CBE will feature the Beauty Ingredient Formulation Forum in its 3rd edition, with a program designed in partnership with IFSCC led by Claudie Willemin, physics-chemistry and formulation expert in skin care applied research in R&D. It will consists in a whole day conference with scientific R&D experts from Estée Lauder, L'Oréal, Shiseido, Amorepacific, Sunjin, Ashland, Pola, Merck, Greentech and BioAlternatives to demonstrate the latest beauty and science topics."

Chinese consumers need to be better informed about dermocosmetics,"New research from Mintel [1] reveals that two-thirds (66%) of urban Chinese consumers aged 20-49 who experience skin conditions say lifestyle is a top factor causing their facial skin conditions, followed by an endocrine disorder (47%) and environmental pollution (45%). According to Mintel, Chinese consumers are more likely to modify their lifestyle (72%) and pay more attention to daily facial skincare (71%) before taking any extra measures to treat their skin conditions. However, while 86% of male skin condition sufferers claim they don't take any measures, allowing it to heal on its own, only just 3% of female skin condition sufferers do the same. The most common skin conditions are not all the same for men as for women. Acne is the main concern of Chinese males (45% vs 38% among females), while they are less likely to report dark spots/pigments (24% vs 36% among females). Products designed to manage specific skin issues have a long history of development in China, but the dermocosmetics industry (usually referred as the cosmeceuticals industry in China) only started gaining momentum over the past few years. So far, only 38% of urban Chinese consumers use cosmeceuticals to improve their skin conditions. ""Minor skin conditions seem to be no big deal for Chinese consumers. The majority of them don't bother to use specialised products or take medicines to treat their skin conditions. In order to broaden the consumer base and usage frequencies, cosmeceuticals need to promote more preventative usage by positioning the products as a holistic approach to maintaining healthy skin, or address lifestyle factors, such as stress or lack of sleep, which is regarded as the number one cause of skin conditions in China, according to our research,"" commented Alice Li, research analyst at Mintel. In China, the number of skincare products claiming to be dermatologically tested, grew from 3.3% of new product launches in 2015 to 8.9% in 2017, according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD); meanwhile, the 'for sensitive skin' claim is also on the rise as it was featured in 12% of new product launches in 2017, even exceeding similar launches in Japan in 2017 (10.4%). ""As Chinese consumers highly value scientific data and endorsement from professional institutes to support product quality, dermatologically tested claims could help local brands build a professional and effective image,"" Li added. Furthermore, 74% of Chinese consumers agree it's essential that cosmeceuticals contain enough active ingredients. While 60% agree cosmeceuticals formulated with fewer ingredients are safer, nearly the same percentage (62%) of respondents are concerned that long-term usage of cosmeceuticals may result in dependence."
The UK prestige beauty market gets vegan and natural boosts,"The sale of vegan prestige beauty products in the UK reported an increase of 38% in the 12-month period February 2017 to end of January 2018 according to The NPD Group. The total market for natural prestige beauty products (of which vegan is a category) was valued at £124 million in 2017 and accounts for 26% of prestige women's face skincare. Driven by social media and campaigns like Veganuary, the popularity of a vegan lifestyle has grown as consumers embrace a more wellness-oriented lifestyle. The NPD Group has seen an increase in the number of vegan brands in the prestige beauty market but notes that most of these are in limited distribution. Vegan beauty brands only account for 1% of women's face skincare, but growth is well above the category at 38%. ""There has certainly been a rise in the number of vegan brands in prestige beauty and this coincides with consumers adopting a more conscientious approach when purchasing products, looking closely at the underlying philosophies and actions of the brands. They not only investigate ingredients and efficacy, they want to know about traceability, and how animal friendly they are. Vegan and cruelty-free are two of the big issues for customers in 2018, but still remains a niche segment of the skincare market,"" explained Helen Duxbury, Senior Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. The prestige beauty market has also been boosted by the growth of natural beauty. Natural brands (including organic, naturally-derived and vegan) are growing at 16%, ahead of the market growth which is at 7% in the 12-month period to the end of January 2018. The top five product sectors for naturals are anti-ageing, cleansers, moisturisers, eye treatment and masks. The biggest contribution to growth from natural beauty products is with anti-ageing (18%), cleansers (14%) and masks (39%) which are all ahead of the category. Natural cleansers in particular perform well, accounting for 18% of sales, compared to all cleansers which is 11%. According to The NPD Group, as consumers become more aware of the ingredients used in beauty products, ethics are now becoming a more important issue to individual brands. While the European Union has banned animal testing for cosmetic products, more consumers are aware that if a brand is selling in China then their products need to be tested on animals. ""Having a clear stance on these ethical issues can provide a valuable boost to sales,"" says The NPD Group. For instance, beauty brands with cruelty-free certification account for 20% of the women's face skincare and are grew by 18% compared to the overall category which grew only 7%. According to The NPD Group, the top five cruelty-free brands in the UK are (in alphabetical order): Charlotte Tilbury, Decleor, Elemis, La Prairie and Liz Earle. ""The popularity of vegan is undeniable and brands are now capitalising on the movement. In the past year we have seen solid growth and a stream of new launches in this sector. Whilst most of these are in limited distribution, we are also seeing an increase in mainstream brands offering a vegan range or who are fully vegan, such as the launch of Super Food Skincare by Elemis, which is not only vegan, it meets consumer demand for super food ingredients. We believe the trend for beauty products that not only help consumers look good but feel good about their purchase too is set to grow in 2018,"" concluded Duxbury."
Cosmoprof Bologna breaks records amid digital transformation of the beauty industry,"""Cosmoprof 2018 registered astonishing results. The number of professionals attending the exhibition exceeded the 250,000 visitors of the 2017 edition; we recorded a growth by 11% in the presence of foreign operators. Record numbers also for exhibitors, 2,822, from 70 countries; they attracted an international audience,"" said says Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. This year, the Cosmoprof Bologna show adopted a new format designed to better address the expectations of visitors and exhibitors. Hence, most of the show's sectors were opened from Thursday 15 to Sunday 18 March 2018 (Cosmopack and all the sectors working in the retail channel, for perfumery and cosmetics, green beauty and the international pavilions). The sectors dedicated to the professional beauty channels (hair, nail and aesthetics & spa segments, with the country pavilions of China and Taiwan) were the only ones opened from Friday 16 to Monday 19 March 2018. Almost entirely dedicated to the impact of digitalization on the beauty market, the show's inaugural conference, which was organized by Cosmetica Italia, the federation of the Italian cosmetics industry, set the tone of the whole edition. ""Our daily habits and thus our consumption choices are being rapidly influenced and changed by the ceaseless move towards digitisation"", said Fabio Rossello, President of Cosmetica Italia. ""For cosmetics companies, it is crucial to be able to transmit and consolidate our reputation and values in the world of digital information, social value included: indeed, this is increasingly considered to be one of the trademarks of our industry."" A transformation that the exhibitors already integrated into their strategies. ""Business models are changing with the rise of digital and the process goes very fast, especially in China. We have no choice but to adapt. It is increasingly difficult to get customer loyalty, even for big brands. We must be in constant contact with customers, we are entering an era of co-development,"" explains Simon Menard, CEO of the perfumery and cosmetics brand Gellé Frères. The sound is the same from the suppliers' side where the operators are organizing themselves to meet the new flexibility, agility and reactivity requirements of the market. For instance, Brivaplast, the Italian specialist of mascaras, eyeliners and lip-gloss packaging, presented its Ready2Go service to meet the consumers' new flexibility needs. Ready2Go is not a full service offer, but rather a catalogue of formulas developed by partners and previously tested with Brivaplast packaging. Eventually, this year again, the show honoured the most significant innovations from both brands and suppliers, as well as a personality that has marked the industry. This year, the career Award honoured Jean-Claude Ellena, the famous ""nose"" of the Maison Hermes that attracted new attention to high-end perfumery. Next rendez-vous for the Cosmoprof community: Cosmoprof North America in Las Vegas (from 29 to 31 July), Cosmoprof India in Mumbai (10 and 11 September) and Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong (from 13 to 15 November with Cosmopack Asia and from 14 to 16 November with Cosmoprof Asia)."
Beauty Tech: Augmented reality applications take center stage in brands' multi-channel strategies,"The gone through road in just a few years is impressive! YouCam's photo editing and virtual reality suite of applications (YouCam Makeup, YouCam Perfect, YouCam Fun and YouCam Nails) has established itself as the global leader in virtual reality makeup, with more than 550 million downloads [1] and collaborations with the biggest names in beauty: Estée Lauder, Yves Saint Laurent, L'Oréal Paris, MAC Cosmetics or Macy's, to name a few. ""Last year, we signed a global framework agreement with the L'Oréal Group, which allows all of the Group's brands to use the Youcam MakeUp app,"" explains Sylvain Delteil, Director Business Development of Business Corp. A resounding success, enabling Perfect Corp, the Taiwanese Company that develops the apps, to raise more than US$ 25 million last October 2017. It cannot be denied that the Company has given itself the means to succeed. The spin-off of Cyberlink, a Company specializing in digital imaging, could rely from its inception, on a team of about 100 developers. YouCam and similar non-specialized platforms (Perfect 365 or, more particularly in China, Meitoo) have thus almost overridden proprietary apps developed by brands, by imposing an ongoing pace of innovation. After having made inroads in skincare, YouCam recently added an extension dedicated to hair colouring to its suite. But most of all, these platforms are now increasingly becoming essential tools to support multichannel strategies. ""At first we operated as a mobile platform for consumers and very quickly, at the request of brands and retailers, we started developing in-store applications. Today we are developing ourselves as a service platform dedicated to brands,"" continues Sylvain Delteil. ""Augmented reality is a convincing tool to win over consumers and facilitate sales, but we are now also offering a Full Service multichannel marketing management."" In practical terms, once the SKUs are loaded on the steering console, made available to them, brands can use them as they wish: YouCam Makeup application, virtual tests on in-store terminals, or even for their own websites or mobiles. Custom developed services can even be added to the platform, especially for the training of sales forces. The console also aggregates all the data collected by the applications on consumer behaviors: number of likes for the brand, number of tests done per SKU, and most of all, data on the saved and/or shared looks. ""The list of solutions currently available to brands is actually quite impressive: YouCam Makeup, in Store Brand Makeup & Skincare Consultation Mode, Exclusive Online Consultation Mode, Webpage Consultation Mode, Beauty Live Training, Live Streaming for Brands, In Store Barcode Try on, and so on,"" explains Sylvain Delteil. Brands can therefore rely on various and efficient tools to test their product in a user-friendly and fun way, train their consultants remotely, or educate their consumers. ""This involves investing a little in some human resources, but then the brand has access to a multiservice platform designed from the outset to meet all the needs of a multi-channel strategy."" In a nutshell, Perfect Corp promises effective results. ""A study we commissioned in Japan [2] with a panel of 25,000 smartphone users showed that YouCam Makeup users are 60% more likely than standard users to buy makeup products. For brands, being present on the app increases by 30% their sales opportunities,"" concludes Sylvain Delteil."
"From the kitchen to the cosmetic counter, food-inspired cosmetics gain popularity in Brazil","Going to a pharmacy and coming across products such as mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, chocolate syrup or creamy vegetable soup might come as a surprise to customers, but it is becoming increasingly common to find cosmetics that seem more like food than beauty products in Brazil. This is not a new trend. Butters, mousses and fruit-based formulas have been part of the beauty routine of thousands of customers for decades. However, this new concept of 'gourmet cosmetics' goes beyond the textures and ingredients – it also plays an important role in the packaging and branding of the products. ""We are seeing more and more food-inspired cosmetics in Brazil with a wide range of textures and appeals. They are products that arouse the curiosity of customers and create a whole new experience when applied to the hair or skin,"" says Christine Botto, Marketing Manager for Personal Care at BASF South America. BASF manufacture polymers that allow for different types of textures, meeting the current customer demand for gourmet cosmetics with formulas such as Marshmallow and Fruit Jelly, suitable for skin moisturizers, and Maria Mole (a popular Brazilian dessert), used in curl defining creams. ""This trend gained momentum with homemade mixtures that digital influencers began sharing on social networks. As an alternative to salon services, given the country's harsh economic climate, a huge new movement towards homemade recipes to smooth, moisturize and care for the hair using easily accessible ingredients - including food products - gained strength,"" says Andressa Neves, PR and Digital Media Manager at Muriel Cosméticos. The boom in videos showing women how to straighten their hair at home using corn starch inspired Muriel to launch the Alisena product line. Its name, formula and packaging resemble the most popular corn starch brand in Brazil: Maizena. ""With mayonnaise it was no different. Even celebrities started promoting the use of mayonnaise to moisturize their hair, making the procedure very popular among women with curly hair"", says Neves. This prompted Muriel to launch the Hair Mayonnaise line, with hair masks made from egg protein and natural oils. However, if these homemade recipes are so successful, why did the industry decide to invest in developing products to recreate them? ""Homemade mixtures require a certain amount of work and create a lot of mess, which makes our products a more convenient alternative. Moreover, despite being inspired by food ingredients, all our products are carefully developed using high technology and quality raw materials,"" claims Neves. Although these cosmetics look a lot like their food counterparts, she states customers don't get confused. ""The Mayonnaise features an 'inedible' sign on its packaging and such products are only available in the cosmetics aisle."" For The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), it's not as simple as it looks. In a statement to Brazil Beauty News, the health surveillance agency said that ""this matter has been addressed by the board and it should be regulated soon."" From shower jelly to ketchup and soy sauce hair masks – there seems to be no limit to the creativity in the Brazilian beauty market. ""The trend should hold up. New homemade recipes are always emerging and spreading widely on social media. There are many ingredients yet to be explored,"" concludes Andressa Neves."
Pakistan: Male grooming booms as social media set new beauty standards,"Deeply conservative Pakistan has strict notions of masculinity where men are often expected to be austere and flamboyant styling is to be avoided. But savvy entrepreneurs in urban centres have latched on to a new metrosexual trend: male beauty salons. While women in urban Pakistan have long enjoyed access to the care of beauticians and stylists, expensive facials and mani-pedis for men are becoming more common as disposable incomes in the nation's swelling middle class grow — per capita income jumped by 6.4 percent in 2017. A vibrant social media culture has also fuelled the desire to be selfie-ready at any time, with influencers like Adnan Malik and Osman Khalid Butt attracting hundreds of thousands of followers online with their fashion-conscious posts. At Tauseeq Haider's ""Men's"" salon, customers usually fork out a minimum of 1,400 rupees (US$12.60) for a visit — a far cry from the 200 rupees spent at traditional barber shops. ""Men have equal right to be groomed and times have changed. It's no more just getting your haircut,"" says Haider. ""Senior citizens, bureaucrats, they don't feel ashamed of saying that I need a facial, massage, my nails need to be done, please suggest what should I get,"" he adds. In rural Pakistan, men have traditionally taken their fashion tips from Islamic dictates, with the Koran specifying the length of beard and moustache along with hygiene guidelines. And in the cities, Bollywood and Western entertainment have long driven fashion trends for conscientious groomers. But times are changing fast in the rapidly developing South Asian nation, with social media setting and wrecking trends in urban centres at the speed of a swipe. According to Lebanese salon owner Michael Kanaan, who has been based in Pakistan for more than a decade, rising wages and greater exposure to global culture is fanning the burgeoning demand. ""The Pakistan male is becoming more metrosexual. It is all due to the internet and the age of satellites and TVs,"" says Kanaan. Economist Minhajul Haque agrees, saying Pakistani men are also subjected to a new slew of online advertising campaigns that have reinforced the trend. ""There is this whole lot of clever marketing of male beauty products which is spurring demand,"" he explains. Humayun Khan, 49, says he is fine with spending more money to look good and his wife is supportive of the new passion. ""I... get my nails done, get my haircut, get my facial and I am done for the day and after two weeks I come again,"" he says. ""If I don't look good, my wife wouldn't like me,"" he laughs. Stylist Ghulfam Ghori says Pakistani men are also now more concerned with skincare, opting for blackhead removal, acne treatments and even the occasional brush with makeup before major events like weddings. ""Men are very conscious about their skin now... and consider it essential to get facials. Previously it was not common, but now the trend is increasing among men to get themselves groomed,"" says Ghori. But it's not just the salons that are cashing in on Pakistani men's blossoming cosmopolitan predilections. Zafar Bakhtawari, chairman of the D. Watson Group, one of Pakistan's biggest pharmacy chains, explains: ""I can say there is a revolution coming up in Pakistan in the male psyche that they are becoming very much conscious about their beauty, about their face, about their hair, about their dress and it's a great revolution."""
France: Exports of perfumes and cosmetics drive industry growth,"Exports of French perfumes and cosmetics broke a new record in 2017, passing the 13 billion euro mark (13.6 billion euros according to figures published by FEBEA, up +12% compared to 2016). While the French domestic market is struggling with low sales, the dynamism of exports drives the growth of the French industry in a sector boasting a trade surplus of 10.5 billion euros (up +14% compared to 2016). ""The 2017 figures confirm France's leading position in the international market. It is heartening to see that, thanks to their good reputation, French cosmetics that are still appealing to foreign consumers,"" said Patrick O'Quin, President of the FEBEA. In the mature European Union market, growth of French exports remained strong with a rise of 6.2%. The growth was driven by Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain, four countries remaining in the top 5 of France exports. Exports to Asia are skyrocketing, with a 25% year-on-year and growth. Sales to China and Singapore even grew by more than 30%. Exports towards the continent returned to growth after flat figures in 2015 and a timid recovery (+9%) in 2016. Now, 20% of French beauty and personal care exports are shipped to Asia, representing more than 2.6 billion euros. North America is another growth booster. French exports to the region increased by +19% last year, including a +20% increase in sales to the United States. Exports to the Middle East have increased by +13.1% o, driven by UAE and Saudi Arabia. Eventually, North Africa was the only zone to record a decline in 2017, with exports down by -14%, despite a recovery in Egypt (+17%). The good export figures of perfumes and cosmetics are exception in the context of a French trade balance that showed a global deficit of 62.3 billion euros in 2017. ""There is a real impact of the French know-how in cosmetics perfumes. These products are part of the French way of life. For many years, French companies have demonstrated their ability to address the demands of global markets, in all segments, not just for premium products. For a long time, French companies in the personal care and cosmetics sectors have been thinking globally and have adapted themselves in order to offer attractive products to the whole world,"" explains Patrick O'Quin. Skin care and fragrances still account for three quarters of French cosmetics exports (44.3% for care and 31% for perfumes), but the make-up category has shown a real dynamism in 2017, with exports up +28% for lip products, +14.5% for eye products and +25% for makeup powders. According to Patrick O'Quin, the growth French exports is at least equivalent to those of its main competitors, in particular the United States and Italy. However, according to the FEBEA President, there is a strong progression of Korea, which is now exporting beyond the Asian continent. Brazil is also emerging as a new major player, driven by the natural trend. But for the moment, France is brilliantly facing competition!"
Tradeshows: MakeUp & Luxe Pack take the beauty industry by storm in Los Angeles,"Taking advantage of the momentum initiated three years ago by of MakeUp in LosAngeles, the first edition of Luxe Pack in Los Angeles was held last week at the Barker Hangar, jointly to the MakeUp in trade show. The result: Two complementary two-day events dedicated to the premium and beauty sectors that have welcomed more than 3,900 visitors, according to the organizers. An impressive progression compared to the 1,650 visitors announced last year for the MakeUp in event alone. ""It was difficult at certain hours of the day to make your way in the crowded aisles ..., very difficult also to try meeting without any appointment exhibitors often overwhelmed by requests..., and certainly easier to see the satisfaction on the faces of all participants,"" commented the organisers. The simultaneity of the two events widened the range of solutions proposed to visitors. As usual, MakeUp in LosAngeles has gathered some of the leading global makeup subcontractors - ranging from colour cosmetics formulators to suppliers of make-up packaging and accessories. In total: more than 80 exhibitors, more than double last year. The Luxe Pack section added about fifty exhibitors from the luxury packaging sector (perfumes, skincare, spirits ...). The interest of makeup brands for full-service solutions was cleraly confirmed on the show-floor. Fusion Packaging, for instance, presented Accelerate by Fusion Packaging, a turnkey solutions package launched last year at Cosmoprof North America in Las Vegas. ""Turnkey solutions are in big demand,"" said Kelly Kopa, Head of Marketing at Fusion Packaging. ""We we have our own in house R&D team and we develop the formulas with partner laboratories. It's a way to be sure packaging matches with formula and to accelerate time to market."" The evolution has been similar at Roberts Beauty. In just a few years, the company evolved from being a makeup packaging supplier to being a provider of full and customized solutions. Albéa, for its part, presented the Black Box concept, a smart selection of packaging, formulas and trendy accessories from Albéa Beauty Solutions, the group's turnkey solution offering, specially design for brands seeking to launch their products on the beauty market without delay. The first edition of Albéa's Black Box groups together a selection of accessories and packs with artistic and musical inspirations. Following the same way towards more service and innovation,Canada's KDC presented its new identity KDC/One. The new branding has been designed to unify the offering of the group's ten production sites around one single innovation centre, which will open its doors next June in New Jersey. However, we should remember this warning from Aïmara Coupet, who presented Asquan's first steps in turnkey makeup solutions: ""Full-service is not just putting a formula into a packaging. It requires a real concept with a story and a product ready to put on the market."" The next edition is announced to take place next year, at the same dates in the same place."
CosmeTokyo rides the J-Beauty wave: The next big beauty trend?,"From 24 to 26th January, CosmeTokyo gathered beauty industry professionals on its 8th edition at a new venue, the Makhuari Messe exhibitions centre. The trade show hosted a new area this year with Inner Beauty Tokyo dedicated to beauty and health foods. As usual, the event was held in conjunction with CosmeTech - an exhibition focusing on suppliers of the beauty industry (ranging from ingredients and formulation to pack and services, when CosmeTokyo is devoted to finished products. Gathered under the ""Beauty and Health Week Tokyo"" umbrella, the events gathered 709 exhibitors from 30 countries (including 33% international companies) and 22,114 visitors with international visitors mainly coming from South East Asia (China, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.) but also from middle east. To support the growing trend for the Asia-made products with consumers, the organizers invited 100 social influencers and micro influencers to create a Beauty Buzz Talk around the show. ""Marketing is as much important with micro influencers as with the other target consumers … We have to be present on social networks to support our exhibitors,"" says Megumi Yanai, International Sales Director. Japan's taste for High Tech was confirmed at this year's show with a number of stem cell-based beauty brands as well as nano ingredients or hydrogen water, and also an eclectic presence of beauty devices with ion technology or hydrogen-rich water diffusor for anti-ageing benefits. In the same time, the boom of natural/organic beauty products in Japan was confirmed through a wide section of the show dedicated to a greened offer. The section also included products with traditional Japanese ingredients (soybean, seaweed, black yeast, etc.) and also local brands with organic cocoa, water from Mont Fuji or organic avocado or olive oil. Confirming Japan's ancestral know-how in the sector, the show also hosted manufacturers of traditional brushes were present (Chikuho-do, or Koyudo to name a few). To help international businesses, the organizers of CosmeTokyo offered workshops and online webinars to help navigate the Japanese market and understand the local customs. They also held an international buyers' program with a matchmaking service setting up over 500 meetings with buyers and exhibitors. All these actions certainly contributed to a general feeling among exhibitors that this edition of the show was marked by an increased internationalization. The Japanese market is opening up recently and CosmeTokyo reinforces the idea with more exhibitors from the international scene but also visitors coming from Middle East, Russia, Europe or America. The market is quickly evolving and beauty products are no longer limited to a category of people. Make-up has attracted younger consumers for a while and the spending power of Japanese women has increased which has opened to market to foreign brands. Imports have increased in the recent years with the example of the success of specialised retailers such as CosmeKitchen or @Cosme sourcing Japanese but also international beauty brands … Mixing tradition and modernism and renowned for their uncompromising attitude towards quality, Japanese beauty products are a strong competitor of South Korea, which have been flying high recently. They offer the perfect mix of performing products and strong cultural codes, thus addressing the quest for authenticity of increasingly sophisticated Asian consumers. So, watch out for Japanese brands!"
U.S.A: Sales of prestige beauty brands rise 6 percent in 2017,"The U.S. prestige beauty industry reached USD 17.7 billion in 2017, a 6 percent increase over 2016, according to market research firm The NPD Group. At the forefront, the skincare category grew its sales by 9 percent and contributed 45 percent of the industry's total gains; makeup followed with a 6 percent increase in sales, and fragrance closed the year up 4 percent. [1] After several years of soft performance, skincare was revitalized in 2017. Reaching USD 5.6 billion in sales, growth has stemmed from smaller segments including masks (+32 percent), facial exfoliators (+12 percent) and cleansers (+6 percent), and other face products (+39 percent) which, among other items, includes emerging formats, essences, and facial sprays. Larger segments such as facial moisturizers (+7 percent), skincare's largest by dollar volume, and age specialists (+7 percent) also fared well in 2017. The body, sun, and hair care segments of skincare all experienced growth as well. Though makeup's growth rate slowed in 2017, it remains beauty's largest category, bringing the most dollar volume to the industry and USD 8.1 billion in 2017. Growth was driven by high volume segments including foundation (+7 percent) and eye shadow (+13 percent), as well as other face products such as bronzers, highlighters, and glow products. Sales were also positive for other key segments like face primers (+17 percent), concealer (+10 percent), eye brow makeup (+7 percent), and lip colour (+2 percent). In fragrance, where sales totalled USD 4.0 billion in 2017, juices grew by 4 percent. Niche areas of the market including natural and artisanal fragrances grew their sales by 32 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Beyond the body, the home scents market is booming. It has added USD 44.4 million in sales since 2014. Sales reached $80.4 million in 2017, up 59 percent. This is building off of 18 percent growth the segment saw in 2016. Growth drivers for the market in 2017 included candles (+56 percent) and the smaller segment of home ancillary gift sets (+165 percent) which include candle and reed diffuser gift sets. The prestige beauty industry had a good fourth quarter in 2017, with sales consistently strong throughout the holiday season. Across the industries tracked weekly by NPD throughout the season, beauty was the growth leader during various weeks including Thanksgiving/Black Friday week. Some of its hottest holiday sellers were false eyelashes, lip gloss, skincare sets and kits, and home ancillary gift sets. Overall, fragrance juices brought in the most dollars for the entire holiday season driven entirely by Christmas week, followed by makeup and skincare face products, which showed consistent growth throughout the holiday season. ""As beauty brands and retailers look to understand 'what's next' to keep the momentum going, their focus should be on developing new and alternative ways to engage with consumers. Amidst the news headlines around store closures and challenges facing traditional department stores, it's important to remember that brick-and-mortar is a critical component to driving growth,"" said Larissa Jensen, executive director and beauty industry analyst at The NPD Group. ""We're seeing more brands enhance their in-store interaction with consumers through pop-up, pop-in, and other experience stores, and we expect this will accelerate in this new year."""
On-the-go skincare formats make a splash with US women,"Whether throwing it in a gym bag or using during the commute, travel-friendly skincare formats are making a splash with US women, reveals Mintel. According to one the firm's latest research [1], the skincare formats that US female skincare users are most likely to have tried or are interested in trying include on-the-go products, such as exfoliating wipes (81 percent), waterless facial cleansers (69 percent) and sunscreen sticks (68 percent). As value remains a top priority when it comes to skincare routines, consumers are willing to pay more for products that give them the best bang for their buck. Three in 10 female skincare users are willing to pay more for products with built-in applicators, dual packaging, i.e. contains multiple products (30 percent) or that are refillable (29 percent). ""Consumer focus on health and wellness is inspiring a burgeoning trend in beauty with innovative, on-the-go formats. In addition to wanting skincare that satisfies their specific needs, convenience enables skincare consumers to streamline their routines, a benefit they are willing to spend for. Brands that offer quick and easy-to-use formats that make the most out of beauty routines while traveling, such as waterless facial cleansers and portable sunscreen sticks, will do well with consumers as they seek out more convenient products,"" said Alison Gaither, Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Furthermore, as the line between facial makeup and facial skincare blurs and skincare staples address multiple concerns, specialty skincare products are being put back on the shelves. Mintel research [2] shows that sales of facial anti-aging products (16 percent market share) are estimated to decline 3 percent in 2017 to reach US $1.8 billion, while acne treatments (8 percent market share) are estimated to decline 1.5 percent to reach US $9.1 million. While demanding high value multifunctional products, US women also favour the most simple and easy-to-use products. According to Mintel, ""when it comes to purchasing skincare products, back to basics is best as simple usage instructions (58 percent) and short ingredient lists (53 percent) rank as the most important packaging features for female skincare users."" This is especially true among older women as those aged 55+ are more likely than their younger counterparts to prioritize simple usage instructions (66 percent vs 46 percent of 18-34s) and short ingredient lists (58 percent vs 49 percent of 18-34s). Formulating skincare products with natural ingredients is also a good way to help them standing out from the mass. For instance, more than two in five skincare users are interested in skincare products that contain clay (42 percent) or apple cider vinegar (41 percent). ""The familiarity of food-based ingredients in skincare is appealing to consumers who want to understand what exactly is in the products they use,"" continued Gaither. Mintel also noted a growing interest for the skincare benefits of probiotics (38 percent of female skincare consumers). This interest is reflected in new product development in recent years, as the use of the probiotic Lactobacillus in skincare products in the US grew 98 percent from 2013-17. ""The skincare market is highly saturated, and brands are challenged by consumer demand for simplicity, as well as routine shopping behaviour which is limiting product trial. Focusing on unique offerings to capture the attention of consumers, such as Korean skincare trends and on-the-go formats, could nurture category growth. Eco-ethical claims will also continue to rise, and familiar, food-inspired ingredients such as apple cider vinegar and Manuka honey will support the natural trend. The movement to embrace aging will continue to give multi-benefit products an advantage over specialty products, while no-rinse options, such as micellar waters, will encourage consumers to use a larger repertoire of cleansing products, further boosting segment growth,"" concluded Gaither."
Sales of prestige beauty products up 4% in the UK,"Sales of luxury beauty products in the UK reported an increase of 4% in 2017, hitting the £3 billion mark (EUR 3.4 billion), unveiled The NPD Group. According to the market research firm, the growth was largely driven by strong performance in fragrance, make-up and skincare and by the interest from overseas shoppers. ""The growth we have seen in the UK prestige beauty market is impressive, given the uncertainty with Brexit and the weak pound. British customers continue to purchase prestige beauty with great passion, and we also believe that an increase in global shoppers is a contributing factor to this growth, especially in super premium skincare and fragrance,"" commented Helen Duxbury, Senior Account Manager, NPD UK Beauty. The prestige fragrance market was valued at £1 billion in 2017. Fragrance ended the year with a solid performance, increasing 3%, with both classic and new launches contributing to this growth. Consumers continue to choose juices over gift sets with the sale of gift sets remaining flat in 2017, with juices growing 4%. Skincare grew 6% in 2017 and this growth has been driven by classic and super premium brands. Although small at present, natural and vegan brands are demonstrating their importance to the skincare market's growth. As far as make-up are concerned, sales increased by 6% compared to last year, but this slowed from the double-digit growth of 10% reported in 2016. Within the make-up sector, foundation and lip colour remain the star performing categories reporting healthy growth throughout 2017. ""From the figures we have seen in 2017 there is a definite boom in the prestige beauty market. Make-up and super premium skincare are a real attraction for overseas visitors as they include many designer brands. Retailers confirm they have seen an increase in global shoppers in store. Whilst the weak pound confirms our thoughts that the global shopper is boosting the prestige beauty market, UK shoppers continue their love affair with prestige beauty in all categories,"" concluded Helen Duxbury."
Shanghai and Seoul: A winning duo for the MakeUp In shows in Asia?,"Premium Beauty News - ""MakeUp In"" is a concept that adapts to the diversity of markets and cultures in Asia! Adriana Rodriguez - That's true! It's not only to be able to adapt, but it mostly about doing it quickly! Seoul remains one of the most important spot in Asia when it comes to Fashion and Beauty but meanwhile China continues to develop its domestic market for cosmetics. New Brands are growing fast. Chinese women are more and more adepts of make-up. China is ""finally"" becoming this great beauty market coveted by the entire industrial world. Requirements and needs are very different in Korea and in China. The first country has reached an unprecedented level of quality, challenging its Japanese neighbour but the second country is catching up. Premium Beauty News - Which explains why you chose to be present for the first time both in Seoul and Shanghai? Adriana Rodriguez - Yes and for a simple reason... Some of our exhibitors - who follow us around the world, often three or four times a year -, wanted to stay in Seoul while others were more tempted to enter the Chinese market. If you recall, the creators of MakeUp In trade shows, Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, had already expressed themselves on this point a few months ago: with their size, specificity, excellence and exclusivity the concept of these events suits this international network particularly well. And given the diversity and economic weight of major countries like Korea, China and..., undoubtedly one day Japan, it was only logical for us to be present the same year on these different theatres of operation. Regarding Shanghai, the opportunity was all the more interesting given the fact we now belong to the InfoPro Group, the organizer of Luxe Pack Shanghai, a event with a ten-year proven track record in Shanghai, which gives even more assets to this first MakeUp in Shanghai. Premium Beauty News - You said exhibitors were not the same? Adriana Rodriguez - Not quite! But for these two events, we have the confidence of the biggest subcontractors in the make-up sector at MakeUp in Shanghai (where we are with Luxe Pack Shanghai) and at MakeUp in Seoul with companies like Intercos, Cosmax, Strand Cosmetics Europe, LF Beauty, BKolorMakeUp, FS Korea, Weckerle Cosmetics, Nippon Shikizai, Kolmar, Geka, MS Swiss Cosmetics, Zignago Vetro, Pennelifaro, Baralan, Elcos, Libo Cosmetics, Arcade Beauty, Du Pont de Nemours, C & C International, Bormioli Luigi, Eisen, Anomatic, Yonwoo, Toly, Schwan Cosmetics, Regi, Hana, Fiabila, Coson, Cosmecca, Albéa, Englewood, Bonne, Chemicos, SGD Asia, Sleever etc. Premium Beauty News - It is often said that Asian people prefer ""big events"" to the expense of smaller targeted events! Adriana Rodriguez - That's not true! A proof is the number of Asian companies exhibiting at MakeUp in Paris, MakeUp in New York and, now, MakeUp in Los Angeles. Many of them prefer our targeted events with no loss of visitors. They understood that our events bring together the top of of make-up leaders in the world. ""Quality"" before ""Quantity""! We met so many of these exhibitors complaining about these big events where they were lost in the middle of nowhere and meeting uninteresting visitors during long endless days. ""Quality"" also means the service offered. A Premium service where everything is included...: the booth, the furniture, the participation to conferences, the meals, the coffees etc. We have definitely banned impersonal and cold venues to organize our events in upscale and fashionable places! Premium Beauty News - You are certainly the trade shows organizer who created the biggest number of planetary events in such a short time! Adriana Rodriguez - The credit should go to the Beauteam team that I joined a few months ago! But it was indeed a perfect bet! Figures are there to prove it. In total each year, our events bring together 400 exhibitors, 12,000 visitors, 58% of whom are top Managers / Marketers, which is quite a performance when you think about it. In nine years, the team organized no less than 29 trade shows! A winning concept that is now conquering Asia! So, see you in April in Shanghai and then in Seoul."
Are these the beauty trends that will dominate in 2018?,"The social media platform has shared its trend predictions for the coming year based on the activity of its 48 million beauty 'Pinners', and, when it comes to beauty, there are a few surprises in store. Facial rollers are set to be big business, with 'pins' for the 'derma roller' skincare tool up by 345% in the last year, despite controversies regarding this somewhat aggressive instrument. Jade, quartz, and even ice rollers are also set to increase in popularity. Another skincare trend prediction is oil, with saves for 'cleansing oil' up by 555% over the past 12 months. When it comes to makeup, it looks like eyelashes will be getting their moment in the spotlight, while graphic nail design will also remain popular, particularly geometric designs. In keeping with the beauty looks seen on the catwalk during the Spring/Summer 2018 fashion shows, bright, vibrant eye makeup will also be on trend, judging by a 63% increase in searches for 'bright eyeshadow'. Another major trend will see consumers embracing the increasingly wide range of foundation shades available on the cosmetics market, with 'complexion matching' saves up by 378%. The trendiest beauty followers will be wearing their hair slicked back or wavy, if the 166% increase in searches for both of those terms is to be trusted. Wet-look, slicked back hair has been a major catwalk and red-carpet beauty trend for the fashion world throughout 2017, but only time will tell whether or not the concept makes it to everyday life. However, it seems that another celebrity hair trend from this year might be about to die — saves for 'long hair' and 'pixie' were up by 130%, suggesting that the bob has had its 15 minutes of fame for now.

Kline reveals beauty's cyber month winners,"The results for November - also known as Cyber Month - have just been posted in Amalgam [1], Kline's digital tracking service. As it is a big month for online gift purchases, we naturally saw many gift sets moving up the ranks. Here are the top scoring items in the makeup kits category: Topping the list is Physicians Formula Shimmer Strips Custom Eye Enhancing Kit, which moved up 36 spots in makeup overall. This item is consistently among Amazon's top sellers in eye makeup. Several Birchbox exclusives are among the top scored items, including Arrow 5 Minute Beauty Kit and The Maid Up & Ready Kit, its curated collection of items from such brands as Jouer, Benefit, and Livingproof. Too Faced Boss Lady Beauty Agenda, a limited-edition Sephora exclusive, debuted in Amalgam in October, securing the #13 spot in the category. In November, it jumped to the #3 slot. Tarte Limited-Edition Treasure Box Collector's Set, another Sephora exclusive that debuted on our charts in October, shares the #3 spot.

The nail product industry on track for growth,"The global nail polish market is set to grow at a compound annual rate of 9.5% to reach a value of US $15.55 billion by 2024, a new report by Research and Markets alleges. The report attributes the forecasted surge in demand to the increasing numbers of young beauty fans investing in nail designs, as well as innovation in terms of textures and effects. The number of professional salons providing nail care services is also on the increase, making it easier than ever to invest in manicure and nail treatments, while collaborations between manufacturers and salons are also expected to have a positive impact on market growth. When it comes to choosing polishes, gel formulas are performing well, accounting for 10.1% of nail polish sales in 2015. A demand for long-lasting nail colours is predicted to fuel further growth in the near future. Meanwhile, the liquid polish market is set to grow at a yearly rate of 9.4% from 2016 to 2024, due to affordability and the vast range of colours available. Geographically, Europe remains one of the biggest markets, with Latin America pegged to drive growth in the nail industry over the coming years, due to the rising trend for long and polished nails and nail art among young women and increasing disposable income among consumers. A slew of recent high-profile collaborations between manicure brands and the fashion and entertainment world could also be contributing to the fact that nail products are hotter than ever. Earlier this month, designer Christian Siriano teamed up with manicure brand ImPress to create a limited edition press-on nail collection that comprises seven different designs, all inspired by the creative's luxury fashion pieces, while Emmy-nominated actress Laverne Cox launched a limited-edition collection of polishes back in September, in partnership with Orly Nails."
Men are changing their attitudes regarding beauty treatments,"Almost half (47%) of young men in the UK have enjoyed a spa, in-store or beauty salon treatment in the past 12 months, according to new research from market intelligence agency Mintel - a marked increase from 2015, when the number was just 33%. [1] The most popular treatments appear to be massages, which 18% of men aged 16-24 polled had partaken in, and facial hair removal or shaping, which also attracted 18% of participants. Meanwhile, 17% had visited the spa for body hair removal. The mental benefits of beauty and grooming treatments were cited as one of the main reasons behind the trend, with 76% of those who had visited a spa or salon over the last 12 months saying that it helped to promote their mental well-being. Sixty-four percent said that such appointments were an important part of their health routine. Overall, 36% of the men had booked their last appointment as a treat for themselves, while 20% did so for a special occasion and 19% said it was a regular grooming appointment. ""The high proportion of men showing engagement in spa and salon treatments highlights that consumers are moving away from gender stereotypes while embracing gender neutrality,"" said Roshida Khanom, Associate Director, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel, in a statement. The findings are in line with the general shift in attitudes regarding the topic of male beauty, and it isn't just in the UK that men are upping their grooming game. Back in August, the 'Dove Men+Care 2017 Men's Hair Census' found that men take their hair very seriously indeed, with eight out of 10 men in the US seeing their crowning glory as a reflection of their personal style, and as something that helps them look both masculine and professional. Brands are increasingly tapping into the trend for male self-care with multiple new product lines aimed at men, with Clinique's Sonic System Deep Cleansing Brush, brewery Carlsberg's shampoo, conditioner and body lotion trio, and Dove Men+Care's beauty bars just some of the high-profile launches that have helped drive the market over the last few years. Meanwhile, the news can only be a good thing for the beauty industry - UK consumers are estimated to spend £7.6 billion (approximately US $10.1 billion) on treatments in spa, salons and in-store treatment areas in 2017, surpassing £8 billion (approximately US $10.7 billion) by 2021."
Skyrocketing indie brands are reinventing the beauty market,"""In the digital era, make-up brands have been confronted with a paradigm shift,"" said Nicolas Cordier, CEO of Make Up For Ever in a speech at the inauguration of Strand Cosmetics Europe's new production site. ""These new brands have successfully established a more direct link with consumers, and the revolution continues with the rise of DTC Brands – such as Kylie Cosmetics - which sell directly and only to consumers."" Newly-launched brands, such as Kylie Cosmetics and Huda Beauty, gain momentum by recording triple-digit and quadruple-digit growth rates, confirms market research firm Kline in the recently published second edition of the Beauty's Most Buyable Brands: Analysis of Booming Independent Brands in the United States report. Indeed, Kylie Cosmetics is expected to make more than US$ 400 million in sales only through its website. Brands focusing on makeup, such as ColourPop, Gerard Cosmetics, and Dose of Colors, lead the rankings of social popularity due to the aesthetically-pleasing content they provide and their unique product offerings. However, indies make waves across various categories from natural concepts from Tata Harper and Coola Suncare, to male grooming provided by Brickell and Bevel, to gender-free makeup provided by Milk Makeup. ""Millennials and Generation Z are a crucial marketing demographic for the indies,"" comments Naira Aslanian, Project Manager at Kline. ""These innovators resonate with experimental consumers who are searching for the next best product or ingredient to bring out their individualism and uniqueness. With so many choices out there, the tech-savvy generations look for tutorials, tips, and reviews to help them make decisions about trends, brands, and even ingredients. Indies' digital prowess, combined with the fine-tuned focus from beauty products that cater to consumers' personalized needs, results in some of them growing three to five times the rate of the market."" To build close connections with their consumers, these brands utilize innovative and often low cost strategies. For instance, they transform their admirers into stars: Say Hello To Sexy Legs regularly reposts content from its fans who feature its products in photos. Some go as far as asking consumers to create products alongside the company, such as ColourPop, which virtually invites millions of fans into its lab as product development specialists to inspire the creation of new products. Several trend-setting retailers, including Sephora, Ulta, Bluemercury, Target, and Urban Outfitters, take notice of the heightened consumer interest and give these brands a louder voice and broader reach by bringing them to their shelves and websites. In 2016, a brand like Say Hello To Sexy Legs launched in the market and entered QVC and Sephora in the same year. According to Kline, these disruptors are expected to continue innovating with their products, packaging, and design, appealing to the generations that are open and receptive to new ideas and concepts. While they innovate, they are expected to remain the targets of growth-seeking beauty giants."
Aptar unveils the secrets of perfume routine in Brazil,"In Brazil, the relationship with perfume is influenced by the climate, among others. ""It is very hot in most regions, in particular in the North, and this has an impact on perfume conception. All Brazilians pay particular attention to the perception of being clean and fresh,"" explains Carla Amado. She describes an almost ancestral cultural behaviour inherited from the indigenous populations that would have a bath four or five times a day, and then adopted by the Portuguese. ""Today, people still have a bath or shower two to three times a day, mainly in the north-eastern part of the country. All across the country, it is cultural to be clean, fresh, and smell good despite the heat. It not only has an impact on the perfume market, but also on deodorants, soap, body milk, oils, shampoos…"" she explains. Given this climate, most Brazilians turn to fresh fragrances and light perfumes like eaux de toilette or Eaux de Cologne, which they regularly reapply throughout the day. ""It is in Brazil and the Middle East that the frequency of perfume application is the highest, compared to the rest of the world. For example, in France, people put on perfume once or twice a day on average, whereas in Brazil, they do it three to four times a day, at least,"" adds Sabine Bouillet-Lubot. Perfume application is very specific: it is always done with the hands. ""In the North-East, in particular, Brazilians put Eau de Cologne in their hands, and then they spread it on their bodies, necks, torsos, hair, and arms. No other culture involves applying perfume mainly with the hands,"" claims Carla Amado. In the Ritual Codex, this gesture is named Hakaressing. It corresponds to a succession of manly slaps on the body, the forearms, or the torso, in a regular, ritualized rhythm. ""This routine helps feel fresh, but it also stimulates self-confidence,"" reveals Carla Amado. In Brazil, perfume application starts as soon as early childhood, through manual contact. The mother usually shares her Eau de Cologne with her children and rubs their bodies with it. In the Codex, this gesture is called frescanizing: apply a fragrance by friction with vigour and freshness, with the hands, as an expression of tender loving when done onto someone else. Although this very cultural tradition is deeply anchored in the culture and still widespread, today, Brazilian consumers prefer sprays for their convenience and more even product distribution. As a result, Aptar's strategy consists in offering solutions adapted to everyone's practices. As regards Brazilian consumers, who like putting on perfume all over their bodies in quite a sensorial manner, Aptar suggests two complementary solutions: – The Essencia Colonia spray, a system screwed on the bottle so the user can remove it if they want to, in order to get back to the traditional gesture – The Precious spray, a ""longtime"" spray which covers the whole body with a mist effect and has the advantage of providing a more generous dose every time the valve is activated for an easier perfume application on the whole body, for those interested ""In the long run, the spray is likely to completely replace manual application. We can feel this need on the market, as we saw it on European markets before. We tested both solutions in Brazil, and they were both immediately successful, because they are perfectly adapted to the traditional gesture. So, we have come up with two answers, Essencia Colonia, an accessible product, and Precious, for a more premium market,"" explains Sabine Bouillet-Lubot. The second market change might come from the interest in the more concentrated perfumes developed by global brands, but also major local brands well-established on this segment. The gesture will be impacted and might evolve towards a more targeted and accurate application, like that described by Scentango in the Codex. Aptar already offers several solutions to this gesture."
Cosmoprof Asia 2017: Five key trends of the Asian beauty market,"Tradition and nature Sustainable, natural and organic beauty was a big trend at Cosmoprof Asia 2017 with a brand-new hall dedicated to Natural & Organic brands. Consumer demand for natural cosmetics is growing strongly in the Asia Pacific region. Many of the numerous Australian and New Zealand brands exhibiting at Cosmoprof Asia build on naturalness as a key factor of success, particularly in the baby care, sun care and skin care segments. Thai exhibitors are trying to play the same game.. In China, in a context of fast industrialization and urbanization, but also because of the succession of health scandals, the interest in natural products - which are perceived as healthier - is coupled with a certain nostalgia vis-à-vis ancestral wisdom thus benefiting to products claiming inspiration from the traditional Chinese medicine and / or pharmacopoeia. Let's also note that the development of hallal beauty products in the region is partially linked to the search for products perceived as more natural, haowever the weight of Muslim countries - such as Indonesia - also contributes to the development of this offer. Masks According to a recent Mintel research, Asia Pacific accounted for 76% of all global sheet mask launches in 2016, followed by Europe (16%) and the US (8%). The product is now a frequent feature in many consumers' skincare routine. At Cosmoprof Asia, beauty masks were everywhere and of every type (hydrogel, sheet mask, bio cellulose, fil patch). The Korean brand The Oozoo, for instance, showcased its new Fresh Capsule Masks, which keep the sensitive active ingredients in an airtight capsule protecting their integrity until consumer use. Beauty masks are available to address the need of any specific area of the face (nose, chin, cheeks, eyes, lips). The men's masks offering, especially from Korean brands, is also growing fastly. Prestige brands Their desire for ""flawless skin"" led Asian women to grow as the world's best ""self-educating"" consumers, believing in product efficacy and the importance of investing in skin care and beauty products. According to Euromonitor International, this resulted in the skin care routine expansion in the region, with the number of items reaching to as many as 10 and boosted the premium skin care segment. In China, this trend has largely benefited to prestige brands imported from Japan, Korea, France or the United States. The trend has been amplified by the importance of e-commerce which has facilitated the access to products. Urban pollution Since the beginning of the 2010s, the number of skincare products with anti-pollution claims has augmented constantly in Asia, where the trend emerged before spreading all around the world. ""Consumers are increasingly in search of healthier, happier and more balanced lives. They want antidotes to urban congestion and environmental pollution, and greener, more people-friendly cities,"" said Matthew Crabbe, Director of Research, Asia Pacific at Mintel. Men's competition The importance of the men's health care market is another eye-catcher when visiting a show such as Cosmoprof Asia. According to a recent survey by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, 63 per cent of Chinese male beauty consumers report using cleansing milk, lotion or face cream. Demographic data also show that the one-child policy combined with the preference of Chinese parents for boys has led to the birth of 25 to 30 million more men than women in the last 30 years. Many Chinese men will never get married! The consequence is an increased attention of men to their appearance. For other reasons (the length of military service delaying entry into the labour market) the same phenomenon is observed in Korea. The next edition of Cosmoprof Asia will take place from 13 to 15 November 2018 with Cosmopack Asia at AsiaWorld-Expo and from 14 to 16 November 2018 at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre."
"Nature, inclusivity, personality and customization set to drive the beauty industry next year","The importance of environmental issues, the interest of consumers in broader definitions of beauty - beyond age, gender, and body type - and their search for strong ethical behaviours, and customization opportunities opened by digital technologies, will be the major forces set to influence the beauty and personal care sector worldwide in 2018, according to Mintel. With evolving consumer demands and climatic changes around the world, the beauty and personal care industry's approach to natural and sustainable ingredients must adapt. According to Mintel, advances in biotechnologies will help brands to address these challenges. ""In the coming year, the possibilities for creating safe, allergen-free, pure, and efficacious ingredients through science could replace the harvesting of natural ingredients,"" stresses Sarah Jindal, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst, Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. The move to become more 'local' will also create opportunities. According to Mintel, local sourcing and production of ingredients will become essential in the years ahead. ""Brands will stop targeting consumers based on their age, gender, or body type as consumers increasingly demand personalized beauty defined on their terms,"" states Sarah Jindal. Perceptions of beauty based on age, gender, skin, hair, and body type are changing as today's consumers take control of how beauty is defined. ""In 2018 and beyond, beauty consumers will demand that their individual needs are answered with options or customizable beauty. Brands will embrace inclusivity and address individual beauty concerns which will result in more customization and personalization of products."" ""Simply selling a great beauty product will no longer be enough; brands must have personality and purpose that align with consumers' own beliefs in order to win them over,"" explains Sarah Jindal. The onus is now on brands to impress consumers with a human-like personality that's relatable, personable, and sincere. According to Mintel, in 2018 and beyond, educational projects, and environmental and ethical issues will be at the forefront. Digital technology will make shopping more personal in 2018. Beauty brands will be watching consumers' every move, as digital technology drives unprecedented customization of the shopping experience. ""Mintel predicts that the beauty and personal care market will experience a fundamental shift during 2018,"" concludes Sarah Jindal."
Asia Pacific drives the beauty sheet masks global market,"When considering which Asian market is the most innovative, according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD) most of these launches came from the North Asian region, with China accounting for 28% of all global sheet mask introductions, followed by Taiwan (12%), South Korea (10%), Hong Kong (7%) and Japan (6%). Meanwhile, data from Mintel Market Sizes (MMS) found that China and Japan are currently among the world's largest facial care markets, estimated to reach a retail market value of US$15.8 billion and US$13.5 billion respectively in 2017. Rounding out the top three facial care markets is South Korea, with a retail market value that is expected to hit US$6.6 billion in 2017. The product is now a frequent feature in many consumers' skincare routine. Three in four (75%) consumers in China use sleep masks in the evening; while 69% use sheet masks at the same time of day. Additionally, over half (53%) agree that facial masks are the best first-aid skincare products and three in five (59%) Chinese women aged 30-39 say they feel happy after using a sheet mask. Furthermore, two in five (40%) Thai women have used a face mask in the last 12 months. Despite growing popularity in Asia, it appears that European and American consumers are lagging behind in usage. Mintel research shows that just 12% of women in the UK have used a sheet or leave-on mask in the last 12 months [1]. Meanwhile, in the US, just 8% of consumers use facial masks as part of their evening routine and 29% use facial masks on an 'as-needed' basis. Furthermore, Mintel data shows that around one in 10 women in France (10%), Germany (10%) and Spain (8%) have used sheet masks in the last 12 months. However, it does seem that there is appetite for sheet mask innovation in the UK moving forward. Over a third (35%) of UK consumers aged 16-24 say they are using more skincare treatments, such as masks. ""The facial mask trend will continue to gain strength in the West, as it becomes part of a regular beauty routine for consumers,"" says Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. As to which benefits consumers are looking for in facial masks, hydration is key for consumers in China. Three in four (76%) Chinese women aged 20-49 who use facial masks say they look for the products to provide hydration, followed by 59% who look for whitening and 47% for pore refining. Meanwhile, among US consumers who have used facial masks and peels, the top four skin concerns users are looking to treat are acne or blemishes (29%), followed by signs of aging (27%), fine lines and wrinkles (27%), and pore size (27%). ""Consumers curate their own facial mask routines according to skin type, lifestyle and product offering. In the future, this will drive new product development with different positioning claims and ingredients will be chosen to match different facial mask formats which deliver maximum efficacy. Brands can look to include local ingredients to appeal to consumers who don't currently use facial masks, and can slowly introduce Asian ingredients that are increasingly of interest to consumers in the global market,"" Sharon concludes."
Kanebo decodes makeup habits of Millennial women,"The Japanese cosmetics maker tried to connect differences in lifestyles and environment with the differences in makeup habits among women in big Asian cities and in New York. ""With the emergence of the internet and social media, women all over the world have instant access to the same kinds of information. In spite of this ubiquity of information, there are still great differences in the ways women from different regions and countries use makeup,"" explains the Tokyo-based company. According to Kanebo, Japan and Korea are prominent examples. While sharing many features as geographic neighbours and a strong global influence in cosmetics, their ways of using makeup are very different. At work, for instance, women in Tokyo and Seoul tend to think of makeup as a duty rather than a matter of choice. Women from both cities spend more time on makeup than women from other cities, but they enjoy the experience less. In Tokyo, makeup is synonymous with social etiquette (a tool for blending smoothly into the group), while in Seoul it is seen as a way to conceal blemishes (a tool for winning out in a competitive social environment). As far as makeup at work is concerned, Kanebo's survey shows that dress codes are clearest in Beijing, Bangkok, and New York. In all three cities there are clear prescriptions on the use of makeup in the workplace. However, if companies in Seoul and Tokyo do not formulate specific dress codes it is also because women in these cities usually pay careful attention to their business outfits. However, the survey also found that women take pleasure in makeup in cities where dress codes are important. When dress codes are stricter, makeup at work also tends to be more strongly linked to self-confidence and a sense of professionalism. According to the survey, it is in Bangkok and Beijing that women make the most effort with their makeup when ""going to work,"" while women in Seoul do so when going out ""on a date."" Compared with other cities, women in Tokyo make the most effort with their makeup when ""going out with female friends."" Furthermore, it is in Seoul that women spend the most time on makeup and use the largest number of items. ""Women in Seoul clearly place great importance on personal growth and career advancement. In contrast, Tokyo women are only interested in career advancement when no trade-offs are required in their private lives. Women in New York believe in a work-life balance. Women in Bangkok are concerned mainly about earning a high income and tend to have highly positive attitudes towards work. Women in Taipei seek a sense of achievement and satisfaction in their work but are far less concerned about income than their peers in Bangkok,"" concludes Kanebo."
Skincare masks take the Asia-Pacific beauty market by storm,"At the in-cosmetic Asia tradeshow, which was held in Bangkok last month, global market intelligence company Euromonitor International revealed that the Asia Pacific (APAC) beauty market has achieved a 6% growth rate over the past years (Compound Annual Growth Rate - CAGR) and 51% of global sales come from the region. While face moisturisers continue to command the biggest share of the Asian beauty products market, with a value of almost US$19bn, face masks have been the source of much of the growth, achieving CAGR of over 13% (2012-2017) - accounting for US$5bn of sales. In Asia, mass skincare grew at 6% CAGR over the same time period, eroding the premium skincare category's market share. ""South Korean brands, such as The Face Shop, Etude House and Innisfree, fuelled the mass cosmetics boom by fulfilling Asian consumers' need for self-indulgence and affordability through creative brand storytelling, eye-catching packaging, diverse product ranges and low-price points,"" said Sunny Um, Beauty & Fashion Analyst at Euromonitor International. However, contrary to this trend, in China, demand for mass products has been less than that of premium, despite mass skincare generating value sales 250% larger than premium skincare. Touching on the rapid growth of the colour cosmetics segment, Euromonitor revealed that Asia is also leading the global market with a value of US$15bn last year. In the APAC region, foundations and concealers are the largest category in the segment, with a worth of almost US$5bn, but BB and CC achieved a CAGR of 25% (2011-2016) despite modest sales of US$1bn - showing the huge potential in this area. The global market intelligence company also unveiled a number of growing trends from 'genderless' beauty. Across Asia, more men experiment with products that have traditionally been used exclusively by females, while there is a growing number of consumers looking to 'personalise' products to their individual tastes. Eventually, in the context of an ageing population in Asia, in particular in Japan, South Korea and China, Euromonitor also shared insights into the use of cosmetics by the over-50s global population. It noted that half of women aged over 60 used foundation at least once a week, while 59% of the same demographic used lipstick and 52% wore eye make-up to the same frequency."
COSME Tokyo 2018 is taking on a new dimension within Beauty & Health Week Tokyo,"As on previous years, COSME Tokyo will be held conjointly with COSME Tech, the trade show dedicated to the cosmetics industry supply chain, including ingredients, contract manufacturing / private label, containers / packaging, tools / accessories and all other products and services required for the development of cosmetic products. New in 2018, the two shows will be held together with INNER BEAUTY Tokyo 2018, an event focused on beauty and health foods, and the first edition of Health & Beauty Goods Expo, which will focus on beauty care goods, to form the Beauty & Health Week Tokyo 2018. Based on the foundation that COSME Tokyo and COSME Tech have been setting up over years, those four jointly held shows will cover not only cosmetics but the whole beauty industry with the aim to attract a wider range of visitors. ""Thanks to the synergy between these different events, COSME Tokyo 2018 will be much larger and more international. Visitors of the Beauty & Health Week Tokyo 2018 will have the possibility to get information about all aspects of the beauty industry at once. This will be the most attractive venue for those who are looking for beauty products from Japan and Asia,"" explain the show organizers. One of the most attractive feature of the show is its impressive line-up of Japanese cosmetic brands. Most Japanese cosmetics to be exhibited at COSME Tokyo 2018 cannot be found at any other exhibitions in the world. It is therefore a unique occasion to find new innovative and high quality brands, concepts and technologies. ""Generally, Japanese cosmetics are popular around the world for their high quality, their reliability, cost performance, etc. However, there are much more products which are yet to be known outside Japan, especially products made by small-and-medium sized manufacturers. As the number of exhibitors including small-and-medium sized companies will increase from the last edition, COSME Tokyo 2018 is the must-visit exhibition for international visitors looking for high quality Japanese cosmetics,"" conclude the organizers."
French presence reinforced at Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Asia 2017,"Why does the French Pavilion grow every year? Caroline Escudier - Thanks to the high vitality and diversity that characterise the French cosmetics industry, we will be present at two exhibitions this year. The French cosmetics industry is stimulated by perpetual changes, as even the newest companies are ready to meet the demands of the Asian market. The Pavilion France at Cosmoprof Asia welcomes 27 new exhibitors which make up more than a third of the delegation. Some regular exhibitors have even enlarged their exhibition area. In a niche market, where products are ultra-segmented and of very high quality, French companies possess a high-end know-how expertise that covers the whole production process: from ingredient to the finished products, through the private label, hair products, spa and packaging services dedicated to cosmetics. Therefore, a block of 7 French companies will be established for the first time, on a space of 112 m2 at Cosmopack Asia 2017. The French Cosmetics Awards will be in its 3rd consecutive year in 2017. Has it been a success? Caroline Escudier - It has been, thanks to the team effort! We are lucky to be supported by highly motivated sponsors: La Boutique France (La Poste), Hengcheng, PinGuan and our media partners. This year, the French Cosmetics Awards will be awarded by a jury of Chinese professionals. Three French brands among the 14 finalists will be rewarded for their innovation and creativity adapted to the Chinese market. Thanks to the support of our French sponsor La Boutique France (La Poste), one of the three winning brands will benefit from a six-month online release of its product on ""La Boutique France"", an e-boutique reserved for French brands at the three largest Chinese B2C cross-border market places: Tmall Global, JD worldwide and Kaola. This award is very much supported by the press and the bloggers. Over the past two years (2015-2016), we have seen more than 70 publications in professional magazines and fashion and lifestyle magazines, nearly 300,000 views on YouTube, and not to mention success on social networks (over 500,000 views on the Facebook and Instagram posts). Beyond the prize-winners, this wide range media coverage benefits all exhibitors in the Pavilion, who are in great demand due to the resurgence of visitors on their stands. Do you also rely on the support of your regional partners? Caroline Escudier - As a longtime leader in the cosmetics sector, France has about 1,000 leading companies. Present in more than 200 countries, they represent a quarter of the world market for exports. If Made in France is a guarantee of quality and reliability, this success deserves to deploy energy throughout the French territory. Local and specialised organisations add up to the nation effort: BCI supports 10 Breton companies, Cosmed and Dev'up / Cosmetic Valley supports 8 companies each. Their support is essential to help Business France detect the rising stars for the French Buzz space. A showcase of the dynamism of the research and the creativity of the sector, 11 entities exhibit not only their latest technological innovations but also their creativity in terms of concepts, textures, images, targets, bottling, etc. They rely on the subtle alliance between traditional beauty rituals, the choice of local natural resources for their ingredients and a very high research expertise. The Pavillon France, sponsored by Air France, Accor and La boutique France (La Poste / Colissimo) is deployed on the two exhibition sites: – Cosmopack Asia, 14-16 November 2017 at AsiaWorld Expo (Hall 6G) – Cosmoprof Asia, 15-17 November 2017 at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (Halls 1F & 3E). The 7 exhibitors of Cosmopack are: ABC Texture, Coverpla, Distimex, Laboratoire Rosier Davenne, Lessonia, PB Group et Technature."
"U.K.: Health & beauty to drive Christmas retail sales, says GlobalData","Non-food retailers will continue to struggle this Christmas with sales expected to show year-on-year growth of only 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Volumes are forecast to fall by 0.1% as price rises, which came into play as result of the weakened pound, will discourage cash strapped consumers from shopping over the seasonal period. According to GlobalData, weak sales in early Q4 may entice more retailers to take part in Black Friday this year, although this runs the risk of bringing forward sales that would have otherwise been made at full price. The market research firm forecasts volumes to decrease by 0.6% on Q4 2017 compared to Q4 2017 in the clothing & footwear sector, as well as for furniture. While food & grocery remain more resilient than discretionary spend sectors, inflation has helped discounters to increase their reach ever further over the past year. In contrast, the health & beauty market will be the strongest performing sector in Q4, with spend up 3.4% and volume growth positive - despite easing marginally on last year. Fragrance and make-up new releases such as Chanel Gabrielle perfume and Fenty and Victoria Beckham x Estée Lauder cosmetics ranges will fuel gifting spend, as will innovation-led skincare items which tap into the 'clean' trend and wellness revolution. Department stores face increased competition this year from ASOS and the online beauty pureplays which are incredibly fierce on price and fulfilment. Actually, online pure-players such as ASOS and Amazon are set to be the winners this Christmas, drawing consumers online with their vast product offer alongside market leading, fast and low cost delivery propositions. ""The online channel will continue to outperform physical sales growth,"" says GlobalData. ""The increased availability of delivery saver schemes this year, alongside express delivery options being widely accessible, will encourage shoppers to leave online purchases later, having the confidence to purchase right up until the last few days before Christmas,"" the firm concludes."
"The male grooming market is undergoing a dramatic change, sees Kline","""The taboos are slowly dropping, and a growing number of men are using anti-aging serums and masks, beauty devices, and even makeup,"" says Naira Aslanian, the report's manager. ""While makeup for men is a trend now and brands such as Covergirl and Maybelline are debuting their first male ambassadors, it is categories like skin care and personal cleansing that see the most innovation and progression. Traditional male-oriented categories, such as deodorants and antiperspirants, also post strong gains driven by innovations like anti-mark antiperspirant technology."" In addition, the increased purchasing power of millennial men, who follow trends set by look-conscious celebrities, take the notion of self-care to a different level. The desire to associate themselves with a lifestyle synonymous with success and well-being turns male consumers to barbershops and male-centric salons offering personalized services and pampering. ""Men are moving to specialized, often luxury barbershops, not only because they are increasingly accepting the notion of pampering, but they also see the immediate results when their surroundings take a notice of a change. In this newly accepted environment men are groomed to put their best face forward and be trendy,"" comments Agnieszka Saintemarie, Industry Manager for Kline's recently published Barbershops: Global Market Brief. Beard-wearing trends are also fuelling the barbershop market with, for example, over 60% of Italians wearing a beard these days. This is among the reasons why the barbershops markets in Europe and the United States grow at over 10%. The robust growth within the professional hair care segment for men, however, did not offset the decline of the overall haircare category caused by lack of innovation and competition from unisex products. Shaving products, the second fastest growing category after skin care with over 6% growth, is driven by direct selling brands, such as Bevel, Harry's, and Dollar Shave Club, which have recorded phenomenal, triple-digit growth rates, paving the way for a new category of subscription box providers. Direct sales, along with specialty stores, are the most vibrant retail channels for cosmetics and toiletries for men. The convenience of online shopping and sampling through subscription boxes fuels the rise of the direct sales channel. Besides digital advertising, smaller, niche brands find an audience for their products by posting videos on YouTube, many of which often go viral. Large companies lead the market, with Unilever being the undisputed number one through brands like Dove Men+Care, Axe, and Degree and placing an even stronger foot in the male grooming market through the acquisition of the market innovator Dollar Shave Club. However, finds Kline, a number of new, smaller, indie brands, such as Brickell, Bevel, and Anthony, are popping up, making this market truly innovative. According to Kline, the increased acceptance of personal care and spending on it is anticipated to offer more business opportunities in this booming segment. A number of the new players that have entered the category will gain increasing shelf space at stores and salons alike. Brands will continue to explore new product categories, shifting to offerings of technologies men are becoming familiar with. Note that Kline will hold a webinar on November 7 to take an A to Z look into the male grooming boom: register here."
Western beauty brands successfully use ecommerce to sell to China,"With a total sales value estimated to USD 800 billion in 2017, China's ecommerce market is the world's number one. ""China is one of the most lucrative markets for global consumer brands to tap, but it's also one of the toughest. With more internet users than any other country, China is the world's largest and fastest-growing ecommerce market – driven by the rapid pace of mobile adoption,"" says Angela Liu, director of strategy & insight for China, at Profitero, one of the world's leading ecommerce analytics companies. ""Huge opportunities await brands prepared to win over Chinese consumers, adapt to local market nuances, and put strategies in place which effectively adjust to a dynamic - and mobile-centric - ecommerce environment,"" she adds. E-commerce is therefore an effective way to gain market share in China. But it is a very concentrated sector, dominated by two major platforms: Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com. Together, these e-tailers capture 83% of China's ecommerce sales. Strict rules and regulations in place on Tmall and JD are intended to prevent fraud and fake product distribution. As a consequence, both platforms enjoy a high level of confidence from Chinese consumers bruised by the experience by bad experiences with fake products bought on the sites that pioneered the ecommerce sector in the country. Furthermore, according to Profitero, consumer-generated ratings and reviews carry extraordinary weight in China and have become an integral part of purchase decisions and about 80% of Chinese shoppers leave reviews online. ""For brand marketers, this high level of ratings and review activity, and the importance of sentiment analysis over star ratings, is all the more critical when doing business in China,"" explains Profitero in a white paper ""China Mobile Commerce - How to Expand Reach and Effectiveness in the World's Biggest eCommerce Market"". With its particularities compared to Europe and North America, the Chinese ecommerce is a real challenge for western brands, however, many of them are successfully competing with local and Asian brands. This is particularly true in the make-up remover category, where products from French brand Bioderma and US brand Maybelline account for three of the top four best-selling products on China's biggest online retail site Tmall. However, in the toothpaste category, only one western brand - Colgate - has a product among the five best-sellers. This success often involves an ultra-personalized purchasing experience the principle of which is pushed to the extreme in China. ""Basically, every single eCommerce interaction is effectively personalized for individual consumers with content that is relevant and resonates with them based on past experiences and through the use of cookies,"" highlights Profitero."
"""Cosmetics companies need data and multi-channel strategies to win the race,"" Amaury Martin, Emarsys","Premium Beauty News - How can you define your business and the nature of the solutions you offer? Amaury Martin - Emarsys is an Austrian company that has established itself as a pioneer in Machine Learning and the application of artificial intelligence to digital marketing (AIM – Artificial Intelligence Marketing), also called marketing cloud. Based on the customer data we collect and centralize, our software calculates aggregates according to which the platform itself decides to launch marketing actions: the best incentive, depending on the customer status, the best time to send emails, text messages, push notifications on applications… For companies, the information collection points are either physical (stores), or digital (websites or applications), or they can even use the phone. Premium Beauty News - Why is the omnichannel strategy so crucial? Amaury Martin - Buyer behaviours are changing. Consumers and companies used to work in silos: stores and websites were separate, and sometimes you could even ask your network of friends for some advice. Today, with smartphones and constant connectivity, mobile applications, comparative websites, etc., people are much more cross-channel-oriented: they ask their friends what they think, they compare what their friends say with what they find online, and they buy products in stores because they want to test them. They have ""un-siloted"" the way they act, buy, compare, and interact with brands. And yet, many brands are still structured in silos, which means they have store managers/network managers with their own way to solve problems, web managers and social media, and customer service managers. Most often, they do not get all customer information and feedback, because they can only focus on their own work or field. For example, only the web manager will hear about a dissatisfied customer who chose Facebook to express himself. Companies are still very compartmentalized, while customers have changed: they expect a unified experience, whatever the channel they use to interact with the brand. Premium Beauty News - Technologically speaking, it seems easier to grab information on digital channels than in stores: how can you optimize fluidity between the various channels? Amaury Martin - It is definitely easier to collect digital information. Online, you always leave a trace, which is not always true in a store. At a point of sale, there are two ways to collect information: either on the cash register software, through the loyalty card – that is what happens in 90% cases – or via the shop assistant, on a tablet or smartphone. Of course, it is more difficult when there is a distributor in-between. Be it as it may, globalized companies like L'Oréal have been adapting to the customer knowledge trend and are becoming Customer-Centric, as they collect navigational or declarative data. Asia is a good incubator: its population comprises 50% young people under 20, digital adoption is very strong, and consumers are prone to provide personal data. Premium Beauty News - Once you have collected the data, what are the aggregates that determine the marketing action? Amaury Martin - Engagement is taken into account. When someone opens and clicks on such or such e-mail, then we send them an e-mail. And if they have also downloaded the app, then we provide e-mails and push notifications, etc. The idea is to simplify Marketers' lives as much as possible. We let the machine calculate the aggregates on a large scale (left brain), and the Marketer makes a decision about the content and strategy (right brain). The combination of the two makes it possible for the platform to interact depending on the customer's engagement and decide which channel is best to contact them. We can even go farther if we record the history in a database. The machine can choose the most timely day and time to send the message, depending on the individual, i.e. the time when, statistically, we will have the best opening rate. That is called send time optimization. Among our French customers, we have already achieved an opening rate 3% to 15% higher than with a standard campaign! Lastly, it is the platform that decides which offer is the best (incentive recommendation). Among a whole range of offers of 10, 15, or 0 euros, or a free delivery, the platform itself decides what it needs to transform the message into a purchase, according to customer engagement. We have realized it tends to spend 20% to 30% less than a human being. Premium Beauty News - Has the cosmetics industry made any progress on this new relationship with customers? Amaury Martin - The cosmetics industry is starting to understand that you win the race with declarative and transactional customer data more than with the product. A few companies have started to adapt, others still have quite outdated a vision, due to their disconnection with final customers because of the filter of distributors. There is a reconnection digital change coming, but everyone is not moving at the same pace. The machine is running."
Cosmetic 360 focuses on digital innovation,"The third edition of the Cosmetic 360 trade show hosted 200 exhibitors and welcomed about 4,400 visitors (an 11% increase compared to last year). Organized by the Cosmetic Valley - the French Competitiveness Cluster dedicated to the cosmetics sector, which concentrates 800 companies and extends over an area covering the metropolitan and suburban areas of Tours, Rouen, Orleans, Chartres and Versailles - this event aims to ""promote the innovative players from the beauty sector."" An 800 m2 area was entirely dedicated to some 30 beauty start-ups such as Aryballe Technology (which showcased an electronic odour identification device), Oxiproteomics (presenting a technique to determine the skin's aging from protein oxidation), Zéo (a 100% natural absorbent powder that provides ultra-fast hair drying and winner of the Cosmetic Victories 2017 competition), Exhalia (an interactive fragrance bar), Saralon GmbH (electronic packaging inks), Waw (a mobile app for delving into cosmetics bags around the world). This area was conceived as a full business incubation area, where entrepreneurs had a chance to present their projects to a committee of experts including Business Angels and banks. As in previous years, Cosmetic 360 also offered a series of meetings dedicated to Open Innovation. For the third edition, some 150 appointments were scheduled between project leaders from around twenty countries, selected from the 253 start-ups, and five leading multinationals: Chanel, Johnson & Johnson, L'Oréal, LVMH Research, Shiseido. Another highlight of the show was the debut edition of the Hackaton C360. The event gathered 50 international students - including marketers, designers, programmers, creators, developers, engineers and designers - from 22 French schools (Mines, Chimie Paris Tech, ENSTA Paris Tech, ISIPCA, Telecom Paris Tech, Neoma Business School, International Fashion Academy, etc.), grouped into seven teams, to brainstorm on the theme Reveal Your Perception, with the support of LVMH teams. The U Scent concept (""How to test and choose the right fragrance online?"") won the competition over the various projects presented (perfume samples available in Uber cars, use of Big Data, skin tone photo-measurements, personal assistant to help with the choice of cosmetics, beauty routine tutorials, etc.). In the wake of this test edition, the Cosmetic Valley intends the Hackathon C360 to transform into an annual and bigger and more ambitious event within the Cosmetic 360 show. ""Innovation is the hallmark of the Cosmetic Valley. The actions the cluster has been conducting for 20 years to multiply industrial and collaborative research projects, to pool resources, have made the sector stronger, more enterprising and more visible. However, they would not have any future if the cluster would not be able to foster the agility and capacity of its members to face competition and to remain disruptive within a changing world and the context of the digital revolution,"" said Marc-Antoine Jamet, President of the Cosmetic Valley."
Make-up: The MakeUp In shows are stating their ambitions for 2018,"Premium Beauty News - Looking at it, 2017 was a particularly flattering year for you! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Indeed, who would have imagined, eight years earlier, such a track record! The success is a quantitative one first. During the year 2017 alone, MakeUp In trade shows welcomed a total of nearly 400 exhibitors and almost 10 000 visitors. And this, only in the make-up category... The concept is now well established. There was a real need on the side of exhibitors and visitors. But on the other hand it is also and above all qualitative: more than half of visitors attend conferences, one third of exhibitors submit innovations at each edition, more than 50% of them attend at least three out of four MakeUp In events, - and some of them and not the least, even exhibit at each edition whatever the location in the world. Premium Beauty News - Have market developments helped you? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Unquestionably the concept emerged at the right time and events were favourable! The make-up sector has never been so dynamic across the world. Nor have subcontractors in the sector been so much called upon. And never before has the entire industrial chain experienced so many rapid changes with newcomers, market launches and so many different requests coming from everywhere. MakeUp In trade shows have indeed become unavoidable appointments for the whole industry. Premium Beauty News - 2017 was also marked by your integration in the InfoPro Digital Group, who is also the organizer of the Luxe Pack exhibition... Sandra Maguarian - You already gave us the opportunity to express ourselves here a few weeks ago. There are real synergies between the two Companies and in some parts of the world, we bring them to being with new events: a new Luxe Pack Los Angeles, which will be held concomitantly to MakeUp in Los Angeles and a new MakeUp in Shanghai at the same time as Luxe Pack Shanghai. The first event of the series in Los Angeles, which already looks extremely promising will be the first one set up by the two Companies. It will welcome some 150 exhibitors in total. Furthermore, we are delighted to have in our team since September, Irene Yanhua Gu, Asia Sales Manager and Adriana Rodriguez who joined us as Commercial Director and who will be in charge of the commercial development of MakeUp In events in the world alongside Jean- Yves Bourgeois. Adriana, of Mexican origin, has a long international professional experience in many different areas. Premium Beauty News - What are your prospects for 2018? Sandra Maguarian - We're still on an upward trend. MakeUp in Seoul and the first edition of MakeUp in Shanghai will be held next April and will undoubtedly stand as leading events in the make-up and skincare sector in Asia. As for MakeUp in Paris, in June, and MakeUp in New York, in September, it will certainly be a full house for both. Premium Beauty News - Other projects? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Of course, we are already working on them..."
"European and North American consumers in search for transparency and trust, Mintel unveils","Trust and transparency appear in the top 4 trends that are set to impact consumer markets in North America and Europe in 2018, according to Mintel. There is in fact a general lack of confidence between consumers and many governmental or private organizations. Generally speaking, distrust in governments and media is spreading to companies and brands, Mintel points out. According to the market research firm, only 18% of American consumers agree that ""most Americans share my values,"" and just 5% of Canadians say they trust the news stories they read on social media sites. As far as European are concerned, Mintel reveals that ""just 25% of those who have used a device to access national newspapers online say that the content on these websites is trustworthy."" In such a context, many consumers - especially at the younger end of the spectrum - expect companies to take a more proactive, high-tech approach when it comes to increasing transparency. For instance, one in five 20-24-yearold Brits would like online retailers to have videos showing how clothes and shoes are made. In an effort to increase transparency SC Johnson recently announced that it will list the presence of 368 potential skin allergens that may occur in its products. As consumers reprioritize who and what they believe in, companies will have to take a stand, speak out and prove that they're trustworthy. ""Today, trust has become one of the strongest drivers in how consumers choose products, services, and which organizations and politicians to support"", explains Carli Gernot, Manager of Trends, North America at Mintel. In the coming years, brands will have to court consumers with transparency, honesty and facts and, at the same time, they will need to find new ways to prove their positions. ""Product innovation that meets the changing needs of apprehensive consumers can build or redeem trust, including adding more information to packaging or incorporating livestreams of production methods,"" adds Carli Gernot. As greater transparency will become standard, companies must be ready to provide consumers with quantified and qualified facts, whether this is related to manufacturing processes or how efficacious a product is. ""In terms of marketing, there will be a push for greater authenticity,"" says Mintel. ""Consumers are set to see behind-the-scenes revealed through creative campaigns that put employees to the fore and capitalise on their years of expertise."" ""With consumers more able to question and query the actions of brands, radical transparency will be the watchword for 2018 as they try and show they can be relied upon as trustworthy,"" concludes Catherine Cottney, Manager of Trends at Mintel. While consumers of both sides of the Atlantic share this common concern for transparency, other areas of interest vary widely. As far as North America is concerned, Mintel unveils the following four key trends: 1. Trust Funding. In a post-truth world, consumers are putting their dollars where their trust remains intact. 2. The Value Equation. Budget-minded consumers are weighing a variety of value factors for each purchase decision, and brands are making these individuals a priority. 3. Health Yourself. In an uncertain and seemingly unstable world, self-care and preventative health are becoming essential for consumers across demographics. 4. Life in Sinc. Voices & Visuals. As the line between online and offline blurs, smart systems are delivering seamless convenience - with voice control and image recognition at the helm. And for Europe: 1. Sea Change. Ocean plastic fashion and recycled packaging launches, ingredient bans and activism are focusing consumer and government attention on maritime conservation. 2. Shareholders. Hacks and data disclosure legislation form a new breed of consumers who will hold on tight to their data and demand something in return before sharing it. 3. Teenaiders. Teens are increasingly defined by anxieties around image, health and work, and are looking for brands to alleviate the pressure and help them build both their confidence and prospects. 4. Accountants. In a world of post-truth politics and unsubstantiated media, consumers are looking for brands to court them with transparency, simplicity and evidence."
Sales of natural & organic cosmetics continue to grow in Germany,"According to Elfriede Dambacher (Naturkosmetik Konzepte), industry expert and program chairwoman, ""natural and organic cosmetics have brought a breath of fresh air to the saturated cosmetics market, doubling the market volume over the last decade."" With a market share of 8.5% (16.5% including nature inspired cosmetics) and a value of 1.150 billion euros in 2016, the natural and organic cosmetics market in Germany has become the strongest market in Europe. Today, approximately 9 million consumers purchase natural and organic cosmetics several times a year, revealed Elfriede Dambacher during the conference. Furthermore, demand continues to be strong and sales grew by approximately 2% during the first six months of 2017. However, the conference was also looking at the future with the aim to address challenges of the future. ""To meet the challenges of the future, we need to look beyond our current vantage point and take the major societal changes into consideration. They are affecting the entire market and changing not only the purchasing behaviour,"" stated Elfriede Dambacher added. ""There are two forces that the industry needs to stand up to: the global increase of demand and digitalization,"" she added. In its keynote presentation, futurologist and theologian Michael Carl, from 2b AHEAD ThinkTank GmbH, focused on the core topic of digitalization with a thought-provoking presentation. He impressively depicted the power of digitalization and its effects: throughout all industries, digitalization is putting production processes, supply chains and communication on a new foundation, creating a shift in the balance of power and changing every aspect of the customers´ living environment. The expert called for more communication and to start talking to people. His recommendation to the industry: individuality instead of standards, being open-minded, integrate new forms of communication, flexibility, courage, credibility, identity, responsibility, and a positive outlook on the future. Keynote speaker Dr. Kay Hafner (Hafner & Cie.) provided insights on the topic of digital change from the corporate perspective, casting a critical glance at brand policies. According to his experience, many brands underestimate the gradual process of digital change. His message: digital change is a cultural change. Companies have to be committed to implement digitalization throughout all corporate processes. For Dr. Hafner, this also includes a distinct focus on customer needs. The conference also featured an informative presentation on Packaging Trends as well as two internationally oriented panels Booming Markets in Asia and From Fairtrade to Realtrade. As far as Asia is concerned, experts provided insights onto the development of natural and organic cosmetics in Japan, China and South Korea. After Europe, the Asia-Pacific region is the second largest market for personal care products with consumer preferences gradually shifting towards more natural and organic products."
"Europe needs to step it up on anti-pollution beauty, Mintel says","As far as air pollution is concerned, the situation in European urban areas may be better than in big Asian cities. However, air pollution is a public health concern here too and public campaigns about the dangers of pollution are clearly having an effect on consumer awareness. According to Mintel, ""only 4-7% of consumers in France, Germany and Italy believe pollution is not an issue in their country"". Despite the high level of concern, anti-pollution new product development (NPD) in Europe's beauty and personal care market is stagnating, Mintel finds. Data from Mintel Global New Products Database show that anti-pollution products accounted for 1.3% of European beauty and personal care launches in both 2015 and 2016, and fell slightly to 1.2% of launches in January-May 2017. In contrast, Asia Pacific saw anti-pollution launches grow from 1.2% in 2015 to 1.7% in 2016; in North America, the share rose from 1.3% to 1.4% over the same period. This situation may be linked to a lack of credibility of the benefits of anti-pollution in cosmetic products. ""A third of German consumers say anti-pollution skincare products are of no use, and a quarter of French consumers don't believe anti-pollution haircare has any validity,"" points Mintel. However, new data are now available, as testing agencies have worked on protocols that can evaluate anti-pollution protection. According to Vivienne Rudd, beauty brands now have valuable scientific tools to convince sceptical consumers. Another useful innovation would be to move towards an on-pack anti-pollution index mimicking SPF ratings. ""Beauty brands need to step up their launch activity, creating targeted formulations backed with compelling and meaningful marketing,"" explains Vivienne Rudd. While Mintel also sees potential growth in the anti-pollution haircare category, the market research firm notes that only few brands have created an anti-pollution haircare regimen. ""Although NPD and category share doubled in Europe in 2016, anti-pollution products still represented just 1.1% of total haircare launches,"" Vivienne Rudd writes. Brands that launched anti-pollution haircare innovations includes Aveda, with the Pramasana range, Shu Uemura, with the Urban Moisture shampoo, conditioner, treatment and serum and Shea Moisture, one of the very few to add a styling component. With the development of beauty products designed to combat pollution, there have been accusations that beauty brands are merely seeking to profit from pollution rather than help alleviate it. According to Vivienne Rudd, this creates ""an opportunity for beauty brands to step up and take action"" in this area. Recent initiatives from Shiseido or The Body Shop in order to emphasises their actions to reduce or eliminate emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants thus contribute to change the image of the industry. Mintel will present latest trends and product innovations related to environmental stress on the ""Trend Zone"" at the Cosmetic 360 trade show.

Social networks: can we do without them?,"Premium Beauty News - Why are social networks a key lever for the BtoB sector today? Séverine Boutry - It is true that recent figures on the staggering growth of Internet traffic are quite enough to make the head of B2B players spin. In one minute in the world, Google processes over 3.5 million search queries; Facebook records 900,000 connections; Youtube broadcasts 4.1 million videos; Twitter 452,000 tweets and SnapChat 1.8 million new images! And when companies are not trying to reach their end consumer, but instead their corporate clients, journalists, distributors, trend firms... they are also all very active on all networks. Not using social networks would be like putting a black curtain on its shop window! When you look at it, the web has offered a mouthpiece to everyone, and it's a shame not to care for its ""owned-media"" and its ""shared-media"" represented by one's website, newsletters and social networks. It is the image and reputation of the company that can benefit from it in the medium term, and even in the short term, ROI can be immediate: a press article triggered by a properly devised tweet, a new distributor contacted via LinkedIn, a partner won over by an event pushed on Instagram... Premium Beauty News - So, for example, what is your assessment of the recent MakeUp in New York trade show? Séverine Boutry - For MakeUp in New York, we chose to work on the four traditional networks (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram) and to stick to the timetable of newsletters sent by the show organisers. Upstream, the recruitment of visitors was pushed on LinkedIn and Twitter, with excellent reach on LinkedIn in particular. During the show, Twitter and Instagram were used for their very ""hot now"" side, which enabled to put forward exhibitors, teams, partners... and after the show had closed its doors, we continued to send thanks and review the outcome, to prepare MakeUp in Los Angeles next February! Twitter is the key to touch reporters, LinkedIn is perfect to maintain ties with clients and nurture the hiring brand and Instagram to touch the beauty sphere, while Facebook, by nature, is more BtoC but so powerful... Overall, results are real: on Twitter more than 29,000 impressions, with + 113% on profile visitors and + 280% on mentions, on LinkedIn more than 15,000 impressions for the period, on Instagram + 36% subscribers and on Facebook the scope of publications increased by 29% and commitments by 110%... I believe the show achieved its goals, a success ""in real life"" and on social networks too! Premium Beauty News - What would be you recommendations for BtoB brands wanting to stand out on social networks? Séverine Boutry - The first basic rule is to be true and generous! Because on social networks, you must give to receive. Don't hesitate to follow and congratulate your competitors, and avoid inflating your figures by ""buying"" fans and likes. It's better to be followed by a small community of true fans, instead of robots in Thailand! Then find your narrative territory and don't only talk about yourself, it's like during a first date, if you only talk about yourself at the first diner, there will not be others! And finally, our philosophy for each product content is the ""3 S"" for Surprise, Service, Social. Indeed, you must be able to surprise to catch attention, be helpful by being pedagogical, funny or useful, and finally stimulate the desire to share to push virality... and – Google recently announced it–, without forgetting to propose a responsive and pleasant website on mobiles, because mobile search has now exceeded in France computer searches..."
Latin America: Sales of men's grooming to grow by 27 percent by 2021,"According to the report, men's grooming will grow the fastest in emerging regions. Latin America, in particular, will become a key market for men's beauty. Valued at USD 10 billion in 2016 and forecasted to grow over 27 percent until 2021, Latin America will lead men's grooming sales growth in the world. Men's Grooming: Growth Rate per Region (2016-2021) – Latin America: +27,4 percent – Asia Pacific: +20,5 percent – Middle East and Africa: +19,4 percent – North America: +9,9 percent – Eastern Europe: 9,7 percent – Western Europe: 5,1 percent – Australasia: 4,4 percent Source: Euromonitor International Note: Data refers to retail value and is expressed in USD million, fixed 2016 exchange rate, constant 2016 prices. ""Men's grooming has presented sustained growth in Latin America, positioned as the second fastest growing segment between 2011 and 2016. Holding a 'men's zone' in stores has shown to be a successful strategy as it provides men a place to go for all their beauty needs. Previously, men had to sort through shelves full of products targeting women in order to find products tailored to them,"" said Elton Morimitsu, Senior Research Analyst at Euromonitor. According to the report, while men's grooming sales are still highly dominated by the most traditional categories, such as fragrances, deodorants, and shaving products, which together accounts for 96 percent of total men's grooming sales, Latin American men are slowly increasing their consumption of esthetics products. ""The regional challenge lies on breaking stereotypes. Skin care, for example, is still very much associated with femininity. For this reason, men's skin care launches are now exploring claims that focus on the product's features, such as sunscreen or post shave. The objective is to gradually get men to experiment with multifunctional products as a first step to explore their vanity,"" concludes Morimitsu.

"""Still too little R&D for dark skins,"" Aïmara Coupet","Premium Beauty News - Why does the makeup offering still not correspond to what women expect? Aïmara Coupet - Actually, it should be said that there is a will to open to everyone today. The market has changed a lot as regards coloured skins, compared to about twenty years ago. There are more shades available. But if you really want to meet mixed to dark skins' makeup needs, you need to go much farther and try and innovate, rather than just add a few shades. That is not enough. Generally speaking, there is very little Research & Development going on for these skin types, although they are very specific and different from Caucasian skins. They are still little-known. For example, there are very few documented actives available for phototypes 5 or 6. Besides, if you take a look at the skincare market segmentation, half is dedicated to anti-wrinkle products, which definitely does not correspond to a dark skin need. Premium Beauty News - What are dark skins' specificities? Aïmara Coupet - There are several, but the main specificities are hyperpigmentation and dyschromia, i.e. a more or less pigmented skin depending on the face or body area. There is a lack of evenness, as certain areas are very dark, others lighter. There are also differences in how they heal - the process usually leaves spots. Lastly, they tend to be combination to oily skins, which does not mean they are not dehydrated, quite the contrary. The unbalance between sebum production and dehydration is a significant element to be taken into account. Dehydrated dark skins often look dull and lack radiance. These specificities directly impact the makeup result. On the positive side, the epidermis is more resistant, firmer, and less likely to have wrinkles and suffer from photoaging - it has a lower risk to develop a skin cancer. That is one of the reasons why I recommend not adding an SPF to a foundation, especially if it prevents the product from providing a bright complexion. The skin should not look grey or dull. A protective sun care product may replace it if needed, but to me, results prevail as far as makeup is concerned: the first mission of a foundation is to provide a beautiful complexion. Physiological differences should also be taken into account, like those of lips, which are thicker, often bicoloured, and sometimes much textured. It is important when it comes to designing a lipstick. Premium Beauty News - How can companies develop ranges with new, better-adapted shades? Aïmara Coupet - The first question is, ""is this formula efficient at providing dark skins with a beautiful complexion?"" Certain textures are much too oily and shiny for them, and the makeup result is not satisfactory, while other formulas do not accept enough pigments. As a matter of fact, making a darker shade does not come up to just increasing the black content, it also means working on the other pigments. In addition, certain pigments do not create a nice result on dark skins: certain brown shades can turn pink, for example, or yellow colours may become grey or greenish. So, the pigments added to the formula are very important, they need to be worked according to the formula. There are better-adapted ingredients available, but they are still not properly identified for an application on black skins. Researchers are still learning, testing and making mistakes… Premium Beauty News - What do you recommend for brands to improve their offering? Aïmara Coupet - As regards makeup, the idea is to think of the result first: think like a makeup artist rather than a marketer. Brands need to change the way they see things. Instead of copying/pasting formulas intended for Caucasian skins, they should strengthen their R&D and focus research on these specific skins. Why not do things the other way round? Why could a dark-skin-suited innovation not be adapted to light skins? Brands should think differently. It is the industry's mission to open to mixed skins. Mixed skins represent the majority of tomorrow's consumers."
Brazil: Premium products on the rise despite economy uncertainties,"According to data by market research firm Euromonitor, mass beauty brands grew by 4.4% in 2016 in Brazil whereas luxury products rose 9.1%. The figures follow last year's trend, when sales of luxury beauty products increased by 16.6%, compared to a drop of 1.3% in mass cosmetic sales. There are some reasons behind this category's positive performance despite the challenging scenario. Most luxury product purchases were previously made overseas, but with the dollar on the rise and the drop in international travel, consumers have shifted to local stores. Customer loyalty and an improved perception of value for money are also key factors. ""Most consumers of luxury beauty products are from a social-economic demographic that is less affected by economic cycles. We have also seen several new brands entering the market and the expansion of prestigious beauty retailers,"" says Andrea Olim, Manager of the Brazilian branch of Japanese-based cosmetic company Shiseido, which has been operating locally for over 20 years. A good example of this market's boom in Brazil is French cosmetics chain Sephora. The beauty retail giant landed in Brazil in 2012 and today has 30 stores in 11 different states. Sephora began to feel the effects of the recession in mid-2016, with the trend towards declining mall foot traffic. However, General Manager at Sephora Brasil, Flavia Bittencourt, says ""the crisis has not affected us in the same way as other sectors. I often say that Sephora was not impacted because it does not only sell beauty products, but rather a unique experience for our customers."" With around 90% of its products coming from overseas, the beauty chain was able to maintain its growth plan in Brazil. ""We did not come for a 100-meter sprint, but for a marathon. By the time the crisis was knocking on our door, we were ready to face it,"" says Bittencourt. The strategy of expanding the business model with the launch of beauty kiosks has given Sephora the ability to reach new areas of interest yet also serve as a trial. ""If the kiosks are successful, it is a sign that we can go head with a full store,"" says Bittencourt. She also attributes Sephora's success to the number of exclusive brands sold through the chain, consistent new product launches and its attractive pricing policy. ""We have items to suit all tastes and budgets. There are face masks available in store for only R$ 10. We need to create a perception that premium cosmetics do not necessarily have to be expensive."" Offering less affordable prices (a 100ml fragrance can exceed R$ 600), Jo Malone is another beauty chain that recently settled in Brazil. The UK-based fragrance brand opened its first store in the luxury shopping destination Iguatemi Shopping in early 2016 and has already opened its second store in São Paulo and another one in Rio. However, even customers who are willing to pay more for quality products and are loyal to a particular brand may adjust their buying habits in times of recession. ""We noticed changes in the behaviour of the Shiseido customer, including a shift towards lines with more attractive pricing, as well as an increased demand for offers,"" says Olim. She reveals that a number of strategies and product launches, such as the new LiftDynamic instant lifting effect moisturizers, have been sustaining the company's double-digit growth. Revlon has also reviewed its price point in Brazil. To become more competitive in the face of the crisis, the US beauty giant has cut prices for its products in Brazil. Revlon's creamy lipstick now sells for R$ 30 and the ColorStay liquid foundation, which has released new shades for darker skin and higher FPS, was reduced from R$ 89.90 to R$ 69.90."
Concerns over pollution stimulate sales in the UK prestige skincare sales,"Sales of anti-pollution prestige skincare products are skyrocketing in the UK. Sales of have were up by 30% in the six-month period January 2017 to end of June 2017 according to The NPD Group. ""As the market develops we are seeing more brands introducing products that are specifically designed to protect the skin from pollution,"" explains June Jensen, Director, NPD UK Beauty. However, despite these impressive growth rates, anti-pollution remains an emerging category in the women's skincare sector. According to The NPD Group, the market for these products is valued at £3.1 million. Sales of anti-pollution face masks reported the strongest growth, increasing 112% in the six months to the end of June 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. Anti-pollution moisturiser was also a star performer, reporting 62% growth in the same period. Cleansers and eye creams, designed specifically to tackle the issues relating to pollution also reported double digit growth. The trend for anti-pollution skincare, which emerged a couple of years ago, benefits from consumers' concerns about air quality, in particular in big cities. Today, over half (52%) of Londoners say they are concerned about pollution levels, compared to a national average of 34%. According to Mintel, this trend also boosts sales of air care products as UK consumers are estimated to spend £502 million on these products in 2017, up from £499 million in 2016. More and more products that protect and defend the skin with antioxidants and SPF are marketed as anti-pollution and often feature terms like 'urban', 'city skin', 'shield', 'protector', 'defence' and 'environment' in their names. Cleanse and protect More widely in the prestige beauty market, products which support a healthy skin regime have also reported a rise in sales. Face masks and cleansers in particular, which are regarded as essential for detoxing the skin have reported impressive growth in the six-month period January 2017 to end of June 2017. According to The NPD Group, face cleansers grew 7% to £1.6 million and skincare face masks (not specific to pollution) grew 42% to £2.2 million. Within that category, clay and mud face masks, regarded as the most effective deep cleansing and detoxifying of products, grew by 102%. SPF Protection Make-up products that protect the skin have also reported an increase. Sales of foundations formulated with an SPF have increased by 11% in the year to date June 2017. Foundations with SFP of 20 and above have reported double digit growth, whilst foundation formulated with SPF 50, often seen as the gold standard for pollution defence, has increased by 350%. ""The popularity of products which protect against pollution have had a big impact on the prestige beauty market. We have witnessed the emergence of a niche skincare segment that has proved hugely popular with consumers. Brands like Murad in particular have created innovative products to protect the skin from pollution and blue light which is emitted from digital devices. We expect to see more products like those in the Murad City Skin range in the future as people aim to protect their skin from the harmful damage of pollution and city life,"" concludes June Jensen."
Brazil remains one of the world's leading fragrance markets,"With both mass and premium products, Brazilian fragrances are leading the Latin American market by far. In 2016, Brazil accounted for more than half (US$ 6.4 billion) of total sales in the region, which totaled US$ 11.2 billion according to a Beauty and Personal Care survey by international consultancy firm Euromonitor. Brazil currently holds second position on the global fragrance market, just behind the U.S., whose performance generated US$ 7.9 billion last year. The third place in the global ranking goes to the UK, who recorded a total of US$ 2.4 billion in sales. In 2021, Euromonitor predicts that the Brazilian fragrance market will reach R$ 30.8 billion (approximately US$ 9.6 billion) in sales revenue, exclusive of inflation. According to Euromonitor, Natura was the second-largest fragrance maker in Brazil last year. O Boticário was at the top of the ranking with third place going to Avon. ""We have taken the lead in the fragrance market in Argentina and have gained relevant positions in strategic markets such as Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. In Brazil we are leaders in men's fragrances, with iconic brands such as Natura Homem and Kaiak. We have also seen significant growth in women's fragrances,"" says Natura's Global Fragrance Director, Denise Coutinho. The positive performance is linked to expansion initiatives, such as the plan to open 17 new physical stores in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and the revamp of sales practices by the consultants. According to Coutinho, perfumery is one of the strategic focuses of the company. ""Natura is always investing in new product launches and innovation in this category, which is traditionally very dynamic. In recent years, we have launched new brands such as Una and Luna, and relaunched popular classics such as Kriska, Biografia and Natura Homem,"" she says. ""We also invest heavily in the quality of fragrances as well as the packaging, with the goal of building a prestige and unique image of Brazilian perfumery, all in our own factory in Cajamar."" In the masstige market, Natura's signature brand is Kaiak, inspired by the connection with nature, followed by the Humor line, which encourages customers to live a lighter life. The category with more attractive pricing contains mainly eau de colognes from brands such as Águas and Tododia, designed at prolonging the after-bath sensation. The company's communication strategy is anchored in a direct relationship between Natura's fragrances and their Brazilian origins. To create varied fragrances and a unique scent identity, Coutinho explains that Natura's Perfumer for the past eleven years, Veronica Kato, has combined 2,500 ingredients of world perfumery with 20 exclusive essential oils extracted from the Brazilian biodiversity. ""Another unique aspect is that all fragrances use 100% organic alcohol extracted from sugar cane, which is grown without being affected by pesticides or burning,"" she adds. The use of recycled glass adds to Natura's sustainability strategies. ""In brands like Kaiak and Humor, the packaging has 20% recycled post-consumer glass, and we are expanding that concept to the rest of the portfolio"", says Coutinho."
What did happen this summer?,"While the growth of the European cosmetics and personal care industry was much slower in 2016 than in 2015, according to Cosmetics Europe's figures, due in particular to a fall in the UK market, several market segments are driving sales. That is case of luxury lipsticks in France, and more generally of make-up in the UK. Beauty brands therefore have good reasons to look at consumers' preferences about make-up shades. In the USA, the overall colour cosmetics market is experiencing moderate growth, around two percent slower than last year. Nevertheless, skincare-inspired benefits are still in high demand among colour cosmetics users. In parallel, American consumers are also seduced by the mildness of an alternative anti-aging method: face yoga. The successes of gelatinous formulas, vegan makeup, and beauty masks were also highlighted during the summer. In the absence of major exhibitions, few packaging innovations were presented during the summer, let's note however the ambitions of Saverglass in the perfumery market or those of Mosaico in the cardboard business. As far as decoration is concerned, RPC highlighted its lacquering and metallizing capabilities, while Quadpack, in the wake of the MakeUp in Paris tradeshow, showed the extent of possibilities offered by wood when ingeniously processed. The life of the companies was marked by numerous acquisitions on the part of the ingredients suppliers, the sector continuing to consolidate. Let's also note the acquisition of BCM, a leading European designer and manufacturer of skincare and make-up formulations, by the Fareva group. As for brands, let's note L'Occitane's decision to invest in the building of its first plant in Brazil for the production of the L'Occitane au Brésil lines and, regarding retailers, the acquisition of the Spanish beauty chain Perfumerias If by Douglas, which becomes the number one prestige beauty retailer in this market. Enjoy the coming fall season!"
Creation of desire: an e-Beauty essential,"The generation of ""tech-babyfed"" Millennials is questioning conventional marketing, asserts journalist Nicolas Jaimes. According to a study conducted by the Global Data Institute, 64% of Millennials believe it is important to spend time on social media. Today, on YouTube, 100 creators count over two million subscribers in France. Beyond the very notion of share of attention on social networks, it is the notion of influence that is being questioned. To Nicolas Jaimes, 63% of Millennials trust influencers' posts more easily than messages posted by brands. To Alexiane Dérail, founder of the Subleem agency, new influencers are spreading beyond the target of Millennials by capillary action. Right now, her agency is working with a community of influencing women aged up to 68. However, as more and more mega-influencers are gaining importance, micro-influencers have been emerging as a new target. ""Web users buy products used by people similar to them. An influencer with 5,000 followers is actually very important, because she is usually very close to her community,"" explains Alexiane Dérail, founder of Subleem. Since sincerity and authenticity are at the core of the relationship of trust, micro-influencers offer the advantage of enjoying more intimate closeness with their followers, which is why they have become a new target to seduce. For example, Sephora has never used any icon: instead, they work with influencers. Micro-influencers are strategic for retailers, explains Théo Julien, Head of Social Media Sephora EMEA. Most inspirational creators on YouTube count less than 100,000 followers, which explains why retailers aim to reach as many as possible, but following a real targeted marketing strategy of influence – a relationship that grows in time and is adapted to the influencer's style. From sales to customer experience as a primary focus, at Sephora, they do it all to make customers feel like testing products. Retailers work according to the principle of consolidated basket. Products should not systematically be sold in-store, but also online – beauty advisors are actually equipped with iPads to make the synergy easier. This approach is at the core of the customer experience, but it is also necessary for space reasons, because there is not always enough room in-store to display a complete assortment with all the shades available (necessary to satisfy all types of complexions). Birchbox has also decided to focus their strategy on pampering testers, since product testing is the cornerstone of the beauty box forerunner: they are now widening their presence from the web to physical stores. ""Birchbox counts 1 million subscribers in the world, including 200,000 in France,"" explains Quentin Reygrobollet, Birchbox General Manager France. ""What is crucial is to sell the right product to the right person, thanks to accurate targeting, to maximize the conversion rate."" Today, Birchbox boasts a conversion rate of 50% (buying rate on the website after purchasing the box), and asserts a leading position in France. The quality of key targeting depends on perfect mastery of the new, ultimate data weapon, not only to best personalize the box, but also to find the right tone when exchanging with the community. The beauty industry is experiencing a real revolution. Influencers, data, augmented reality… the new seduction tools deployed by beauty addicts are available to brands – and the latter will definitely know how to best use them."
Skincare: Europe and Asia-Pacific lead the way in anti-ageing innovation,"Asia's ageing population continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, and the beauty industry has taken notice of this shift in demographics. New research from global market intelligence agency Mintel reveals that, in 2016, over one third (37%) of global beauty and personal care launches with anti-ageing claims were launched in Asia Pacific (APAC), up from 28% in 2014. This makes APAC the second most active region for anti-ageing BPC innovation after Europe (40%), according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD). In APAC, South Korea and Japan are leading the charge in anti-ageing beauty and personal care launches, each country accounting for 23% of APAC anti-ageing BPC launches respectively between 2014 and 2016, according to Mintel GNPD. Ranking third for anti-ageing BPC products is China at 22%; Thailand comes in fourth at 7%, and finally, India at 6% - rounding up the list of top five Asian markets for anti-ageing BPC innovation. Globally, the United Kingdom takes up the largest share of the pie, accounting for 16% of the world's beauty and personal care innovation with anti-ageing claims between 2014 and 2016. Comparatively, in the same time period, South Korea and Japan each account for 8% of all global anti-ageing BPC launches respectively, and China at 7%. While the UK leads globally, Mintel GNPD reveals that anti-ageing BPC innovation in the country has seen a year-on-year dip: 19% in 2014; 17% in 2015; and 12% in 2016. ""Ageing is a global issue, particularly in South Korea, Japan and China - countries that are most affected by a rapidly greying population. As such, it makes sense that these North Asian markets are at the forefront of anti-ageing beauty within Asia Pacific. The region's growing silver generation is opening up opportunities for beauty and personal care brands looking to capitalise on the 'grey wave',"" explains Sharon Kwek, Senior Beauty and Personal Care Innovation and Insights Analyst at Mintel. Meanwhile, it seems that the concept of ageing has infiltrated the younger population. This has given rise to the 'early anti-ageing' trend where younger consumers are starting to use anti-ageing beauty and personal care products that act as a preventive measure against early signs of ageing. Indeed, research from Mintel reveals that as many as 30% of urban Chinese consumers aged 20-49 describe their current skin condition as showing early signs of wrinkles or lines, while 39% of Chinese females aged 20-24 report using anti-ageing skincare products. In Thailand, 45% and 48% of metro male consumers aged 18 and over are concerned about the appearance of wrinkles and age spots respectively. Finally, Mintel research reveals that over half (55%) of urban females in Thailand think that the environment - including pollution - plays a part in the appearance of skin. What's more, environmental concerns have led to the addition of new protection claims within the anti-ageing beauty and personal care products space, particularly against pollution. According to Mintel GNPD, launches of anti-ageing facial skincare products with an anti-pollution claim increased from 20% in 2015 to 35% in 2016 in APAC."
"MakeUp In and Luxe Pack: ""The winning pair!""","Premium Beauty News - First question on everyone's lips: What are the changes exactly in terms of countries and dates? Nathalie Grosdidier - The answer is quite clear! In general, both events are perfectly complementary and don't compete with one another! Therefore there is no reason to merge them! On the other hand, this doesn't mean that we cannot have common strategies in some parts of the world, where one of the events can take draw on the successful implementation of the other. In Europe, there are no changes. MakeUp in Paris will still take place in June, and Luxe Pack Monaco in October. Complementarity and efficiency. In the United States, there are no changes either, on the East Coast. Luxe Pack New York will still be held in May, and MakeUp in New York in September. There again, complementarity and efficiency. But on the West Coast, the success of MakeUp in Los Angeles is a fantastic opportunity to launch a first Luxe Pack Los Angeles event, which we had always intended to do. And I can tell you that these two events that will take place at the same time in the same venue, but with two separate show entrances, already promise to be extremely successful. In Asia, the picture is unchanged. MakeUp in Seoul will take place next April 25th and 26th and Luxe Pack Shanghai will also be held in April, but two weeks earlier, on April 11th and 12th. MakeUp in Seoul is the Asian make-up industry's favourite event. South Korea remains one of the flagship countries in the make-up sector in the region. Conversely, this time, it is the MakeUp In team that will draw on the historical success of Luxe Pack Shanghai by setting up for the first time, on April 11th and 12th, an area dedicated to make-up. There too, we expect a big success... We have already received a lot of registration requests. Premium Beauty News - Therefore in Asia, you will have two events organized a few weeks apart. Is it a problem? Sandra Maguarian - Not at all! In fact, manufacturers are divided into two categories. Those who want to exhibit in Seoul and those who want to be present in Shanghai. For most of them, they are not the same! They have different strategies. Which actually show the first registration requests received. We will launch the MakeUp in trade show in Shanghai the same way we do with all our other trade shows, with carefully selected exhibitors who have strong ambitions in the Chinese market. Premium Beauty News - Concerning Los Angeles and, Shanghai, how are the events organized in concrete terms? Danielle Rousseau - The general philosophy is: everyone keeps his identity! There will therefore be different entrances and a different show scenery. Concerning Los Angeles, and because the venue makes it possible, there will be a buffer zone between the two events, enabling visitors to make the link and in which will be present manufacturers who have a dual offer, both in make-up and perfume but also cosmetics. For Shanghai, the idea is the same. Premium Beauty News - What about MakeUp in Sao Paulo? Sandra Maguarian - We have decided ""to let go"" the 2017 edition. As you know, the country is in deep economic crisis. Foreign manufacturers are reluctant to invest in this Brazil. Import taxes have reached record levels and inflation is on the rise again. ""To let go"" does not mean abandon this country. We will consider the opportunity to be back again next year. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any other ideas for synergy? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Of course, we always have fresh ideas up our sleeves! But we always bear in mind that we are fortunate enough to have our customers/partners joining us every year in two, three, four and even five trade shows in a row. We cannot expand the list of events forever. New events have to respond to a real need. But it seems obvious that these two concepts, Luxe Pack and MakeUp In, have upset the world of trade shows. They are targeted, efficient, higher-end and perfectly fit current and above all, future demands."
The new face of the Japanese beauty market,"Despite many economic and demographic challenges Japan - the second largest market in Asia (behind China) for personal care products - remains a must. With some of the highest incomes in the Asia Pacific region, Japanese consumers continue to enjoy respectable purchasing power. According to consultancy Bain & Company, the country logs some US$22.7 billion in annual spending on top-end goods, ranking it as the world's number two luxury market behind the United States. ""You shouldn't forget that a big portion of the luxury clientele is here in Japan,"" Sidney Toledano, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, told AFP last April at the opening of Ginza Six, a 241-store building fully dedicated to luxury brands. ""It remains a strategic market for luxury."" Japan's luxury market also benefited from the growing number of foreign shoppers visiting the country, in particular from China and Japan is hoping to land 40 million visitors in 2020 [1], the year that Tokyo hosts the Olympics. Last year, some six million Chinese visited, compared with 2.4 million in 2014. For Chinese shoppers, Tokyo remains an attractive alternative to Hong Kong. ""Historically, (Japan has) been a very insular luxury market where 90 to 95 percent of the spending was by locals,"" said Joëlle de Montgolfier, Paris-based director of consumer and luxury product research at Bain & Company. But now some 30 percent of sales are generated by foreign visitors owing to tourism, she added. Another major shift of the Japanese market is the growing interest for natural products. Indeed, Japan is no exception to the growing interest and demand for healthier, safer and more ethically conscious products. In addition, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that severely hit the Tohoku region, has accelerated the transformation to a more environmentally-conscious lifestyle. As Japanese brands lagged to enter this segment, the growth in demand for natural cosmetics has mostly benefited international brands. An illustration to this trend was the massive participation of international natural and organic cosmetic brands to the Cosme Tokyo tradeshow. [2] However, Yuiko Mitani, research analyst for beauty and fashion industries at Euromonitor International, wrote in a recent blog post that ""Japanese consumers are not buying into such strict natural/organic claims. Rather, a more general feel around natural/organic brands and products seems to be key attraction."" While Euromonitor anticipates the natural/organic beauty market in Japan to continue steady growth, Yuiko Mitani says the definition of these products is likely to remain vague and ""the growth of the officially certified area is forecast to remain limited"". Furthermore, natural/organic beauty brands and products may face intensifying competition from other beauty trends such as derma-cosmetics with ""stronger scientific backing"", due to Japanese consumers' persistent preference for efficacy. In the future, the Japanese market should still undergo many changes. While tourism-related consumption partially offsets demographic decline, it remains highly dependent on the Yen level. Furthermore, younger people don't have the money or the same interest in luxury brands anymore, said Naoko Kuga, a consumer lifestyle analyst at Tokyo's NLI Research Institute."
"Haircare is a serious business for men, study finds","According to the 'Dove Men+Care 2017 Men's Hair Census', eight out of 10 men in the US see their crowning glory as a reflection of their personal style, and as something that helps them look both masculine and professional. Six out of 10 wish they had healthier-looking hair, while one out of five men even admitted to feeling jealous of a friend's hair. When it comes to style preferences, seven out of 10 of the men surveyed said they wished the controversial 'man bun' would disappear for good, while a whopping 90 percent admitted to touching up their hairstyle in the mirror at least once a day. In terms of styling products, gel, pomade and even hair spray were revealed to be the tools of choice for 60 per cent of the respondents. But perhaps the most surprising revelation of all was that one in five men would give up drinking for a month if it meant having stronger and healthier hair. Men's Hair Habits – 60% of men named frequent washing as the key to maintaining strong, healthy hair – More than 60% of all men style their hair every day and prefer to use hair gel, hair spray or pomade – 90% of guys look in the mirror to fix their hair at least once a day The survey saw the beauty giant Dove's male-only line Dove Men+Care team up with comedian W. Kamau Bell to quiz men in all 50 US states about their relationship with their manes. ""Hair is a big part of my identity and the Census really proves how, as a culture, guys are putting an importance on the look and style of their hair,"" said Bell. ""I was surprised that men from all walks of life held hair in such a high regard, and yet reflect their identity through hair in many different ways."" The conversation around male grooming has become a hot topic recently, with an increased awareness and availability of speciality beauty products for men. Clinique's Sonic System Deep Cleansing Brush, brewery Carlsberg's shampoo, conditioner and body lotion trio, and Dove Men+Care's beauty bars are just some of the high-profile launches that have helped drive the market over the last few years."
Vegan makeup brands in the spotlight this summer,"Dubai-based beauty brand Luscious Cosmetics caused great excitement earlier this month, thanks to its long-awaited launch in the US. The brand, which was founded in 2007, specialises in pigment-rich, long-lasting products that are designed to withstand hot climates and humidity, and are suitable for customers looking for both vegan and halal makeup. Bestsellers include its face contour kits and powder blushes. Website: www.iloveluscious.com Vegan makeup mogul Kat Von D has always been a vocal animal rights activist as well as a highly successful animal-free cosmetics entrepreneur, so it was no surprise when the star announced earlier this month that she had been hard at work on a vegan makeup brush collection. According to the star, the new brushes are made from ""the highest grade synthetic fibres that mimic the same product distribution you would get from animal-based bristles"". Website: www.katvondbeauty.com British cult hair dye brand Bleach London delighted fans earlier this summer with the launch of its inaugural makeup collection. Comprising pressed glitter pots, lip colors, eyeshadows, highlighters and brushes, the line is entirely vegan and cruelty-free, and even comes wrapped up in recycled packaging for extra green points.

"""Face yoga"": the new anti-aging skincare trend?","The concept involves using exercises to tone, lift and sculpt muscles in the face and counteract sagginess and puffiness for a rejuvenated appearance. Back in 2015, a pop-up called SkinGym Face Fitness established itself in New York offering a workout called 'Face Love'. Its UK equivalent, FaceGym, is still going strong, with a location in the London's flagship Selfridges department store as well as a stand-alone studio in the British capital. FaceGym describes itself as ""the UK's only gym studio for the face and the original non-invasive face workout"", offering clients the chance to have their muscles stretched and sculpted by dedicated 'face trainers'. This year, the trend reached LA too, thanks to the city's new Skin Fit Gym, which hosts dedicated face training classes for individuals and groups. ""Face workouts are the new facials,"" says FaceGym's founder, Inge Theron. But what if you can't get to a brick-and-mortar studio for a session? Luckily, facial workouts are also thriving online, giving rise to gurus like British 'Face Yoga Expert' Danielle Collins, who guides followers through various facial exercises via a series of YouTube tutorials. One of Collins' most popular videos, published this March, is aimed at smoothing out frown lines. She suggests gently massaging the area between the eyebrows, as well as lightly tapping the forehead and gently pinching and pulling at the eyebrows to relieve tension and help stimulate the production of collagen. FaceGym also published an article this April detailing a series of DIY facial exercises that can aid lymphatic drainage and reduce the appearance of under-eye circles. Is face yoga set to become a mainstream beauty trend? It remains to be seen."
Skincare-inspired benefits in high demand among colour cosmetics users in the USA,"According to the market research firm, consumer desire for more simplified makeup routines is resulting in stalled growth across the individual colour cosmetics segments in the USA. Mintel forecasts colour cosmetics sales to increase by two percent in 2017 to reach US$11.0 billion, with lip cosmetics, facial cosmetics and eye cosmetics each growing around two percentage points slower this year compared to 2016 [2]. Despite this drop in sales growth, Mintel research indicates skincare-inspired benefits are in high demand among colour cosmetics users as the lines between facial makeup and facial skincare continue to blur. Anti-aging and moisturizing claims (44 percent respectively) top the list of benefits female facial cosmetics users are interested in seeing from their facial makeup. Of course, age plays a significant role in the benefits consumers look for. Not surprising, female consumers aged 55+ are most likely to be interested in products with anti-aging claims (68 percent vs 18 percent of women aged 18-34), while those aged 18-34 are most likely to seek products that treat acne (24 percent vs 2 percent of women 55+), are for sensitive skin (23 percent vs 9 percent) or minimize pores (23 percent vs 11 percent). However, it appears that women of all ages show the same enthusiasm for makeup that creates the appearance of flawless skin as more than one quarter (28 percent) of facial cosmetics users say they're interested in facial makeup that evens skin tone, including 28 percent of women 18-34 and 29 percent of women 55+. Interest in products that improve the skin's appearance extends to new product innovation as well, as pore-minimizing products (29 percent) and colour-correcting palettes (24 percent) garner the strongest appeal from female colour cosmetics users. ""Overall, the colour cosmetics market experienced moderate growth in 2017. However, products which do not align with the current 'natural look' trend, such as lip gloss, bronzer and eye shadow, resulted in slower gains across the category segments. While the market is saturated and some women are turning to value brands to cut costs, facial makeup products that offer relevant skincare benefits present a bright spot that could reinvigorate sales,"" said Shannon Romanowski, Director, Mintel Reports, Health, Household, Beauty and Personal Care. ""As consumers increasingly express interest in facial makeup that incorporates skincare-related claims, it's likely these claims will continue expanding into the cosmetics category. Anti-aging and moisturizing claims are appealing to older women, and can be particularly successful in light of an aging population that is typically less engaged in the category."""
Lipsticks: What are the preferences of consumers around the world?,"Perfect Corp, the editor of a suite of augmented reality makeup apps, has analysed the preferences of the 280 million users of its YouCam Makeup flagship app. The data provide a large array of information on global and regional lipstick trends: – Millennial pink is the most preferred lip color globally. Millennial pink proves to be a trending favourite across the globe. Over 20% of lipstick try-ons in the United States and the UK are Millennial pink shades, and 15% of lip colour try-ons in China and Japan are Millennial pinks. – All shades of pink dominate in the West, while classic reds are favoured in Asia. Overall pink is the most preferred colour in the United States and the UK, with almost 50% of the top lip colours being pink shades, significantly higher than the other countries with pinks making up only 20% - 35% of all try-ons. China shows the most diverse lipstick colour trials overall YouCam Makeup's Beauty AR Reveals Global Lipstick Trends in Celebration of National Lipstick Day (Graphic: Business Wire) with purples, oranges and lighter sheer shades taking the top spots. In contrast, Korean users prefer bold darker pinks, purples, and reds, playing off many of the K-Beauty trends that continue to surface. – Lip finishes matter, with matte ruling the West and sheer reigning in Asia. ""Matte is a fact"" in the United States and the UK, with over 40% matte lip try-ons monthly. Users in East Asia prefer sheer textures overall. China favours sheer (40%) and satin (28%) finishes. Users in Japan clearly favour sheer lip finishes, taking the top spot with over 50% of the total try-ons in a month. The K-Beauty fans in Korea favour matte (35%) and sheer (33%) lip finishes as their top choices. – The two-toned lip trend is the fastest growing globally. While ombré lips became popular last year, two-toned lips (different colours on top and bottom lips) are now the fastest growing trend. AR try-ons of two-toned lip colors have grown 74% this summer, indicating a huge interest in this new lip style. Two-tone lips were first noted on the New York Fashion Week runway in Jason Wu's Fall 2017 collection, and now beauty brands such as Estée Lauder and Laneige have also released two-toned lipsticks in their collections."
Jelly: beauty's latest obsession,"The trend was arguably sparked back in 2016, when millennial beauty brand Glossier debuted its crowd-sourced 'Milk Jelly Cleanser', which promises to dissolve makeup and provide a deep but gentle cleanse suitable for everyday use. The gel-like product can be used on wet or dry skin and claims to reinforce the skin's barrier to safeguard against dehydration. Fast forward to this summer, and jelly is going mainstream. The Japanese beauty brand Shiseido recently launched a 'Fresh Jelly Lotion' as part of its brand-new 'Waso' range, which is rooted in natural, organic ingredients. The name comes from the lotion's gel-like texture, but also from its star ingredient: white jelly mushroom. The fungus is said to encourage a healthy, dewy complexion. Other brands getting in on the act include Estée Lauder, which recently released a 'Nutritious Micro-Algae Pore Purifying Cleansing Jelly' that claims to lather into a silky foam in order to remove impurities via a combination of micro-algaes. And June saw the US brand Drunk Elephant, which focuses on non-toxic skincare solutions, unveil its 'Beste Jelly Cleanser', which features virgin marula oil to nourish the skin and glycerin to hydrate it. But despite its sophisticated reinvention, jelly has retained its fun side. One of the quirkiest jellied skincare product launches this year comes courtesy of Boscia, which made waves earlier this summer with its new 'Charcoal Jelly Ball Cleanser'. The squishy, balloon-shaped product that features activated black charcoal to extract impurities, proving that jelly can be a playful way to seriously step up your beauty routine."
Colour cosmetics continue to boost the UK beauty market,"Britain's love of makeup products shows no signs of fading, as Mintel predicts the market to grow by 36% and reach £2.5 billion by 2021 (EUR2.85 billion). Today, as many as 83% of UK women wear make-up. The most purchased products within the last 12 months were classic make-up bag staples: mascara (57%), lipstick (49%) and liquid/cream foundation (46%). According to Mintel, the face and lip colour segments saw the biggest rise in sales in the colour cosmetics category in 2016, driven in part by the 'no make-up make-up look' and colour correction trends. While sales of face colour products rose by 10% to reach £580 million in 2016, sales of lip colour grew by 11% to £304 million. ""The colour cosmetics category continues to show strong year-on-year growth, particularly driven by the fashion for the 'no make-up make-up' look, which requires more products, time and skill than the name might suggest,"" said Roshida Khanom, Associate Director, Beauty & Personal Care at Mintel. Actually, over a third (35%) of British women surveyed by Mintel say they use make-up to subtly enhance their natural features. When considering at why women turn towards the make-up box, tiredness is the leading motivator. As many as 41% of women say they wear make-up to look less tired, followed by 39% who use it to cover blemishes and 25% who use make-up to look more youthful. Meanwhile, Mintel research highlights the emotional ties UK women have when 'putting on their face'. Over three in five (64%) women who wear make-up say it makes them feel confident and 43% say it makes them feel attractive, compared to just 16% who feel more professional and 15% who feel empowered by wearing make-up. What's more, it seems that being selfie-ready is also an important factor for younger make-up users in particular. Almost a quarter (22%) of women aged 16-24 wear make-up to create a camera-ready look, up from an average of 7%. As far as the prestige beauty market is concerned, makeup remains the main growth driver in the UK. According to The NPD Group, ""the most impressive growth both in store and online is from make-up which grew by 7% in store to reach £668 million. Online sales of prestige make-up increased by 45% to £120 million in 2016."""
France: Sales of prestige lipsticks reach new records,"According to The NPD Group, one of the world leaders in market research, sales of prestige lipsticks have increased by 31% in value over the last two years in France. Today, more than one in five makeup products sold in the prestige retail channel in France is a lipstick. A total of 3.2 million lipsticks were sold in this channel during the 12 months of the survey period (May 2016 - April 2017). With a 22% market share, sales of lipsticks top the make-up category in volume. However, they rank second in value, just behind foundations, with a total turnover of 90.3 million euros annually. Lipstick sales have recorded a double-digit growth for the second year in a row, with a 14% increase in value this year, representing an additional gain of 3.2 million euros (year-to-date to April 2017 vs. 2016). ""All indicators are green for lipsticks in France, with a strong contribution from new launches (39 products have been launched in less than one year compared with 28 last year) and also with a steady health of older products that remain on their double-digit growth path. The craze for lipsticks goes well beyond French borders: the segment is up 21% in Italy and Spain, and 38% in the United Kingdom,"" said Mathilde Lion, Beauty Expert for Europe at The NPD Group. According to analysts from The NPD Group, the success of lipsticks could be explained by their small size and small price. Small and packed in elegant and practical tubes, lipsticks are easily transportable, so women can take them anywhere and use them at any time of the day. Lipsticks are also the most affordable products sold by major prestige brands. ""For an average price of 28 euros in French perfumeries and department stores, women of all ages gain access to prestigious brands,"" says The NPD Group. However, lipsticks are also an object of desire, which generates impulse purchases from consumers. Far from the basic usefulness of mascaras or foundations. For instance, according to The NPD Group, the choice of a lipstick is increasingly inspired by fashion and internet trends. ""Social networks and online tutorials played a key role in the success of lipsticks. Trends are multiplying and constantly changing, from lips jewellery to contouring or colour overlays: the playground has no limits and the market adapts almost in real time, offering new textures, such as liquid mats for instance, wider and bolder colour palettes and more and more product benefits,"" continues Mathilde Lion. While women continue to test colours and textures in stores (sales grew by +10% in beauty and department stores), The NPD Group also notes online lipstick sales are skyrocketing, with sales multiplied by 2.5 in one year. The online channel now accounts for 7% of sales, thanks to the attractiveness of the channel for young consumers and the power of recommendation of social media. Brands are also strong sales driver. Chanel, Christian Dior, Guerlain, Lancôme and Yves Saint Laurent, the five top prestige lipstick brands (in alphabetical order), share more than three-quarters of the market value."
The European cosmetics market slows down in 2016,"Europe remains the global flagship producer of cosmetic products. In 2016, the European cosmetics market was valued at EUR 77 billion, making Europe the largest market for cosmetic products in the world. However, growth in the European market has slowed significantly in 2016 compared to 2015, according to figures released by Cosmetics Europe. Several countries recorded a significant recession, in particular Denmark (-14.3%) and the United Kingdom (-11.4%). As far as products are concerned, all categories are down from 2015, with the exception of makeup (+ 0.8%). Skin care and toiletries remain the most important product categories in Europe, followed by hair care and fragrances. In the context, international trade is a critical component of the industry. Nearly EUR 18 billion worth of cosmetic products were exported from the European Union in 2016. Such exports are particularly important in countries strongly affected by the Euro crisis (such as Spain and Italy) where the cosmetics sector is helping to secure national economic recovery. France and Germany, followed by Italy and Spain are the main European exporters of cosmetic products."
Facial masks remain a coveted beauty item among urban Chinese consumers,"According to the global market intelligence agency, in 2016, the category saw a steady increase of 26% in growth, hitting a sales value of RMB 15,218 million, up from RMB 12,040 million in 2015. In comparison, the overall growth rate of China's beauty and personal care market stood at 8% in 2016, making the facial mask category one of the most dynamic in the country's beauty and personal care market. Mintel estimates China's facial mask segment to grow at a CAGR of 15.8% in value over the next five years, reaching RMB 31,746 million by 2021. ""In recent years, facial masks have successfully penetrated women's facial skin care regimes in most parts of Asia, like China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, to name a few. The growing usage of facial masks in wider Asia is largely because of the beauty item's ability to offer consumers different skin care benefits in a convenient manner and short turnaround time. Today, the usage of facial masks in China is commonplace, and the so-loved item will continue to be coveted among Chinese women,"" said Sharon Kwek, Senior Innovation and Insights Analyst of Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel. Furthermore, it seems Chinese consumers love of facial masks is also causing them to turn to social media. Mintel research reveals as many as one in three (33%) surveyed urban Chinese female consumers who use facial masks [1] purchase the skin care product via the social application, WeChat. This purchase channel seems to have grown in popularity as only 10% of these female facial mask users reported purchasing facial masks via WeChat in 2016. ""The success of online channels has contributed to the growth of China's beauty and personal care market, and these portals will continue to bring momentum to the wider industry, and especially, the facial masks category in the years ahead. However, there is no strong brand loyalty in the facial masks category as our research shows that there is similar interest among female facial mask consumers to try out premium masks and new brands. Consumers' growing demand for innovative products will require dynamic and vivid response from facial mask brands"", highlighted Jessica Jin, Beauty and Personal Care Associate Director at Mintel. According to Mintel, females in China, today, are increasingly accepting of the idea of premium facial masks, as Mintel research reveals just over half (54%) of female facial mask users surveyed [2] in urban China have purchased a facial mask priced RMB 30 or above (per sheet) in the six months to January 2017. Additionally, a similar proportion (52%) of these facial mask consumers have tried out new brands during the same time period. Research from Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD) reveals an increase in the number of new facial mask launches with masstige and prestige pricing in China from 2015 to 2016. The proportion of masstige and prestige launches in China's facial mask market has risen from 14% and 3% in 2015, to 25% and 8% in 2016 (respectively). When it comes to usage occasions, Mintel data shows that seven in 10 (69%) surveyed urban Chinese females have used sheet masks in the evenings in the last six months [3], and only 17% have used the mask variant in the mornings. While evenings remain the major usage occasion of facial masks, it seems mornings still hold potential for brands. Mintel research shows that morning usage is gradually being accepted by facial mask consumers as 47% of surveyed urban Chinese females [4] have used at least one type of facial mask in the morning in the six months to January 2017. Bringing attention to morning usage, among all the different types of facial masks, rinse-off masks have the highest usage penetration among China's urban female consumers, followed by sheet masks. One third (33%) of those surveyed who have an MPI (monthly personal income) of RMB 8,000 or above have used rinse-off masks in the morning, compared to 20% of all urban Chinese female respondents [5]. Generally speaking, Mintel's study show that high earners consumers are more likely to use a larger variety of the product. When considering the types of facial masks brought to market across the Asia Pacific region in 2016, Mintel GNPD reveals that 40% and 50% of new facial mask launches in South Korea and Japan bear the anti-aging claim (respectively), while only 25% claim the same in China. Finally, as many as 47% of female facial mask users surveyed [6] have used facial masks with pore-refining purposes, while 39% have used facial masks that claim to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, according to findings from Mintel. ""New product innovation is important to companies and brands looking to stand out in China's facial masks market. Anti-aging is an expected avenue for facial mask brands to tap into as Chinese consumers' skincare routines are highly influenced by neighbouring countries, such as South Korea and Japan, where early uptake of anti-aging products is now a trend,"" Jessica concludes."
Beauty under the influence of the GenNext,"Premium Beauty News - To what extent does the GenNext relationship with digital technologies impact the beauty industry? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - As we have already highlighted, the reasons behind this beauty culture among the GenNext are education, first, since their mothers applied cream on their skins from a very early age, then their exposure to the media, which initiated them very early to the importance of beauty in our image-oriented society, their social bond, directly related to self-staging on social networks, and their information medium: they can access the Internet right in the hollow of their hands and get regularly informed of new launches or beauty looks. This ""beauty addict"" generation is constantly in search of the latest trends and good deals. Two years after our first report, it seemed obvious to us that we needed to follow the evolution of this generation, given the boom of social media and how deeply it changed our relationship with beauty, trends, and the buying journey. That is why we called our report GenNext - Connected Beauty. And to better understand these new shopping dynamics, we completed our study with a survey conducted among 200 young girls living in the biggest French and American cities, as well as interviews of about twenty of them in the streets. Premium Beauty News - What are the main implications for brands? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - There are multiple implications for brands, so we have tackled this issue in detail. One of their essential drivers is to turn from a product brand to a lifestyle concept. For this generation, beauty is part of a real way of life, as can be seen with the study results. More than eight young girls out of ten in France and the USA like being complimented on their style, and beauty products play a significant role in asserting it. Beautification outmatches the notion of attractiveness to become a tool for assertiveness and empowerment, for stressing their own chosen personality shaped by beauty products. There is this new relationship of ""intimacy"" with brands, a complicity they like to share, since beauty is one of the main discussion topics on the web and social networks. The disruption of levers of influence is another consequence. Clearly, ""indie"" brands (alternative and independent brands) boast a powerful personality with strong values and excel in the art of social conversation and their ability to gather their community together – a community that is proud to follow them. These new brands no longer build up on a notion of expertise through fashion (1960s), Makeup Artists, or doctors (late 1980s), they draw their legitimacy from their unrestrained, disruptive creativity and skilfulness in controlling social media dynamics. For example, the Milk Makeup brand, launched in early 2016 in the USA, celebrates freedom of expression. It is an ode to the notion of acceptance of everyone, whatever the appearance, complexion, and style. They advocate universality throughout the world. Their almost political, activist stance makes them not only a makeup brand, but a tool to express one's own personality. Premium Beauty News - What main transformations should they get ready for? Leïla Rochet-Podvin - First, boundaries are falling into pieces. Whether they be boundaries between segments or distribution channels, competitiveness is getting global, as products are increasingly available on the Internet. Consumers are freeing themselves from the notions of space and standard boundaries that had made up our industry. This phenomenon makes it necessary for brands to get more fluid, fast, and flexible, and question their customs. They need to show both bold and creative. Then, brands willing to target this generation should be able to create a bond with their customers and devise ""relational"" beauty products that will generate conversations, intimacy, exchange, and sharing. But beware, this target consists of connoisseurs, so products should be flawless and offer a real added value. On the other hand, there is a transformation in the shopping experience and in the new dynamics of influence when it comes to buying a cosmetic product. To a Beauty Native, purchasing a beauty product involves a lot and results from a real investigative work: peers' or influencers' opinions are essential in this. The study conducted by Poshly [1] in the USA had revealed that only 7% of Millennials consumers trusted shop assistants' recommendations. So, there is a legitimacy to regain at the point of sale, and it is crucial for brands and distributors alike to make sure they are attractive to this target.

MakeUp in Paris preview: New trends are marked by pencils,"Alkos Cosmétiques will present the Tattoo Lip Contour, which was selected among other innovations for the show's Innovation Tree. With its fluid texture and semi-permanent felt-tip fitted with moisturizing and emollient actives, it keeps the lip contour coloured for hours and replumps the lips, while preserving hydration. It can also be used as a colouring base to any gloss or lipstick for a long-lasting result. Schwan Cosmetics also banked on their know-how to develop a new, long-lasting, covering, and nourishing product: RetractMatic Divine Texture. Available both in matte and semi-matte versions, this lip liner and stick works precisely on lip contour and coverage for a perfect result up to six hours. Its waterproof, shea-butter-based formula is free from any mineral oil, preservative, paraffin, and animal derivatives. Faber-Castell Cosmetics will introduce two concepts with electric colours for a shiny, cheeky look. The Magnetic Electric plastic pencil range, with its Slim Plastic Magnetic eyeliner and lip liner, also counts on a long-lasting effect to highlight acid/pop colours. Its gel texture makes the application easier for a super long-lasting finish, up to 8 hours for the lips, and 16 for the eyeliner. This line with astonishing shades ranges from classic to electric colours and from matte to metallic effects. It can be easily personalized and is now available with a shiny, matte, pearly, or metallic finish. For pop lips day and night, Alkos will also spotlight their Moonlight Kiss Fluo, this time in a Jumbo Pencil version. The Jumbo plastic pencil can be sharpened to deliver the Moonlight Kiss formula, which looks like a sparkling lipstick with pure fluorescent colours during the day, and makes lips appear fluorescent under typical black or blue club lights at night. The product is available in orange and fluorescent pink. Urban Amazon, the other concept developed by Faber-Castell Cosmetics, draws conquering lines. This eye & lip liner concept contained in a gel formula offers vibrant colours and an accurate application. The formula dries in 40 seconds for a long-lasting finish and its marked pigmentation provides a strong colouring effect. The pencil is fitted with a retractable tip and is available in bright and transparent shades. The Color Block Eyeliner Marker range by Alkos Cosmétiques has been enriched with new shades: purple, green, brown, and bright shades – pretty rare on the eyeliner segment. Also in the Alkos Cosmétiques Eyeliner category, the Slim Metal'Eye plastic pencils deliver a formula with an ultra-sensorial application to create a film with a waterproof metallic effect as soon as the first line drawn. As for Schwan Cosmetics, they will showcase Dip Pen with Ebony Texture, a high-performance liquid eyeliner with a matte finish. The application gets ultra-fine or thicker, depending on the applicator, and draws a precise, intense black line. Waterproof Dip Pen with Ebony Texture quickly dries and promises to last all day – at least 17 hours – ideal for humid climates. Its formula is free from parabens and IPBC. The Alkos Cosmétiques Filling Brow Marker is a semi-permanent marker which gives the illusion of natural, denser brows. Other than its easy application and long-lasting performance, its colour is stable and does not turn while drying – obviously a ""plus"" for such a product. The Brow Pomade Pencil by Schwan Cosmetics also creates a natural effect. The ultra-fine pearls in the formula make the application more even and perfect the coverage. Thanks to its long-lasting effect, this new product based on organic synthetic waxes is adapted to the most humid climates. Lastly, also in the ""pen makeup"" peripheral world, it should be highlighted that the Alkos Cosmétiques company will also showcase the HD Cover Stick Jumbo Twist, a concealer with a powdered result, as well as travel size sticks: Exfoliating Charcoal Stick, a 2-in-1 mask which exfoliates and cleanses the skin's pores, thanks to its natural charcoal extracts, while preserving hydration, and the Stick with me Travel Cleanser, a travel-size solid cleanser to be emulsified - ideal for travelling."

Is protection the future of nail care?,"Beauty consumers are becoming increasingly concerned over the negative effects of environmental stressors on their appearance and this trend is also impacting colour cosmetics. ""Nail brands are therefore exploring new treatment concepts: for instance, overnight nail products, reminiscent of night creams, were launched by Nails Inc in 2016 with the Overnight Detox Mask, and Sally Hansen recommends overnight use with the Moisture Rehab product,"" writes Charlotte Libby, in a recent blog post. Furthermore, according to the market research firm, almost one third of US nail colour users are concerned about chemicals in the products they use. Mintel expects protecting claims such as anti-pollution and UV protection to increase in 2017. In 2016, Nails Inc has already released a range of nail polishes formulated with charcoal to protect nails against pollutants. However, other trends may also impact nail care in the future. The search for healthy food, for instance, could lead to the apparition of new ingredients inspired from green detox diets such as kale, turmeric, carrots, milk and almond. According to Mintel, there are opportunities for nail polish brands to further promote their superfood ingredients. ""Additionally, with the Pantone Colour of the Year 2017 being Greenery, brands can explore green vegetable polishes to match this shade."" Hot on the heels of this trend, in November 2016 French do-it-yourself cosmetics company Aroma-Zone announced the launch of a 100% vegan nail varnish range based on bio-sourced, plant-derived solvents and pigments. The anti-ageing claims remain relatively untapped in the nail area, Mintel points. ""Further innovation is needed in colour cosmetics to match the demand from older women. As the population of mature countries across the world ages, nail brands can do more to target senior consumers,"" Charlotte Libby writes. However, other claims such as hydrating, strengthening and smoothing may also help to attract both younger and older women while expanding the scope of nail protection. Last but not least, Mintel also identifies new opportunities in the improvement of nail varnish removal solutions. ""Nail polish removal can be harsh on nails and cuticles, therefore innovation to increase nail care benefits of removal can appeal to nail polish users, and encourage more frequent application."""
China Beauty Expo is taking the beauty world by storm,"China beauty Expo, which was acquired by Informa in 2014, has steadily grown from the main Chinese beauty event to major international fair. ""In just three years the trade show has added to new halls (about 100,000 sqm) taken the entire exhibition centre and now totals 250 000 sqm, making it the biggest B2B beauty trade show in the world,"" explains Claudia Bonfiglioli, the show's International Director. This year's edition hosted more than 3,000 exhibitors including cosmetic ingredients suppliers, formulators, packaging suppliers, manufacturers of machinery and equipment, OEM/ODM/OBM and brands. The supply side was gathered under the CosmeTech banner, representing about 1,000 exhibitors, including 30% international companies such as Intercos, Fiabila, Albéa, Cosmax, HCT, etc. ""Made in China packaging and machinery is attracting buyers from India, the USA and elsewhere as they have become more innovative and qualitative,"" emphasizes Ying Sang, CBE's Deputy General Manager. As far as finished products are concerned, the show hosted over 2,000 exhibitors with a Hall entirely dedicated to trends and innovation (N5) and another to E-Commerce and WeChat (E6). This Cosmetics section gathered both products dedicated to the retail markets and products for the professional market. Skin Care and Toiletries remain the biggest sectors of the show followed by Color Cosmetic, Hair Care and Accessories. Informa aims at bringing more international exhibitors and visitors to the Chinese show. ""The Cosmetics sectors welcomed 20% international exhibitors with the biggest contingent coming from neighbouring Korea accounting for 302 companies. There are also new country pavilions, which were brought to the show in recent years with Spain, Germany, Italy, Japan for instance,"" highlights Claudia Bonfiglioli. France, which is still considered by Chinese professionals as the initiator of innovations in Beauty, was the country of honour this year. In order to promote innovation, the organizers partnered with design agency Cent Degrès to create a Beauty District at the heart of the show, to host a museum (in partnership with Grasse Fragrance Museum), a library (Scent Library) and a beauty village. The aim was also to offer visitors a different feel, right next to innovative concepts/brands in Hall N5. CBE 2017 attracted 412,500 visitors from 80 regions and countries hailing from all buying networks, including department stores, shopping malls, supermarkets, specialty and chain stores, beauty salons, nail salons, SPA, hair salons, plastic surgery hospitals, e-commerce, manufactories, supply chain decision makers and purchasers, R&D researchers, packaging designers, design agencies, etc. ""Recognised for its dynamic growth, China Beauty Expo offers opportunities to Chinese and International exhibitors to meet qualified local and international buyers. We have created a unique program of conferences and networking opportunities to federate the worldwide beauty industry. The mission of the show is to reaffirm every year its leadership in Asia and to federate global industry players from manufacturing to finish products and distribution,"" states Ying Sang. China Beauty Expo has known a huge increase recently in quality and numbers and is the impressive demonstration that the Chinese market is moving fast and catching up with the rest of the world. Chinese companies are innovating and Chinese brands are coming into the global market with unlimited means in terms of people, money and willpower. Beauty and mobile devices The Chinese market is increasingly led by mobile devices with the boom of online/mobile transactions in the last 2 years (+62,2% in 2016). Chinese consumers were late adopters but jumped from cash to mobile payments. WeChat has become a dominent player with over 1.1 bilion users (as of January 2017) and offers features such as payments, shopping and exchange platform for users, on top of social media features. In practice, it means that an individual can become a cosmetic retailer in just a few clicks. Testifying of this phenonemon the Hall dedicated to E-Commerce and WeChat welcomed brands exclusively available on the platform with the example of Mageline being the biggest brand on WeChat today!"
Middle East: Luxury in the age of digitalisation,"""Internet is instrumental in transforming GCC luxury consumers who now are very aware of labels, prices, trends and products, and can find almost any item on the web. Faced with this level of volatility and exigence, we shouldn't push these consumers, but instead let them pull,"" explains Anthony Chalhoub, Co-CEO of the Chalhoub Group, one of the main distributors of luxury products in the region. Indeed, regional prospects are exciting: although e-commerce in the region has been lagging at 2.6% of total retail sales vs 7% globally in 2015, with luxury products' online sales amounting to only US$200-US$230 million and 2.5% of the segment's total sales in the GCC, the e-commerce contribution to the Gulf high-end market is expected to reach a total value of US$1.5 billion within four years, driven by young demographics, more value-conscious consumers and ambitious digital pure players. The GCC is at a demographic turning point. People under 30 - Generation Y (also known as millennials, born between 1975 and 2000) and Generation Z (born in 2000 and onwards) - now form half of the population. However, despite their young age, GCC millennials and Gen-Zers have a high disposable income, and live in some of the world's richest countries. These generations are extremely digital savvy, digital tools and media are part of their way of life. Many young consumers have never known any other type of interaction with brands but through digital channels. Mobile apps, websites and social media are their first and most important touchpoints. This digital inclination fuses with higher levels of education and frequent travels to give GCC millennials, in particular, sophistication, assurance and voice. Their knowledge of international trends, pricing and labels, allows them to pass quick and confident judgement - which they readily share. Like their peers all around the globe, Arab youth want to make an impact. For example, beyond quality, heritage or status, young Arabs now look at brands from different perspectives, such as social responsibility. ""Regional luxury players have no choice but to affirm their presence, speak and interact with their audience in a very honest and transparent manner - and almost in real time. Modern Arab clients also expect us to have e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, and we have to give them what they are looking for. We all have a lot to do, from adapting our websites so that they are user-friendly and accessible, to training our teams to be fully involved in the omnichannel, as the store and the digital properties now must complement one another - all the while protecting the brand's DNA. It's a learning curve, but in one way or another, we are all moving forward in that direction,"" adds Anthony Chalhoub. For the Chalhoub Group, the omnicanal seems to be the only alternative to satisfy the consumer. Retailers must offer a unique and extraordinary experience in the shop, allowing consumers to touch and test, exactly what the online media cannot offer. In parallel, they must redouble efforts on the net. For brands, full-fledged social media strategies, influencer marketing and content/context marketing should help offer customers the complete, seamless experience that they seek. ""Our strategy is to get a better knowledge of our audience, avoiding the 'spray and pay' habit to rather initiate a real dialogue with them, both physically and digitally - because the future of luxury cannot be one of the two: consumers' experience must seamlessly connect offline and online. To be truly omnichannel means to stop focusing on the way to deliver products and services, and to put customers at the centre instead. We are at the beginning of this digital disruption of the luxury retail industry. To be truly omnichannel means to stop focusing on the way to deliver products and services, and to put customers at the centre instead. We are at the beginning of this digital disruption of the luxury retail industry. Tomorrow, there will be fewer flagship stores, offering a uniquew, outstanding, and better customer experience; and probably more community stores, offering simultaneously a personal contact with the consumers and a digital connection - which will allow the customer to access a broad choice and navigate solid, relevant e-commerce and m-commerce platforms,"" concludes Patrick Chalhoub - Co-CEO, Chalhoub Group."
China Beauty Expo opens 22nd edition in Shanghai,"China Beauty Expo 2017 will host about 3,000 exhibitors (vs. 2,568 in 2016) on over 250,000 sqm of exhibition space, among those will be more than 1,200 international players from 26 countries and regions (increase of 90% in two years), including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK and USA. International exhibitors include numerous renowned players such as Fiabila (France), Intercos (Italy), Cosmax (Korea), Kolmar (Korea), LG (Korea), Symrise (Germany), L'Oréal (France), and Shiseido (Japan). France has been chosen as the Country of Honour for this year's edition. ""The appointment further cements the ongoing collaboration between CBE and France. French exhibitors will use CBE as an international platform to showcase the latest and best of beauty products, technology and services from France,"" explain the organisers. French beauty brands are gathered in hall E2 under the Cosmetic Valley flagship and in hall E1 to hall E7 where more than 800 French brands are hosted in their distributors' stands.

All that glitters: Japan 'nailists' turn manicures into art,"The nail artist - whose designs are finding Internet fame - was one of the chief attractions at last week's Tokyo Nail Forum, where catwalk models flashed their electric-pink digits and visitors dressed up their fingers in almost every imaginable way. The event was held on 15-17 May 2017 within the Beautyworld Japan tradeshow in Tokyo. Glow-in-the-dark nails, glittery blue ones with red flames, nails with yellow smiley faces and unicorns were all on offer. Or how about turning your hands into a recreation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves? ""People tell me my design is like a fusion of Japan and the US,"" said the manicurist, who moved to Los Angeles several years ago. ""I say it's Tokyo-meets-Hollywood."" Nail art is taking off in the US and is already popular in China and South Korea. But beauty-conscious Japan is ground-zero for the business. The domestic market has doubled in a decade to 220 billion yen ($1.98 billion) annually, according to the Japan Nailist Association (JNA), which said there are nearly 25,000 nail salons across the country. It's been growing since Japan was introduced to US-made artificial nails about four decades ago. ""Japanese manicurists are very detail oriented and always want to improve their skills,"" said JNA board member Mihori Kinoshita on the sidelines of the three-day nail show. ""That may be linked to the Japanese attention to craftsmanship."" But what really super-charged the sector was the introduction of a soft gel that lasts for up to two months, far longer than traditional manicures which start chipping in about a week, said Koji Kawamoto, president of an Osaka-based nail product manufacturer. Mr Kawamoto has participated in the Tokyo Nail Forum for two decades. ""At first there were just a few companies doing this but the market has grown a lot over the years,"" said the industry veteran. ""The number of manicurists has skyrocketed,"" he added. Some 60 exhibitors had booths at the show, advertising nails adorned with stones, ribbons, flowers or ultra-long talons that appeal to visitors like Mizuho Mobu. The 25-year-old manicurist sported aqua-green claws encrusted with fake diamonds that cost 12,000 yen and took three hours to apply. Many designs take several hours or more to complete and cost 10,000 yen and up. Most clients are women although nail art is also popular among some men who like to paint their nails the colour of favourite sports teams on special occasions. Hand-drawn paintings are also a big hit in Japan. But some people don't have the patience, prompting Britney Tokyo to make some of her designs available in a quick and easy sticker format. ""Painting was also popular in the US as well until last year but now fewer people want to spend such a long time waiting,"" she said. ""Customers don't want to hang around for two or three hours."" In nail-art as in manga and animated movies, Japan influences the rest of Asia, from South Korea to China, explains Mihori Kinoshita. ""We built the industry. I remember doing a seminar in Taiwan 25 years ago when this art was beginning to interest other Asian countries. Then I went to teach in Shanghai and Hong Kong (China). Students also come in Japan from other Asian countries to learn more aboit nail art."""
"Millennial beauty consumers embrace 'the natural look,' finds Mintel","While Millennial consumers are slightly less likely to prefer the natural look, they are more likely (71 percent) to actually wear a natural makeup look than female consumers overall (68 percent). The majority of Millennial women report spending just 20 minutes or less (59 percent vs 68 percent overall) on their regular beauty routine and one-fifth (18 percent) say their beauty routine consists of four or less steps. Usage of cosmetics products that are essential to the natural makeup look have also been on the rise among younger consumers over the past five years*. Indeed, nearly half (46 percent) of women aged 22-39 use eyebrow pencils today, up 9 percent since 2011 (37 percent); four in five (79 percent) are using mascara compared to 73 percent five years ago; and 77 percent of these consumers say they use lip care products compared to 73 percent who said the same in 2011. But don't confuse the natural look with the no-makeup trend as nearly half (46 percent) of Millennial women say they feel more confident when they spend time on their appearance. ""Short beauty routines underscore that Millennials are strapped for time and emphasize efficiency, highlighting the importance of products that can be applied quickly and easily, as well as those that can multitask,"" said Margie Nanninga, Beauty and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Mintel research indicates that Millennials are results-driven in their beauty routines as beauty consumers in this generation are most likely to prioritize products that provide good results (58 percent) and to purchase products based on their benefits (43 percent). Further highlighting trends toward simplicity, two in five (40 percent) Millennial beauty consumers also look for products that are easy to use. However, while one third (34 percent) of Millennial women look for products they usually use, nine percent are influenced by interesting packaging or design when purchasing beauty products. While ethical claims are further down on the list of concerns for Millennial beauty consumers, these claims are more important to Millennials than they are to other generations. Indeed, Millennial beauty consumers are more likely to look for products that have natural ingredients (25 percent vs 23 percent overall), are environmentally-friendly (12 percent vs nine percent overall), ethically-sourced (seven percent vs five percent overall) and those that donate a portion of proceeds to charity (six percent vs four percent overall). Younger adults also seem to be more experimental and adventurous when it comes to nature-based ingredients in their beauty and personal care products. Mintel research highlights that female skincare consumers aged 18-34 are more likely than female consumers overall to be interested in skincare products containing ingredients such as seaweed (52 percent vs 42 percent overall), ginseng (48 percent vs 37 percent overall), sandalwood (29 percent vs 23 percent overall) and fermented ingredients (28 percent vs 19 percent overall). ""Beauty and personal care brands would do well to focus on natural offerings as a way to differentiate in a saturated market. Products that have clear, straightforward packaging that highlight the natural ingredients will help set the product apart and help push beauty and personal care consumers out of their comfort zones,"" continued Nanninga."
Nail polish: tomorrow's trends according to IL Cosmetics,"Premium Beauty News - After years of euphoria, the global market of nail polish really seems to be experimenting a serious slowdown. We have witnessed a 50% contraction in the last three years! How do you explain this phenomenon and what is your outlook for the future? Jean-François Harpes - Like any other market, it is also a cyclical market that undergoes increasing and decreasing phases. From our internal forecasting / market trend analysis we know how to quantify the time lapse between each cycle, and identify the different product types that consumers a looking for during each phase of the nail polish cycle. Hence we know that a consumer will look for long-lasting formulas, classic shades and that she won't buy as many products during a declining phase. On the contrary, the growth phase trend is marked by an explosion of colours, special effects, and gimmicks. The consumer is seeking variety and wants to change products often. However, during a phase of a comeback of colour, it is necessary to be able to propose more convenient, easy-to-use systems, which do not compromise market standards for essential parameters such as gloss, long hold, freshness, and overall manicure durability. Premium Beauty News - So you believe that this current period of decline, will soon be followed by a sharp rise? Jean-François Harpes - Absolutely, confirmed signs of interest in colours and special effects are already on the market, and this rise advances the beginning of a recovery of the nail polish market. We are entering the increasing phase of a new cycle, driven by a wave of trend-setter brands in the market. It should be noted that, traditionally, trend-setter brands used to come from USA. Now, there is a shift in the market and trend-setter brands are coming from Europe, especially UK, which is driving new trends. Today IL Cosmetics is working with each of them. It is clear that we strongly believe in the market's recovery, and that is why we are investing to expand our conditioning capacities. At the end of this year our capacity will be of 350 million units per year to reach 500 million units per year at the end of June 2018. Premium Beauty News - You are putting yourself in optimal conditions to have the best industrial and technical assets to meet market demand by helping trend-setters to make the right choices! Jean-François Harpes - A lot of brands want to impose themselves in the market and slowly rise into the trend-setter category as well. However, becoming a trend-setter is not always that obvious and there are several variables that need to be considered and mastered to be successful at it. For example, it is essential to be able to rely on suppliers that have a good know how of the market and strong R&D capacities that can guide the launch of the right product at the right time. Because it is not just about having ""THE"" good idea. It's about being able to materialize the idea from the concept to the final product in a very short time. This is one of the reasons why having the possibility of offering Full Service options is obviously more interesting for these trend-setters. A complete integration allows a faster go-to-market reducing time and effort between concept creation, product development, production and filling. This Full Service offer also allows a guarantee in overall quality. Not only in terms of the quality of the finished product and its performance but also in the quality of the process, controlled through the entire supply chain. If you add to this, competitive prices and modern facilities that guarantee both high production capacities and the flexibility that a trend-setter needs for a rapid reaction to a product that will be launched in the market for the first time... then you have the winning ticket! Premium Beauty News - Your strong point remains an excellent knowledge of the market and your ability to anticipate? Jean-François Harpes - That's right! Today, between 20 and 25% of nail polishes worldwide are produced by ILCosmetics. We are continuing to strengthen our position in the nail polish market. In other words, we are ready for the restart of the market, the first signs of which we can feel. Our deep understanding of the nail polish cycle gives us an anticipation advantage. This, combined with strong investments in R&D, enables the translation of future market trends into exclusive product developments, patented technologies and innovations adapted to serve what consumers are looking for."
France: Online cosmetics sales grew by 21 percent in 2016,"While the French prestige beauty market declined in 2016, partly due to a sharp drop in tourist visits following terror attacks in the country, online sales have steadily increased since 2014. ""The strong growth of online beauty sales alone brought 1 point of growth to the whole sector. In a context of market downturn, this trend is particularly important since it is durable and robust enough to lean against the general tendency observed in 2016,"" commented Mathilde Lion, European Beauty Expert at The NPD Group. According to The NPD Group, online sales account for 5% of total prestige beauty sales in France, much lower than other markets, such as sports goods or toys. It is also far from the UK, a much more connected market where online beauty sales represent 11.5% of total sales. This fact suggests there still a huge room for growth in France, even though the country is far ahead of Spain (1.4%) and Italy (1.5%). Skincare is the segment that generates the largest share of online sales, before perfumes and makeup. According to The NPD Group, the most purchased product online (in units) is a skincare, while in physical stores the first skincare product only arrives in 25th position. However, when we look at growth rates, makeup products show the strongest momentum with sales growing by more than 30% in 2016. The Christmas season is the biggest driving force for online prestige beauty sales since 43% of the turnover of the internet channel is concentrated in the last quarter of the year while the Christmas season sales just account for a third in physical stores. Today, all major prestige beauty retailers run their own online shops. Prestige brands have also launched their own e-shops. According to The NPD Group, e-commerce allows for more aggressive marketing strategies. Far from competing with brick-and-mortar shops, ""flash"" and other online exclusive offers allow to better capture consumers in an omni-channel strategy. ""Brick-and-mortar retailers remain key points of sale for products such as fragrances or foundations. E-commerce helps maintain and improve the customer's experience with a new, more comfortable, more flexible and often richer point of sale offering a wider choice and more promotions,"" concluded Mathilde Lion."
The makeup craze reaches young German women,"From a general point of view, the study shows that cosmetics help young people to have more control over themselves and their own bodies. 85 percent of adolescents and young adults say they use cosmetic products in order to feel more confident. It the same for colour cosmetics. Younger German women do not make any compromises when it comes to their appearance - everything has to be perfect and many of them won't leave the house anymore without makeup. The study finds that 67 percent of 14- to 21-year-old women say that highlighting their eyes is very important and that mascara is an indispensable companion for them in daily life. They apply mascara every day, some of them even multiple times a day. Some of them even say the brush for their lashes is almost more important than a toothpaste or a deodorant. Many young consumers own several mascaras and decide which one to use depending on the occasion. A student participant said: ""I have three types of mascaras - one for everyday, one waterproof, when we have sports, for example, and in the summer, and then another one, a large brush, for the big event"". For young women, eye makeup has more than just one function in the daily routine: on the one hand, it helps to improve someone's aesthetics and to accentuate one's own femininity, on the other hand, it acts as a deliberate eye-catcher, especially towards the other sex. While many young women use mascaras and nail polishes as a stepping stone into the world of cosmetics (first experiences are often made by 11-year-olds), the first use of lipsticks usually happens later in the transition to adulthood, the study finds. ""Accentuating the lips makes many women at a young age uncomfortable, as they do not feel grown up enough. Red lips are seen as seductive, and are viewed by most young women as 'over the top' for a daily routine. The fear of looking 'cheap' also prevents especially young girls from intensively using lipstick,"" says IKW. Wearing lipstick is therefore mainly popular on special occasions, or on a ""bad hair day"", when attention should be drawn away from something that is not perfect. ""Adolescents place a lot of importance on their outer image. 60 percent of them stated that they generally believe that it is possible to read a person by their appearance. Puberty is a very unsettling phase in a person's life which brings with it a feeling of loss of control and this is what the young adults are fighting against. Using cosmetics makes them feel more confident and deodorant and acne creams are seen as indispensable everyday essentials."" explains Ines Imdahl, owner and managing director of Rheingold Salon. ""As far as colour cosmetics are concerned, while adolescents often wear decorative products such as mascara and nail polish from quite an early age, other products such as lipsticks only become important a few years later, when emphasising femininity plays a more important role."""
France: Perfumes and cosmetics exports pass the 12 billion euro mark,"The cosmetics industry remains a major pillar of French foreign trade. In 2016, the trade surplus in the cosmetics sector reached 9.2 billion euros, ranking cosmetics as the second most performant sector after the aeronautics. ""The French cosmetics industry continues to grow its international reputation by combining its strong assets, including innovation a reputation of high-quality,"" says Patrick O'Quin, President of the French Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA). However, French exports score very differently from one geographical area to the other. Dynamism in North America and Asia has offset the slowdown in other areas. While Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy remain among the top 5 countries where France exports the most, the total amount of exports in these four countries tends to slow down. French exports to European countries outside the European Union (-3.5%) continue to decline, mostly because of the drop of exports to Russia (-13%), which is linked to the rubble weakness that had a positive impact on local brands but not on foreign imports. However, sustained growth in North America offset the slowdown in Europe. Exports rose in all the three North American countries: United States (+8.5%), Canada (+4.5%) and Mexico (+4%). Exports to Asia grew by almost 10% in 2016, including China (+15%), Singapore (+13%), South Korea (+18%) and Japan (+4%). While Asia passed through some difficulties in 2015, last year marked a real recovery throughout the zone. ""The growth remains strong in China despite, regulations that are not adapted to the constant innovations in this product categories,"" explains the FEBEA. Asia now accounts for 17% of French cosmetics exports. Exports to Latin America (-7.2%) and the Middle East (-5.9%) were down significantly. According to the FEBEA, declines in the Middle East (including Saudi Arabia, -18% and United Arab Emirates, -5.8%) are linked to the evolution and increasingly complexification of local regulations, but also the economic transition linked to lower oil prices. Exports to North Africa were also down (-3.6%), mainly due to a -27% drop of exports to Egypt, linked to the very bad economic situation in the country. Skin care and fragrances account for 3/4 of French exports in the beauty category (43.4% for skin care and 31.3% for perfumes). ""High-end prestige brands remain popular around the world, and pharmacy brands are accelerating their penetration,"" said Virginie d'Enfert, FEBEA's Director of Economic, Environmental and International Affairs. However, figures published by the FEBEA do not tell anything about the evolution of France's share of the global market. While French brands remain in high demand worldwide, they are facing increased competition, particularly in Asia with the rise of Korean brands, and in the makeup category, the world's most dynamic beauty market, where new players are sky-rocketing based on innovative distribution and marketing methods. As far as competitiveness is concerned, the latest annual survey by Coe-Rexecode (September 2016), conducted among major European, American, Japanese and Chinese buyers about their perception of the characteristics of foreign products, found that the image of French hygiene and beauty products was declining in particular because of a very strong increase of perceived prices. A problem that does not affect luxury brands but can impact the sales of the most common products."
Athleisure trend moves into make-up,"In the U.S., prestige makeup sales increased by 11 percent to $7.6 billion in the 12 months ending February 2017, accounting for over 80 percent of total industry gains [1], according to global information company The NPD Group. Growth in foundation, primers, eye brow, and lip colour products, as well as those formulated to be long-lasting and waterproof, are playing into the trend. ""In today's image-driven society, the bar has been raised to maintain a perfected 'natural' appearance virtually around the clock,"" said Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst, The NPD Group. ""With heightened focus on appearance, the door opens for manufacturers and retailers to fill the need for consumers seeking increased usage of beauty products that can hold up to the rigors of our active lives - including a workout - to look good before, during, and after working out."" Foundation sales grew by 8 percent in the US during this period, driven by long wear foundation and those with added benefits. Long wear foundation sales increased by 13 percent, while basic foundation saw a decline. Concealer sales increased by 17 percent and powder by 7 percent, the latter which has now surpassed blush sales. Completing the makeup package, growth in eye brow makeup accelerated to 31 percent and lip colour sales increased by 18 percent. According to The NPD Group, makeup has seen sales increases for products designed specifically to help makeup last; primer sales for the face (+16 percent), eyes (+6 percent), and even lips (+23 percent) have grown. Waterproof mascara (+16 percent) and eyeliner (+7 percent) led the gains in their respective categories. To freshen up after a workout, dry shampoo sales increased by 66 percent [2]."
Segmentation increases on US natural and organic personal care market,"""As the US natural and organic personal care products market is becoming increasingly competitive, brands are taking a segmented approach and / or investing in labels to differentiate their products in a crowded marketplace,"" explains Ecovia Intelligence. According to the market research firm, ""segmentation is occurring whereby natural and organic brands are targeting specific consumer segments."" Dedicated ranges for baby care, expectant mothers and men are already established, however new brands are focusing on more targeted segments such as teenage girls and health enthusiasts. One such example is the Good For You Girls brand. Brands are also developing natural and organic ranges for specific applications. A number of such anti-ageing skincare products are now available. Brands like Tata Harper and REN have introduced anti-pollution skincare products that protect and heal skin from air pollutants. Another illustration: the Canadian company Novia Scotia Fisherman has developed natural skincare products for extreme weather conditions. Ethical labels are also becoming prominent in the personal care market. The butterfly logo of Non-GMO Project Verified, well-established in the food industry, is making headway on natural and organic personal care products. Almost 500 products are now certified, confirming no genetically modified ingredients are in product formulations. Andalou Naturals, Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, and EO Products are some of the highest adopters of this scheme. Fairtrade, vegan and gluten-free labels - as well as the traditional natural and organic labels - are also becoming more visible on personal care products. ""Thus, it is becoming increasingly common to see three or more labels on product packs,"" said Ecovia Intelligence. ""The question is how these trends will sustain themselves as the market evolves,"" concludes Ecovia Intelligence who will enter more in details on this subject at the upcoming North American edition of the Sustainable Cosmetics Summit, which be will be hosted at the Park Central New York on 3-5th May 2017."
Natural make-up is growing in popularity,"According to a recent survey by US beauty brand Kari Gran, 49% of US women say it is important to them the makeup products they purchase are all-natural (after hair care, 51%, and skin care, 57%). Moreover, the survey found that 55% of women asked read product labels prior to purchases in order to avoid some specific ingredients, while this number was 62% amongst millennials. [1] This month Swiss natural cosmetics brand Weleda became the latest to branch out into make-up, with a range of three tinted lip balms. Containing organic shea butter and jojoba oil and mineral pigments, the balms are designed to smooth and soften lips, while providing sheer colour and a hint of gloss. While Weleda have just dipped their toes into the natural make-up market, there are many brands offering full ranges of products that claim to be natural, organic and/or eco-friendly. It is certainly for foundations that this type of claim is the most common. Mineral makeup brand bareMinerals, for instance, claims that its product is ""so pure you can sleep in it."" The brand's loose mineral powder contains just five ingredients and offers SPF 15 sun protection. However, mineral powders are not the only offer for this segment. Dr. Hauschka, which recently expanded its makeup offering in celebration of the brand's 50th year, now offers a liquid foundation in seven shades and a compact powder coming in three shades, silicone and mineral oil-free and NaTrue labelled. Concerns about substances applied around the mouth - especially with regard to lead contamination, even though it's only a matter of miniscule quantities - is one of the driving forces behind the development of natural lipstick. Weleda's tinted lip balms claim to provide a natural look, while German brand Lavera promises something more dramatic with its ""Beautiful Lips"" range. Dr. Hauschka's new colour cosmetics range is consistent with a more general trend in natural make-up consisting in providing additional care benefits. Dr. Hauschka's organic mascara thus contains rose petal wax to protect lashes, as well as black tea extract to soothe the delicate eye area. British makeup mineral brand Lily Lolo has developed ranges for all skin types with ingredients ""proven to nourish and protect the skin"". The brand's eyeshadows feature 27 highly-pigmented colours with formulas promising not to irritate sensitive skin. Founded by make-up artist Rosie-Marie Swift, RMS Beauty offers a range of luxurious products, claiming to be non-toxic and nourishing. The ""Un-Cover-Up"" concealer is designed to hydrate the skin, while camouflaging imperfections and redness. Eventually, let's mention Tata Harper's Lip and Cheek tint, which combines two products in one. The range of three colours are designed to create a sheer, natural effect, and the ""volumising"" formula claims to plump the skin."
South Korea's skin care and make-up trends decoded,"According to the market research firm, facial skincare accounts for more than half (51%) of the total market share with US$6.5 billion in retail sales and a projected 5.8% CAGR [1] over the next five years to reach US$7.2 billion by 2020. Much of the success of the facial skincare category is in part due to the abundance of new product development and the fact that more than two thirds (68%) of total skincare product launches in South Korea 2015-2016 [2] were facial skincare products, according to Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD). Following facial skincare, colour cosmetics makes up the second largest beauty category in the South Korean market, valued at US$2.3 billion in 2017. Mintel research indicates that the market is supported by an active and engaged consumer base with per capita spend on colour cosmetics in South Korea at US$45 in 2017, compared to US$43 in the UK and US$37 in the US [3], and more than double the global average per capita spend of US$21. With a projected CAGR of 8.1% over the next five years, the market is estimated to reach US$2.8 billion by 2020. According to Jane Jang, Senior Beauty Analyst at Mintel, 2017 will be the year of extreme segmentation for facial skincare and products will become increasingly targeted and multi-functional, responding to the needs of knowledgeable and demanding consumers. As lines are blurring in every possible way to deliver new experiences and create continuous excitement around skincare, Mintel expects hybrid concoctions - such as daily exfoliating moisturisers, anti-wrinkle whitening tone-up creams and lightweight nourishing oil serums - to emerge, as well as transformative textures, like powder-to-serum, oil-to-foam and water-to-cream. ""A strong focus on quality and safety supports a fascination for natural ingredients, in line with 'hanbang', the ancient Korean herbal medicine,"" adds Jane Jang. According to Mintel GNPD, 69% of facial skincare launches in 2016 featured herbal/botanical claims in South Korea. Furthermore, the sheet mask craze does not seem to be slowing down. Moving beyond basic hydrating benefits, sheet masks and patches are now designed for each part of the body and every member of the family, babies included, to target every possible need and to be used on the most specific occasions. As far as colour cosmetics are concerned, South Korea's make-up rituals is focusing on lips and complexion. According to Mintel GNPD, lip colour launches accounted for 30% of all colour cosmetics launches in South Korea in 2016, compared to a global average of 27%. This is followed by foundations and fluid illuminators, which accounted for 16% of colour cosmetics launches in South Korea. "" The boom of hybrid formats has spawned a variety of new lip products, like lip syrups, lip crayons, lip-quids and gel sticks,"" says Jane Jang. Furthermore, South Korean brands are increasingly focusing on gels, jellies, mousses and watery oils to enhance consumers' sensorial experiences. Actually, the trend for hybrid and transforming textures and formats is borrowed from skincare. Mintel, eventually notes that while cushion compacts have been a Korean success story for the past few years, they are increasingly becoming a trend in Western markets. From October 2013-September 2014, 80% of the global launches of cushion compacts took place in Asia Pacific, while 20% of launches occurred in Europe and the US. By October 2015-September 2016, the tables have turned and 46% of global cushion compacts launches were in Asia Pacific and 54% in Europe and the US. New launches in South Korea include multi-functional skincare claims (such as moisturising, anti-ageing, whitening and UV protection); foundation-like properties; and hygiene and application innovations. ""The popularity of South Korean beauty products is due to their high performance combined with fun packaging and sensorial cues, as well as affordable prices. By gaining the attention of bloggers, vloggers and the media, the K-beauty wave is spreading to retailers outside of Asia. While colour cosmetics will be the active innovation area to cater to an increasing number of sophisticated beauty consumers, facial skincare remains the real powerhouse for K-beauty,"" concluded Jane Jang."
"MakeUp in Asia welcomed nearly 2,800 visitors last week in Seoul","Rebranded MakeUp in Asia, the latest edition of the B2B event dedicated to the makeup industry in Asia took place on 05-06 April 2017 at the Conrad Hotel in Seoul. With 55 exhibitors, from makers of make-up formulas to packaging and make-up accessories suppliers, the event was offering quite enough to suit all quests. ""As of 10:00 am on Wednesday, April 5, we could clearly feel that this 4th edition was going to be an excellent vintage. At 09:00 am, several hundred people were already gathered and waiting in front the exhibition entrance and couldn't wait for the doors to open,"" said the organisers. At the opening, a good part of visitors deciding to visit the show on both levels of the Conrad Hotel Seoul, while others rushed to the 6th floor of the venue to attend the first morning conferences. Over the two days, the event gathered nearly 2,800 people visitors, a rise of four hundred more people compared to 2016, thus coming down to an average of 44 visitors per exhibitor. ""An all-time record for the show and, probably the best performance of all BtoB events dedicated to the beauty industry in Asia,"" claimed the organisers. A total of 1,700 people took part to the 14 conferences and round tables bringing together some 25 speakers. One of the most attended was undoubtedly the one dedicated to the cushions with a conference room packed with three hundred people. According to the organisers, conferences focused on economic trends in the Asian make-up industry and across the world were also very successful, so as round tables on Australia and Halal products."
Trends: Perfumes are going green,"The creation team worked on different home fragrance, candle, and eaux de toilette compositions to illustrate this colour's creative possibilities. The combination of 'green' and sweet notes nourishes the base of the Vert Gourmand, Pomme verte, and Figolu candles. Then, pine or sandalwood notes are used for the Canopée, Sève des sens, and Griffe de sorcières creations. Home fragrances for ceramic, wood chip, or polymer bead materials. Ultimately, the three women's, men's, and mixed perfumes, Nymphea Alba, Trèfle zesté, and Haldri, embody in turn fertility, with iris notes, the tonicity of morning dew with lemon and woody notes, or the mystery of an ancestral forest with pistacia. ""Green is an active trend that is present in many fields. In perfumery, the note smells modern and is usually used by niche brands. Ex Nihilo has just released Viper Green for the Russian market, and Tom Ford has launched an evocative collection with Vert Bohème, Vert de fleur, Vert d'encens, and Vert des bois,"" explains Isabelle Ferrand, Director of Cinquième Sens."
Halal cosmetics market expected to meet continuous growth,"Adoption of vegan, natural and organic products by younger consumers wing to the supposed risks associated with conventional beauty-care products is also expected to fuel demand for ethical products. Increasing number of Muslims gaining higher education level is another factor for the shifting trends and usage of products perceived as being safer and of higher-quality. These consumers are worried about the ingredients used in conventional personal care and beauty products and try to avoid substances they view as potentially harmful. Furthermore, some Muslims consumers are especially interested to shop for personal care and beauty-care brands that are sharia compliant and prefer not use products containing substances such as pork fat, non-halal animal derivatives, and alcohol. According to Grand View Research, this combination of factors would favour eco-ethical modern consuming behaviours and would drive the overall growth of the halal cosmetics market over the next nine years. ""With the help of advertisements and promotion incentives offered by companies, the level of consumer consciousness has increased in the recent past and is fostering the growth of these segments in relatively smaller countries,"" explains the market research firm. However, the halal certification is not another natural or environmentally friendly label. Indeed, silicone-based polymers such as methicone and dimethicone are considered sharia compliant and are widely used as anti-foaming agents in skin care applications. Polyethylene glycol, hexylene glycol, butylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and ethoxydiglycol are some other ingredients that are considered to meet sharia prerequisites and may be used in halal beauty care formulations. The growth of the overall demand is also largely driven by a growing number of Muslim women trying to integrate religious observance with fashion developments along with rising purchasing power of these consumers. As far as product categories are concerned, Grand View Research forecasts skin care products to witness the highest CAGR [1] of 12% over the forecast period (2014-2025). Actually, according to the market research firm, consumers are very sensitive about the quality of the substances they widely apply on their skin and they may consider safer to use sharia compliant beauty care items over their conventional counterparts. To date, the demand for halal certified items has witnessed the most significant increase in the skin care as well as in the hair care categories. In 2015, the hair care category accounted for over 15% of the overall halal beauty revenue share. The Asia Pacific region is expected to witness an estimated CAGR of 12.6% over the forecast period (2014-2025). South East Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are expected to witness significant growth owing to rising Muslim population along with large untapped potential in developing economies. The Middle East & Africa region is anticipated to witness significant growth owing to the local domination of Islamic ethos. Lack of certification body in the region is expected to attract industry participants from developed regions such as the U.S., UK and Germany. The region accounted for over 17% of the overall halal beauty revenue in 2015."
Social networks: Chinese KOLs have become crucial for cosmetics brands,"Among the speakers at the conference, which focused on the theme ""Crack the Codes"", there was Melilim Fu (real name傅沛 Fu Pei), a Chinese KOL who came from Beijing with her American boyfriend and associate, Elijah Whaley, who is specialized in marketing content, and with whom she created her makeup video platform. Since August 2015, Melilim Fu has posted about thirty makeup tutorials and a thousand pictures, and offered twelve live streaming sessions. With her blue or pink-dyed hair, coloured lenses, and strong makeup, Melilim Fu chose to stand out in a world of beauty videos dominated by light-skinned Koreans, and where Chinese women are still scarce, to her. ""I am a makeup artist, and even if I may draw inspiration from the Western world and Japan, my top priority is to help and guide Chinese women discovering makeup, and make them feel self-confident,"" Melilim Fu explains. If, when she started, her videos could shock Chinese web users more keen on lightness and discretion, they are now widely accepted by a fast-changing clientele. Contacts with her public are crucial, she emphasizes. ""I answer all questions, and our exchanges can get very personal. My generation – I was born in 1991 – is made of people who grew up in one-child families and are eager for interactions."" On Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, Melilim Fu currently counts almost 175,000 fans. ""From the beginning, we decided to use Weibo for Melilim's content hub. This choice was a bit of a gamble, but it was a well-placed bet, as Weibo continues to gain popularity and WeChat [the most widely used mobile messaging service in China, which features many applications], remains a harsh environment for UGC [1] video distribution,"" explains Elijah Whaley, who also highlights that ""China's online video ecosystem differs from the rest of the world's, which relies heavily on Google and YouTube."" According to him, not a single video platform in China comes close to matching YouTube's popularity or sophisticated search algorithms – LeTV, one of China's most popular video sites, does not even accept UGC videos. Melilim Fu does use WeChat, although she has no official account, as well as Instagram and Snapchat, ""to experience the playfulness of filters, without particularly trying to reach a Western public, but rather Chinese people abroad."" Melilim Fu states she has worked with ""global brands like H&M, Nike, and Make Up For Ever, as well as with many small brands,"" but few Chinese brands. ""It seems consumers' trust in Chinese products is a real issue,"" she thinks. Elijah Whaley adds that ""even if we have not achieved that yet, exclusive contracts with brands are the best way for them to capitalize on a KOL,"" referring to the exclusive collaborations with global brands signed by Chinese Internet stars – whose number of fans exceeds 800,000 on Weibo – like that between humourist Papi Jiang and Shanghai-based cosmetics online retailer Lili&Beauty, or actress and singer Angelababy and Maybelline, of the L'Oréal group. The duo declares they usually work for a flat rate. ""In addition, we have recently had the opportunity to try out our e-commerce skills. Someone who sells foreign products through WeChat and Weibo offered to redirect our traffic towards these two accounts. In only seven days, we made US$25,000 sales, of which we perceived 20%,"" Elijah Whaley explains. To him, this type of collaboration can only work with brands with limited distribution channels. ""Other collaborations mainly help us gain attention and reach more people,"" Elijah Whaley continues. ""With Yes, a brand that developed a live streaming to e-commerce application, we made a one-hour live video in a shopping mall that sold the brand's products, generating a US$5,000 sales volume."" The experience, which allowed web users to react, was very positive, according to Melilim Fu. ""People told me they had the impression they went shopping with me."" These live videos are on a roll: the trend spread across China last year, so much that Maybelline organized a giant live streaming event in Shanghai with many KOLs to launch a lipstick. It is believed that China counts 344 million live broadcast users, i.e. almost half the number of web users. Two thirds of them are men, and most are under 30, according to the iResearch institute quoted by French newspaper Les Échos. The number of platforms has literally boomed over the past two years, and it is said there are almost 200 of them today. ""Just like China's TV offering, most of the content of these videos is devoid of any interest, so we have the opportunity to catch people's attention by producing quality, both live and in our recorded videos,"" Elijah Whaley underlines. To him, a well-performing KOL ""can guide a given social media platform public towards a shopping environment."" Kim Leitzes (ParkLU) shares this vision, so she recommends brands to invest time with their KOL and set up a content strategy."
Italy: Make-up and exports boost the cosmetics industry,"The Italian cosmetics market is the fourth largest in Europe, behind France, Germany and the UK. According to Cosmetica Italia, domestic consumption grew by +0.5% in 2016, reaching 9.9 billion euros (compared to 9.85 in 2015). Contrasting with this relative weak domestic demand, exports increased by more than 12.3% to reach 4.27 billion euros in 2016. Italian exports of cosmetics are mainly directed to the European Union (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom at the top) and to the United States. Looking at the various retail channels, sales in beauty salons grew by 2.1% in 2016, reaching 230 million euros, while hairdressing salons grew by 1% to reach 563 million euros. Perfume shops (which account for 20.4% of cosmetics sales in Italy) have shown signs of slight recovery (+9.0%) and the value of this channel now amounts to 2,018 million euros. Meanwhile, pharmacies appear to have reached a stalemate: cosmetics sales fell by -1%. For their part, cosmetics sales in the mass market channel, which accounts for 40% of cosmetics sales in Italy, fell by 1.1% in 2016. Finally, data from Cosmetica Italia show that the dynamism of make-up sales with lip-glosses and lip glosses growing by +8.5%, and sales of foundations and tinted creams grew by + 5%. On the other hand, sales of body care products decreased by 2% compared to 2015 reaching 1,383 million euros and 16% of the total cosmetics market."
Spain: A vigorous personal care market!,"The demand for perfumes and cosmetics in Spain grew by 3.5% in 2016 compared to the previous year. The market is experiencing a second consecutive year of growth after the collapse that followed the 2008 crisis. According to Stanpa, the Spanish association of cosmetics and perfumes manufacturers, all the market categories are on the rise, with colour cosmetics growing by 8% and perfumes growing by more than 4% in value. As far as perfumes and fragrances are concerned, most of the growth came from the selective and luxury segments (+5%), with a stronger increase from women's fragrances (+5%) than from the men's ones (+3%). Within the skin care category, which is the main category in Spain (28% of the market), sun protection products recorded a very strong growth (+9%). All the traditional retail channels are growing, with the highest growth recorded by pharmacies (+5.5%). Mass retailers still hold the higher share of the market (47%), followed by pharmacies (22%) and selective retailers (21%). Other channels, such as direct retails, beauty salons and hairdressing salons, account for 10% of sales. According to the Stanpa, online sales are experiencing a sharp deceleration with an increase of +9% in 2015 compared to +57% previously. Exports of Spanish beauty products also had a good year, reaching 3,536 million euros (+6.4% compared to 2015). In total, exports of Spanish beauty products have increased by more than 1 billion euros since 2010. The trade balance has maintained a positive balance since 2006 with a coverage rate of 129% in 2016. The European countries, with Portugal and France in the lead, account for 60% of Spain's beauty products exports, followed by the Americas (18%), in particular the United States, Mexico and Chile, then by the Middle East (6.5 per cent), Asia-Pacific (5.6 per cent) and Africa (5 per cent)."
Solid soap trendy again,"Long replaced by shower gels, solid soap is making a strong comeback in shopping baskets. This trend is revitalizing the segment. ""There has recently been a renewed interest in soap for four reasons. Consumers are wary about the undesirable substances contained in shower gels, they feel like buying more authentic products, and there is also an economic parameter, because solid soap lasts longer. Besides, it has become an ideal gift,"" explains Guillaume Fievet, Director of La Savonnerie du Midi, which gathers the La Corvette and Maitre Savon brands. In 2013, the entrepreneur purchased this company established in for several generations Marseille, France, as it was experiencing difficulties. He endeavoured to revive the two historic soap ranges of traditional Savons de Marseille: Maitre Savon, sold through mass distribution networks, and La Corvette, which had a more premium positioning and was sold in organic stores, pharmacies, and channels specialized in decoration. It has been only three years: the company grew by more than 25% in 2016, compared to 2015, and is expecting the same growth for 2017. France should gain 15 to 20%, and export 30 to 35%, to account for 12% of the revenue share, compared to 5% three years ago. ""Things are doing well abroad, because the term Savon de Marseille Traditionnel is known all around the world now, and so is Provence,"" M. Fievet explains. This global dimension might even be enhanced with INPI creating an IGPIA label (protected geographical indication for industrial and craft products), whose file is being examined. As he is very attached to the authenticity of the ""Savon de Marseille Traditionnel"" designation, M. Fievet has not waited for the label to be issued: in 2011, he contacted three other local soap factories, Marius Fabre, Sérail, and Fer à Cheval, to set up an association to defend and promote traditional Savon de Marseille. ""We wrote a charter to define this soap according to three criteria: it should be manufactured in Marseille or its region, with a traditional cauldron, and contain vegetable oils, but no additive, perfume, or colourant. These three elements provide it with its specific characteristics, and that is what makes it successful in France and around the world,"" he adds. The association has created a collective mark, Union des professionnels de savons de Marseille, which is affixed on their products, so that consumers are sure they are buying an authentic product. New solid soap users are keen on it for its economical and eco-friendly aspect (no plastic packaging), its naturalness, but also… its novelty! Indeed, many people have only ever known liquid gels. A great number of brands have already met these expectations, while new names have recently entered the market with a high-end positioning for a universal product. For example, Adduna and Daliane both rely on the same motivations, i.e. offering a range of premium natural hygiene products with cosmetic virtues made in France by craftsmen. ""The choice to go back to basics is not made by default, it is actually very active,"" asserts Codou Cissé, founder of Adduna Beauté. She could not find any satisfactory product for her fragile skin, so this young entrepreneur launched her own brand in 2014 with a range of soap made in France with the richness of the entire world (shea, olive, cocoa, coconut, sesame…). Adduna beauty soap results from cold saponification, which merely consists in mixing fats (vegetable butters and oils) with a base and transforming them into soap. The soap naturally contains glycerine, which preserves the skin's hydrolipidic film. ""Cold saponification is the best solution to preserve the moisturizing properties of our precious oil actives we select with such care,"" adds Codou Cissé. If it is only sold online right now, the Adduna range should soon be added to beauty boxes and appear on online and concept stores. ""Users are instantaneously seduced and ask me to start working on liquid, exfoliating, and shampoo versions,"" the founder rejoices. The new era of soap has reached cosmetics. The Daliane she-ass milk range created by Sylvie Dalibard comprises exfoliating, purifying, protective, and relaxing products. ""I wished to create healthy, organic, preservative-free products in synergy with she-ass milk, such an extraordinary ingredient,"" she explains. Also derived from cold saponification, Daliane products contain 42% of this precious milk (an unequalled percentage in cosmetics), and natural essential oils. The range is available in pharmacies, organic stores, and abroad. ""The attraction to quality, natural soap with beneficial actives is a well-established trend because it is related to the search of safe products,"" Sylvie Dalibard asserts. Soap is trendy. The cosmetics industry has jumped on the bandwagon, making this basic hygiene product a real skincare treatment. Similarly, in the cleaning product industry, it has made a strong comeback as a natural alternative to chemical detergents."
Cosmoprof Bologna closes 50th edition with plans for international growth,"One of the main innovations of the 50th edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna was the creation of a new B2B area dedicated to cosmetic brands with a focus in retail channels. The new Cosmoprime special area featured 151 exhibitors, 81% of them from foreign countries showcasing a large variety of cosmetic brands, from high-end mass market to prestige and niche segments. Niche and high-end brands have been presented in the Extraordinary Gallery, while the Tones of Beauty area gathered multi-ethnic beauty brands. The area, which opened simultaneously to Cosmopack, one day before the rest of the show, also hosted the CosmoTalks round tables and presentations dedicated to insights on the world of retail and the future of the beauty market. Innovative suppliers were honoured on the occasion of Cosmopack, the B2B event which involves the international beauty supply chain. The 4th edition of the Cosmopack Wall Awards contest was held on the theme ""Let's get emotional…urban poetry"", to highlight how the emotion arisen by original packaging design, by the texture of a cream or by a fragrance may drive the purchase process by final customers. An international jury voted the winners among 24 finalists: – Gotha Cosmetics for ""Bi-Metallic Eyes & Face Color Veil"", a lightweight and easy-to-apply cream for face and eyes (category Formula Make Up). – MYC Packaging Innovation for ""Transforming Eye Shadow Kajal"" an innovative packaging line for eyes and lips products (category Packaging Make Up) – Geka won the award in the category Technology for ""Bottle in Bottle Marble Mascara"", the first mascara with a ""marble-effect"" packaging. – Ancorotti Cosmetics won the award in Design category for its ""Extruded Powder"" – Pink Frogs Cosmetics won the award in the Formula Skin Care category for ""Sleeping Metallic Mask"", a facial mask rich in detox ingredients, nourishing and anti-age. – Karza won the award for the Packaging Skin Care category thanks to ""Helium"": an innovative dispenser for cosmetics, to protect the integrity of the products. – O-Pac won the Inspiration award with its product ""24h Urban Kits in Wipes"", thanks to the anti-pollution action of the micellar water. – Chromavis won the Special Avant-Garde Award with the product ""New vision eyes & lips"". Its technology combines two different textures to get different performances without any physical barriers in a single all-over product. The Cosmoprof show, which already has branches in Asia and North America, recently confirmed its partnership with Iran Beauty & Clean. Cosmoprof Bologna will be exclusive international agent of the 24th edition of this exhibition, to be held at the Teheran International Fairground from April 25. Furthermore, in September BolognaFiere Cosmoprof will start working with Feira Belleza y Salud in Bogota, Colombia, widening its reach to Latin America. ""And then we are working to develop a project that in 2019 will cover India,"" said Franco Boni, President of Bologna Fiere."
"Health concerns drive the US natural and organic personal care market, says Mintel","A new research from Mintel [1] reveals that over one third (37 percent) of consumers agree that they were buying more natural and organic personal care products in 2016 than the year prior, including 34 percent of parents with children under 18 in the household. According to Mintel, parents are clearly more likely to purchase personal care products that are natural or organic than non-parents, including hand and body lotion (53 percent parents vs 34 percent non-parents), facial skincare (51 percent parents vs 32 percent non-parents), haircare (50 percent parents vs 34 percent non-parents) and body cleansing products (48 percent parents vs 34 percent non-parents). ""Parents are information seekers when it comes to raising their kids and, therefore, could be more aware of ingredients to avoid in their children's personal care products, as well as their own,"" said Jana Vyleta, Health and Personal Care Analyst at Mintel. Furthermore, nearly seven in 10 (67 percent) natural and organic personal care consumers in the US agree they are trying to live a healthier lifestyle, compared to just over half (54 percent) of non-users. It seems trends toward health and wellness aren't just limited to diet and exercise and natural and organic personal care products could align with these ambitions as many consumers consider them safer than mainstream products (49 percent) and of higher quality (49 percent). ""Similar to how consumers who are trying to live healthier opt for fresh produce over sweets or wear a fitness tracker to monitor their activity, many also view using natural and organic personal care products as a step toward greater health. Mintel's 2017 Global Beauty Trend, 'Active Beauty,' highlights this move toward overall health and wellness, discussing how beauty brands are formulating products to help consumers in their quest for health and fitness this year,"" continued Vyleta. ""For marketers, the opportunity lies in convincing non-users by proving that natural and organic personal care products have tangible health benefits."" According to Mintel, outside of certifications, the most common way consumers know a personal care product is natural or organic is whether or not the ingredients are simple and familiar. Specifically, consumers look at the types of ingredients used (55 percent), whether or not the ingredients are easy to understand (49 percent) and whether certain ingredients are excluded (49 percent). Consumers also seem to prioritize general ingredient statements when it comes to purchasing natural and organic personal care products as claims such as 'made with all natural ingredients' (88 percent), 'no artificial ingredients' (86 percent) and 'contains organic ingredients' (81 percent) rank as some of the most important claims to natural and organic personal care consumers. However, some consumers are skeptical as 43 percent of non-users think natural and organic personal care products are a marketing scheme. Nevertheless, the younger generations seem to be more open to the category. The iGeneration [2] is less likely to view natural claims as a way for companies to charge more money (20 percent) and is most likely to take the do-it-yourself approach. Indeed, nearly one-fifth (19 percent) of iGens say they prefer to make their own personal care products as compared to just 12 percent overall. ""Consumers are more likely to consider general, simple ingredient statements as an indicator that a personal care product is natural than they are certifications. The belief that natural and organic personal care products are safe likely stems from the increasing conversations regarding potential harmful effects of ingredients used in mainstream brands,"" concluded Vyleta."
Alternative perfumery: is the game changing?,"Premium Beauty News - Alternative perfumery is recording the fastest growth rate on the market: there were more launchings in this field than in selective perfumery in 2016. It seems Esxence will be successful… do you agree? Johann Vitrey - No, actually, the niche perfumery segment is not doing that well, especially in France, because there are too many brands, and most of them are empty. The most renowned names were purchased and are doing well, but many brands quickly entered the market although they were not solid enough, which explains why they are experiencing difficulties today. Italians know how to do business with craftsmanship, but in France, arrogance has prevailed over clear-sightedness. The Esxence show will be an opportunity to sort things out for French brands. Many of them have not focused on the right issues or have not identified the right reasons. Premium Beauty News - What should we expect? Johann Vitrey - The brands that will stay have a real base: most are heritage brands. But many others went too fast and ran on empty after three of five years, as they did not have that strong a positioning or enough financial support. However, new gems will soon get noticed: they are those that will have taken enough time to install their base with a real artistic concept, like Sabé Masson, who waited until they got mature enough to go to Esxence. These brands will really be able to do business. Premium Beauty News - Markets like Russia or Europe have known a slowdown. Are there other opportunities? Johann Vitrey - The nice surprise will come from the discovery of new, very dynamic markets like Pakistan or West Africa, although brands used to stay away from them. As a matter of fact, there are 1.5 million multimillionaire people in Karachi, as well as a network of top luxury points of sale. These new buyers will be all the rage, as they have taken their time to monitor the market. Today, brands need them, so now they will be demanding. Their requirements will focus on the product quality, depending on the climate and skin types, on the customer service, which will need to go much farther than simply distributing samples, and on the customs duties. Young people in these countries were often educated in Europe. They are really open to a new type of perfumery. Codes are going to change."
"Hairceuticals, the next big trend in Brazil?","The steady growth of the dermocosmetics market in the last decade seems to have spilled into what might be an upcoming trend in beauty and personal care in Brazil: hairceuticals. Global haircare analyst at Mintel, Andrew McDougall, believes this product category will gain momentum locally in the near future. As the name implies, hairceuticals reportedly combine pharmaceutical and cosmetic properties. These products claim to deliver high-performance results to scalp and hair problems including hair loss, hair thinning and hair dryness through state-of-the-art technology and a blend of natural and medicinal ingredients. McDougall says that although hairceuticals is a concept still in its infancy in the country, it is likely to appeal to Brazilian consumers given the widespread popularity of hair ampoules and boosters in the local market. ""Our research shows that Brazilians already purchase a number of hair vitamins and supplements, indicating there is a potential audience for hairceuticals,"" he says. A growing number of trichologists – hair and scalp specialists – working in beauty salons across the country is further evidence of this particular demand for a clinical approach to hair and scalp problems. Hairceuticals already account for a significant chunk of the global hair care market. Kérastase was one of the brands that started the conversation around hairceuticals with Aminexil Force R, a six-week program to counteract hair loss launched in the 1990s. Leave-in scalp and hair concentrate Initialiste and the Densifique line – targeted at improving hair density – are some of Kérastase's latest launches in this field. Aveda's Invati has a more natural approach and claims to reduce hair loss due to breakage by 33%. In Brazil, local cosmetics distribution channels can further boost the trend, says McDougall. ""Inspired by the US and Europe, Brazilian pharmacies and drugstores are expanding their beauty and personal care offer, which might prove a powerful tool for hairceutical sales in the country."" He says economic uncertainty and price points could be sticking points initially. However, these can be overcome if the consumer is engaged and convinced by the health and beauty benefits. In the skincare market, clinically proven results and a shift towards natural ingredients have developed a loyal following in Brazil, he says: ""37% of Brazilians from higher socioeconomic groups believe that dermocosmetics are cosmetics that have a formula that is scientifically proven to be effective."" McDougall says the popularity of dermocosmetics might work in favor of haiceuticals. ""A total of 59% of Brazilian internet users look for 'sun protection' when buying dermocosmetic products. Given consumers' high interest in hair – the second largest cosmetics category in Brazil –, hairceuticals are expected to follow the same path."" Anti-pollution active ingredients are also in demand, with 37% of Brazilian consumers saying the environment has an impact on the appearance of their hair. ""Products that can tackle this problem, offer sun protection and anti-aging benefits are more likely to be successful in Brazil,"" says McDougall. According to Euromonitor, the aging population and the consequent search for anti-aging products are also setting the tone for hair care products. The market research firm has yet to track the hairceuticals segment, but based on results for clinical shampoos to treat hair loss, psoriasis, seborrhea and acute dandruff, business is growing. Between 2010 and 2015, this product category saw a 37.9% growth in retail value in Brazil."
"""Active Beauty"" emerges as a key trend for 2017 and beyond","As consumers are increasingly encouraged to exercise their bodies and brains, beauty brands can align themselves with this interest in fitness by offering products designed to meet the unique needs of active consumers. In a recently released report [1], Mintel observes that several beauty brands and products such as Sweat Cosmetics (a mineral makeup with SPF) or Eyeko's Sport Waterproof Mascara and Sport Waterproof Eyeliner already address the athleisure and athbeauty trends and new consumer expectations. In December 2016, Tarte Cosmetics launched the Athleisure Skincare & Makeup line, described as ""the yoga pants of skincare"". Mintel also points out that brands increasingly adapt their packaging to meet the new trend. Stowaway Cosmetics, for instance, describes its products as ""right-sized make-up for travel, the gym and life"". The surge of outdoor sports is also ideal for protection positioning. ""In Asia, athbeauty is positioned as sun protection for active people rather than cosmetics products. This allows companies such as Kosé to extend their ultraviolet protection claims from the face to the body, while Western sun protection brands are focussing more closely on products that provide comfort as well as protection for people with active lifestyles. Brazilian beauty companies Pink Cheeks and Lola Cosmetics have introduced products for runners and swimmers to protect their hair before and after their activities."" For 2017 and beyond Mintel forecasts a surge of beauty products that shield the hair and skin from exposure to pollution, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) light, of make-up and gym bags filled with rubberised packaging that stays pristine and of exercise clothing that sends skin temperature and hydration levels to apps with instructions about which products to release into the skin. ""Looking ahead, we will see more brands driving the 'Active Beauty' trend by launching a number of new and innovative products that not only prepare and support consumers before and during physical and mental activity, but aid in the recovery process as well. Expect to see beauty brands play with temperature and water-activated products, partner with DNA analysis to provide personalised beauty regimes and team up with retailers on athletic apparel with time-release product features,"" said Vivienne Rudd, Director of Global Insights, Beauty and Personal Care at Mintel."
Fragrances and cosmetics sales continue to surge in the Gulf countries,"The retail value of the GCC's beauty and personal care market was US$9.3 billion in 2016, an increase of 10 per cent over 2015, unveiled Euromonitor International in a recent report. Strong growth is expected over the next four years, as consumers look to collectively spend US$13.6 billion on their personal well-being in 2020, defying any notion of a market readjustment. The figures include bath and shower products, colour cosmetics, fragrances, hair care, men's grooming, skin care, and sun care, while regional growth is driven by a young and affluent population that has high awareness of fashion and beauty, boosted by media exposure. In the UAE, consumers spent US$2.1 billion on beauty and personal care in 2016 according to Euromonitor. The market is set to rise to US$2.7 billion by 2020. The top five categories are fragrances (US$642 million), colour cosmetics (US$400 million), skin care and men's grooming (both US$300 million), and hair care (US$283 million). The dynamism of the regional market is a strong asset for Beautyworld Middle East, the region's largest international trade fair for beauty products, hair, fragrances, and wellbeing, which take place from 14-16 May 2017 at the Dubai International Convention and Exhibition Centre. The 22nd edition of the three-day event is expected to feature more than 1,500 exhibitors from 60 countries. While the UAE and GCC remain its main market focus, the show is attracting a growing number of visitors from neighbouring countries. ""Beautyworld Middle East's internationality is integral to the overall success of the show, which is why we're seeing participating exhibitors and visitors from every corner of the world,"" said Ahmed Pauwels, CEO of organiser Messe Frankfurt Middle East. ""While half of the 37,000-plus beauty professionals and trade buyers are from the GCC, more and more are coming from Iran, Africa, Europe, and as far away as Australia, and North and South America."" The show's strong international flavour will also be underlined by 21 country pavilions from Argentina, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Brazil, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, UK, and the USA. Beautyworld Middle East 2017 returns after a spectacular run in 2016, when it featured 1,522 exhibitors from 60 countries, and attracted 37,184 visitors from 135 countries, 25 per cent up on the previous year."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna announces several new features for its 50th edition,"""The 50th edition is recording record numbers"", said Franco Boni, President of the BolognaFiere Group. Actually, this new edition will host 2.604 exhibiting companies (94 more than 2016) coming from 69 countries in the world. Among the 2017 exhibitors, 73% of them come from outside Italy. The exhibition is growing up to 7%, and there are great expectations on the number of visitors participating, too, with a +10% increase of online purchases to date, compared to 2016. The landmark trade show, which is organized in collaboration with Cosmetica Italia, the Italian personal care association and with the support of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development and the Italian Trade Agency (ITA), has been recognized by the Italian Ministry of Economic Department as one of Italian fairs with the highest international appeal. The next edition will confirm this leadership with 29 Country Pavilions involved in the exhibition, +16% compared to the previous edition. For the first time ever Argentina, Chile, Japan, Latvia and United Arab Emirates will exhibit. To celebrate its 50th edition, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna will inaugurate Cosmoprime a new area dedicated to the masstige and prestige markets and to niche perfumery and opening from March 16th to 19th, 2017. With 151 exhibitors (81% coming from abroad) from 28 countries, Cosmoprime meets the particular requirements of the retail sector with special initiatives with an international impact. Within Cosmoprime, The Perfume Factory will offer attendants the opportunity to visit a real perfume manufacturing chain, from olfactory composition to maceration, from filtration to filling, packing and wrapping. A limited edition fragrance will be produced, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, in collaboration with some leading suppliers including: ICR, Bormioli Luigi, Candiani, Aptar, Ima Group, Coven Egidio, Pusterla 1880 and Industrial Box. The fragrance has been created by the perfumer Luca Maffei. It is a gender-free Eau de Cologne revised from a contemporary and sophisticated viewpoint. The next Cosmoprof show will also host the first edition of Tones of Beauty, a project devoted to the multi-ethnic beauty, with cosmetic brands of ""Black & Brown"" products. Also presented for the first time at Cosmoprime, the BeOrganic area will be fully dedicated to companies producing certified organic beauty products. The number of exhibitors participating in Cosmopack, the show within the show dedicated to the supply chain of the beauty industry, is expected to grow by 8%, 50% of them coming from outside Italy and from 29 countries, including most European countries, Turkey, the USA, China, South Korea and Japan."
Are perfume brands really aware of trends?,"First, the agency worked with NPD: with their cash payment statistics, they shed a factual light on the selective market. ""It is a way to put trends analyses into perspective, compared to the reality of the market,"" Aurélie Dematons observes. ""Sometimes, we get really surprised."" For example, NPD data show that in the category of women's perfumes, floral fragrances only represent 32.5% of the products purchased, while historically, every year, they accounted for the majority of the products launched (about 60%). ""Why do we keep launching so many floral perfumes, when according to NPD data, consumers prefer oriental ones?"" Aurélie Dematons asks. Philippe Pourhashémi, founder of the Supremeye website, and journalist, designer, and talent scout in the world of fashion, is another partner of Aurélie Dematons's, who identifies channels of influences thanks to his fashion expertise. In 2016, POP was one of the most dominant of them. ""The Pop trend is a transversal trend: it can be found everywhere, in fashion, art, and perfumery."" With Pop, Aurélie Dematons describes a quick, colourful approach adopted by consumers who influence communication and packaging the same way as the olfactory strategy. ""In communication, it is characterized by a very visual, playful way to seduce today's young people, in particular on social networks, for example Instagram, which has really become a key vehicle for both major and small perfume brands,"" Aurélie Dematons explains. ""From an olfactory standpoint, it is conveyed by floral and fruity fragrances, whose top notes are designed for consumers to be attracted very fast in store,"" she adds. The Pop trend expresses an urgent need to revive freedom and good humour and be joyful again. The perfumes following this movement take the opposite course of the year 2016, when the climate was stressful due to terrorist attacks and the loss of… pop icons! The third expert consulted was Hakim Azib, founder of the Bowe studio. ""It was important to notice how packaging follows certain codes,"" Aurélie Dematons explains. As an example, the study shows a return to themes that highlight the dressmaking heritage of renowned companies. This trend is illustrated with decorations that often sport a knot (Bottega Veneta, Burberry…). ""This sort of tiny details marks the establishment and close relationship between perfumery and the DNA of the House that inspired them."" Lastly, with Annie Begnaud, founder of the Ab Agency, the study focused on the new means of expression and distribution implemented to make consumers discover products (samples accompanying the product, boxes, data targeting and cross-referencing…). Perfume trends by genre, transversal trends, 2016 news… the study conducted by Le Musc et la Plume deciphers last perfume year from all angles. ""It is designed like a reference object that is easy to read in order to understand where we come from and where we are going,"" Aurélie Dematons concludes. Study available in hard copy or as a training presentation."
MakeUp in LosAngeles: Digital natives shake up beauty trends,"The second edition of MakeUp in Los Angeles, which was held on 08-09 February 2017 at the Quixote Studios in West Holywood fulfilled all its promises with a number of exhibitors that doubled and a number of visitors that grew from 600 to 1,650 compared to the previous year. It must be said that in the makeup business, as in other sectors, California now plays a key role in innovations and trends. The 2017 edition of MakeUp in Los Angeles focused on how digital influencers are revolutionizing beauty, and how brands can harness this new power. ""The Beauty sphere is currently in a state of upheaval,"" said Leïla Rochet-Podvin, Founder of Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation, one of the experts charged with running the event's conference programme. ""Selfies, Snapchat or Instagram posts — in this new era dominated by influencers, consumers are totally 'hooked' to their smartphones, and modifying the beauty landscape."" The birthplace of big internet American companies and of the great trends of recent years, California is at the heart of these upheavals. ""Los Angeles is a true melting pot, open to a large variety of cultural influences, and packed with a lot of big influencers: celebrities, artists and designers,"" highlighted Noelle Kot, Associate, Global Marketing at Glamglow. Anastasia Soare, founder of Anastasia Beverly Hills, the epitome of these brands whose audience exploded thanks to social networks, shared her experience and explained how very good products can now gain a global fame in a very short lap of time. While TrendAnalytics has unveiled that 82% of women consider that social media have changed the definition of beauty, it is clear that all beauty brands were not equally successful in their digital strategies. Actually, while the circulation of a magazine like Glamour now reaches 2.3 million readers in the United States, the four main beauty influencers (bloggers and vloggers combined) reach an audience of 17 million people. ""A brand cannot hand over its communication to web influencers without fully rethinking its relationship with its customers,"" explained Conor Begley, co-founder at Tribe Dynamics, an agency specialising in digital marketing. ""In particular, it implies to let others tell your story,"" he added. In this context, MAC, Benefit, Too Face, Urban Decay, and MakeUp for Ever are the brands that - in the United States - have maximized the coverage provided by web influencers. Enough to feed the discussions in the lively alleys of the show! ""All the elements were present to make of MakeUp in LosAngeles a success. Top suppliers and top brands, had clearly decided to not to miss this event,"" said Sandra Maguarian, the show manager. Her only regret is that she was not able to host all the exhibitors who wanted to participate in the event because of the lack of space available. A problem that should be solved as of the 2018 edition since the organizers have already found a new exhibition venue!"
Evaluating requisites and desires of the growing skin care products market,"There is a standup geographical demand for skin lightening or skin whitening creams and lotions at and along the equator. While the residents of the colder parts of the earth and those in gulf locations exhibit a significant affinity to tanning lotions and sun protect respectively. All geographies combined, the demand figures for sunscreen lotions and creams hold a dominant share of the overall revenue in the industry. This disparity of demands among the consumer populace are more of brownie points rather than a business hurdle. It has provided the vendors with enough freedom to maintain an economical balance in their choice of ingredients for product composition. Going by the figure, Asia-Pacific contributes the maximum share of revenue to the global roundup value. There is a thin divisive line in between the desired and the healthy. As a fact, skin is the largest organ of the human body which adds the first tier of protection against foreign particles and bodies. A good skin care regime for the entire body is necessary for every human to maintain overall health. There is a dire need for a typical shift from cosmetic skin care products that only aim at temporary lightening or brightening of the skin towards more natural products that nurture the skin from within the deep layers. As per market figures, a considerable mass of global population is experiencing the necessary shift at present. However, a majority remains to overcome their economic limitations and spare a part of their expenditures on effective skin care products. In addition, the product developers face intense pressure from the social and environmental activists that do not agree with either the publicity agenda or the constituent elements of their offerings. There have been campaigns across social media and internet pinning down that there being ""fair and lovely"" is not a requisite. In other instances, the environmentalists have raised their concerns against the use of constituents derived from exotic animals or plastic compounds for delivering ""enhance beauty."" In latest news, the industry witnessed a ban on the use of microbeads as a scrubbing agent, citing it unnecessary and a menace to the environment at large. While some of the voices against the industry operations are conveniently tuned down because of their non-relevance, there are several others for which the industry has prepared an action plan. Manufacturers in this industry segment have their priorities set on catering to the core consumer desires, over their needs. The range of products that attend to the needs of a healthy skin are made available at higher prices than the rest. Prominent companies, such as Avon, Estee Lauder, and L'Oréal, have a committed base of buyers, their trust tagging along to the brand value of the products. Successful brands with high market value share the same history of teaming up with healthcare professionals and skin care experts to obtain primary customer reviews and resolve a common fix to their issues. They have leveraged strategic business acquisitions and mergers to capture the product lines with promising market potential. Small companies that venture out to introduce similar line of cosmeceuticals get a hold of local market easily but face a tough time making it big in the global commercial interface. Low marketing budgets and modest ingredients along with limited scope for research facilities for product development are the core restraining factors that make it difficult for small- to mid-sized manufacturers from shining solo. There exists a limited number of small names in the skin care products market that have managed to be consistent in their product quality, reputation, price, and yet managed to emerge as winners on global platforms. For the others, partnership with the pharmaceutical giants brings them an opportunity to improvise and enrich their portfolio. In addition, a sturdy advertising and marketing strategy helps them get recognized as a brand name. Although, seldom is the case when the prices have not hiked up post the strategic acquisition of these manufacturers. On a comparative note, the leading names in the skin care industry have felt the pulse of the regional markets. They realize that there is an opportunity to build remarkable profit margins within low-price range products. Simple compounds go into the making of these products as compared to the trademark complexes used in high-range alternatives. Low consumer expectations and the unquestioned trust on brand name helps garner remarkable profits. A sequence of latest product launches indicate that they are wary of not being able to capture the participation from midrange income consumers. These users comprise the population segment, which does not look upon skin care products as necessities to their lifestyle. With the introduction of low-priced products, the prominent industry vendors aim at inculcating a habit among their users, which can be leveraged to lure them into active participation across all market segments. According to the findings of a latest market research, the global skin care products market is bound to attain the $179 billion revenue mark by 2022. Business analysts predict the industry to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% over the rest of the forecast period 2016-2022. Adaptability and agility in response to consumption pattern aids the completion of set targets for the global industry."
Makeup continues to boost global prestige beauty sales,"Makeup continued its overall leading role in the global prestige beauty market in 2016. Sales of prestige makeup products soared by 23% in South America in 2016 (compared to +9% for prestige skincare products and +13% for prestige fragrances), by 13% in North America (compared to +3% for prestige skincare products and + 1% for prestige fragrances) and by 6% in Europe (compared to +1% for prestige skincare products and fragrances), according to data from The NPD Group. In the U.S., sales of prestige beauty products grew by 7% in 2016 (vs +6% for the overall beauty market), according to The NPD Group. The prestige beauty market was mainly driven by the increase in make-up sales (+12%) which, according to the market research firm, contributed to 76% of incremental gains of the sector in value and to 83% of the volume increase. On the other hand, sales of prestige fragrances continue to weaken, with a growth of 1% only. As far as prestige skincare sales are concerned, the U.S. market grew by 3% 2016. The trend is very similar in most markets, with consumers attracted in every product that can improve their appearance instantly including in a selfie made at any time of the day. Self-staging on social media plays a key role in this phenomenon. In a dynamic global market, France was the exception in 2016. Sales of prestige beauty products dropped by 3% compared to 2015, according to The NPD Group, the strongest decline in 10 years. Skincare sales recorded the strongest decline (-7%), while sales of perfumes and make-up dropped by 2%. The French market, which has been suffering from a sluggish economic environment for several years, was strongly hit by the decline in foreign tourist numbers in 2016 after the wake of terror attacks, explained The NPD Group. ""The Paris region accounted for two-thirds of the decline, while it is usually a driver for the market,"" Mathilde Lion, a beauty specialist at NPD, told Reuters. However, some segments of the market remained unaffected by this trend and recorded strong growth in 2016. That is the case of niche fragrances, which are continuing to grow and, in the make-up category, of products for eyebrows, lipsticks or skin luminizers."
Cosme Tokyo: A window on Japan's beauty trends,"""The show has grown by 30% in exhibition space this year,"" said Takuya Ishimoto, Director of the show for Reed Exhibitions Japan. ""We have worked on increasing the quality of exhibitors as well as the number of international companies with new country pavilions from the US, Spain and Turkey"", he added. The rise of international exhibitors has been a constant goal of the organizers. This year, the proportion of foreign companies coming from 36 different countries culminated at 40%. The biggest contingent came from Korea, a long-time supplier for the Japanese beauty market. ""The Japanese market is opening up to international markets but is still quite closed. Also, Japan is now aware of the competition coming from Korean and tries to differentiate itself with its historical culture,"" analyzed Florence Bernardin, founder of Information & Inspiration, a beauty trends agency specializing on Asian markets. As usual, the show was divided in two areas with CosmeTokyo dedicated to finished products, which welcomed 8,454 visitors, and CosmeTech dedicated to the industry's supply side and representing approximately 2/3 of the exhibition space, which welcomed 16,358 visitors. In total 24,812 professional visitors walked the floor, representing a 6.7% increase compared to 2016 (23,295 visitors). In order to further promote the internationalization of the show, the organizers also invited 100 buyers from overseas and organized B2B meeting with the exhibitors. A delegation of Japanese buyers and importers was also invited to the show to strengthen its position as the biggest trade show for cosmetics in Japan. ""Japanese companies are trying to internationalize their services,"" highlighted Takuya Ishimoto. ""We hope to bring more and more international visitors with a focus on professionals coming from Dubai and Russia, but also the Americas and Europe in the coming years. That's why, the next edition will be held in early December to avoid clashing with Chinese New Year and the Holidays in occident. The show will change venue and go to Makuhari Messe to allow the exhibition to be held in one space and not in separate halls like it was this time."" Despite the organizers efforts, the internationalization of Japanese brands seems still timid. According to a buyer from US-based retailer TJX visiting the show, ""buying Japanese brands is a difficult mission. Most Japanese beauty brands are still unfamiliar with export procedures and the need of foreign customers outside Asia"", he added. Another key feature of the event was the importance of brands and suppliers with natural and/or organic claims. ""The trade show reflects the current trend in the market: a great wave into natural products. There is an increasing sensitivity to health in Japan. After the Fukushima disaster and other health concerns consumers have started paying more attention into the ingredients used in their cosmetics products. Although Japanese were late at picking up the natural and organic trends, the market is considerably turning into them but also sustainable and locally sourced products with a focus on Japanese values,"" concluded Florence Bernardin."
Cosmetic surgery market enjoys growth worldwide,"Specialists estimate continued and stable growth in cosmetic surgery procedures worldwide, with 8.9% growth by 2020. The market, worth US $8.5 billion 2016, could be worth US $9.2 billion in 2020. Global growth is above all driven by Asia, which saw annual growth of 10% in 2016 and should continue to follow Europe closely in 2020. Demand in Asia is exploding, practitioners say, driven by a rapidly growing middle class and a quest for more Caucasian features. On the whole, the market for medical and surgical cosmetic procedures in the USA is predicted to account for almost half of the global market by 2020 (44%), followed by the Asia-Pacific region (23%), Europe (25%) and Latin America (7%). Behind the United States and Brazil, South Korea was the third biggest market for aesthetic treatments in 2015, with 1.2 million procedures out of a global total of 21.7 million, according to data from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS). While breast augmentation and liposuction are the most popular procedures in the USA, Brazil, Mexico and most of Europe, demand in South Korea is for eye, nose, cheek and chin resculpting. Injectable products (principally botulinum toxin and fillers) remain the market leaders in terms of value (38%), with an average annual growth of 8.3% per year expected until 2020. However, energy-based devices (laser, ultrasound, radiofrequency) and body contouring devices are almost as popular (35% of the global market), and higher average annual growth is expected (11%). Body contouring procedures saw the biggest growth in 2016, at 16.3%. This category includes various types of procedures, such as facelifts, abdominoplasty, buttock implants and liposuction. Cosmeceuticals (active cosmetics) are seeing stronger growth than breast implants, with average annual growth of 7.6% versus 2.2% from 2014 to 2019. Asia saw the strongest growth in breast implants, at 7.3%, compared to 0.4% in Europe. The IMCAS analysis was compiled using available data relating to the medical and surgical aesthetics market from market research companies, financial analysts and industry professionals present at the IMCAS Tribune."
"""The brand's storytelling is a key factor of success"", Benny Tung, Parfumerie Trésor, Hong Kong","Premium Beauty News - What are the origins of the Parfumerie Trésor? Benny Tung - I studied in London and I discovered artistic perfumery in Europe with my sister, mainly in London and Paris. As far as fragrances are concerned, the choice is much more limited in Hong Kong than in Europe. We thought there was an opportunity to develop the artistic perfumery segment in Hong Kong and we partnered to open the city's very first artistic perfume shop. It is a family-owned business and a family story. Fragrances have been very important in our personal and familial history. Premium Beauty News - How do you select the brands your distributing? Benny Tung - For food and for clothes my personal preference always goes to high quality and niche. It is the same for fragrances. The most interesting brands are those focusing on quality rather than on marketing. Beyond quality, other very important criteria are the brand's storytelling and emotional touch. Of course, the brands we sell must match with the style of the store. Eventually, exclusivity is a plus. Premium Beauty News - How many brands are you selling? Benny Tung - So far we're selling 24 brands including 20 brands that are exclusive to Hong Kong and some are even exclusive to the Asia region. Let's mention, for instance, Arabian Oud, Bella Bellissima, D'Orsay, E.Coudray, Evody, Fragrance Du Bois, Histoires de Parfums, Jardins d'Écrivains, Jovoy, Juliette Has A Gun, L.T. Piver, Laurent Mazzone, Les Parfums de Rosine, Making of Cannes, Memo, Van Cleef & Arpels, Xerjoff, Yosh... We import the brands and sell them in our retail store. In most cases, we are their official distributor in Hong Kong. We hope that the culture and lifestyle of niche and artistic perfumes can be appreciated and spread to other markets. Premium Beauty News - Who are your customers? Benny Tung - Most of our customers are women, but there are also some men looking for a gift and also some perfume lovers. About 60% of our customers are based in Hong Kong. We also have many customers from other Asian countries, mostly from Korea, but also from Japan and Malaysia, and also from mainland China. While some of them are just starting to discover perfumes, younger consumers are already well informed about artistic fragrances. Floral and citrus notes are the most popular among our customers but woody fragrances also perform well during the winter. However, clients from the Middle East or India prefer stronger and more woody perfumes. Clients from mainland China also appreciate oud."
