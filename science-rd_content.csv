COSMÉTOSCIENCES: A cosmetics research program in France,"The French cosmetics industry, which brings together 3,500 companies, 80% of which are SMEs, is the  second largest contributor to the country’s trade balance. This highly strategic sector for the French economy operates in a growing global market that is attracting more and more countries. In 2021, France was the world’s leading exporter of cosmetics with over 14,5% of the export market. In front of a strong competition from Asian countries, especially South Korea, Japan, and China, France remains the market leader thanks to a dynamic research on the subjects of innovations of the perfumery and cosmetic industry. In such a context, R&D and innovation are key elements to establish the values of the “French brand”. The Centre-Val  de  Loire  region  has  made  cosmetics  the  core focus of its Regional Innovation Strategy, spawning the COSMÉTOSCIENCES program in 2015. Led by the University of Orléans, the project involves the University of Tours, the CNRS, the Cosmetic Valley competitiveness hub and Le Studium Loire Valley institute. Since 2015, 40 collaborative research projects have emerged, involving various research teams at 35 businesses in the cosmetics sector. Over 5 years, the combined workforce dedicated to cosmetics research in the Centre-Val de Loire region has reached 120 Full-Time Equivalents and published close on 100 papers. This dynamic allows researchers to promote their skills and expertise with new academic and industry partners in order to set up or contribute to projects with a national or international scope. The research activities developed within COSMÉTOSCIENCES focus on current cornerstones of the cosmetics industry that best meet consumer expectations: eco-responsible cosmetics, efficacy, safety and “Made in France”. The program’s three key focus areas for research, development and innovation are: – Naturalness and eco-responsible processes,
– Characterisation of a product’s biological activity and safety,
– Formulation and sensoriality. COSMÉTOSCIENCES federates 23 research teams from 10 academic laboratories at the University of Orléans, the University of Tours and the CNRS, whose expertise spans the entire cosmetic product value chain. COSMÉTOSCIENCES is the only regionally structured cosmetics research program in Europe, the skills and visibility of which are gradually gaining momentum. It is part of a regional dynamic with a strong national and international outreach. European partnerships are being set up to use the network’s expertise to promote innovation within the French industry sector.

"Hair straightening chemicals could increase uterine cancer risk, research finds","The National Institutes of Health (NIH) looked into the chemical products used by women to straighten their curly or frizzy hair. The procedure, which involves modifying the texture of the hair in question to make it straight, is apparently not without health risks. Such are the findings of this study conducted among 33,497 American women aged 35 to 74, over a period of nearly 11 years, who participated in a survey led by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) seeking to identify the factors involved in several diseases, including some forms of cancer. [1] The major study, which identified 378 cases of uterine cancer, reports that women who used chemicals to straighten their hair had a higher risk of developing uterine cancer than those who did not. The scientists found no link between uterine cancer and other hair products, such as dyes, bleaches, highlights or perms. It should be noted, however, that it was essentially the women who declared using these straightening products ""frequently"" — meaning more than four times in the previous year — who were more likely to develop this type of cancer. This risk, according to the researchers, was twice as high compared to those who did not use these products. Note, however, that the risk of developing uterine cancer following frequent exposure to these chemicals appears to be relatively low according to the figures provided by the scientists. Moreover, the study did not collect any data on the brands or on the ingredients contained in the products used. ""We estimated that 1.64% of women who never used hair straighteners would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70; but for frequent users, that risk goes up to 4.05%,” said Alexandra White, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group and lead author on the new study. “This doubling rate is concerning. However, it is important to put this information into context — uterine cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer.” According to previous data, the incidence rate of uterine cancer appears to be on the rise in the United States, and particularly among Black women, with more than 65,000 new cases estimated in 2022. In its study, the NIH indicates that 60% of the women who said they had used chemicals to straighten their hair were Black women, implying that the effects on their health could be more significant due to this higher prevalence of use. It is also within this population that the incidence is rising the most. ""Because Black women use hair straightening or relaxer products more frequently and tend to initiate use at earlier ages than other races and ethnicities, these findings may be even more relevant for them,” said Che-Jung Chang, Ph.D., an author on the new study and a research fellow in the NIEHS Epidemiology Branch. While the correlation found in the study show there is a potential problem with hair straighteners, more research is warranted to identify specific chemicals driving this observed association. Formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals, which are part of some straighteners, have already been identified as playing a potential role in hormone-sensitive carcinogenesis. “A fundamental principle of epidemiology is that association is not the same as causation; one does not necessarily lead to the other. The association observed in the study is with people who straighten their hair, not the ingredients in hair products or any specific chemicals as this data was not collected,” commented Kimberly Norman, Senior Director, Safety and Regulatory Toxicology, at the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) in a statement."
Can cellulose replace plastic in packaging?,"As it is foreseen as a solution to replace plastic in the future, cellulose is scrutinized by the packaging sector and its peripheral players. To speed up the development of alternative solutions, in particular to single-use food and cosmetics packaging, the Cellulose Valley teaching and research chair implemented a programme for PhDs, research engineers, and Master’s students working on various issues. “We aim to boost innovation and take advantage of all the scientific developments of the past few years in order to provide this material with properties as close as possible to those of plastic, in particular by improving the barrier function, finding solutions to closing and shaping problems, etc. We intend to develop a high-performing material that will help create recyclable and biodegradable packaging”, explains PhD Julien Bras, who holds the Cellulose Valley chair. This chair was created thanks to eight founding partners who directly or indirectly come from the cellulose ecosystem, including Ahlstrom and DS Smith, providers of cellulose-based solutions, Guillin Emballage and Aptar, who transform the material into packaging, Décathlon, Marie, or Chanel, users, and Citeo, for a global vision of the value chain. These partners finance the chair and launch the new research projects, training actions, exchange sessions, webinars, etc. “Every year, there is a research project planned with eight Master’s specialties, which makes 32, all in all: the students will work on proofs of concept and offer solutions expected by society in these fields. The results will be shared every year: the first day of the inauguration, we unveiled those of the first Master’s groups who presented their work on cheese and chocolate packaging, cushioning materials, new types of corrugated cardboard, and high-performing moulded cellulose”, Bras explains. The objective is to work on primary and secondary packaging for the food, cosmetics, and other industries that share the same problems, like the barrier function for liquid formulas, closing constraints, or decorations. Other than being a natural, renewable material, cellulose presents no risk of supply difficulties. “Cellulose is found in a significant, much underexploited biomass. Nature produces 200 billion tonnes of cellulose, and only six are used, mainly for heating. About 100 million tonnes of plastics are used in the packaging sector today, so I am not really worried about supplying, be it for the original or the recycled material”, says Bras. Launched in early 2022, the Cellulose Valley chair will continue its research work until 2026. All this will take place in parallel to the CDP Cosmethic programme, a tool implemented five years ago by the Institute of Excellence of the Grenoble University to build a bridge between social sciences and chemistry and material sciences, thanks to cosmetics."
Connected skin chips to predict the efficacy of sebum-regulating ingredients,"Sebum is a complex lipids mixture secreted by sebocytes and deposited in stratum corneum for helping to the skin barrier function. Disruption of sebum production leads to common skin diseases, including acne or atopic dermatitis; it also contributes to the development of oily or dry skin and impacts both appearance and beauty of the skin. Solutions to develop more efficient sebum-regulating cosmetics still require more predictive testing ranging from lab data to humans. Success of lab-to-donor data is not easy and quite often fails because of no proper translational readouts. Therefore, Gattefossé and CTIBiotech have joined forces to develop a relevant 3D bio printed model integrating sebocytes for measuring non-invasive parameters in vitro as on real humans while at the same time giving laboratory readouts. Using connected scales, Gattefossé and CTIBiotech used bioimpedance [1] to evaluate changes in the local environment of a 3D skin model integrating sebocytes. Measurement of such a non-invasive electrical activity allowed the scientists to follow in real-time the sebum production, in addition to laboratory readouts dealing with cellular, matrix and tissue development. “Full thickness skin models containing sebocytes have reproducible oil production which is increased by linoleic acid and reduced by TOFA, and remarkably this is characterized by significant changes in bioimpedance in both printed tissues and culture supernatants surrounding them. Bioimpedance, linked to the sebum production thus proves to be an in vitro non-invasive proper parameter and measurable in real-time, to design ever more predictive and effective testing, since 3D models described here and linked with a simple chip system, accurately mirror changes within skin models as on live donors,” says Dr. Nicolas Bechetoille, Ph.D/HDR, Research Manager Skin Biology, Head of Biology Laboratory at Gattefossé. While the use of bio-impedance to monitor sebum production by the skin is a natural advance, Professor Colin McGuckin, President and Chief Scientific Officer at CTIBiotech highlights that the real innovation comes from developing real-time analysis for oil changes. “We advanced our 3D printed full thickness skin models with an integrated bioimpedance chip connected to monitor changes. Linking cosmetics screening in this way advances faster towards human tests and increases our ability to make more effective products,” he says. This work will be presented at the 32nd IFSCC Congress in London, 19-22 September 2022."
How scientists are working on silk as a greener alternative to microplastics,"Whether in cosmetics, in clothes, detergents and many products of our daily life, microplastics are everywhere. They even have been found in air, water, and soil as well as in the bloodstream of animals and people around the world. While many manufacturers are looking for alternatives to these products, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in a joint work with BASF, have come up with an alternative that is surprisingly sourced from silkworms [1]. ""The EU has already declared that these added, nonbiodegradable microplastics must be eliminated by 2025, so the search is on for suitable replacements, which do not currently exist,"" the researchers explain in a statement. MIT researchers were interested in the properties of silk fibroins, which are not soluble in water while remaining biodegradable by the proteolytic enzymes commonly produced by living organisms. Using spray drying and ultrasonic spray freeze drying processes, the team of engineers designed and fabricated silk-based microcapsules with a wide range of structures. ""By precisely adjusting the polymer chain arrangements of silk materials and addition of a surfactant, it is possible to fine-tune the properties of the resulting coatings once they dry out and harden,"" the scientists explain. The material can thus be hydrophobic (water-repelling) even though it is made and processed in a water solution, or it can be hydrophilic (water-attracting), or anywhere in between, and for a given application it can be made to match the characteristics of the material it is being used to replace. Considered ""safe"" in the food and medical fields, silk is a biodegradable and non-toxic material for the body. It is also relatively easy to obtain as it can be extracted from the cocoons of silkworms or recovered from used silk fabric (or inferior-quality silk, unusable for textile manufacturing). Currently, 90 percent of the world’s silk production takes place in China. However,  that’s largely because the country has perfected the production of the high-quality silk threads needed for fabrics. The process developed by the MIT engineers uses bulk silk and has no need for a high level of quality. ""Production could easily be ramped up in other parts of the world to meet local demand if this process becomes widely used,"" says MIT professor of civil and environmental engineering Benedetto Marelli, co-author of the research. It is thus possible to carry out these encapsulations from cocoons of non-textile quality or even by recovering the silk of used fabrics. “The process is simple and can be implemented in existing factories,” says Muchun Liu, post-doctoral researcher at MIT and lead author of the study. While other similar experiments have been conducted before with biodegradable materials to replace microplastics, the MIT team insists that encapsulating high-content active substances is necessary to pave the way for commercial use. ""The only way to have an impact is where we can not only replace a synthetic polymer with a biodegradable counterpart, but also achieve performance that is the same, if not better,"" explains Benedetto Marelli. Micro-plastics that are intentionally added to consumer products represent only a minor part of the global pollution linked to plastics (10 to 15% according to the European Chemical Agency); indeed, much of the burden comes from other sources, such as the degradation over time of larger plastic objects such as bottles and packaging, and from the wear of car tires. “We cannot solve the whole microplastics problem with one solution that fits them all. Ten percent of a big number is still a big number,” highlights MIT professor of civil and environmental engineering Benedetto Marelli, co-author of the research."
"“They’re everywhere”: microplastics in oceans, air and human body","Images of plastic pollution have become familiar: a turtle suffocated by a shopping bag, water bottles washed up on beaches, or the monstrous ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" of floating detritus. Millions of tonnes of plastic produced every year, largely from fossil fuels, make their way into the environment and degrade into smaller and smaller pieces. ""We did not imagine 10 years ago that there could be so many small microplastics, invisible to the naked eye, and that they were everywhere around us,"" said Jean-Francois Ghiglione, a researcher at the Laboratory of Microbial Oceanography in France. ""And we could not yet envisage finding them in the human body"". Now scientific studies are increasingly detecting microplastics in some human organs — including ""the lungs, spleen, kidneys, and even the placenta,"" Ghiglione told AFP. It may not come as much of a shock that we breathe in these particles present in the air, in particular microfibres from synthetic clothing. ""We know that there’s microplastics in the air, we know it’s all around us,"" said Laura Sadofsky, from the Hull York Medical School in the UK. Her team found polypropylene and PET (polyethylene terephthalate) in lung tissue, identifying fibres from synthetic fabrics. ""The surprise for us was how deep it got into the lungs and the size of those particles,"" she told AFP. In March, another study reported the first traces of PET found in the blood. Given the small sample of volunteers, some scientists say it is too early to draw conclusions, but there are concerns that if plastics are in the bloodstream they could be transported to all organs. In 2021, researchers found microplastics in both maternal and foetal placental tissue, expressing ""great concern"" over the possible consequences on the development of the foetus. But concern is not the same as a proven risk. ""If you ask a scientist if there is a negative effect, he or she would say ’I don’t know’,"" said Bart Koelmans, professor in Aquatic Ecology and Water Quality at Wageningen University. ""It’s potentially a big problem, but we don’t have the scientific evidence to positively confirm what are the effects, if any."" One hypothesis is that microplastics could be responsible for certain syndromes that weaken human health. While scientists have recently identified their presence in the body, it is likely that humans have been eating, drinking and breathing in plastics for years. In 2019, a shock report by the environmental charity WWF estimated that people are ingesting and inhaling up to five grams of plastic per week — enough to make a credit card. Koelmans, who contests the methodology and results of that study, has calculated the amount is closer to a grain of salt. ""Over a lifetime, a grain of salt per week is still quite something,"" he told AFP. While health studies on humans have yet to be developed, toxicity in certain animals reinforces concerns. ""Small microplastics invisible to the naked eye have deleterious effects on all the animals that we have studied in the marine environment, or on land,"" said Ghiglione. He added that the array of chemicals found in these materials — including dyes, stabilisers, flame retardants — can affect growth, metabolism, blood sugar, blood pressure and even reproduction.  The researcher said there should be a ""precautionary"" approach, urging consumers to reduce the number of plastic-packaged products they buy, particularly bottles. However, ""people cannot stop breathing, so even if you change your eating habits you will still inhale them,"" said Koelmans. ""They’re everywhere."" Earlier this year, the United Nations began a process to develop an internationally binding treaty to tackle the global plastic scourge. It has warned that the world is facing a pollution crisis to match the biodiversity and climate crises. Some 460 million tonnes of plastics were used in 2019, twice as much as 20 years earlier. Less than 10 percent was recycled. Annual production of fossil-fuel-based plastics is set to top 1.2 billion tonnes by 2060, with waste exceeding one billion tonnes, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said last month."
Symrise blurs chromatography analyses to protect their fragrances,"Until now, perfumers had few other solutions than secrecy to protect their creations, which are not covered by intellectual property laws. However, this protection had become quite illusory in front of the growing improvement of analysis technologies, in particular gas chromatography, that make it possible to quickly display the chemical composition of a formula. Actually, the creation of an original fragrance is a long and meticulous process that requires different skills, a lot of time, and many tests. The process is expensive and counterfeiters - which are quite numerous in the luxury industry - avoid such huge investments by pirating the work of original creators. As a result, perfumes and cosmetics are among the most counterfeited products in the world! At European level, seizures of counterfeit perfumes and cosmetics represent nearly 10 billion euros, almost 10% of the cosmetics market [1]. To protect the creative work of their perfumers and the investment of their customers, Symrise initiated in 2018 a program to protect scented formulas by blurring the results of gas chromatography analyses regarding fragrance ingredients. Developed by Symrise’s R&D team in consultation with their perfumers, this technology is based on an innovative, colourless and odourless universal base, that helps to protect the originality of the perfume in which it is used. It contains a mixture of specific raw materials, with excellent UV resistance and temperature stability, that induce a wide range of interferences during a gas chromatography analysis. By blurring the quantification and identification of certain raw materials contained in the perfume formula, the base makes much more difficult to identically reproduce a specific fragrance. Finalized in 2019, the Cryptosym technology has already been applied to 45 formulas developed by Symrise for different olfactory families. Chromatography analyses showed that out of 133 natural and synthetic ingredients tested, the technology induces a variation in the analysis results for 118 of them: 93 being difficult to quantify, 25 being difficult to identify. In the main, according to Symrise, 40% of tested raw materials were affected by Cryptosym and 29% of them were completely “encrypted” by the technology. ""Cryptosym is a revolution in the sector because until then nothing had yet been developed to protect the intellectual property of the perfumer’s creativity"", underlines Aliénor Massenet, senior perfumer at Symrise. ""With Cryptosym, copying a perfume is now more difficult, the process is much longer and without any guarantee of finding that little extra that makes all the difference between success and simple reproduction"" To date, Symrise continues researches to collect additional data but already offers the technology as an option to their customers."
Recommendations on sun protection still insufficiently followed,"During the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress, which has just ended in Slovenia, Pierre Fabre unveiled the results of its ’Sunscreen Assessment Family Experience (SAFE)’ study [1], which was conducted among 8,000 adults — parents and grandparents — in seven countries around the world during the summer months. And it is clear that adults and children are still not following health recommendations for sun protection. Last year, at the height of the summer season, only about one-third of children received adequate sun protection while exposed during the hours of the day when the sun is at its strongest/ This figure drops to 13% for the adult population. And this isn’t the only recommendation that many don’t follow. While health professionals recommend applying sun protection at least every two hours during the periods of sunshine when risk is considered highest — between 11am and 5pm — only 18.5% of children have actually benefited from such assiduity. ""Between 50 and 80% of cumulative exposure occurs during early childhood and is the leading cause of most skin cancers,"" outlines Dr Ariadna Ortiz Brugués Medical Directorate at Laboratoires Dermatologiques Avène. However, the study shows that 32% of children had at least one sunburn during the summer; the average number of sunburns was two. These behaviours could be explained by a lack of information on sun protection, as well as by certain misunderstandings that are clearly enduring, despite the prevention campaigns conducted each year. Nearly one out of two people surveyed (45%) admitted not knowing that UVB rays cause sunburn, 27% didn’t know that UVA rays accelerate skin aging, and more than a fifth of respondents are convinced that clouds protect from the sun. However, these numbers could soon change dramatically for the better considering that many children take the matter seriously. Nearly 47% of them said they would apply sunscreen without the help of their parents. This is true in all the countries surveyed, from France (41%) to the United States (54%), as well as Spain (nearly 52%) and Germany (nearly 46%). And generally speaking, the youngest respondents showed that they were aware of the issues surrounding sun protection, up to 70%."
Dutch scientists find microplastics in human blood for the first time,"The tiny and ubiquitous pieces of mostly invisible plastic have already been found almost everywhere else on Earth, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains as well as in the air, soil and food chain. However, it is the first time that their presence in human blood has been demonstrated. A Dutch study [1] published in the Environment International journal on Thursday examined blood samples from 22 anonymous, healthy volunteers and found microplastics in quantifiable quantities in 17 of them (nearly 80 percent). Half of the blood samples showed traces of PET plastic (polyethylene terephthalate), a widely used substance globally, in particular to make drink bottles. More than a third had polystyrene, commonly used to produce disposable food containers and many other products. PE (polyethylene) and PMMA (poly methyl methacrylate) were also detected and 23% and 5% of the samples, respectively. The mean of the sum concentrations for each donor was 1.6 µg total plastic particles/ml blood sample. ""This is the first time we have actually been able to detect and quantify,"" such microplastics in human blood, said Dick Vethaak, an ecotoxicologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. ""This is proof that we have plastics in our body — and we shouldn’t,"" he told AFP, calling for further research to investigate how it could be impacting health. ""Where is it going in your body? Can it be eliminated? Excreted? Or is it retained in certain organs, accumulating maybe, or is it even able to pass the blood-brain barrier?"" questioned the scientist about the plastic in human body. The uptake routes of plastic particles detected in human bloodstream are likely to be via mucosal contact (either ingestion or inhalation). Dermal uptake of fine particles is unlikely except if the skin is damaged. The authors of the study therefore said the microplastics could have entered the body by many routes: via air, water or food, but also in products such as hygiene or cosmetic products (toothpastes or lip glosses, for instance) or tattoo ink. Furthermore, ""it is scientifically plausible that plastic particles may be transported to organs via the bloodstream,"" they added. The study was funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development as well as Common Seas, a UK-based group aimed at reducing plastic pollution. Alice Horton, anthropogenic contaminants scientist at Britain’s National Oceanography Centre, said the study ""unequivocally"" proved there was microplastics in human blood. ""This study contributes to the evidence that plastic particles have not just pervaded throughout the environment, but are pervading our bodies too,"" she told the Science Media Centre. Fay Couceiro, reader in biogeochemistry and environmental pollution at the University of Portsmouth, said that despite the small sample size and lack of data on the exposure level of participants, she felt the study was ""robust and will stand up to scrutiny"". She also called for further research. ""After all blood links all the organs of our body and if plastic is there, it could be anywhere in us."""
Shiseido unveils new testing method to accelerate skin bacteria analysis,"According to Shiseido, the methods currently available to analyze the bacteria that are present on the skin of an individual (the so-called “skin microbiome”) make it hardly possible to obtain results in last than one month after having collected the samples. With the aim to provide customers with a new high-value in-store experience and beauty service, the group has partnered with Yamato-Esulon and Orcoa, two Japanese manufacturers of laboratory equipment that have developed devices that are able to detect periodontal disease bacteria. The link between skin health and beauty and the 1,000+ types of indigenous bacteria that can be present at the surface an within the skin is still to be fully investigated. However, Shiseido has found in earlier research that indigenous bacterial diversity is low in sensitive skin and that some prebiotic ingredients can improve skin texture and hydration. While, the skin microbiome can vary a lot from one individual to another, Shiseido chose to focus on Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, two types of skin bacteria that are said to be strongly “related to the beauty and health of the skin.” Using a compact and simplified PCR [1] testing device, the Japanese cosmetics giant was able to develop a fast testing method for these two strains. The new method enables any person without specific skill to perform the test and obtain the results in about 40 minutes. According to Shiseido, analyzes confirmed the amount and balance of the bacteria assessed with the new methods were equivalent to the results of those being examined with a conventional method [2]. Thanks to its compact size, the device can be placed in any venue receiving customers. Beauty advisors just have to collect samples from the customer’s stratum corneum, usually from the forehead, and the results can be delivered within less than an hour, providing customers with a unique shopping experience. As a first step, Shiseido plans to launch a “unique skin bacteria” measuring service using this testing method on a trial basis for visitors at the Shiseido Global Innovation Center (called “S/PARK”), a research and innovation hub located in the Minato Mirai area in Yokohama, Japan. “With this technology, we wish to offer opportunities for our customers to deepen their understanding of indigenous skin bacteria, which play an important role in the beauty and health of the skin. Furthermore, by combining with the advanced counseling services of our beauty consultants, which are one of our strengths, we would like to provide people with optimal, personalized skincare solutions according to their current skin conditions,” said Shiseido in a statement. The Japanese group plans to further develop these technologies to gain a deeper understanding of the human skin ecosystem in which cells and microbes coexist and how to provide beneficial services to its customers."
"Microbiome, fermentation: 2022 sheds a new light on bacteria!","Advances in medicine have made us aware of the dangers of bacteria which can cause strep throat, gastroenteritis or cholera. But most bacteria are far from being pathogenic, and some of them can actually be beneficial to our bodies. There would be a thousand billion species of microorganism out there, compared to just 10 million animal species. They are absolutely everywhere: in the air, in the ground, in the water. Measuring between one and 10 microns, these unicellular organisms ""regulate ecosystems, modulate the flow of carbon and nitrogen, produce half of the available oxygen, form symbioses with all living things, protect against pathogenic microbes, facilitate the absorption of nutrients, inform the immune system and regulate a number of physiological parameters,"" writes the French bimonthly magazine ""Socialter,"". And for some time now bacteria are being cultivated to address new needs and even to help us reduce our environmental footprint. The tide perhaps began turning with talk of microbiota. Suddenly, it was all the rage to take an interest in the inner life of our intestines and those microorganisms that populate our guts, without which we would experience bloating, flatulence or seriously disturbed digestion. Bacteria, which are the basis of the fermentation processes, have given new life to foods such as yogurts, pickles, or sauerkraut. During the fermentation process, microorganisms consume the sugar and water contained in the food. By multiplying, these microscopic living beings change the taste, as well as the texture and even the colour of a food. They are also able to boost food content of vitamins B and C, as well as zinc and iron, and even make proteins more digestible. Last summer, US researchers from the Stanford School of Medicine discovered that following a diet enriched with fermented foods for 10 weeks increased the diversity of the microbiome, and that it was even possible to help maintain weight, and reduce the risk of diabetes and cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease. Up to six such foods should be eaten to enjoy the benefits. Actually, bacteria have become indispensable to our diets, as fermented products make up 5 to 40% of the human diet, depending on the culinary culture. Five years ago, a study by BIS Research estimated that the market for fermented foods could be worth $888.76 billion by 2023. And, for several years now, manufacturers have been working on food innovations populated with ""good"" bacteria. Take the pickle juice developed specifically for athletes by the American brand Pickle Juice Company, presented at the SIAL international food innovation show in Paris in 2018. Or the Korean brand Ligaro, which transformed its kimchi — an iconic K-cuisine staple based on cabbage and chilies — into jam! But these microbes aren’t just doing good things to food. They are now increasingly being used in anti-wrinkle creams, moisturizing serums and other products in the beauty toolbox. Cosmetic brands have realized that the fermentation process could be useful in this sector: letting these microscopic organisms proliferate supposedly helps obtain a better concentration of nutrients and antioxidants. In fact, active ingredients are reportedly boosted by the fermentation process. As such, in a recently published report, US market research firm WGSN naturally bet on fermented beauty as a trend that will boom in 2022. Bacteria are one of the main drivers for the development of biotechnologies with almost infinite applications. Recently, researchers in Quebec have been working on molecules produced by bacteria that can kill... other bacteria. This breakthrough could very well take the form of a future soap. This new-gen version would replace the current detergents or hand sanitizers… Bacteria can also help turn greenhouse gases into bottles for shampoos or ethanol for perfumes, or even luxury glasses, bags, and sleeves for smartphones and laptops."
Could turmeric be a key ingredient in future sun protection products?,"While health specialists do reiterate the importance to use an effecient protection against UV in the event of prolonged sun exposure, the demand for more natural sunscreen products is also rising among consumers, as for all personal care categories. This is a problem that brands have taken on board, gradually adapting their formulas to meet the expectations of consumers while offering the highest level of protection possible. But that hasn’t stopped scientists from continuing to search for potential new natural molecules, which could protect the skin even more effectively against the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. A recent study [1] has brought to light an unexpected ingredient that could do just that, and in so doing contribute to the fight against skin cancers, which have been on the rise over the last few years, as well as against photoaging: turmeric. Turmeric is already known for its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and healing properties, which help in the fight against eczema and psoriasis. It is, more particularly, one of its molecules, curcumin, which proves to be an interesting aid for several skin problems. And it is precisely this active ingredient that American researchers have paid attention when seeking out the sun filter of the future. Conducted on rodents, their study confirms the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin on the skin, and highlights ""its potential as a photoprotective adjuvant when delivered through nanoparticles."" A process intended to overcome some limitations of curcumin observed by researchers in previous studies, including its low aqueous solubility and rapid degradation in vivo. The substance is still far from being incorporated into everyday products. However, in view of these encouraging primary results, the scientists now wish to go further to determine whether the active molecule could be used as a sun filter. In an interview with Dermatology Times, Adam J. Friedman, a professor at George Washington University, who participated in this American study, is enthusiastic about these results and already sees the potential of curcumin, although the research is not yet at an advanced stage. ""Ideally this would be incorporated into a sunscreen or a moisturizer that would be used in conjunction with a sunscreen,"" explains the scientist, who believes that another formulation would be possible as a ""do-over"" — meaning when you have forgotten to put on sunscreen. Curcumin also seems to have a bright future in many applications, if this researcher is to be believed. “Today there is growing scientific evidence suggesting curcumin’s utility in the treatment of chronic pain, osteoarthritis, and inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis; acceleration of wound closure; and bacterial, fungal, and viral skin infections, as well as cosmetic ailments such as dyspigmentation,"" he outlines."
Study: Sulforafane may be helpful in the fight against hair loss,"Sulforaphane could not only become an unmissable ingredient in hair care cosmetics, but even an alternative pharmacological treatment for androgenetic alopecia, of which baldness is the ultimate stage. This is the finding of a team of scientists from South Korean company Gragem Co. Ltd. and of the Department of Biotechnology at The University of Suwon. Published in the journal Cosmetics, the results of the study [1] showed that the organic compound present in broccoli and cauliflower induced an increase of nearly 7% in the number of hairs in participants suffering from androgenetic alopecia. The researchers developed a prototype formulation of four ingredients — dexpanthenol, biotin, L-menthol and sulforaphane — to conduct a clinical application test in men and women aged 18 to 54 with androgenetic alopecia. The goal was to determine if the gel in question was able to relieve the symptoms of hair loss after 18 weeks of use. Even before they began their trial, the scientists knew from previous studies that sulforaphane increased the expression of the enzyme that breaks down dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the hormone implicated in hair loss, thereby helping to inhibit hair loss in the animal model. All that remained was to test the effect on men and women and report the results. The clinical study, which was conducted on 23 patients thus showed that “parietal lines and bangs visually improved and the number of hairs increased by 6.71% from before using the test product to 18 weeks after using the test product."" The research works ""strongly suggest that sulforaphane may be an active ingredient that significantly alleviates hair loss symptoms,"" the authors of the work write… In parallel, in vitro studies on the behaviour of specific cells also allowed the researchers to show that sulforaphane enhances the mRNA and protein levels of Akr1c2 and Dhrs9 in the cell cultures of RAW 264.7 macrophages without cytotoxicity. At a time when natural ingredients are taking precedence over synthetic ingredients derived from oil resources, it would not be surprising to see the emergence of new shampoos, conditioners and other masks based on broccoli, cauliflower and other vegetables rich in sulforaphane, such as brussels sprouts."
BASF and Givaudan get OECD approval for first animal-free toxicology testing,"After more than 10 years of collaboration, BASF and Givaudan have received OECD approval on an animal-free testing strategy that can be used to predict whether a substance may cause allergic reactions in the skin. “We have taken a big step forward. Now we can also use alternative methods to answer more complex toxicological questions without animal testing,” said Dr Robert Landsiedel, Vice President, Special Toxicology at BASF. Before a new product is approved by the authorities and placed on the market, numerous tests must be carried out. This includes testing whether the product sensitises the skin. However, since 11 March 2013, European regulations have banned animal testing for cosmetics purposes including for repeated-dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, and toxicokinetics, irrespective of whether there are alternatives. Since then, various in vitro methods - usually based on cell-cultures - have been developed to replace animal testing in the identification of skin sensitizers [1]. The new toxicology testing strategy, a “world’s first” according to BASF and Givaudan, comprises three alternative methods that enable to get rid of animal testing to predict whether a substance causes allergic reactions in the human skin. “To assess skin sensitisation, which is caused by a complex process in the organism, we need a combination of three methods,” Landsiedel explains. “This strategy has a better predictivity for human allergy risks as compared to traditional animal testing,” added Dr Andreas Natsch, head of in vitro Molecular Screening at Givaudan. In addition to this toxicology testing strategy, BASF and Givaudan have also received OECD approval for another new alternative method, the so-called Kinetic Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (kDPRA), which enables researchers to predict how intense an allergic reaction is. It can complement the now approved toxicology testing strategy. In addition to assessing whether there is a skin sensitisation potential, the new method can add information on the potency. “By demonstrating that results are reproducible and predictive, trust in replacements of animal tests is growing,” adds Dr Roger Emter, who developed one of the underlying methods at Givaudan. The approval of this toxicology testing strategy has opened up the possibility of similar progress in other areas, such as eye irritation effects or effects on the hormone system. “We haven’t done it all alone, of course. Over the past 10 years, various companies and scientific institutions, such as the Institute for In Vitro Sciences (IIVS), have worked with us to validate the individual methods of the strategy,” emphasises Dr Susanne Kolle, lab team leader at BASF. “We have trained laboratories around the world on how to use these methods to generate accurate results,” Kolle explains."
"Artificial blue light has negligible impact on human skin, says Beiersdorf","As the number of hours people are spending in front of laptops, smartphones, and TV screens has increased, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic, conjectures and concerns about the effect of these sources of artificial light on the human health have been rising too. The effects of the blue light from the sun are well known, this is why there is suspicion that the artificial screen variant might also damage the skin. However, such conclusion usually lacks of sufficient evidence, said Beiersdorf in a statement. “Public discourse has been characterized by a lack of knowledge and of scientific studies. But through our research activities, we’ve managed to prove that the amount of artificial blue light emitted during conventional use of electronic devices is nowhere near enough to trigger harmful skin effects,” explained Dr. Ludger Kolbe, Chief Scientist Photobiology at Beiersdorf. The Beiersdorf research team headed by Dr. Ludger Kolbe has investigated the subject of artificial blue light [1]. According to the German scientists, spending an entire week in front of a monitor uninterrupted at a distance of 30 cm from the screen would have the same effect on the skin as just one minute outside on a sunny summer day in Hamburg at midday. “Compared to the emissions of the sun’s natural blue light, those of artificial blue light are virtually undetectable. The effect on the skin is negligible, which means concerns about negative impacts on the skin are unfounded,” added Kolbe. According to Beiersdorf, the discussions surrounding artificial blue light should not distract from the actual effects of natural blue light, which have been proven by many years of research. Indeed, visible light accounts for about 50 percent of solar radiation, one-third of which is natural blue light. It penetrates much deeper into the skin than UVA rays, which make up just 5% of sunlight. The Beiersdorf research team said their research has confirmed that high-energy visible (HEV) light generates oxidative stress, thus accelerating skin aging and increasing hyperpigmentation. However, considering the very low quantities emitted by electronic devices, the real problem is the sun’s natural direct blue light. The same study has also verified the protective effect of antioxidant ingredients such as licochalcone A, which is used in several products from Beiersdorf, including nearly every Eucerin sunscreen products as well as in the Sensitive-Allergy and UV Face range of Nivea Sun products."
"“Clinical tests can also stimulate innovation in skin biology,” Dr Nico Forraz","What do Cosmet’in Lyon Skin Science Days represent for the cosmetics industry? Dr Nico Forraz - This congress has been held every two years, since the association was founded in 1962. Its purpose is to highlight the latest scientific innovations and advances in skin biology. This is all the more important since skin biology is directly linked to dermatology and cosmetology. It is therefore a single opportunity to bring together all the players who contribute to innovative developments for skin care and well-being. What are the latest discoveries and emerging trends in skin biology? Dr Nico Forraz - These are precisely the subjects that will be discussed during the congress: the interaction between microbiota and human skin; environmental factors such as pollution, and their influence, in particular on the inflammatory status of the skin; advances in skin aging, linked to the lengthening life expectancy; the progress made in skin renewing, repairing and healing. We will also discuss new technologies, that are really making the bridge between clinical treatments and cosmetology, and tissue engineering also, which makes it possible to model cosmetic and aesthetic treatments. There is a lot to say! Why did you choose to focus on the impact of clinical tests on the skin biology mechanisms? Dr Nico Forraz - Traditionally, we start with discoveries made in the laboratory and then move on to clinical experiences. We wanted to address the subject from the opposite angle: by offering a review of the discoveries resulting from clinical tests and by demonstrating how they stimulate fundamental research and innovation in skin biology. How were the speakers selected? Dr Nico Forraz - The organizing committee, led by Nicolas Bechetoille [2] and Aurélie Pagnon- Minot [3], respectively Secretary and Treasurer of Cosmet’in Lyon, joined forces with academic researchers and industrial players, members of Cosmet’in Lyon. Together, they appointed session chairmen and proposed scientific, academic, clinical and industrial research key subjects, while providing a forum for young researchers. How does this knowledge guide and support the development of new products by brands? Dr Nico Forraz - Brands must both capture market trends and watch for scientific and technological innovations. It is the consideration of the whole that makes it possible to develop and validate the relevance and efficiency of future products. What types of products are more specifically concerned? Dr Nico Forraz - The cosmetic product becomes a preventive product, intended to maintain the balance of the skin, through a daily routine in particular. It aims mainly to fight against pollution, skin aging, to protect from the sun, to regenerate, to hydrate. These are the main demands that contribute to a healthy skin. What does these findings offer to consumers? Dr Nico Forraz - These discoveries offer consumers, innovation, efficiency, and security. Cosmet’in Lyon is very involved in these three aspects and wants to make this knowledge accessible to consumers. It is also preparing a mass market event that will take place in the Lyon area at the end of 2021, to explain how cosmetic products are developed. Then in early 2022, it will present the cosmetics industry, its structure and its business horizons to a high school audience. A booklet and a career forum relative to the beauty industry are in preparation. Education is at the heart of our mission, to bring together all stakeholders : academics, clinics, industry and consumers."
Study links frequent use of cosmetics to increased risk of endometriosis,"A chronic disease that can be disabling, endometriosis is characterized by ""the presence outside the uterine cavity of tissue similar to the uterine lining which will be affected by hormonal changes during each subsequent menstrual cycle,"" according to the EndoFrance association. Affecting one in ten women of childbearing age, the disease is most often responsible for chronic pain, but also in some cases of infertility. A team of researchers from the University of Granada and the San Cecilio Hospital in Granada has investigated the possible role of endocrine disruptors, substances capable of mimicking or blocking the natural action of hormones, in the development of endometriosis. ""Although the exact causes of its appearance are not known, a diverse range of factors are suspected of being involved, including genetic, epigenetic, and environmental causes , with hormones appearing to play a key role,"" explain Olga Ocón and Francisco Artacho, who worked on the study [1]. Concretely, the scientists sought to measure internal levels of various types of parabens and benzophenones [2], a series of substances that are suspected of being endocrine disruptors, in 124 women with and without endometriosis, recruited via public hospitals in the city of Granada, and collected information on each woman’s use of cosmetics and beauty products. Verdict: the study reveals a link between the frequency of use of cosmetic and personal care products and high urinary levels of parabens and benzophenones. So far, there’s nothing new, several studies have already established this kind of correlation. However, the Spanish researchers added that they also observed an association between high levels of parabens and benzophenones and a higher risk of endometriosis. These results add to those of another recent study, this time concerning the possible implication of bisphenol A (which is not a cosmetic ingredient) in the development of the disease. Based on the principle that it is still difficult to establish a diagnosis of endometriosis, and that there is no treatment to effectively cure the disease, the researchers warn of the need to implement preventive measures to reduce exposure to these various substances. In particular, it would be advisable to turn to beauty products that are free of endocrine disruptors. However, as endometriosis has  complex and multifactorial origins, they point out that further studies are needed to corroborate these findings."
A model of 3D dermal microtissue to study the skin’s elastic properties,"The French-based specialist in lipid chemistry and plant extraction, has developed 3D scaffold-free microtissues to mimic in vitro an elastic tissue, which is responsible for intrinsic elastic properties of the dermis. Indeed, explained Gattefossé in a statement: “The 3D bioengineered skin substitutes currently available on the market are still defective models to study skin elasticity. Indeed, they contain exogenous and artificial matrices that bias the measurement of biomechanical properties in the reconstructed tissue”. When it comes to analyzing the biomechanical properties of the skin, the exogenous and artificial supports that serve as a matrix for these skin substrates bias any measurement. However, the deterioration of the organization and functionality of dermal elastic fibers is one of the main causes of age-related skin sagging, which makes them a preferred target for cosmetic anti-aging strategies. To develop the new advanced models, Gattefossé used the 3D scaffold-free spheroids, which takes advantage of the ability of cells to secrete their own extracellular matrix. This technology enabled Gattefossé to produce in vitro hundreds of 3D microtissues within a few days only using dermal fibroblasts aggregated in ultra-low affinity plates. To accurately evaluate the elasticity of such skin microtissues, and the efficiency of cosmetic active ingredients, Gattefossé relied on BioMeca’s expertise and state-of-the-art technologies. The elastic modulus (or Young modulus) was thus measured using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the elastic fibers were visualized by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging microscopy. Gattefossé and BioMeca thus demonstrated that the 3D spheroid microtissue is a relevant and reliable model with a complex organization, comprising a dense, mature elastic fiber network sufficiently extensive to mimic in vitro dermal elastic mechanics. “Second Generation Harmonic microscopy highlights fibers network while Atomic Force Microscopy reveals tissue stiffness in both imaging and mechanically manipulating biological structures near physiological conditions overtime,” underlined the co-Founder of BioMeca, Julien Chlasta. This investigative approach has been featured at the 31st IFSCC Congress, in Yokohama late in 2020. “By combining two cutting-edge analytical techniques, i.e., second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we have been able to accurately correlate both the presence and amounts of elastic fibers with elastic properties of microtissues, thus evidencing that newly formed elastic fibers were functional,” said Dr. HDR Nicolas Bechetoille, Skin Biology Research Manager at Gattefossé. This advanced 3D model has been used to measure the efficacy of EleVastin a novel active ingredient developed by Gattefossé, fighting against age related loss of skin elasticity. More to come in April 2021."
"Octocrylene in sunscreen products degrades into benzophenone, study","The ingredient, which is found in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products - including sunscreens and anti-aging skincare creams - breaks down into benzophenone, which accumulates rapidly as the product ages, demonstrated a team of French and American researchers in a study recently published in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology [1]. Researchers from the Oceanological Observatory of Banyuls-sur-Mer (Sorbonne University, CNRS), in collaboration with their American colleagues from the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Clifford, Virginia, tested some fifteen sunscreen and anti-aging products purchased in France and in the USA. The products have undergone a 6 week accelerated stability aging protocol, equivalent to one year spent at room temperature. Then they were analysed using a high performance mass spectrometer. “Initially, there is very little benzophenone in the products. But gradually as the product ages, there is more and more benzophenone,” told Prof. Philippe Lebaron, co-author of the study, to AFP. Indeed, after subjecting the products to the accelerated stability method, the concentration in benzophenone strongly increased in the products. ""This is the first time the degradation of octocrylene into benzophenone has been demonstrated,"" added Pr. Lebaron. Benzophenone is associated with a wide range of toxicities, including genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and endocrine disruption. The substance is classified as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the WHO. Noting that both octocrylene and benzophenone are easily absorbed through the skin, the researchers believe that octocrylene-based products, and therefore contaminated with benzophenone, can pose a threat to human health. Octocrylene is also suspected of being harmful to marine life, especially corals. Octocrylene can act as a metabolic toxicant in corals, potentially decreasing the resiliency of coral reefs to climate change, said the authors of the study. “Some manufacturers have withdrawn it from their sunscreens for environmental reasons,” notes Prof. Lebaron. The fact that products containing octocrylene may also contain traces of benzophenone is “well known” by cosmetics manufacturers, responded the French federation of beauty enterprises (FEBEA).  According to the trade body, the safety assessment of octocrylene already takes into account the possible presence of benzophenone. Furthermore, the quantities measured in the study published in the the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology, “always remain below the toxicity thresholds that guarantee products are safe to human health.” Actually, the main challenge regarding the use of octocrylene in personal care formulas might be to better purify octocrylene from its benzophenone contaminant before selling it to personal care product manufacturers and to develop stabilizing methods that prevent the formation of benzophenone. ""Our results did indeed demonstrate that the rate of benzophenone concentration increase depends more on the product formulation than on the initial octocrylene concentration,"" said the authors of the study. In any case, according to the FEBEA, human exposure to benzophenone, as described by the study, would not exceed 0.5 mg / day (when applying 18 g of sunscreen per day), which is three times less than the maximum tolerated oral dose. “These traces of benzophenone therefore have no impact on health,"" concludes the organisation."
Silab tests its natural anti-acne active ingredient on a multifactorial model,"Most 3D models mimicking acneic skin do not take into account all of the four main components of this skin inflammation: hyper-seborrhea combined with a modification of the composition of sebum, colonization by Cutibacterium (C.) acnes, in particular the virulent phylotype IA1, hyperkeratinization and a secreted inflammation. “Most 3D models mimicking acneic skin independently use hyperseborrhea or invasion by C. acnes to induce the characteristics of acneic skin,” said Silab. However, as these two factors are inter-related at the early stages of the pathology, the French manufacturer of cosmetic active ingredients sought to develop a 3D model combining sebum alteration and invasion by C. acnes. For that purpose, a reconstructed epidermis was treated simultaneously with peroxidized squalene and C. acnes phylotype IA1 obtained from culture collection or isolated directly from acneic patients. The combination of these two factors induces acne-like keratinocyte responses, such as hyperkeratinization and inflammation, thereby providing a model exhibiting all the characteristics of acneic skin. “The detailed characterization of this new in vitro model proves that it is totally suitable to mimic acneic skin and to be used as a screening tool for the development of acne treatments,” explained by Marine Laclaverie, in vitro Innovation Project Leader at Silab. Once validated, this model was further improved by using different phylotypes of C. acnes strains specifically isolated from healthy and acneic patients. The 3D model resulting from this work has enabled the company to demonstrate the pharmacological activities of Acnesium, a natural active ingredient developed by Silab Softcare to treat the clinical signs of slight to moderate acne in adults. Produced from the pericarps of pomegranates (Punica granatum) from the orchards of the Tunisian Gabès oasis, Acnesium restores the homeostasis of acneic skin by targeting its four major components: it restores the homeostasis of acneic skin, it helps the activity of the sebaceous gland to return to normal, it controls colonization by C. acnes phylotype IA1, it has a keratolytic action and reduces inflammation by limiting keratinocyte sebocyte and lymphocyte inflammatory responses. The clinical efficacy of Acnesium was also demonstrated under control by dermatologists in a cohort of adult Caucasian patients suffering from slight to moderate acne. “Combining rapidity of action and efficacy, this high-tolerance care product improves the general aspect of the skin and thereby patients quality of life,” concluded Silab."
Amorepacific investigates blue light skin damages and how preventing them,"While the cosmetics industry recently focused on fighting the stress induced by the light emitted by the screens of our computers or smartphones, which has been identified as a circadian cycles disruptor and a factor of skin ageing, the scientific evidences substantiating the some claims were hardly abundant. However, a series of recent publications are progressively shedding the light on involved mechanisms and the best strategies to protect the skin from these insidious damages. In a research paper recently published in The Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology” [1], a team of scientists at the Amorepacific R&D Center has presented a clinical evaluation method for blue light skin protection, a world first according to the Korean group. Blue light is a blue wavelength portion of the visible light spectrum ranging from 380-500 nanometres (nm). “Blue light has the shortest wavelength and the strongest energy among all types of visible light, and prolonged exposure to this type of light is known to have harmful effects, such as sleep disturbance and damage to vision. Blue light can have detrimental effects on the skin as well, including skin pigmentation and reductions in skin elasticity and moisture,” explains Amorepacific. However, while the potential impact of blue light and its mechanisms were well known, prior to Amorepacific’s research there had not been any clinical research that had concretely measured the impact of everyday blue light exposure to the skin. Cho Hong-ri, a senior researcher of the Anti-Pollution Research Center in Amorepacific R&D Center, developed a blue light emitting clinical device that allowed the company to measure the effect of these waves on skin pigmentation and to assess the ability of various materials to protect the skin. Based on the minimal persistent pigment darkening dose (MPPD) determined from visual evaluation and melanin index measurements, Amorepacific developed a “protection grade of blue light (PB)” guideline. The Amorepacific’s device produces blue light wavelengths similar to those modern people are often exposed to. By finely adjusting the intensity and time of light, the device makes it easier to conduct clinical evaluations mimicking the average exposure in daily lives. Using the clinical device, Amorepacific R&D Center showed that exposure to blue light with a wavelength of 456 nm causes skin pigmentation. Based on the finding, Amorepacific tested whether a blue light blocker developed and released by the company can actually prevent skin pigmentation. The assessment was based on the measurement of changes in melanin index values, and other data. The company was therefore able to demonstrate that an inorganic filter with titanium dioxide (TiO2) was efficient to prevent blue-light induced stress on the skin. Moving forward, Amorepacific plans to conduct further research on environmental effects and the resulting changes in skin."
USCD and Silab show the importance of the skin microbiota homeostasis,"The role of skin microbiota, in particular opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), in a variety of skin diseases is now well documented. More recently, studies reported an overrepresentation of the species Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) in the damaged areas of compromised skin. This common commensal bacterium of the healthy skin microbiota, which usually brings benefits to the host may also be involved in the compromised skin phenotypes. The objective of the work carried out in Dr. Gallo’s team was to identify the role and mechanism of action of S. aureus and S. epidermidis in the pathogenesis of two inflammatory skin diseases: Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis. The results supported the existence of a pathogenic role for S. epidermidis in compromised skin, similar to S. aureus. The deleterious effects of these two species result from an interspecies communication through a sophisticated system known as quorum sensing. This system allows synchronization of proteases secretion specific of each bacterial population. These virulence factors exacerbate the alterations in epidermal barrier function and inflammatory phenomenon characteristic of Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis. Laura Cau, who was involved in the project at UCSD as part of scientific international volunteering funded by Silab, explains: “These discoveries highlight the considerable influence of the interspecies communication within the epidermal ecosystem on skin health. They strengthen the understanding of the role of commensal microbiota in the development of inflammatory skin diseases”. It is possible that other microbial species could have a similar detrimental effect, including fungi such as Malassezia furfur. Thus, both Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis appear as complex diseases influenced not only by the genome of the hosts but also that of the multiple species colonizing the skin."
Masks can efficiently prevent coronavirus transmission at hair salon: study,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released the report, said the findings added weight to universal face covering policies as a means of slowing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The study is based on a specific case observed in a U.S. hair salon a few months ago. On May 12, a hair stylist (stylist A) developed respiratory symptoms at a salon in Springfield, Missouri and continued working with clients until May 20, when she received a positive test for the new coronavirus. Stylist A ignored medical advice to self-isolate after her test on May 18. A second hair stylist (stylist B), who had been exposed to the first, developed symptoms on May 15 and also continued working until May 20, when stylist A got her result. Stylist B tested positive two days later. At this point, the salon closed for three days for disinfection while Greene County health officials performed contact tracing, identifying a total of 139 clients seen by the two infected stylists. The rest of the staff were also quarantined for two weeks. During their interactions with clients, both stylists had worn masks: stylist A had worn a double-layered cotton face covering, while stylist B had worn either a double-layered cotton face covering or a surgical mask. But even when stylist A had symptoms, the two stylists interacted with each other while neither was masked in intervals between clients. All 139 clients were monitored for symptoms for the next two weeks, and testing was offered to all of them, to be performed five days after their exposure. None of the 67 who were tested were found to be positive, and none of those who refused testing reported symptoms over the next 14 days when they were sent daily text messages inquiring after their health. The customers were roughly gender balanced, and their ages ranged from 21 to 93, with the mean average 52. The overwhelming majority wore masks for the entire duration of their appointments, which ranged in duration between 15 minutes and 45 minutes. The clients mostly wore cloth masks or surgical masks, while about five percent wearing N95 respirators. Scientists believe that although large droplets emitted by people when they cough or sneeze are primarily responsible for spreading COVID-19, smaller droplets released during ordinary speech are also potentially dangerous. This is particularly important because people might spread the virus unknowingly in the two to three days before they develop symptoms, or a carrier in rare cases may never develop symptoms. The authors of the CDC report concluded: ""Widespread adoption of policies requiring face coverings in public settings should be considered to reduce the impact and magnitude of additional waves of COVID-19."""
Skinobs launches a new Preclinical Testing platform,"The new ""Preclinical Testing"" platform enables users to identify and select the most relevant testing methods depending on several criteria: – Test category: Analytical tests, Content-contenair interaction, Ecotoxicity and Biodegradability tests, Safety tests, UV tests, efficacy tests... 
– Claim: anti-ageing, anti-pollution... 
– Test support: cell cultures, 3D skin models... the various tests corresponding to his objectivation project and directly contact each test provider. A keyword search also simplifies the search. Like the clinical tests platform, the new tool is accessible free of charge and without business commission. “It has been never been easier to identify the tests needed for your projects, thanks to the links Skinobs has made between methods and product claims, mechanisms of action and test solutions,” says Anne Charpentier, Skinobs’ founder. In particular, the platform offers a detailed vision on efficacy tests. Cosmeticians can thus find the laboratory that meets their test criteria based on: – Mechanisms of action: Acne, Adipocytes, Anti-Aging, Bioavailability, Skin Renewal, Free Radicals and Oxidation, Hydration, Inflammation, Biomechanical Integrity, Microbiota, Pigmentation, Pollution, Barrier Function, Regeneration... 
– Analysis of 80 biomarkers: cytokeratin, collagen, Metallopeptidases-proteases, interleukins, hyaluronic acid, integrins, Interleukins... 
– Quantitative and/or visual analysis methods: gene expression, histology (morphology and imaging), protein and metabolic analysis... 
– Choice of three levels of custom testing: custom protocol, 100% R&D studies and non-targeted ""omics"" tests. This extension strengthens the central position of the Skinobs platform within the cosmetics industry. It completes the clinical testing platform, which allows cosmeticians to identify relevant methods to support their claims for their active ingredients, finished products or medical devices including: tolerance tests, consumer tests, sensory analyses, efficacy tests on skin, hair or nails. In 2019, 1,700 users from 58 countries have consulted it, viewing more than 19,000 pages. “The success of this unique tool has been built on a collaborative relationship with industry players offering a global view of testing to cosmeticians with more than 300 methods and more than 90 laboratories referenced worldwide,” adds Anne Charpentier. To become comprehensive, the referencing of CROs is continuous to bring together, gradually, all the global partners specialised in the preclinical evaluation of active and finished products on the skin, sebaceous glands and hair. “Our aim is to offer a comprehensive and independent tool, and we know the adventure is just beginning,” concludes Charpentier."
Kao unveils age-related changes in the morphology of lips,"While the problems of young lips are well known, how lips and the lip area do precisely evolve during the different steps of ageing, remained to be documented. Actually, the most common problems affecting lips, dryness and chapping, tend to peak in the 30 somethings. For older women, other issues - such as dull colour, loss of fullness, and an increasing vaguely defined contour of lips - increase along with ageing. In a first part of the study, the researchers of Kao Corporation have analysed facial photographs of 139 Japanese women from 16 to 78 years of age. Results show that both the thickness of the upper and lower lips, and that of both together showed a decreasing trend associated with ageing. Furthermore, the width of the lips broadened with age and fullness of the lower lip shown in lateral views was significantly reduced. The study also found that the white upper lip area under the nose became extended with age. A more detailed investigation by age group showed these changes start around 40 years of age. According to Kao, this phenomenon is attributable to the effects of inner tissue changes and muscular drooping. In a second part of the study, Kao researchers enrolled thirteen Japanese women aged 46-55 years in 2015, then measured and compared various lip area sites in facial photographs taken in 1992, 2002, and 2015. Comparisons of measurements obtained in the same participants confirmed that with age the lips became extended horizontally and nose-lip distance was also increased. The study allowed Kao to get quantitative data on a phenomenon which was generally observed but scarcely measured. The way lips and the lips area change with age has been clarified and documented. According to the Japanese group, these findings will facilitate the development of new cosmetic and make-up products."
ScenTree: a collaborative classification of perfume ingredients,"When they created ScenTree, Maxime Baud and Thomas Espinasse, two young, recent ISIPCA graduates, had three objectives in mind: democratize knowledge on perfume ingredients, take the heat out of allergens, and promote the catalogue of raw material companies. To sum it all up, they offer educational material intended for independent perfumers and marketing services eager for communication data on ingredients and willing to take the heat out of this issue. A digital, interactive raw material bible Maxime and Thomas got the idea of setting up their own classification during their raw material olfactory sessions. To meet this challenge, they drew inspiration from Lifemap, a classification designed by Damien de Vienne, of Lyon University, France. Lifemap classifies all living organisms on Earth in the form of a tree along which you can “move”, a bit like with a map. So far, two perfume ingredient classifications had been available: Champ des Odeurs, by Jean-Noël Jaubert (1983), and a more functional one by The Good Scents Company. As soon as they had got an agreement signed with Lifemap’s creator, the two entrepreneurs applied his model to perfumery. Today, ScenTree lists 460 raw materials, two thirds of which are synthetic, the rest being composed of natural raw materials and a few bases. The two founders aim to classify at least 1,000 raw materials - a perfumer’s palette contains about 1,500. Basically, ScenTree looks like a tree, where each semi-circle represents an olfactory family and includes a descriptor (there are 16 large olfactory families). Zooming on them unveils details about every ingredient, and there is also a search bar providing direct access to ingredients. However, although everyone agrees on the olfactory descriptors, their hierarchy remains subjective – olfaction itself is subjective. All this patient research work was based on reference books, but especially on experts’, perfumers’ and evaluators’ feedback, in order to check the relevance of the information. Cinquième Sens, a partner of the young company, provides a room in their co-working area to host olfactory sessions. Six months after creating ScenTree, the two young entrepreneurs have set up a real structure: their association has become a company. But for it to last, a two-level, self-financing programme was implemented with sponsors, but also partners. As regards sponsors, the idea is to integrate the logo of the sponsoring supplier which markets the ingredient to the ingredient’s ID card. The logo can be interactive and provide access to a complementary presentation drafted by the company. In addition, the sheet will display the ingredient’s trade name used by the partner company as well as the Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ). As far as partners are concerned, the company aims to offer raw material companies and schools the possibility to provide more general communication material. To this aim, ScenTree will use social media, like Instagram and LinkedIn. Apart from this objective, ScenTree will publish a newsletter every other week including the latest updates on the website, cultural information on the perfume world, and information on the sponsors. At the end of the day, ScenTree is aimed to become the not-to-be-missed digital reference in terms of perfume ingredient classification, after Ernest Guenther’s renowned The Essential Oils, first published in 1948."
Google Research team used machine learning to train AI to recognize smells,"Predicting the relationship between a molecule’s structure and its odor remains a difficult. This problem, termed quantitative structure-odor relationship (QSOR) modeling, is an important challenge in chemistry, with a strong potential impact on the manufacture of synthetic fragrance, among others. A paper published on October 23, 2019, by a team of Google researchers tackles how machine learning can be used to find the relationship - which scientists have been trying to quantify for over 70 years - between a molecule’s odor and its structure. While molecular structures can give scientists insight as to what something looks like or what it sounds like, ""predicting the relationship between a molecule’s structure and its odor remains a difficult, decades-old task."" These scientists used machine learning to find this underlying quantitative relationship in a way reminiscent of how deep learning is used to predict visual and auditory characteristics. Using a dataset of 5030 molecules labeled with odor descriptors (like fruity, bready, nutty and cheese) by olfactory experts (like professional perfumers), the team trained a Graph Neural Network to predict these labels based on the molecule’s shape. The perceptual and structural similarities of both local and global components of a molecule aided this neural network in recognizing which parts are responsible for which fragrance nodes. According to the paper, being able to use machine learning to predict odors based on their molecular structures would ""aid in the discovery of new synthetic odorants"" so that natural products don’t need to be harvested in such high numbers. The latest trends and innovations in fragrance will be presented on November 7, 2019 at the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris. Program and registration: www.fragranceinnovation.com"
Kamax Innovative develops breakthrough method to assess cosmetic actives,"Founded in 2013, Kamax Innovative conducted research work in a university in partnership with CNRS to develop a unique optical imaging technology for which they hold exclusive licenses. “We use polarization as an information vehicle to record contrasts and differences in the activity of a cosmetic product on the skin or hair,” explains Jérôme Desroches, President and founder of the startup. Using the K-PROBE device, a next generation automated microscope, the XPolar technology accurately reads contrast differences and quantifies biological modifications on dermal collagen and hair keratin. “We accurately monitor dermal collagen and measure the direct effects of stress factors, like UV rays or oxidation, which can appear on in vitro skin, or the chemical impact of colourants, for example hair colourants,” adds Jérôme Desroches. Other than the new dimension of the results provided, the technology offers multiple key advantages. The sample does not get coloured like it does with the standard observation technique, which requires a visual marker likely to create a bias. With the XPolar test, the sample remains clear of any added substance, so the result is endogenous and more reliable. “We observe a natural XPolar signature made possible thanks to light and demonstrate the activity of products in cosmetics without any particular sample preparation. In addition, our technique helps discover previously unknown actions. It goes beyond the standard technique,” says Jérôme Desroches. Ultimately, this “contact-free” technology only requires a low-power optical laser beam and does not degrade the slides, which can be reused for additional tests. Then, it is all scanned and digitized with a fully digital device ensuring easier data sharing. Launched a year ago, the XPolar technology has already seduced testing laboratories through the services developed by Kamax. The comprehensive solution combining the imaging system and the image processing software solution is now offered to small and major cosmetics groups."
Study reveals the lifestyle factors affecting the skin microbiome,"The new epidemiology study [1] - a collaboration between Amway and Microbiome Insights - was recently published in the scientific journal mBio, and found that up to 20 percent of the variability of the bacteria on people’s skin can be explained by demographic, physiologic and lifestyle factors. Through a survey of 495 individuals between the ages of 9 and 78, and by collecting over 2500 skin swab samples from four skin sites and the mouth, scientists have revealed that the most influential factors associated with facial skin microbiome composition include levels of skin porphyrins - fluorescent molecules synthesized by C. acnes, the bacterium involved in the development of acne — as well as age and the use of sun protection. For the skin inside the mouth, by comparison, ethnicity and smoking showed the strongest associations with its microbiome. The study also found different skin microbiome patterns that corresponded with chronological age and others that corresponded with facial wrinkles and hyperpigmented spots; the discovery of a bacterium called Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii and its association with aging skin is being touted as the first step toward understanding how this microbe could be involved in the mechanisms of skin aging. A patent is pending on this particular finding. Commenting on the findings, Dr. Pedro Dimitriu, Senior Director of Bioinformatics at Microbiome Insights, Inc., which collaborated with Amway on the study, said the research ""advances our understanding of why skin microbiomes are so different from person to person."" ""We know the environment outside the body influences the skin microbiome to some extent, but this study shows some of the lifestyle and host factors that shape it too."""
"“BioMeca puts Atomic Force Microscopy at the service of skin knowledge,” Anna Drillat","Premium Beauty News - What is the link between mechanics of materials and the cosmetics industry? Anna Drillat - The startup was founded in 2016 by Julien Chlasta and Pascale Milani, both PhD in Biology. Pascale Milani was the first to publish an article about the use of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to measure the mechanical properties of growing biological tissues. She worked in collaboration with Marek Haftek [1] on atopic dermatitis. As for Julien Chlasta, he wrote a thesis on the influence of the extracellular matrix mechanical properties in a growing organ. They pooled their expertises to set up BioMeca, whose activities include AFM for measuring the skin’s mechanical properties. Premium Beauty News - How can Atomic Force Microscopy improve our knowledge of the skin? Anna Drillat - AFM is a very high-resolution technique which helps us work at very small scales and study the structures of biological tissues, like the skin, while maintaining the physiological conditions. Today, the innovative approach developed by BioMeca makes it possible to explore the skin’s 3D structure and obtain information about the mechanical properties of the tissue as a whole. In addition, we can study particular structures, like hair follicles, and focus on specific areas: the epidermis, to measure the cohesion between the cells, or the dermis, for example to get information about the organization of collagen, the density and thickness of fibres, their spacing, etc. Then, we make comparisons under various conditions after treatment with an active, or to address specific ages. Premium Beauty News - At the CED days in January 2018, Pascale Milani presented a study on the nano-mechanical properties of corneocytes. What sort of information can you get about the condition of the skin barrier? Anna Drillat - Atomic Force Microscopy makes it possible to screen the surface of a sample with a very thin tip and to measure the interaction forces between the tip and the sample: the higher the elastic module, the harder the sample. The study shows that the hardness of corneocytes provides information about their level of maturation, that, with age, mechanical constraints get stronger, and that they are reduced in case of atopic dermatitis. These measurements are used to evaluate the condition of the barrier function and diagnose sensitive skins or a predisposition to atopic dermatitis. Premium Beauty News - What other information can you get about the skin? Anna Drillat - We work on the main skin compartments, in particular the epidermis, the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ), the dermis, etc. One of our AFM systems is coupled with an epifluorescence microscope, which helps determine correlations between the mechanical and molecular behaviours of a structure. We also have confocal microscopes, so we can complete our mechanical data with accurate fluorescence data to precisely determine the biological processes involved. We are now able to measure the impact of a stress, whether physical or chemical. Our customers are cosmetics players, but we also work for the oncology, phytobiology, and pharmaceutical industries. Thanks to our expertise, we make our customers understand the biological activity and provide them with a scientific interpretation of results. We provide quantitative data that can substantiate claims. Premium Beauty News - What about your prospects? Anna Drillat - There are many. What is important is that all our studies are carried out in vitro, ex vivo, and we keep trying to get as close as possible to in vivo."
Marie-Alice Dibon (1966 - 2019),"Marie Alice held a Masters in Industrial Pharmacy from the Industrial Pharmacy Institute of  Lyon (IPIL) and a Doctorate in Pharmacy from the Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biological Sciences of Lyon (ISPB). She spent 15 years in France and the United States working for the beauty, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. She occupied various positions, from formulation to R&D mangement at Bourjois-Chanel, Beauty Naturally, Aroma Vera and Darja Lab. In 2000, Marie Alice founded Alice Communications Inc. a consulting company, servicing the biotech, pharma and beauty industries on business development, communication, regulatory and innovation, before establishing more recently The WonderLab, with the aim to promote innovation in beauty and support new product developments. Her experience ranged from product development to marketing, through regulatory affairs, business development and manufacturing. In recent years, she had been particularly instrumental in alerting and educating the industry on the major role of the skin microbiome. Many of the people who crossed her path have wished to share their memories here, and pay her a last tribute: Thierry Magnet, General Manager of Gattefossé France - ""In addition to being a passionate professional in the sphere of beauty and health, endlessly exploring the main scientific trends that would make tomorrow’s cosmetic successes, Marie-Alice was also true in friendship and never missed an opportunity to reunite former university fellows, when her frequent flights across the Atlantic allowed her to do so. The many tributes to her memory that have been appearing on social media these past weeks highlight the imprint she will leave in our industry. Her friends will also remember her as a joyful, happy and passionate woman."" Marie Drago, founder of Gallinée - ""For me Marie Alice was really the cement of the cutaneous microbiome community. She succeeded in bringing together and encouraging direct competitors to collaborate in a unique atmosphere. She always delivered new and avant-garde insights. She was clearly passionate, but nonetheless realistic and idealistic and she really believed that the microbiome could change the industry for the better. And thanks to her we all think the same way"". Elsa Jungman, founder of Elsi Beauty - ""Marie-Alice was so brilliant and yet so approachable. When we met in October 2016 in Orlando she immediately introduced me to a community that I knew very little of, inviting me as a speaker to the Premium Beauty News conferences. I will dedicate my conference in Boston to her (an event she should have attended) and the one in Rotterdam in May."" Laurence Moulin, General Manager, CEW France - ""Marie-Alice was a member of the CEW. Many of us knew and appreciated her for both her professional and human qualities. She had a great talent in explaining with clarity and precision how the latest scientific discoveries would influence the future of beauty. Her speeches at the last two editions of the Journée de la Beauté organized by the CEW France had left us all, impressed and enthusiastic. She had also inspired us a lot and helped us for their preparation"".
 
Pauline Gaillard, Marketing Engineer, Gattefossé - ""I was lucky enough to meet Marie-Alice and she will continue to inspire me throughout my professional career. This woman was a shining example of charisma and intelligence ... Marie-Alice had an idea every second on ten subjects at the same time and always with a remarkable, thorough and well-argued accuracy.

"“Bioprinting helps design more and more complex skin models,” Sandrine Héraud, LabSkin Creations","Premium Beauty News - The area of skin substitutes seems to be growth-driving, in particular since animal testing was banned for cosmetic products and their ingredients in the European Union, in 2013. Sandrine Héraud - Indeed, the notion of mimicking the skin, our largest organ, which creates a junction between the internal and external parts of our bodies and offers multiple functionalities, is a broad, even endless topic. Since 2014, Labskin Creations has been creating increasingly sophisticated models derived from tissue engineering for the cosmetics, dermocosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Since the company was founded, we have been developing more or less complex, tailor-made reconstructed skins on which companies can perform efficacy tests on both ingredients and finished products. Our young company has already won many awards, like the Trophée Acteurs de l’Économie and Fast 50 Deloitte, in 2017. Premium Beauty News - At a symposium held by the European Centre for Dermocosmetology (CED) in January 2019, your company introduced a skin model that reproduces atopic dermatitis. What an original approach! Sandrine Héraud -  Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory chronic disease which affects more than one infant out of ten. We combined several approaches to develop an innovative model involving the use of cells derived from patients with atopic dermatitis and of lymphocytes. It is the first human in vitro model of atopic dermatitis with an immunity component. The immune cells migrate in the whole tissue and the model presents a pathological phenotype that mimics the altered skin profile in atopic dermatitis. It helps test actives and finished products designed to treat this pathology. Premium Beauty News - 3D printing is revolutionizing tissue engineering. Has Labskin Creations made progress in this field? Sandrine Héraud - Indeed, bioprinting is a disruptive technology which created a small revolution in the field of tissue engineering, compared to already existing approaches, which is the reason why we focused our developments on this area. Our work results from a very productive collaboration with Christophe Marquette’s 3d.FAB teams specialized in 3D printing. Bioprinting has the advantage of creating highly complex tridimensional structures, very accurately, reproducibly, using an automatic process. Thanks to this approach, we can get a mature skin sample in 21 days, compared to 45 with an in vitro culture. In 2016, we registered a first patent for a complete skin model consisting of both the dermis and epidermis. Then, we added a hypodermis, based on stem cells from fat tissue. We can also enrich models with the vascular component, add skin annexes, like sebaceous glands, and pigment the epidermis with melanocytes. The cell components may be modulated for a personalized result, which offers our customers great flexibility. In the skin, there are more than ten cell components, and we want our 3D models to be as sophisticated as possible, by adding Langerhans cells or skin innervation. Also, we try to reproduce the undulated physiological shape of the dermo-epidermal junction, which is flat in existing models using conventional engineering methods. It is a big challenge for our teams. In addition, we got involved in the Bloc-Print collaborative project which gathers our company, 3d.FAB, and the Lyon Civilian Hospices, in partnership with the Directorate General of Armament. The idea is to use bioprinting to treat burnt soldiers directly on the battlefield. The cells extracted from the patient’s healthy skin are integrated to our bio-ink, and then directly reprinted on the patient, thanks to a bioprinter fitted with an articulated arm. The project received several awards in 2018: the Prix de l’esprit d’entreprendre (award for the entrepreneurial spirit) and the Bref Eco Lab Meeting Trophy. Premium Beauty News - To you, what is the future of 3D models? Sandrine Héraud - The fact that we offer bioprinted 3D models helps us reach new customers. First, the complexity of the 3D models now available, thanks to bioprinting, offers us new development prospects. Then, this approach makes it possible to standardize 3D models, i.e. their reproducibility, in order to discover new actives. The cosmetics industry accounts for 90% of our customers, but the pharmaceutical and medical industries are also much interested in regenerative medicine applications."
Forever young: study uncovers protein that keeps skin youthful,"The prosaically named COL17A1 might not sound like a fountain of youth, but the new study suggests it does the heavy lifting when it comes to keeping skin intact and unimpaired. The protein works by encouraging cell competition, a key process to maintain tissue fitness. That effectively ""drives out"" weaker cells while encouraging replication of stronger ones. But ageing results in a depletion of COL17A1, as do familiar enemies of youthful skin, like UV radiation. And when that happens, weaker cells replicate, leaving the skin thinner, more prone to damage and slower to heal. The research recently published in the journal Nature [1] is based on investigations using mice tails, which share many of the same characteristics as human skin. After confirming the importance of COL17A1, the team decided to investigate whether they could stimulate the protein once it was depleted - effectively looking for compounds that could kickstart the anti-ageing process in skin. They isolated two chemical compounds - Y27632 and apocynin - and tested both on skin cells, with positive results. ""Application of these drugs to full-thickness skin wounds significantly promoted wound repair,"" the study said. The two compounds point to ways of ""facilitating skin regeneration and reducing skin ageing,"" the study added. In a review of the study commissioned by Nature, two professors from the University of Colorado said cell competition had previously only been studied extensively in fruit flies. The research ""provides evidence that healthy cells in mammals can also efficiently repopulate adults tissues, replacing unfit or damaged cells,"" wrote professors Ganna Bilousova and James DeGregori. And they said the research offered ""proof-of-principle"" that the two chemical compounds could combat ageing. ""Future studies are needed to determine the mechanisms of cell competition in other tissues, and to identify compounds capable of reversing ageing in other organs,"" they added."
Understanding intercellular communication in the skin tissue,"There are multiple modes of communication between cells, and they are quite complex. Two main pathways are highlighted: the direct mode, by physical contact, and the indirect mode, through an exchange of chemical messages between an epithelial cell and a recipient cell. Exosome communication is largely studied, in particular as regards cancer or healing. Jérôme Lamartine, of the LBTI Laboratory, raised the question of whether ageing may impact this communication. As for Dr Matthieu Talagas, of the Brest university hospital, he focused on the physical exchanges in the neuro-epidermal synapses. “There are physical contacts between our neurons and each type of epidermal cell, in the form of excrescences, grooves, or keratinocyte tunnels,” he said. Dr Kaori Inoue, of Japan’s Shiseido Global Innovation Center, showed that the ATP and glutamate released after a mechanical stimulation act as mediators between keratinocytes and neurons. They contribute to maintaining the skin’s homeostasis. To Professor Miroslav Radman, Director of the Mediterranean Institute for Life Sciences (MedILS) in Split, Croatia, tissue homeostasis plays a determining role in ageing. “There are many communication channels in our tissues. Cell parabiosis results in a functional homogenization of the cells by offsetting the flaws in a cell using the other nearby cells, without removing the failing one.” In inflammatory phenomena, intercellular communication is stopped by the activation of extracellular proteases. Parabiosis is broken down and the newly isolated cells can then reveal dormant pathologies and accelerate cells’ death. To study the intercellular dialogue, companies use more and more sophisticated skin models. Specific research work is focused on atopic skins. “Our model combines a mode of communication related to an inflammatory condition with a physical disturbance of the barrier function,” explains Pauline Rouaud-Tinguely, of Silab. As for LabSkin Creation, they developed a 3D model obtained from diseased cells enriched in immune cells. As he aimed to better reproduce human skin, Dr Christophe Marquette, of CNRS in Lyon, worked in partnership with LabSkin Creation on the 3D bioprinting of a complete skin model with three layers, including a functional hypodermis. These are promising prospects for a better understanding of how the skin works, but also for grafts intended for serious burn victims. Other presentations on the skin barrier and the epidermis or on the microbiota, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells completed the congress. Skin Science Happy Hour in Paris On April 1, 2019, as a prelude to the in-cosmetics Globa trade show, the European Dermocosmetology Center (CED) will organize an event dedicated to skin engineering and genomics.

Skin and hair science in the age of diversity,"Although Caucasian skin is still the mainstay of many scientific studies, changes in the global population are reducing its prevalence, including in the most developed economies. As Paul Matts, Research Fellow at Procter & Gamble, pointed out, ""in 2050, Caucasian skin will represent only 15% of skin categories, while high growth populations in Asia and Africa will be the majority. It becomes necessary to no longer consider Caucasian skin as central in scientific studies.” Such evolution is all the more necessary that the skin’s main characteristics differ according to ethnic groups. For example, the study conducted by Procter & Gamble on 250 subjects from five different ethnic groups showed that Indians and Latinos had more wrinkles than other groups, but that the wrinkles of Caucasians were deeper and therefore more visible. Several companies have already taken into account the evolution of the distribution of ethnic groups and have adapted their models. Mauritius-based International Center for Pharmaceutical Development (CIDP), for instance, has developed an in vivo measurement system to assess the effect of pollutants on different skin types. ""Measurements have shown that pollution has greater effects on Caucasian skins than on African skins,"" explains Véronique Newton, R&D Laboratory Manager of the CIDP. For its part, BASF has developed an in vitro model reproducing the cell cycle of sebocytes and conducted a study that showed notable differences between sebocytes of Asian populations and African-American populations. Other topics on nails, hair and eyelashes have been dealt through this same multi-ethnic approach. In parallel to the congress and as in previous years, the SFC awarded several scientists for their work in skin or hair science. The young researcher’s prize was awarded to Laura Sabatier of Paris-Sud University for her study demonstrating that the shape of the hair follicle is linked to the shape of the hair. The curlier is the hair, the more asymmetrical is the follicle structure. For his part, Dr. Marek Haftek, research director at the CNRS Lyon, scooped the SFC Award for all its lifetime work contributing to a better knowledge of the skin and its functions. In 2019, the Jean Paul Marty Days will be held on the theme ""Skin and age""."
Study links early puberty in girls to chemicals in personal care products,"Conducted by Kim Harley and Brenda Eskenazi, from the University of California, Berkeley, and published in the journal Human Reproduction, the study shows an association between certain phthalates, parabens and phenols and precocious puberty in girls. [1] Starting with the observation that girls are experiencing pubertal onset at progressively younger ages, study leader Professor Harley and her team analyzed data from 338 mothers and their children who were monitored from birth to adolescence. Researchers have enrolled pregnant women in 1999-2000. Mothers were mostly Latina, living below the federal poverty threshold and without a high school diploma. The mothers were first interviewed during pregnancy. The researchers then measured concentrations of a variety of chemical substances in urine collected from mothers during pregnancy and from children at age 9. Three types of substances were targeted: – three phthalate metabolites (monoethyl phthalate [MEP], mono-n-butyl phthalate and mono-isobutyl phthalate);
– methyl and propyl paraben;
– and four other phenols (triclosan, benzophenone-3 and 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol). The three compounds cited above were present in 90 percent of samples, with the exception of triclosan (a type of phenol) which was detected in 73 percent of samples collected from expectant mothers and 69 percent of samples from the 9-years-old children. In parallel, pubertal timing was assessed among 179 girls and 159 boys every 9 months between ages 9 and 13 using clinical Tanner staging. The research found that girls prenatally exposed to these compounds are more likely to experience earlier puberty, and this risk is particularly high for the daughters of mothers exposed to monoethyl phthalate MEP concentrations and triclosan (TCS) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) concentrations. The researchers found that higher concentrations of MEP and triclosan in prenatal urine was associated with changes in the timing of children’s development milestones. The higher the concentrations, the earlier puberty signs appear.  A problematic situation in a context where the differences of exposure, within the women enlisted in the study, could vary from 1 to 20 according to the substances. Possible reverse causality Previous researches on rats (Bateman and Patisaul, 2008 and Rasier et al., 2006) have shown that phenols, parabens and phthalates might have endocrine disruptors effects. However, no studies have examined the effects of these substances on humans, both during the prenatal period and in the period before puberty. “This complicates our comparison with other studies,” explain the authors. The researchers also warn that their “findings with peripubertal exposure to methyl and propyl parabens could reflect reverse causality if, for example, girls and boys who entered puberty early were more likely to use personal care products containing these preservatives compared to children entering puberty later.” Indeed, these chemicals are quickly metabolized and are found very quickly in the urine (in 24 to 48 hours). Therefore, one to two urinary measurements per developmental point may not accurately reflect usual exposure. The authors also mention another limitation of their study. The population which was observed is limited to Latino children of low socioeconomic status living in a farmworker community. The role of other environmental exposures, such as pesticides, cannot be excluded. Despite these limitations, the authors consider their study is methodologically strong, with a longitudinal design, measurements of exposure biomarkers during two critical windows of development.  It “contributes to a growing literature that suggests that exposure to certain endocrine disrupting chemicals may impact timing of puberty in children.”"
Skin ageing mechanisms are increasingly better determined,"First, Marie-Thérèse Lecci, of the Grenoble university hospital, reiterated the clinical aspects of skin ageing. “Skin ageing is influenced by two main factors: one is intrinsic and related to our biological clock, the other is extrinsic and depends on the sun, tobacco, pollution, our diet, and drugs.” The list of impacting criteria is long and completed by lifestyle changes. Recent studies conducted by Gattefossé showed that screen-related light stress slows down the cell metabolism and causes important damage on the ATP. Skin ageing can be followed up with “-omic” analyses, which help understand physiological mechanisms and identify relevant biomarkers. As Mathieu Hébert, of Laboratoire Hubert Curien, explained, contact-free, non-invasive volume imaging makes it possible to visualize the dermo-epidermal junction. “We have also modelled an average face to characterize the ptosis phenomena based on spectral and hyperspectral imaging,” he emphasized. The CEA evaluates rosacea and complexion radiance by Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy. Then, Catherine Bosser, of the Lyon École Centrale Laboratory of Tribology and Systems Dynamics (LTDS), suggested the SILT (Skin Index of Living Tissue) based on the elastin/collagen ratio calculation, for which a patent was registered. Scientific progress makes it possible to offer more and more, increasingly diversified cosmetic treatments to fight against ageing based on increasingly solid scientific work. Players in this field do not hesitate to invest in advanced research programmes to develop the best-adapted product. BASF collaborated with the Lyon Laboratory of Tissue Biology and Therapeutic Engineering (LBTI) on research related to the maintenance of skin elasticity. As for Gattefossé, they worked with the Grenoble CEA on UVA genotoxicity. Today, the trend is towards ageing well and wellness, as opposed to the cult of appearance. Yet, one can wonder whether it is actually necessary to offer women consumers ever-more innovative solutions against skin ageing. According to a study conducted by the Inter-University Laboratory of Psychology of the University of Grenoble-Alpes and presented by Anna Tcherkassof, “out of 115 women aged 49 on average, 2/3 are satisfied with their own face, while 1/3 are not. They admit a face looks more attractive when it is perceived as young.” This argument will actually do to keep investigating skin ageing."
"Environment, light radiation, microbiota, and substantiation at the core of the IFSCC congress debates","The congress opening conference was focused on the impact of climate change. According to Dr Dick Notz, of the Max Planck Institute, “Even if politicians deny it, the severity of climate evolution is real for scientists. Global warming is inevitable and the consequences on populations’ living conditions will lead to habit changes, and of course, changes in cosmetic use.” The skin effects of the environment were much debated. Beyond pollution, the impact of the whole light radiation, from UV rays to infrareds, triggered many discussions mainly focused on IR and visible radiation, which increases the production of free radicals in Type IV-V Asian skins. “Infrareds accelerate skin ageing and interfere in the regulation of genes involved in the dermal matrix functioning,” explained Suyeon Lee, of Korean company SK Bioland. As for Reinhold Dauskardt, of Stanford University, he studied the skin’s biomechanical changes under the effect of UV and IR exposure. Multiple innovations in terms of cosmetics analysis methods and claims substantiation were shared. Dr Émilie Munnier, of the University of Tours, France, combined Raman imaging with data analysis to set up semi-quantitative distribution maps of cosmetic actives in the skin with high spatial resolution. Ziwei Zhang, of the German University of Tübingen, used Raman Confocal Spectroscopy (RCS) to assess the impact of emulsifiers and of the formulation type on the stratum corneum lipid composition. Other non-invasive optical imaging methods were also introduced. The microbiota keeps generating considerable interest, with varied research work from skin model creation, taking into account the whole skin microbiota, to the study of the influence of antimicrobial peptides on skin quality. Patrick Robe, of Givaudan, presented an analysis of the microbiota taken from five different sites on 86 Caucasian women. 278 microbiotas were sequenced, in particular to highlight the sebum rate as a factor with a strong impact on microbial diversity. Lifestyle influence and hair care and decorative cosmetics innovations were also on the agenda over the congress three days. Next time, it will be held in Yokohama, Japan, in 2020, but in the meantime, the IFSCC conferences will take place in Milan, Italy, from September 30 to October 2, 2019."
Silab demonstrates the shift in skin microbiota of aging Caucasian skins,"After having analysed the skin’s microbiota of a sample of Caucasian women [1], Silab’s researchers have demonstrated its transformation with age. The advanced research teams of [the molecular biology pole of Silab’s microbiota platform->http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/silab-unveils-recent-investments,13170] have collected skin‐swab samples directly on the forehead of two groups of Western European women with healthy skin: a group of younger women aged 21‐31 years and a group of older individuals aged 54‐69 years. The bacterial communities of the samples were then analysed, sequenced and compared. Bioinformatics analysis of the data showed that the distribution of the microbiota changes in the course of aging. The searchers have shown the overall microbiota structure was different between the two age groups, as well as high interpersonal variation within older individuals. Furthermore, taxonomic composition analysis showed both an increase in Proteobacteria and a decrease in Actinobacteria on the older skin. At the genus level, older skin exhibited a significant increase in Corynebacterium and a decrease in Propionibacterium relative abundance.  The results of this researche have just been published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Applied Microbiology [2]. “Previous studies on Asian women had shown a change in the cutaneous microbiota in the course of aging. Nevertheless, given that each population has a different microbial signature with its own lifestyle, it was of interest to the scientific community to decrypt the imbalances of the age-related cutaneous microbiota specifically in Caucasian women” stated Romain Jugé, Silab’s R&D Project Leader. According to Silab these results could become the basis to develop new approaches aiming to rebalance the skin microbiota, which is modified during the aging process. As a first step, the results of this in vivo modelling study led to the selection of panels of volunteers and the substantiation of Ecobiotys by metasequencing. Ecobiotys is a cosmetic active ingredient developed from the yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii, isolated from the nectar of the porcelain flower Hoya carnosa. Ecobiotys is precisely intended to rebalance the distribution of bacterial communities of mature skin by strengthening the skin’s immune and mechanical barriers."
Australia scientists develop ’world first’ melanoma blood test,"The scientists, from Edith Cowan University, said the new test could help doctors detect the skin cancer before it spreads through a person’s body. ""Patients who have their melanoma detected in its early stage have a five-year survival rate between 90 and 99 percent,"" lead researcher Pauline Zaenker said in a statement. She added that survival rates fell to less than 50 percent if the cancer spread in the body. ""This is what makes this blood test so exciting as a potential screening tool because it can pick up melanoma in its very early stages when it is still treatable,"" Zaenker said. The research, published in the journal Oncotarget on Wednesday, included a trial involving 105 patients with melanoma and 104 healthy people. The procedure detected early stage melanoma in 79 percent of cases, the scientists said. Melanoma is currently detected using a visual scan by a doctor, with areas of concern cut out surgically and biopsied. Zaenker said the new process involved identifying autoantibodies a person’s body produces in response to the cancer. ""We examined a total of 1627 different types of antibodies to identify a combination of 10 antibodies that best indicated the presence of melanoma in confirmed patients relative to healthy volunteers,"" she added. Cancer Council Australia chief executive Sanchia Aranda said the test would be important for high-risk groups, who have to undergo regular inspections of their spots and moles that can be difficult and time consuming. She cautioned that the test did not pick up other types of less deadly, but more common, skin cancers such as squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma. ""People need to be very aware of whether they’ve got sun damage or UV damage on their skin, and be alert to changes in any spots or moles,"" she told AFP. The scientists will conduct another clinical trial lasting three years to validate the findings, and hope to have a test that clinics can use after that. One in every three cancers diagnosed is a skin cancer, according to the World Health Organization, with Australia having among the highest incidences of melanoma in the world."
For its 20th anniversary COSM’ING celebrates the key role of biotechnologies in cosmetics,"“Bioinspiration”, or how nature has inspired men for thousands of years, was the recurring theme in the first morning. Examples included ivy, the plant that can cling on to walls by making a glue containing nanoparticles. One gram of this botanical glue makes it possible to stick one tonne! As for the Euplectella Aspergillum sponge, it makes a skeleton with ultra-flexible glass fibres at very low temperature under the action of enzymes… One of the most widely known applications of biomimetics is Velcro. It is inspired from plants fitted with hooks that help them have their seeds carried by animals. Biomimetics is not a new discipline: it started to emerge 20 years ago. Germany was the first country to take interest in it and to understand the usefulness of such an approach. As a matter of fact, it remains the reference country in this field. To Kalina Raskin, CEO of CEEBIOS, the national network of competencies created in 2004, “The culture of biomimetics research is better structured in Germany, as researchers are very motivated and supported by the government. There are more than a hundred public research centres in the field of biomimetics and two major institutional research networks, BIOKON and KompetenznetzBiomimetik (KN), among the largest in the world. It is also the country that drove the drafting of the ISO TC 266/ISO 18458 standard. Switzerland is also very active. As for France, it has advantages thanks to the biodiversity of its territories. The issue of knowledge transfer from Biology to manufacturers is still a brake, though.” In France, as soon as 2007, biomimetics was considered as the figure of the next industrial revolution. In July 2018, on the request of the Ministry of Ecological and Inclusive Transition, CEEBIOS drafted a report on the state of biomimetics in France. [1] What’s next, a biomimetics label? The next conferences revealed the vast spectrum of potential applications of biotechnologies in the field of cosmetics and all the new disciplines that will need to be mastered in the future: Big Data processing, high-density screening, 4D printing of tissues soaked with bacteria, omics… Many cosmetics players, suppliers, and brands draw inspiration from nature to produce actives or develop technologies. Pierre Fabre and Yves Rocher implemented eco-design strategies to produce innovative molecules. Deinove has been exploring the potential of extremophilic strains to develop a unique database (6,000 strains) and produce high-added value molecules like pure, colourless carotenoids. In 2018, a collaboration with Greentech resulted in the Hebelys anti-aging and protective active being placed on the market. A future launch is scheduled for 2019 with Oléos (Hallstar Group) for new oleo-actives. Evonik recently won the first prize at in-Cosmetics for their 100% biodegradable glycolipids obtained by fermentation from modified bacteria. Research on biosurfactants has been booming since the 2000s, as the number of publications and patent registrations literally exploded. Germany is the leader in this field, followed by the US and Asia, and Henkel is the biggest patent applicant. Lastly, since the congress took place in Brittany, marine biotechnologies were at the forefront (Biotechmarine, Roscoff marine station, Lessonia, Agrimer, Greensea…). It is a way for CBB Capbiotek, the congress organizer, to contribute to the economic development of the region, by putting in the spotlight Breton companies which innovate with biotechnologies. For example, Codif International developed a “supervised” screening method to identify biological pathways that remain unexplored in cosmetics. The Biogenouest laboratory has been working on the automation of metabolomics data processing in order to process Big Data. The platform on Workflow4metabolomics.org helps build up, execute, and share data flows online. The perfume segment is also interested in the production of new, increasingly renewable and biodegradable molecules to provide perfumers with a diversified palette. This bioeconomy has become a field of interest for perfumery and aromas. All these conferences help understand the challenges of the great potential of biotechnologies for beauty manufacturers. Whether of marine origin or not, they represent an alternative to our industrial past for a greener future in line with society’s expectations."
"“Authenticating raw materials is a strategic issue”, Patrick Jame, Institute of Analytical Sciences","Premium Beauty News - You are specialized in analyzing and controlling products, in particular on the isotopic level. Patrick Jame - Indeed, ISA is one of the greatest European laboratories in the field of analytical sciences. It gathers over 170 people. Isotopic analysis is based on the measurement of the isotope concentration, compared to the element: for example, the quantitative measurement of the 13C/12C ratio. It helps provide scientific data to recognize or authenticate certain products as regards their origins:  synthetic or natural, animal, or plant origin. Isotopic analysis may also be used to determine the content in biosourced elements, i.e. to verify a compound is actually based on sustainable and renewable biomass and differentiate it from a compound based on petroleum products. Among others, it is used to analyze pure compounds (raw materials of interest), because it is a low-cost, quick method – it takes about ten minutes. Premium Beauty News - What compounds do you work on the most? Patrick Jame - In the field of cosmetics, we were pioneers in determining the animal or plant origin of squalane, as we developed an isotopic analysis method which, as far as we know, is the only existing method to control this substance right now. The Bloom NGO conducted a study in 2015: they revealed that out of 72 cosmetics creams tested, one out of five contained shark squalane. However, the vast majority of creams sold in Europe are plant-derived. The isotopic analysis of squalane is regularly requested to our laboratory, because major cosmetics brands are willing to verify their supply sources. Our customers are European, but also Asian. We are a global reference in this field. We provide a result, but above all, we commit to provide recommendations and a conclusion. Premium Beauty News - What are the limits of this method? Patrick Jame - If used to authenticate the origin of squalane, isotopic analysis only denounces fraud beyond 10%. It depends on the natural variation and measurement uncertainty of the instruments. Premium Beauty News - Do you work for other areas of application? Patrick Jame - We do, we have an isotopic database of over 2,000 compounds. We work for industries like health, the environment, and materials – for compliance follow-up and potential fraud detection issues. The organic sector is also interested in our work."
"“Optics offer a strong innovation potential for cosmetics”, Mathieu Hébert, Institut d’Optique Graduate School","Premium Beauty News – Could you describe the innovation potential associated with optics and the study of coloured surfaces? Mathieu Hebert - At Institut d’Optique, we focus on products with a visual functionality and on their appearance. We endeavour to describe and understand perception attributes with physical or mathematical models describing colours, shine, textures, or transparency. We explore how light is reflected by the material with macroscopic approaches. For example, we are among the first in the world to have studied prints seen not only through reflectance, but also through light transmittance, which was what I focused on for my 2006 thesis at the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne, Switzerland. It also led to several publications. [1] This work is aimed to enhance the control of appearance, but also to invent new visual effects. It represents a strong innovation potential. Appearance is a deep societal concern: Man tries to optimize His own visual quality and that of His products. Premium Beauty News - Which measuring instruments do you use? Mathieu Hébert - We use standard measuring instruments like spectrophotometers, gonio-spectrophotometers, spectral imagery, polarized imagery, but also cameras. With our engineering and Master’s students, we can develop specific devices, for example to evaluate the translucency of a 3D printing material. Our work is based on measurement, modelling, and prediction, and we favour measuring methods that are easy to use, as well as the simplest mathematical models, so they can subsequently be used in the industry. As an example, in the field of printing, instead of measuring a broad sample of over 2,700 colours on a given material, as the best printing houses still do, mathematical models only measure a small sample of about forty printed colours and predict all the others. This is a strong advantage when you have to repeat the operation for another material. Premium Beauty News - What are the specificities of cosmetics? Mathieu Hebert - Visual functionalities are essential in the field of cosmetics, and it is based on very specific materials. For example, our hair is not a flat surface. Also, it does not have only one colour, but a mosaic of narrow coloured areas. Its small scales produce different reflections, one of which is produced on the scale surface and provides the sensation of shininess. The other is produced inside the scales and is usually coloured due to interferential effects. The regularity of the scales has much influence on these reflections, i.e. on our perception of our hair condition. As for the skin, it is a living, translucent, rather heterogeneous material. It can only be studied in reflectance, because it is not possible to position any instrument behind it, contrary to what can be done with paper or textile. Its translucency, in particular as regards red light, also makes it difficult to make measurements, since most spectrophotometers are not adapted to translucent surfaces. That is when spectral imagery represents a good alternative, although it is still a laboratory instrument. Premium Beauty News - What issues do you study for the field of cosmetics? Mathieu Hebert - We have been working on predicting the colour of skins wearing makeup, knowing the characteristics of the bare skin and the makeup applied beforehand. We also follow up the evolution of colours over time. In partnership with the Lyon-based Newtone Technologies company and the Hospital of Saint-Étienne, we have been directing a thesis on the 3D spectral imagery of the face, which actually got the best paper prize at the San Francisco Material Appearance conference in February 2018."
Could graphene sparkle a new era for hair dyes?,"Professor Jiaxing Huang and his team of researchers at Northwestern University (Illinois) recently published a report [1] suggesting that a material called graphene could double up as a hair dye, offering a safer alternative to the current chemical options on the market. What’s more, the material contains anti-static and anti-bacterial properties, meaning Graphene users might not have to wash their hair so often. According to the report, which has been published in the journal Chem, Graphene can be used to darken light coloured hair via an application process that involves spraying, brushing and then drying the hair.  According to the researchers, who tested graphene oxide (GO) and its reduced form r-GO, the material can be used to create water-based formulations to form smooth and continuous coatings on hair.  The ‘dye’ typically lasted around 30 washes in tests, with the report concluding that it could even be suitable for creating ‘ombre’ styles. “Graphene not only avoids the use of toxic, small molecular ingredients in common hair dyes but also renders new properties of hair for enhanced comfort, such as greatly improved antistatic performance and heat dissipation,” explain the researchers. Despite the great interest of this discovery, graphene hair-dyes are still far from entering the next-door hair salon. But natural and mild haircare solutions are becoming increasingly mainstream — as illustrated last December, when cosmetics giant L’Oreal announced the launch of its first-ever vegan and plant-based hair color line, ""Botanea."" Actually, this new process is already making headlines in the mainstream press, a sign of consumers’ greed for innovative solutions in this sector!"
"Non-animal testing methods: 3D skin models can be used to test genotoxicity, study finds","Researchers from Henkel, BASF, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and Procter & Gamble [1] have adapted the comet assay [2] methodology (a test allowing to detect genotoxic hazard) to two reconstructed full thickness human skin models: the EpiDerm™- and Phenion® Full-Thickness Skin Models. The resulting “3D Skin Comet assay” has successfully completed the first phase of a comprehensive evaluation process. Results of this initial study show that full-thickness skin models can be used to evaluate possible DNA damage (or ‘genotoxicity’) induced by new raw materials with a high degree of predictability and reproducibility. Eight chemicals were first tested in several laboratories each using Henkel’s Phenion® Full-Thickness Skin Model, informing several validation modules. Ultimately, the 3D Skin Comet assay demonstrated a high predictive capacity and good intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility with four laboratories reaching a 100% predictivity and the fifth yielding 70%. The aim of the research was to gather enough data showing that the 3D Skin Comet assay can be used as a new in vitro tool for following up on positive findings from the standard in vitro genotoxicity test battery for dermally applied chemicals, ultimately helping to drive the regulatory acceptance of the assay. To expand the database, the validation will continue by testing an additional 22 chemicals. According to Henkel, which developed the Phenion® Full-Thickness Skin Model, bioartificial skin models are ideally suited to serve as reliable test system for a broad spectrum of applications as they are based on human skin cells and are organised in a three-dimensional environment, which well reflects human native skin. The Phenion® Full-Thickness Skin Model consists of both a fully differentiated epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, and the underlying dermis that contains a natural, collagen-based connective tissue. The model therefore resembles human native skin in a variety of anatomical and physiological properties. “Inventing innovative products requires reliable test methods. Therefore we, at Henkel, are engaged in developing new testing methods that allow us to assess the safety of ingredients,” said Dr. Dirk Petersohn, Director of Biological & Clinical Research at Henkel Beauty Care.  “The excellent study results are an important step towards the acceptance of the 3D Skin Comet assay as an officially approved test method,” he concluded."
Skin and barrier function: What are the advances in science?,"Like highlighted Dr. Michel Simon (Inserm, Toulouse) ""the epidermis is a vital multifunctional barrier between the body and the external environment. The stratum corneum, which is its ultimate layer, provides the skin with essential features."" Mechanical resistance, photo protection, antimicrobial defences, antioxidant defences, the waterproof effect all ensure a balance which, when altered, leads to important skin conditions. The molecular mechanisms associated with the barrier function are not all understood, but ongoing research on this subject constantly enriches scientific knowledge. Dr. Michel Simon insisted on the importance of the MAF/MAFB transcription factors in controlling the huge number of genes and proteins involved in the epidermal differentiation process. Corinne Leprince (Inserm, Toulouse), who has focused her research work on lamellar bodies and in particular some specific proteins, the Rab GTPases, demonstrated that the silence of one of them - the RAB11A - causes structural defects and an imperfect barrier function. The importance of the lipid organization in the stratum corneum was recalled by Professor Joke Bouwstra (Leiden University). Other subjects dealt with the energy, immunological or sensory aspects associated with the barrier function. Prof. Loïc Briand (INRA, Lyon) chose to broadened the debate by presenting the most recent findings on taste receptors located in keratinocytes. Dr. Nathalie Broussard complemented the picture by sharing the work of Prof. Denda Shiseido who refers to the epidermis as a ""third brain"". On the sidelines of the congress, the SFC awarded, as in previous years, the Young Researcher’s Award to two doctoral students. Fatima Alsamad (University of Reims) was rewarded for the development of a method of detection and quantification of cutaneous AGEs by means of vibrational imaging. Nils Petitdidier (CEA-LETI, Grenoble) shared the award for his work on an imaging system for the analysis of layered tissue by diffuse reflectance. The congress was also an opportunity to recall the existence of the scientific database Kosmet with a free access for SFC members and which was upgraded thanks to the contribution of the Greentech and Péchoin Companies. Next year, the Jean Paul Marty Days will address the theme ""Peaux et annexes kératiniques du monde"" (skins and keratin appendices in the World)."
IFSCC 2017: Pollution and Asia at the core of cosmetics research,"Once again, the fight against the deleterious effects of pollution on the skin resulted in a great number of communications and posters. Whether considered from the angle of study models, the ingredients available, or the impacted biological targets, this issue is getting broader and broader and gradually integrates new elements. BASF has developed a machine that can expose the hair to both exhaust gases and UV radiation at the same time. “The impact of pollution on the hair has not been much studied so far, whereas when our hair comes in contact with pollution, its composition and aspect changes. Our machine reproduces what is observed in reality with an exposure modulation system,” explains Zhi Rao, of BASF China. Shiseido uses the effects of repulsion related to electrostatic forces with a polymer based on phosphorylcholine which prevents fine particles and pollen from sticking to the skin. In partnership with Cytoo, Gattefossé designed special equipment to study the biological effects of the light emitted by screens on the skin. The two companies have provided evidence of the significant impact of screen exposure on the function and mitochondrial dynamics of skin fibroblasts. As for Silab, they shared their work on mitochondria and cell stress. The congress was held in Asia, so specific studies on that market were shared. The correlation between the skin parameters of 411 Korean women and their genomic analyses helped identify new aging markers. Another study conducted on 5,205 Asian subjects provided obvious evidence that as we get old, wrinkles increase, elasticity reduces, and above all, the size of skin pores is an important marker of aging. Lastly, Amore Pacific – the company was the first to place cushion products on the market and is still the leader on this segment – studied the new expectations for this type of products in three Asian countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand). The other themes tackled also provide an overview of the main topical issues for the cosmetics industry: the skin barrier, the microbiota, the art of formulating more efficient, but also greener products, makeup formulation. Next year, on September 18-21, 2018, it is Germany that will host, not the IFSCC conferences, but the 30th annual IFSCC Congress."
Skin microbiota: What are the effects of cosmetic products?,"It is possible to answer gradually to the other questions, by comparing skin swabs from subjects receiving a cosmetic product or a placebo. The major species of skin bacteria are known and there is a need for a method which is able to quantify it in a specific way. The quantitative PCR method allows to know the evolution of bacteria quantities between two conditions. For example you can follow Staphylococcus sp. (Firmicutes), Corynebacterium sp. (Actinobacteria), Propionibacterium sp. (Actinobacteria) at the genus level or target the species level. It answers to the question, saying yes, my product impacts or does not impact these species of skin microbiome. This method benefit is the cost, it is a basic investigation method, but it is limited to the targeted species. However, at this stage, it is difficult to explain if the modifications of species are good or bad. Going further, a larger investigation may be done by using the 16S rDNA sequencing for bacteria and ITS sequencing for fungi. This method will provide the semi-quantitative evolutions of the taxonomic composition and evolutions of the microbial diversity index. It is then possible to know if the product broadly modifies or not the microbiome. This method has the advantage to provide an in-depth investigation of the microbial communities and to avoid the culture which is limited to species which grow on the proposed medium. The disadvantage is the semi-quantitation, the yield variations of 16S PCR, and the lack of cause-and-effect relationship on skin. Going deeper, it is possible to know more, particularly by investigating the skin and its microbiota simultaneously, and this at the level of metabolic functions and pathways. This is done with high resolution proteomics (nanoLC-MS/ms mass spectrometry and associated bioinformatics). Indeed, the studies made at the genes level don’t signal the proteins expressed by any cosmetic product effect and however, the proteins are still in charge of the skin cells working. It is thus possible to know for example the variations of defense, virulence or lipid transport mechanisms on the bacterial side and pro-inflammatory mechanisms activation on the skin side. Then you get the knowledge on the impacts. Without giving the cause-and-effects relationships, this method has the advantage to give correlations between phenomenons at the skin and bacteria levels. The main difficulty is the huge quantities of data to be processed, but we know how to reduce it with database adapted strategies, particularly with 16S genomics and proteomes coupling. We enter now in the « multi-omics » approaches which will be more and more used to deep into the mechanisms understanding. Of course, the microbiome investigation requires some precautions in the sampling plan. To avoid he high inter-individual variability and the high subject number, it is convenient to work by comparing the left side to the right side of the face or the body. Also, you have to avoid the comparison of D0 to D+3 weeks as a lot of environmental or physiological events can introduce a bias in the experiment. The following tests are available at MS Phylogene : – Targeted quantitative PCRs of bacteria directed at the genus or species level, 
– Bacterial 16s rDNA and fungal ITS sequencing with OTU-based estimation to investigate microbial communities diversity and determine taxonomic composition, and 
– High-resolution nano LC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics and CORAVALID™ / MicroXplore™ data processing: The efficient tools for discovery."
Gattefossé and Cytoo unveil first results of their research on blue light,"In order to better determine the direct effects of the skin exposure to the artificial light emitted from the screens that are everywhere in our modern life, Gattefossé and Cytoo have initiated a two-year investigation.  The two companies have united technology, expertise and know-how with a first aim: to explore mitochondrial modulation and protection upon artificial visible light exposure. Unique equipment was designed by Gattefossé to accurately recreate the characteristic light emitted by screens of electronic devices (smartphones, tablets, PC).  By using micropatterning technology, a method to guide cell shape and monitor cell fate, Cytoo has developed a High Content Screening assay combining precise control of human dermal fibroblast spreading and sensitive analysis of mitochondrial fusion/ fission dynamics by non-invasive live-cell imaging. A first series of results has already evidenced that exposure to screens significantly weakens mitochondrial function and dynamics. Cytoo and Gattefossé have observed a fragmentation of the mitochondrial network alongside loss of quality control and diminished capacity to produce ATP [1]. “Using the Cytoo model, we have been able to demonstrate that screen-emitted light has a tremendous detrimental effect on the mitochondrial network of skin fibroblasts. This research highlights the need for a strategy to protect the skin from everyday artificial light”, explained Nicolas Bechetoille, Skin Biology Research Manager at Gattefossé. Mitochondria, also termed the powerhouse of cells, produce the energy essential to proper biological function of cells. Mitochondrial quality is finely adjusted by constant reshaping of its structure via a process involving fusion and fission. For this research, Cytoo has adapted its platform to dermo-cosmetic applications, in particular its models of human skin (EpiScreen™ and FibroScreen™), which allow the screening of biologically active compounds. “Mitochondrial fission and fusion play critical roles when cells experience metabolic or environmental stresses. Both companies have brought cutting-edge technologies to address a brand-new vision of biological processes implied in skin homeostasis. This collaboration with Gattefossé validates once more the ability of Cytoo to generate innovative and predictive solutions to our partners,” commented Luc Selig, CEO of Cytoo. This work will be presented at the 2017 IFSCC Conference in Seoul on October 23-25."
Tattoo ink can seep deep into the body: study,"The tiny particles — measuring a few millionths to a few billionths of a centimetre — include molecules from preservatives and contaminants such as nickel, chromium, manganese and cobalt, researchers reported in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports. Tattoo colouring is composed of various organic and inorganic pigments, and can be contaminated with toxic impurities. Besides carbon black, the second most common ingredient used in tatoo inks is titanium dioxide, a white pigment also used in food additives, sun screens and paints.  The chemical has been associated with delayed healing, itching and skin irritation. ""When someone wants to get a tattoo, they are often vary careful in choosing a parlour where they use sterile needles,"" said co-author Hiram Castillo, a researcher at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France.  ""No one checks the chemical composition of the colours, but our study shows that maybe they should."" Scientists in Grenoble, joined by colleagues at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, used X-ray fluorescence measurements to identify particles in the skin and the lymph nodes, which are located in the neck, under the arms and along the crease between the thighs and the abdomen. Only the tiniest, nano-scale particles made it into the lymph nodes.  The researchers also used a technique called Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to assess changes in tissue near tattoo particles at the molecular level. They reported ""strong evidence"" for both the migration and long-term deposit of toxic elements in the body.  Now that their presence has been established, the next step is to look for evidence of adverse effects, including inflammation, they said. Once a rarity outside of marginal communities, tattoos have become mainstream fashion accessories in recent years. By one estimate, some 40 percent of Millennials in the United States have at least one tat, hidden or on display."
Self-tanning: New substance can induce UV-free melanin production in human skin,"Epidemiological studies clearly show that individuals with fair skin and/or poor tanning ability are at higher risk for developing nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers, which are uncommon in darkly pigmented individuals.  The authors of the study published in the US journal Cell Reports [1] therefore consider that the possibility to induce pigment production by human cells through the topical application of the newly designed substance is a realistic pathway toward the reduction of skin cancer risk. The researchers from the Harvard Medical School developed small-molecule SIK inhibitors that were optimized for human skin penetration, resulting in MITF upregulation and induction of melanogenesis. Applied as a cream to the skin, the drug allowed red-haired mice to develop a deep tan. Like their pale-skinned human counterparts, the mice are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of the sun’s ultra-violet rays. The original breakthrough in mice was announced more than a decade ago, in a study published in the British journal Nature in 2006. But it has taken scientists that much time to work out how to make much thicker human skin absorb the substance. The initial report revealed that a substance called forskolin gave red-haired mice a deep tan without exposure to UV light. But because human skin is relatively hairless compared to animals’, it has evolved to be much tougher in order to protect against heat, cold and other environmental factors, and the topical substance could not penetrate it effectively.  ""Human skin is a very good barrier and is a formidable penetration challenge. Therefore, other topical approaches just did not work,"" said David Fisher, chief of dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital, a professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School, and one of the authors of the study.  ""But 10 years later, we have come up with a solution. It’s a different class of compounds, that work by targeting a different enzyme that converges on the same pathway that leads to pigmentation,"" he said. The scientists tested the substance on samples of human skin kept in laboratories and found that it darkened in proportion to the dosage applied. The tan lasted several days. In animal tests, red-haired mice became ""almost jet black in a day or two with a strong enough dose,"" the researchers observed. When the dosage was removed, normal skin regeneration meant the colour faded within a week or so. ""We believe the potential importance of this work is towards a novel strategy for skin cancer prevention,"" Fisher said.  ""Skin is the most common organ in our bodies to be afflicted with cancer, and the majority of cases are thought to be associated with UV radiation,"" he said. The long-term aim would be to create a cream that develops a tan without exposure to sunlight but which also absorbs harmful UV rays like traditional sun screens."
"""The exposome concept could lead to many promising cosmetic innovations,"" Aïna Queiroz, ID bio","Premium Beauty News - You made quit an impression at the last edition of In-Cosmetics by proposing brands to target the exposome. Can you tell us what it all about? Aïna Queiroz - We are indeed delighted with the welcome received by our latest launch and for which we chose to focus on the exposome concept. This term, encompasses all the exposures to which we are subjected as individuals from the intrauterine stage - i.e. already in the womb of our mother - to the end of our lives. This term was coined for the first time in 2005 by Dr. Christopher Wild (current Director of the International Agency for Research on Cancer) and was later found in the French Loi Touraine of 2015, as part of the study and management of environmental exposure in France. If we reconsider the issue in dermo-cosmetics, studies on exposomes are still in their infancy. However, the first scientific journals and publications started to appear, allowing, for example, getting a better understanding of the relationship between exposome and skin ageing. This could lead to very promising new opportunities for our industry in terms of innovation, both on the side of finished product and of active ingredients. Premium Beauty News - Is this an extension of the product offering developed for fighting urban pollution? Aïna Queiroz - More than an extension, we want to take a step back because the exposome encompasses a much wider perimeter than urban pollution alone. For example, such factors as stress, microflora, climate, food, tobacco or alcohol consumption, education, UVs, blue light and many other parameters, will be considered as being part of the exposome. As part of the development of actives planned by ID bio to deal with the exposome, we will of course integrate the anti-pollution dimension, for which we have been already proposing various solutions in the past three years. But finally our offer intends to address more broadly this issue of multiple exposures. Premium Beauty News - What are the solutions proposed by ID bio? Aïna Queiroz - The main thread guiding our Research and Innovation department was to identify the vegetable shields capable of preventing and fighting in a complementary manner the various consequences of these exposures. And to reinforce the natural protection of the skin against the diversity of exposome constituents (UVs, tobacco smoke, pollution, stress, temperature variations etc.), we have already imagined and developed three solutions in synergy: 1. A mechanical shield to physically limit the penetration of harmful particles right to the epidermis. This active ingredient is obtained from marshmallow root, with some complex sugars that form at the surface a protective veil in the way of a ""glyco-cocoon""
2. A biological shield, which prevents and repairs the effects of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, a characteristic feature of tobacco smoke and certain exhaust gases. The development of this ingredient was bio-inspired by buckwheat, a plant studied in phyto-remediation (de-pollution of an environment thanks to a plant species) for its ability to capture some heavy metals from the soil and survive.
3. A soothing shield that relieves particularly fragile and regularly exposed skins to stress or temperature changes, for example. This ingredient was designed with an aim to promote a sustainable Limousin co-product: the saffron flower but with its pistil removed. Premium Beauty News - How does it work? Aïna Queiroz - Today, different mechanisms are already identified but obviously there is still a lot to discover on this new research thematic. To ensure the complementarity of each of our plant based offers, we explored different avenues. Concerning the mechanical shield, we developed an active with both, anti-adhesive properties vs. the exposure to particles (upstream) and a booster effect for their removal (downstream) in order to imagine a complete effective cosmetic routine, from morning to night. As for the development of a biological shield, we sought to limit the pro-inflammatory response (IL-8) and preserve skin homeostasis (tight junction, CLDN1 & 4) against UV and benzo[a] pyrene exposures. In addition, the aim of our soothing shield was to minimize the impact of stress or the skin chafing sensation. For an identical active we therefore highlighted effects on the barrier function (profilaggrine), inflammation (NF-kB/TNF-α) or neurosensory discomfort (TRPV1). Finally, when we project ourselves at the beginning of each of our innovations, in addition to the final claim targeted (moisturising, slimming, anti-ageing, among others), our reflex is now to ask ourselves if our active couldn’t also protect us from one of the effects of exposome?"
"Microbiome, the cosmetic revolution. From science to product.","The aim of this conference is to take stock of scientific knowledge and see how marketing services can already take it on to innovate and meet the new expectations of consumers.

What is the potential for personalized genomics and epigenetics in cosmetic science?,"In a speech opening this congress, which brought together a large audience at the École Normale Supérieure in Lyon, Professor Pierre-Henri Gouyon reminded ""genes have no effect outside a given environment. Genetic information is immaterial and the effect of genes can only be seen in the environment in which they are observed"". That is what epigenetic is all about. Among gene regulators, microRNAs, which were discovered in nematodes in 1993, are now the subject of numerous studies.  ""To date, more than 2,600 microRNA sequences have been described in humans,"" said Professor Jérôme Lamartine.  As far as the skin is concerned, the researcher highlighted the role of Mir-203 as a transition regulator between proliferation and differentiation in the human epidermis. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are also of key regulators of gene expression. Recent researches by Dr. Markus Kretz of the University of Regensburg in Germany has that LncRNAs can impact the regulation of the skin homeostasis. More concretely, according to a study conducted by Clarins, daily meteorological changes can affect the regulation of genes. ""We conducted a large study about the impact of brief and repeated weather variations on differentiation and matrix remodelling of a reconstructed human skin model. The results show a significant reduction in the expression of coding genes for various collagens, laminins, proteoglycans, thus suggesting a profound remodelling of the extracellular matrix,” explained Christelle Guéré of Clarins. Will the future of personal care be the design of personalized cosmetics based on genomic analyses? According to Philippe Benech, from Genex, ""if the identification of genes involved in pathologies or in ageing benefits from recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics, the understanding of involved functional mechanisms remains a major challenge since the function of a given gene can change with the context."" Genex has developed PredictSearch, an in-house software using big data, which could be described as a mix between Google and Medline to carry out biofunctional analyzes of the genes. In France, genetic examination can only be carried out for medical, judicial or scientific research purposes. This is not the case in the US, but also in Norway and Sweden, where some cosmetics companies offer tailor-made products based on a DNA analysis of the customer. Is it a real scientific advance or only marketing argument, it is probably too early to know…"
"""Changes in the rheological properties of the skin open very promising prospects,"" Bérengère Fromy, CNRS","Premium Beauty News - Your career path is unusual. You are a mathematician by training and currently a CNRS Research Director in the Laboratory of Tissue Biology and Therapeutic Engineering (LBTI) of Lyon and a skin specialist. How does one switch from mathematics to biology? Bérengère Fromy - It was during my PhD at the University of Glamorgan in Wales that a door towards biology opened. I was actually working on the mathematical modelling of the vascular effects induced by support stockings to optimize the choice of sizes. The model emphasised was common practice among Egyptians: bandage improves venous return. We were focused on macro-circulation but the model also demonstrated that light pressures could improve microcirculation, an unknown process in biology. Later on, I continued with a post-doctoral research work in Angers in the laboratory of Professor Jean-Louis Saumet to verify the existence of this microvascular process and investigate further the physiological mechanisms involved in the relationship between cutaneous microcirculation and mechanical stress. To this end, I developed a small pendulum, which coupled to a Doppler laser, enabled to measure blood flow in the skin when it is subjected to light pressures. Light pressure promotes blood microcirculation in healthy skin by inducing vasodilatation. The theme I have been focusing on at the CNRS since 2002 is based on this work and this ""mechanical sensitivity and cutaneous vasodilation"" interaction. We are seeking to understand the skin’s defence mechanisms to fight effectively against mechanical stress. Premium Beauty News - In 2012, you were awarded the CNRS bronze medal, for your work published in the prestigious journal Nature Medicine; what was the scope of this work? Bérengère Fromy - We identified a pressure-induced vasodilation (PIV) signalling pathway in healthy skins that have the particularity to spontaneously adjust to mechanical stresses. In pathological skin, this vasodilation is impaired or absent. We demonstrated the role of the ASIC3 mechano-sensitive channel in this physiological process. ASIC3 is activated under the application of local pressure and triggers sensory nerve endings that generate the release of neuropeptides vasodilators (CGRP, VIP, PACAP). These neuropeptides bind to endothelial cells that in turn release nerve relaxing prostaglandins and nitric oxide. This naturally occurring process in healthy skin is less efficient in pathological skin with impaired endothelial cells, such as during ageing or diabetes. This condition contributes to the weakening of the skin under pressure, which can lead to bedsores. In the case of peripheral sensory neuropathy, the person has no nervous information to help detect the applied pressure, which results in worsening its defence capabilities against bedsores. Premium Beauty News - Today, what is your outlook for the future? Bérengère Fromy - This work offers several fields of application with, first, the medical field and the fight against bedsores. We are working on antioxidant treatments that could improve and restore the PIV process. The cosmetic sector is also taking interest in our work and in our ability to assess the functional quality of skin. Furthermore, we are continuing our work by studying the influence of skin viscoelastic properties on microvascular adjustment capabilities in the presence of mechanical stress. Changes in these rheological properties during ageing and in health conditions such as diabetes opens very promising avenues."
"“Information is more important than matter”, Pierre-Henri Gouyon","Premium Beauty News - What is your view on personalized genomics and epigenetics? Pierre-Henri Gouyon - Genetic information is coded in the form of a message through the DNA, a very stable molecule. It should be known that taken separately, this information has no value: a gene cannot make anything. This information must be read by a system we can call a decipherer, which can be found in a given environment. This Message-Decipherer-Environment (MDE) system is interdependent. I like to compare it with the cooking field, where the recipe is the message: it will never make a dish on its own. The cook is the decipherer, and the laboratory where he works and the ingredients he uses are the environment. Epigenetics have to do with the decipherer, which sets up reading systems depending on many elements, including the environment, and modifies the way the message is read. That is when hormones, cell differentiation systems, and the mechanisms related to DNA methylation get involved. And we get different answers from the same hereditary message. Epigenetics science is not new, it appeared in the 1930s. But it was recently demonstrated that certain epigenetic disruptions could be transmitted on the intergenerational level. About ten years ago, researchers at the University of Umea, Sweden, showed that two generations later, in a village in the North of Europe, certain individuals suffered from the same diseases as their ancestors, although they had not experienced the same famine/abundance episodes favourable to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. More recently, it was found that a disrupted reproductive system in women could result in anomalies in the sexual development of their girl descendants. So, obviously, we cannot analyze this system partially. It should be considered as a whole when taking interest in this topic. Premium Beauty News - Your laboratory has been working on genetic systems, adaptation, and domestication. Do the issues related to climate change act on these systems? Pierre-Henri Gouyon -  In my early career, I conducted research work on the genetic variability of aromatic thyme essences. Six genetically different essences coexisted, including one which could be found in a region north of Montpellier, France, where climate conditions were extreme in winter. In the 1960s, the temperature in this area could reach -30 °C. In the 1980s, it was only -20 °C, and now, the thermometer rarely goes down below -10 °C. Forty years later, it was found that these changes resulted in the gradual disappearance of forms that resisted against the cold. Their adaptation involves the elimination of non-adapted forms. Premium Beauty News - You have co-written Le fil de la vie : la face immatérielle du vivant, a book published in April 2016 by Odile Jacob, in which you explain information is more important than matter. Pierre-Henri Gouyon - Indeed, with Jean-Louis Dessalles, who is an expert in artificial language and intelligence, and Cédric Gaucherel, specialist of ecosystems and their interactions with animal and human life, we suggest a complementary view on living organisms. Western science is based on the study of matter and energy. We consider life as a set of structures produced by information and able to reproduce information, whether genetic, social, or ecosystemic. It is genetic information that reproduces, not living beings. Genes use living organisms as vehicles to reproduce. Information unites organisms in time, and it is able to travel from one organism to another, be stored in them, be transmitted, and withstand the test of time beyond their temporal limit."
Study shines light on another benefit of sunlight,"Researchers at the USA’s Georgetown University Medical Center have found that sunlight plays a positive role in the action of T lymphocytes, or T cells, which allow the human body to combat pathogens. The study found that blue light present in sunlight directly activates the cells, both in samples taken from mice and humans, by increasing their speed of movement. This, in turn, makes them more effective at fighting infection. The T-cell response was found to be driven by hydrogen peroxide, a compound that white blood cells release when an infection is detected in the body. It serves to kill bacteria and to rally T cells to mobilize an immune response. Given the large surface area of human skin, all of the T cells present in skin could potentially benefit from this phenomenon through exposure to blue light, the researchers suggest. Note that vitamin D is only produced in the body via exposure to UV rays, which can be harmful in cases of prolonged sun exposure. If blue light from the sun’s rays is capable of energizing infection-fighting T cells, it could be a potential means of treatment for boosting immunity in many patients, the researchers conclude. Blue light present in sunlight could give the immune system a boost. © shapecharge/Istock.com"
Jean-Paul Marty Days 2016: The impact of pollution on the skin,"It is believed that pollution is the 4th cause of death in China, and populations consider it the 2nd reason for early aging. It affects 92% of the world population. The nature of pollutants varies according to the geographic situation, but everyone feels concerned. Cosmetics manufacturers have well understood the issues associated and, since 2011, the number of products launched with an antipollution claim has increased twofold. If the impact of pollution on public health is increasingly more studied, its impact on the skin remains to be more accurately defined. “There are still few in vivo studies on this issue, in particular on the synergy between pollutants and exposure to UV rays. And yet, long UVAs play quite a significant role on the photoxicity of pollutants,” explains Jérémie Sœur, of L’Oréal R&I. It is hard to measure the actual skin exposure to pollutants, while many in vitro and ex vivo tests were performed and showed an effect of pollution on the cell functions. The transcutaneous penetration of very small fine particles, 6 to 20 times smaller than the size of a hair, has not been demonstrated yet. According to Jérémie Sœur, “The pollutants carried by fine particles might adsorb or desorb on the skin.” He adds that “in addition to the topical administration, there is another important route to be taken into account: the systemic route.” Cosmetic actives suppliers and finished product brands have presented various approaches to tackle pollution. Some are inspired from bioremediation, like IDbio, others ensure the protection of certain cell functions like mitochondria and proteasome. Physical screens to pollution are also recommended, showing there can be multiple angles of approach to deal with this complex issue. The congress was also an opportunity for the SFC to award the “SFC Prize” attributed to Jean-Claude Le Joliff for his many contributions to cosmetics, including the recent Cosmétothèque, the library of cosmetics knowledge. The SFC also supports young researchers: PhD Florine Eudier, of the University of Le Havre, France, was rewarded for her original approach to the evaluation of the effects of pollution on the properties of the surface of the skin. The SFC offers her the possibility to travel to Korea and attend the next IFSCC congress there."
UV filters possibly linked to the increased frequency of frontal fibrosing alopecia,"Findings of a recent study published in the British Journal of Dermatology (BJD) [1] suggest an association between sunscreens contained in facial skin care products and the increased frequency of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) among women.  Described for the first time in 1994 in Australia, FFA is an inflammatory scarring alopecia that mainly involves the frontal and frontal / temporal hairline and eyebrows.  FFA mainly affects postmenopausal women although it also occurs in younger women and occasionally in men.  FFA remained rare during the 1990s but has become increasingly common in the last 10-15 years In order to identify possible causes of this new disease, a questionnaire enquiring about exposure to a wide range of lifestyle, social and medical factors was completed by 105 women with FFA and 100 age and sex-matched control subjects. A sub-cohort of 40 women with FFA was patch tested to an extended British standard series of allergens. “This study would not have been possible 15 years ago. The fact that we and others are now able to recruit large numbers of patients with FFA with relative ease is illustrative of the rising incidence of this disease, making it difficult to escape the conclusion that an external cause is responsible,” explain the authors. Results of the questionnaire show that the use of sunscreens was significantly greater in the FFA group compared with controls. Subjects with FFA also showed a trend towards more frequent use of facial moisturizers and foundations but, compared with controls, the difference in frequencies just failed to reach statistical significance. The high frequency of positive patch tests among the FFA group could implicate fragrances.  However, “fragrances have been present in facial cosmetics for many years and this would not explain the apparent recent surge in incidence of FFA,” highlight the authors. Actually, the clue may reside in the frequency of sunscreen use.  Twice as many women in the FFA group regularly used a sunscreen compared with controls.  “Although the use of dedicated sunscreens by subjects with FFA did not approach universality it is noteworthy that many facial moisturizers now contain sunscreen chemicals, a trend that has accelerated in recent years.” The authors also point that allergy to sunscreen chemicals is well recognized although uncommon and that the first cases of FFA were reported from Australia where a campaign promoting the use of sunscreens to prevent skin cancer was launched in 1981. However, the authors admit they cannot exclude the possibility that the higher use of sunscreens and skin care in the FFA group reflects a tendency by these women to ‘look after’ their skin (due to the aesthetic consequences of the disease).  They also highlight the fact that the low level of discrimination between subjects with FFA and control groups with regard to the use of facial products is a significant limitation. Moreover, the study does not make it possible to determine which solar filters are possibly involved."
Scientists reveal the secret of frankincense,"It is mentioned more than twenty times in the Bible, where it is one of the gifts offered by the Three Wise Men. Frankincense (also called olibanum [2]), one of the world’s oldest fragrances, is a gum resin that exudes from the bark of Boswellia trees, which grow in countries bordering the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. It has been used for more than 6,000 years by every civilization, from Mesopotamia to the present. Regularly burned during religious ceremonies, it contributes to the very particular smell of churches. Despite its long history and the large amount of research dedicated to it, the exact nature of the molecules that give frankincense its distinctive fragrance surprisingly remained unknown. Nicolas Baldovini and his team at the Institut de chimie de Nice (CNRS/UNS), which specializes in fragrances, have just succeeded in identifying them for the first time. The chief difficulty lay in finding methods of analysis precise enough to characterize these odorous substances, which are present in the fragrance in very small quantities (a few hundred ppm), and therefore all the more difficult to detect. To do so, the researchers used three kilos of essential oil of frankincense from Somalia, from which they isolated a purified sample of approximately 1 mg of two odorant constituents, through a series of distillations, extractions, and chromatography analyses. A group of researchers trained to recognize the typical odour of frankincense proved necessary to assist in this work, for only the human nose is sensitive enough to detect these constituents in small quantities in a mixture. The team then had to determine the molecular structure of these substances using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, the equivalent of an MRI applied to molecules). The two molecules, which give frankincense its “old church” smell have been identified as (+)-trans- and (+)-cis-2- octylcyclopropyl-1-carboxylic acids. Moreover, this is the first time that these compounds have been discovered in nature. In order to irrefutably confirm their characterization established using spectral analysis, the team then synthesized each of these components - which they named “olibanic acids” - and used synthesis to demonstrate they were identical to the natural components. “Thanks to this discovery, perfume makers can now produce these molecules artificially in unlimited amounts, and use them in different perfumes,” concludes the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)in a release."
"In vitro method in sun care, a status","There is no doubt, we have to replace in vivo methods by in vitro methods for sunscreen products. Whether for economic or ethical reasons, thanks to manufacturers, under pressure from the associations, from the European commission, health or security agencies, the consensus is clear, the next developed method must be an in vitro one. By the way, the work began many years ago thanks to Colipa who published the UVA in vitro method in 2006 offering an alternative to the in vivo method (PPD). But what about today in Europe if an industry wants to develop and sell sunscreen products because Europe has two methods for UVA, one in vivo and one in vitro. Is it possible to replace one method by the other one? The only standardized method for the SPF is in vivo, can we still use an in vitro method for claiming an SPF? Finally what are the other standardized methods and ongoing standardization? Although some answers seem simple, but conflicting information from the web, several newspapers or magazines can be misleading. During Cosmeticdays, next December 1st and 2nd in Marseille, we’ll discuss the standardized methods to date as well as those under development,  including in vitro SPF and the complexity for future developments. A well-defined status could answer precisely to all open questions about the use of these different methods for determining indices of protection and their future."
3D bioprinting of skin tissues: better and better-performing techniques,"What is the objective of tissue engineering? Developing skin substitutes to maintain, repair, enhance, or replace damaged tissue on patients. Several approaches coexisted over the years, and it is now possible to obtain better and better-performing skin substitutes. “We already have functional microvascularized models, and we are also working on models to which the lymphatic system was introduced. It is a challenge for our team, because few studies were conducted in this field, and the lymphatic system is very complex to structure in a functional way,” explains Laure Gibot, of Toulouse’s Institute of Pharmacology and Structural Biology in the south of France. As for Alain Colige, of the Laboratory of Connective Tissues Biology at the University of Liège, Belgium, he has been working on materials based on chitosan nanofibres. “Chitosan nanofibres guarantee a large specific area and their properties are close to human skin’s.” Other methods also involve electrospinning, as Frédéric Bossard, of the Joseph Fourier University of Grenoble, France, explains. Nevertheless, the field that is really revolutionizing tissue engineering is undeniably 3D printing. “It is just the beginning, as we must solve reproducibility issues,” explains Colin McGuckin, of CTiBiotech. Still, Christophe Marquette, Coordinator of the 3DFab platform, has worked with Amélie Thépot, CEO of LabSkin Creation, to obtain a bioprinted skin model. “The technique makes it possible to reduce the culture time by half, from 50 to 21 days, but also to get an undulated dermo-epidermal junction [1], which cannot be done with the usual tissue engineering techniques. We are now able to print all skin layers, even if the epidermis is harder to obtain.” The bioextrusion technique uses a patented bioink and prints 1cm3 of skin in less than two minutes: an outstanding performance and first achievements that will no doubt pave the way for others."
Study suggests triclosan has no impact on human microbiome or endocrine function,"Found in soaps, shower gels, toothpaste, deodorants, mouthwash, moisturizing creams, anti-acne products, shaving creams and more, triclosan is a synthetic antibacterial agent used in all kinds of personal hygiene products since the 1980s. The use of triclosan is so widespread that traces of the substance are found in most people’s urine. In fact, a study carried out between 2003 and 2004 in the USA found triclosan present in urine samples from 75% of individuals tested. The impact of the substance on human health has been a subject of controversy for many years. Suspected to be an endocrine disruptor, triclosan has also been suspected to contribute to antimicrobial resistance or have an adverse effect on the human microbiome and also to increase allergies. In 2014, the European Commission banned the use of triclosan in all shaving products, such as foams, as of October 30 that year. This kind of product was considered a particular risk, since small cuts to the skin’s surface could allow triclosan to enter the body more easily.  In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers of soaps and washes containing triclosan to provide evidence proving the effectiveness and safety of their products, widely used in the USA and elsewhere. American researchers [1] have now found that a group of people exposed to triclosan through day-to-day personal hygiene products suffered no damage to their intestinal microbiota or endocrine system. The findings contradict the conclusions of previous studies on mice, dating from 2012, that pointed to harmful effects on the reproductive and endocrine systems, as well as the muscular and immune systems, with respiratory and food allergies. The substance’s role in increasing antibiotic resistance was also highlighted. ""There are a lot of people who are fearful of triclosan, but we didn’t find anything to support that concern in our study,"" said principal study investigator Julie Parsonnet, MD, George Deforest Barnett Professor in Medicine and Professor of Health Research and Policy, Stanford School of Medicine. ""When you throw most antibiotics into humans, they are an atom bomb on the microbiota, but we found that when people are exposed to triclosan through normal household products, it does not cause a major blow to our microbial ecosystems."" The new study saw 13 healthy participants randomly asked to use personal hygiene products that either contained triclosan or did not contain triclosan for four months. After this initial phase, participants switched over to the alternative group for four additional months. Blood, stool, urine and oral samples were taken and their microbiome composition analyzed. Although triclosan was massively present in participants’ urine during the period where they were using products containing the substance, there was very little change in their intestinal and oral flora, and there was no significant impact on endocrine or metabolic markers. Though this study was limited by the small sample size and imprecise administration of household and personal care products, the authors say that triclosan at physiologic levels from exposure to these products does not appear to have a significant or important impact on human oral or gut microbiome structure or on a panel of metabolic markers.

"A ’second skin’ polymer to eliminate wrinkles, eye bags","While the silicone based product is a long way from being on store shelves, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said it could one day offer more than just cosmetic lifts, but also protect sensitive skin from the ravages of eczema and dermatitis. ""It’s an invisible layer that can provide a barrier, provide cosmetic improvement, and potentially deliver a drug locally to the area that’s being treated,"" said researcher Daniel Anderson, an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering.  ""Those three things together could really make it ideal for use in humans."" Scientists have been working on a polymer like this - one that could mimic the properties of natural skin - for about five years, according to the report in last week’s edition of the journal Nature Materials [1]. The silicone-based polymer can be applied in a thin layer on the skin during a two-step process. ""First, polysiloxane components are applied to the skin, followed by a platinum catalyst that induces the polymer to form a strong cross-linked film that remains on the skin for up to 24 hours,"" said the study. ""Both layers are applied as creams or ointments, and once spread onto the skin, XPL becomes essentially invisible."" Tests on human subjects showed it could reshape saggy skin under the eyes for about 24 hours, and made skin more hydrated.  Future uses could include using the ""second skin"" for protection against the sun and ultraviolet rays, researchers said.  Researchers say the new product, called a cross-linked polymer layer or XPL, works better than the currently available options for wound dressing - silicone gel sheets and polyurethane films. “Creating a material that behaves like skin is very difficult,"" said study co-author Barbara Gilchrest, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.  ""Many people have tried to do this, and the materials that have been available up until this have not had the properties of being flexible, comfortable, non-irritating, and able to conform to the movement of the skin and return to its original shape."" Scientists have created a catalogue of a hundred polymers before testing multiple combinations and find the best way to recreate the look, strength and elasticity of a healthy skin. Besides its cosmetic applications, the XPL platform may offer advanced solutions to compromised skin barrier function, pharmaceutical delivery and wound dressings. The research team included MIT, Massachusetts General Hospital and researchers from two companies, known as Living Proof and Olivo Labs. The latter aims to develop the technology and market it probably with a first focus on its therapeutic properties."
Innovations and Science: New efficacy tests for new products,"The beauty world is moving to a new era. ""Products are becoming increasingly smarter. They seek to meet in real time the needs of consumers, like the Romy concept, dedicated to the creation of made-to-measure and highly customized cosmetics. They can be self-adaptive, like the suncare products in the Expert Sun range developed by Shiseido with a sunscreen protection which is enhanced when it comes into contact with water or sweat, thanks to the Wet Sun technology. Some are the result of collective intelligence, like the Clinique Smart Custom Serum,"" explains Stéphanie Machon founder of Make It Bloom!. Others seek to meet growing consumer demand for anti-pollution products that contribute to well-being. ""All these developments encourage us to adopt new approaches to support never seen before claims,"" explains Anne Sirvent from the Laboratoire Dermscan, who recently developed a deposition protocol of pollution and dust particles on the skin. Ctibiotech has developed a bio 3D printed skin tissue for the in vitro evaluation of cell responses in contact with substances selected according to product claims. ""Smart Beauty starts with us and the in vitro assessment of raw materials on 3D tissues,"" details Nico Forraz CEO of Ctibiotech. Specialised in skin ageing, Patricia Rousselle, Research Director at the CNRS, uses the latest innovations in efficacy testing to evaluate the efficiency of new molecules on processes she identified. ""Our research on perlecan, a proteoglycan with a heparan sulfate function has showed its benefits in the renewal of the epidermal basal layer and its contribution in restoring the skin’s regenerative capacity.""

CTPA responds to study on chemical exposure in teenage girls using cosmetics,"A team of researchers from UC Berkeley and Clinica de Salud del Valle de Salinas looked at the levels of certain chemical substances in the bodies of Latina teenagers who were participating in the Health and Environmental Research on Makeup of Salinas Adolescents (HERMOSA) project, set up to look at the effect of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on adolescents. The researchers enrolled 100 girls with the aim to determine whether using personal care products whose labels stated they did not contain “potentially endocrine disrupting chemicals” such as phthalates, parabens, triclosan, and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) for three days could lower urinary concentrations.  The researchers asked the teenage girls to switch from their usual cosmetics to products labelled as containing the controversial chemical ingredients. The authors of the study said they looked at young females not only because women expose themselves to more personal care products than men, using on average 12 self-care products daily compared to the average man who uses just 6, but also because previous research has suggested that teenage girls use even more self-care products than the average adult woman. To test the any changes in chemical exposure during the trial, the participants submitted urine samples before and after the three days. The results, published last week in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, showed that after these three days, levels of chemicals in the body had dropped significantly. Levels of diethyl phthalate decreased by 27 per cent, methyl and propyl parabens by 44 and 45 per cent respectively, and triclosan and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) both dropped by 36 per cent. From their results the team concluded that women can significantly reduce their exposure to some chemicals by taking just a short break from self-care products or by choosing products with fewer chemicals. “This study demonstrates that techniques available to consumers, such as choosing personal care products that are labelled to be free of phthalates, parabens, triclosan, and BP-3, can reduce personal exposure to possible endocrine disrupting chemicals,” concluded the researchers. In a response to the study publication, the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) said that “nowhere does the study itself demonstrate any endocrine disrupting property or show any negative impact from exposure to the chosen chemicals.” According to CTPA, the fact that levels of certain chemicals found in the body or in the urine decrease when stopping using products containing these substances is really to be expected and is not specific to cosmetics. “Of course our body is used to coping with things that we eat or may get absorbed by the skin, but these are readily metabolised and harmlessly excreted. The levels that we get rid of will be dependent on what we put in. However, what is really important to remember is not whether we can detect the presence of a substance in the body or urine, but whether the presence of that substance can actually cause us harm,” adds the association. The publication of this new study follows a series of attacks by consumer protection groups about potentially harmful ingredients in cosmetic products.  According to experts of the cosmetics market, this wave of catchy headlines and the fact that safety is almost always linked to natural products should benefit to natural and organic cosmetic brands, despite the fact that scientists warn that ""nature"" and ""safety"" are not automatically correlated. Update: March 15, 2016 - 10.30 am (Paris) Yesterday, the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) also responded to the study.  According to the Washington based trade association:  “The study identified nothing new.  The ingredients found in urine were at levels generally consistent with results from other monitoring studies, e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The levels reported for these ingredients have not been shown to cause negative health effects, and the mere presence of a substance does not translate to harm.” The PCPC also criticizes the choices of the study authors regarding the chemicals they chose to focus on.  “The study included three phthalates, only one of which - diethyl phthalate (DEP) - has any significant use in cosmetics and personal care products.  DEP has been repeatedly assessed and found to be safe as currently used.” Read more here: www.personalcarecouncil.org"
Gene holds key to (no) grey hair: study,"The gene, IRF4, was known to affect skin and hair colour through melanin production, but a new study is the first to pinpoint its unique role in the inexorable transition to shades of grey. Further research on precisely how IRF4 works could unlock techniques and treatments that slow or even halt that process, said the scientists. ""An initial avenue has to do with the role IRF4 could play in survival and maintenance of cells that make pigment,"" said Andres Ruiz-Linares, a professor at the University College London Genetics Institute who led the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications.  Understanding how the gene interacts with other genes controlling hair colour, for example, might yield cosmetic applications that block the fade to grey as hair grows in the follicle, he told AFP. To undertake the analysis, scientists did a so-called genome-wide association scan (GWAS) of 6,630 volunteers in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru, matching similarities in their DNA with physical traits. But rather than selecting subjects that shared a common ancestry - all northern Europeans or Japanese, for example - the researchers deliberately mixed things up. Nearly half the participants were of European background, 40 per cent were Native American, and six per cent were of recent African origin. Depending on ancestry, people tend to go grey at different stages in their lives, the study found. ""The average age of hair greying for Caucasians is in the mid-30s,"" Ruiz-Linares told AFP. For East Asians, the loss of colour starts in their late 30s, and for sub-Saharan Africans, in their mid- 40s. Likewise, the greying process is said to be ""premature"" if it starts before the age of 20 in people of European background, and before 25 and 30 among Asians and Africans, respectively. Setting aside unresolved ethical issues, one could even ""wildly contemplate"" the use of gene editing, an ultra-precise cut-and-paste process for altering DNA sequences, he said. But the IRF4 variant that favours grey also produces fair hair, he cautioned, so tinking with the gene could also mean fewer blondes. The size and original design of the research yielded a trove of new results.  Another gene, PRSS53, for example, was found to influence curliness, shedding light on the evolution of hair shape that led to straight hair in East Asia and among Native Americans. A variant of a third gene, PAX3, was strongly associated with ""mono-brow"", the tendency - especially among men - for eyebrows to be joined by a bridge of facial hair."
The Cosmétothèque to spread the heritage of cosmetics,"Created on the initiative of Jean-Claude Le Joliff in January 2014, the Cosmétothèque, which is intended to preserve the cosmetics industry’s heritage, has already compiled thematic dossiers, stories, and over fifty subjects in the form of interviews. “Just like what is being done with perfumery at the Osmothèque in Versailles - the 20-year-old unique perfume library recounting the history of perfumery founded by Jean Kerléo - I had the idea to tell the whole long history of cosmetics, but written by the players and professionals of this industrial branch. And it was first to be available on a web portal.” What was Le Joliff’s aim? After he graduated as a biologist, he was in charge of the R&D, and then the Research & Innovation department of a leading French luxury and cosmetics group. He has now been committed to working as a consultant for companies implementing innovation strategies for 15 years. This forward-looking activity made him grow aware of the importance of being familiar with the past! And he wishes cosmetics players’ memory and know-how would not keep getting lost, because it is harmful for the industry. “The cosmetics industry is a real hub for intense research in innovation. But to be efficient, it needs to rely on the best state of the art, and it is not always an easy thing to do.” That is how the Cosmétothèque was created as an Association Loi 1901, and it now counts about fifty members. It is mainly based on voluntary, unpaid contributions, and the main cosmetics themes are presented via seven columns: brands, creators, products, ingredients, packaging, the collector corner, and the mirror effect. “The mirror effect shows old products can be used to create insights, by reinterpreting the past, as they do in fashion. Besides, it can be noted that some products were even ahead of their time, maybe sometimes too much, like the Clarins lotion against electromagnetic waves developed in 2007, whose production had to be stopped.” Today, a new milestone has been reached for the Cosmétothèque: it is now hosted by the BIU’s website. “Being hosted by this inter-university library shows the university community increasingly recognizes what we do. The Cosmétothèque will be available alongside historical pharmaceutical and dental sites, and we will be able to create virtual exhibitions like Secret de Beauté, built up at the IFSCC congress, and to gather several articles dealing with the same theme in the form of books: the Cahiers de la Cosmétothèque,” explains Jean-Claude Le Joliff."
Bio-printing of human skin: Poietis targets pharmaceutical and cosmetic uses,"""We combine 3D printing technology and cell biology to manufacture biological tissues, layer by layer,"" summarizes Fabien Guillemot, Founder of biotech firm Poietis, ex-researcher at French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). Three-dimensional printing of biological tissues, responds to a wide range of major socio-economic challenges: – Reduction of animal testing thanks to in vitro models allowing to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of cosmetic ingredients and active pharmaceutical compounds;
– Drug discovery by producing predictive disease models;
– Emergence of personalized medicine by making custom tissues from the patient cells; 
– Regenerative medicine by fabricating custom grafts. According to Poietis, market perspectives associated with bioprinting were recently valued at close to 2 billion euros in 2020. To date, four bio-printing technologies are available on the market. However, according to its founders, Poeitis (from the Greek “manufacture”) is for now the only company in the world using a laser-assisted technology to ""print"" living matter. “Using lasers for bio-printing works a bit like inkjet technology, in the sense that a laser drive creates a spurt of ink, the ink being a sort of cradle for cells.  By moving the laser beam, we lay drops of cells at different locations and rebuild 3D structures layer by layer,"" explains Fabien Guillemot.  ""With laser technology, we have a resolution of around 20 micrometres (one millionth of a metre), so we can print cells cell by cell and give even more complexity to what we create, and reproduce all the complexity we see in our tissue and our organs."" The whole manufacturing process is based on predefined computer models that are inspired from existing living tissues. These digital models, fully developed by Poietis, allow not only to organize the cells initially but also to anticipate how they will interact in time.  Three weeks are required to reproduce the skin. For now, the company, which has about twenty employees (biologists, optical engineers, IT specialists …), uses two printers developed with INSERM and Alphanov laboratory, a member of the Bordeaux-based competitiveness cluster dedicated lasers. However, the company is already working on developing its own bioprinter, which should be operational within two years. As a first step, Poietis aims to develop its business by tapping into the enormous potential of testing in cosmetics and pharmaceutical research.  “This is why we first worked on the skin, it is a real opportunity for development,” says Fabien Guillemot, who has just signed a strategic partnership with the global chemical giant, the German group BASF supplier of ingredients for cosmetics. BASF intends to use the advanced printing resolution of the Poietis’ bioprinting technology to refine its skin model Mimeskin. The laser-assisted bioprinting technology will be used in a first step to allow for automated reproduction of Mimeskin, followed by more advanced models containing additional cell types. The company, which has just completed a first round of financing of 2.5 million euros (including a record of nearly 1 million euros via the crowdfunding platform WiSEED), aims to validate its first products and market them to research and testing centres by 2017."
New cell-based tests promise alternative to animal testing,"""Thousands of chemicals to which humans are exposed have inadequate data on which to predict their potential for toxicological effects,"" the study authors wrote in the journal Nature Communications. [1]  However, traditional toxicity tests using animals are expensive and species differences mean they do not always accurately predict a chemical’s effect on humans.  Animal tests also raise ethical concerns about animal welfare.  ""An important goal of the US Tox21 program is to use in vitro data as surrogates for in vivo toxicity to reduce animal testing,"" study co-author Ruili Huang of the NIH told AFP.  But to achieve this, cell tests have to be just as predictive, or more so, of human toxicity as animal tests. After testing about 10,000 compounds, each in 15 different concentrations and on different cells, the team used their database to build predictive models for new chemical combinations. “Compound clustering by structure similarity and activity profile similarity across the assays reveals structure-activity relationships that are useful for the generation of mechanistic hypotheses,” explain the researchers who applied structural information and activity data to build predictive models for 72 in vivo toxicity end points. Researchers found that their models could predict toxicity for both humans and animals.   “Models based on in vitro assay data perform better in predicting human toxicity end points than animal toxicity, while a combination of structural and activity data results in better models than using structure or activity data alone. Our results suggest that in vitro activity profiles can be applied as signatures of compound mechanism of toxicity and used in prioritization for more in-depth toxicological testing.” These models may be ""a promising alternative to traditional animal toxicology studies.""  However, further work must be done to validate and improve the models, which Huang said may never completely replace animal testing. It may, however, allow scientists to prioritise chemicals predicted to be most likely toxic for further tests using traditional methods, and so ""significantly reduce the amount of animal tests required,"" he said. Animal activists have welcomed the research. ""To understand more about human development and human diseases, the world’s most forward thinking scientists are developing and implementing methods that supersede the crude use of animals,"" Julia Baines, science policy advisor of the organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) told AFP.  ""PETA welcomes the wealth of advanced non-animal research methodologies that are creating a brighter future for animals and human health."""
Nanomaterial additives improve performances of cosmetic packaging,"According to the Valencia-based Plastics Technology Centre (AIMPLAS), which participated in the NANOPACK project [1], results of the project’s second phase that occurred in 2015 show that nanoparticles incorporated to plastic polymeric materials used for cosmetic packages can improve their properties. The research was performed with nanosized clays and metallic oxides.  According to AIMPLAS, their incorporation into plastic polymers contributed to add value to plastic cosmetic packaging: – Nanoparticles improved the quality of the polymeric material, making unnecessary the use of additional additives and high filler percentages.
– Nanosized additives allowed decreasing the amount of raw materials needed to elaborate the packaging, with subsequent cost saving when replacing the materials formed by multiple layers with monolayer materials.
– Nanomaterial additives also provided plastic packaging with advanced properties, including a higher barrier to gases and best mechanical and thermal properties. “Plastics are currently the most used material by the cosmetics industry for the package of their products, since they give several advantages regarding design freedom, lightness, resistance and lifespan. NANOPACK has achieved to prove that all these properties can be improved,” commented AIMPLAS. The research programme also investigated the impact of nanoparticles when added to biopolymers (bioplastics) from renewable sources.  In particular, NANOPACK assessed what categories of bioplastics best respond to the incorporation of nanomaterials, bearing in mind the specific requirements of cosmetic packaging."
Jean-Paul Marty Days: Skin microbiota in the focus,"Apart from the fact that 90% of our body is filled – not to say colonized – with bacteria, this gigantic microbial population raises many questions, one of which concerns the cosmetics industry more specifically: the adhesion of microorganisms on the surface of the skin. To Marie-Noëlle Bellon Fontaine, researcher at AgroParisTech, “90% of microbial cells live fixed to biotic surfaces like the skin and the stomach, but also abiotic surfaces like ceramics and plastics.” Adhesion involves physico-chemical interactions. “The pH regulates the adhesion, but also the topography and roughness of the surface. Depending on the type of surface, the microbial structure is modified with a sub- or overexpression of certain bacteria,” the researcher completes. Then it can prove difficult to determine the conditions in which the microbiota must be studied, bearing in mind that the skin surface is not inert. The microbiota analysis, which started with the study of the intestinal microbiota, is a broad, complex subject that is already been researched for several years. Joël Doré, researcher at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), confirms the need to develop standardized methods and collect samples most meticulously. “Without a standardized method, it is impossible to issue any comparability, which often makes it burdensome to implement the protocols, whereas it is essential.” Metagenomic methods are used. By contrast, the research on the skin microbiota is much more recent than that of the intestinal microbiota. “The skin has been studied for a bit less than ten years, knowing that we only cultivate 1% of known bacteria, and that we only know 0.1% of the bacteria present on the skin,” explains Richard Martin of L’Oréal. It is believed that each square centimetre of our skin contains one million bacteria that exchange, communicate, and live together, which makes their analysis quite painstaking. We all have our own bacterial card defined according to our diet, living environment, climate, and even the way we came into the world. “There is a huge difference between what we can observe in our laboratories and what actually happens on the skin,” Richard Martin completes. Scientific research on the skin microbiota has only just started, and prospects must be much broader than what we can imagine today."
Aging: Shiseido links “sagging skin” to impaired lymphatic function,"With Japan having one the world’s most aging population, there’s no surprise that Japanese scientists be among the most advanced in the comprehension of ageing mechanisms.  Cosmetics companies, of course, have a high interest in these issues. The study [1], conducted by the Tokyo-based cosmetics giant jointly with Professor Nobuyuki Takakura of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, also pointed out that “pine cone extract” could contribute to solve this problem as it has the effect of strengthening and normalizing the lymphatic vessels. Capillary vessels, which supply nutrients and oxygen, and lymphatic vessels, which are indispensable in collecting water and waste products, play important roles in the maintenance of healthy skin.  Previous studies have found that impaired blood vessel and lymphatic function is a cause of skin aging. For instance, explains Shiseido, under the effect of ultraviolet rays or aging capillary and lymphatic vessels become slimsy, and this structural change prevents nutrients from spreading into every corner of skin. “In addition, reduced lymphatic function causes prolonged inflammation, which results in wrinkles,” says the company. So far, “sagging” was attributed to a decrease in collagen fibres or reduced elasticity, accumulation of subcutaneous fat and enlargement of adipocytes.  However, the idea of Shiseido and Professor Takakura was that it might be associated to the state of lymphatic vessels. Actually, Professor Takakura has identified “apelin” [2] as a novel endogenous factor that enhances the function of lymphatic vessels, and furthermore, he discovered that apelin suppresses the accumulation of subcutaneous fat. Based on these study results, researchers set out to examine in detail the relationship between lymphatic function and accumulation of subcutaneous fat and found that: – fatty acids, which are present in the lymph, can destabilize lymphatic vessels and leak from the vessels,
– leaked fatty acids directly promote the differentiation of adipocytes. Furthermore, it was found that apelin has a function to suppress the leakage of fatty acids from lymphatic vessels. Precisely, it is in saggy parts that subcutaneous fat accumulates.  The study therefore concludes that “sagging” is due to an impaired lymphatic function that leads to an increase and accumulation of subcutaneous fat. In the wake of this discovery, Shiseido, in collaboration with Osaka University, initiated the screening of herbal components that would be able to mimic apelin, i.e. to enhance the lymphatic function and suppress subcutaneous fat accumulation. “Pine cone extract”, collected from Pinus Sylvestris, which is distributed throughout Europe and Asia, was found to have the same ability to bind to the G protein-coupled receptor APJ, which is expressed in the cell membrane of lymphatic endothelial cells, and stabilizes lymphatic vessels.  Tests were conducted for two months with a trial product formulated with cone pine extract and showed a reduction of the nasolabial and facial lines, as well as of neck sagging."
"""The time when botanists were analysing isolated plants has gone,"" Pr. Gilles Comte","Premium Beauty News - On the occasion of your keynote speech during the last edition of the European Days of Dermocosmetology organized by CED, you put forward the concept of chemical ecology for botanicals. Pr. Gilles Comte - Actually, a plant cannot be isolated from his environment. The time has gone when botanists we’re collecting plants and analysing them outside their biological environment. At the Centre for Studies on Natural Substances, we are investigating the interactions within the whole ecosystem and especially interactions between plants and bacteria. Many types of bacteria are associated with plants and benefit from this association to get carbon and other nutrients. On the plant’s side, the response varies according to each microbial source. While bacteria adapt very quickly to the physiological changes of the plant, the response from plants is slightly longer. There is a kind of chemical war between living organisms, based on weapons that are interaction mediators. Certain aspects are positive, allowing, for example, the selection of partners. Other interactions lead to the production of anti-bacterial, of anti-fungal substances by the plant to ensure its own protection and survival. Botanicals have native protections but the environment where they grow modifies them. We must keep in mind that plants unlike animals cannot run out from specific environmental conditions such as sun exposure, the presence of bacteria, humidity, etc. Premium Beauty News - What kind of analytical tools do you use to identify the interaction mediators? Pr. Gilles Comte -  Several thousands of metabolites can be identified in animals while there are several hundreds of thousands metabolites in botanicals. An interdisciplinary approach is required to study of the interactions between living organisms and the chemical mediators of these interactions. The method combines chemistry, biochemistry, many areas of biology and genomics, in particular metabolomics. The aim is to identify the organs, tissues and even the cells that produce or receive chemical signals. We also follow how mediators evolve depending on conditions related to the environment. Premium Beauty News - What are the main applications of your research? Pr. Gilles Comte - Many sectors can be impacted by our researches since botanicals are widely used for food, as well as by the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industries. Our researches also impact environmental studies. We are used to form partnerships with private companies. For example, a few years ago, we conducted a research on the rose and its varied chemical background to determine the best farming, harvesting, drying and processing parameters to obtain a the least variable product possible. As far as farming is concerned food, a lot of work focuses on food crops (corn, wheat, herbs). From an ecological point of view, we can respond to observations such as the fact that some plants are pollinated by insects while others, which are similar in appearance, are not. We can also explain how some plant species can limit the development of others by using interaction mediators that will limit germination or development. In the latter case, it is easy to figure out what are the potential applications in terms of bio- pesticides at a time when most chemical pesticides are being banned."
"Signs of aging appear in mid-20s, study finds","The findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences’ July 6 issue are based on a group of 954 people born in New Zealand in 1972 or 1973. Researchers collected data on the subjects’ kidney, liver and lung function, dental health, the blood vessels in the eyes as well as their metabolism and immune system function at age 26, 32 and 38. They also measured cholesterol, fitness levels and the length of the telomeres, which are the protective caps at the end of chromosomes that have been found to shorten with age. Using a total of 18 biological measurements, researchers determined a ""biological age"" for each participant at age 38 — with some registering under 30 and others appearing to be nearly 60. When scientists looked closely at the ones who had aged more quickly, they found signs of deterioration were apparent at age 26, the age when the first set of biological measurements were taken. Most of those in the group were aging at the expected rate of one biological year per chronological year, or even less. Others were aging as fast as three biological years per chronological year. Those whose bodies were aging faster also ""scored worse on tests typically given to people over 60, including tests of balance and coordination and solving unfamiliar problems,"" said the study. And when a group of university students at Duke (Durham, North Carolina) was asked to look at pictures of people in the group, they consistently rated as older those whose bodies were aging more quickly than the rest. Study authors said their findings pave the way for future tests that may be easier and cheaper to implement, so that people can find out how fast they are aging in their 20s, when they might be able to do something about it and possibly prevent age-related diseases. Previous research has shown that genes account for only about 20 percent of aging, leaving the rest up to health behaviors and the environment. ""That gives us some hope that medicine might be able to slow aging and give people more healthy active years,"" said senior author Terrie Moffitt, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University."
The CED explores the different facets of plant neochemistry,"To Professor Gilles Comte, Director of the Centre for the study of natural substances, plants must be considered within their environment. They do not live alone, as they interact with predators, but they also have to cope with specific temperature, water stress, and soil composition conditions that have an influence on their own development. “We focus on the interactions between plants and bacteria in particular. We are trying to find out what impact bacteria have on the metabolism of plants, but also how plants act on bacteria”. This chemical ecology is based on powerful analysis tools using genomics. Supercritical fluids, enzymatic aqueous extraction, use of NADES solvents… multiple strategies to obtain compounds of interest from plant materials are developing for more and more efficacy and less environmental impact. Solvent extraction is being replaced by greener techniques that provide compounds with enriched profiles. “Thanks to CO2 supercritical extraction, it is possible to modulate the composition of the extracts obtained, which is not the case with hydrodistillation or solvent extraction,” explains Karima Benaissi, Technical Manager at Innovation Fluides Supercritiques. As for Gattefossé, in 2012 the company committed to a broad research programme on new NADES solvents directly inspired from the way metabolites are solubilized in plant cells. “Prospects are numerous, as it is a topic that was described in the literature very recently, in particular by Pr Robert Verpoorte, of the University of Leiden, Netherlands”, specifies Virginie Charton, Research Engineer at Gattefossé. Plants could not reveal their full potential without biotechnologies, which optimize solutions and offer more possibilities. “We exploit the potential of plant roots using our ‘plant milking’ technology to reach the secondary metabolites of plants and get yields 300 times higher than those we would obtain with traditional cultures,” clarifies Anaïs Thevenin-Gavoille, of PAT. All in all, this congress was very rich, as experts in process engineering, safety, efficacy and formulation were able to explore all the facets of plant neochemistry as well as its use in the cosmetics industry in a warm, friendly atmosphere."
From safety to efficacy: in vitro methods are becoming essential to the cosmetics industry,"New in vitro methods for evaluating the sensitization potential of raw materials have recently been developed to replace the now banned in vivo methods on animals. “We have been waiting for progress in this field for 15 years. Several developments by Procter & Gamble, Givaudan, Kao, and Shiseido have put forward interesting strategies. And on February 5, 2015, the OECD adopted the first test in chemico to identify the sensitization potential of molecules. As for the European Union, it validated and recommended a skin sensitization method (h-CLAT) on the human THP1 cell line in March 2015,” Béatrice Le Varlet explains. “Replacing tests on animals requires a combination of strategies ”, Bart De Wever adds. “From this standpoint, alternatives on reconstructed epidermal skin models like the SENS-IS, SenCeeTox and EE methods present many advantages.” As a matter of fact, the 3D models that present perfect reproducibility, reliability, and relevance characteristics create unique opportunities to assess ingredients and finished products. “Thanks to 3D models, we can obtain exclusive data as regards synergy of action, kinetics of application, and cellular and molecular mechanisms,” specifies Marisa Meloni, CEO of Vitroscreen. The data collected thus seem more valuable than those obtained with tests on animals, and sometimes also with tests on human volunteers. In addition, 3D models are customizable and can be made to measure depending on the type of cells used, how old donors are, how long cultivation lasts, which stresses are induced… they pave the way for multiple innovation possibilities. “It is only the beginning of what may be done with these models,” confirms Amélie Thépot, CEO of LabSkin Creation. They resulted from new constraints related to the ban on animal testing… It now seems alternative methods have actually paved the way for other knowledge, although product toxicity assessment remains the industry’s main concern. Download, here below, the speeches of the round table panellists: Latest advancements of in vitro evaluation of cosmetics – In vitro methods for assessing the sensitising potential of ingredients.

"New generations of after-sun creams could protect better the skin, a new research suggests","Damages that UV light from the sun or from tanning beds cause to the skin and to the DNA in melanocytes, the cells that make the melanin that gives skin its colour, are well known.  While melanin used to be considered as protecting the skin by blocking harmful UV light, several studies have suggested that melanin could also associated with skin cell damage. In a study published online by the journal Science on February 20, a team of researchers led by Douglas E. Brash, clinical professor of therapeutic radiology and dermatology at Yale School of Medicine [1], found that melanin had both carcinogenic and protective effects.  Actually, the study showed that the same kind of DNA damage occurs in melanocytes during sun exposure and hours after the sun exposure ended.  “What’s surprising here, is that melanin is actually doing something that can cause cancer,” said Pr. Brash, also a member of Yale Cancer Centre. The researchers first exposed mouse and human melanocyte cells to radiation from a UV lamp. The radiation caused a type of DNA damage known as a clobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), preventing the information carried by DNA from being read correctly. To the researchers’ surprise, the melanocytes not only generated CPDs immediately but continued to do so hours after UV exposure ended. On the contrary, cells without melanin generated CPDs only during the UV exposure. The researchers next tested the extent of damage that occurred after sun exposure by preventing normal DNA repair in mouse samples. They found that half of the CPDs in melanocytes were “dark CPDs” - CPDs created in the dark. “If you look inside adult skin, melanin does protect against CPDs. It does act as a shield.  But it is doing both good and bad things,” said Douglas Brash. In searching for an explanation of these results, Sanjay Premi, associate research scientist in the Brash laboratory, discovered that the UV light activated two enzymes that combined to “excite” an electron in melanin. The energy generated from this process - known as chemiexcitation - was transferred to DNA in the dark, creating the same DNA damage that sunlight caused in daytime. While noting that news of the carcinogenic effect of melanin is disconcerting, the researchers also said the slowness of chemiexcitation may allow time for new preventive tools, such as an “evening-after” sunscreen designed to block the energy transfer. Such a cream, they say, would prevent DNA damage that occurs when UV rays activate two enzymes that send melanin haywire in the chemiexcitation process.  “We can imagine designing chemicals that dissipate that energy before it has a chance to transfer to the DNA. And in fact there are chemicals like that that exist and we have used some of them in the researches. But you can imagine getting better ones that would be practical to use on the skin,” added Pr. Brash."
Study takes step towards a pill able to turn white fat into brown fat,"Using human stem cells, the team generated a technique to screen for compounds that are able to achieve this important feat of fat colour transfer and have already identified two of these compounds. While it’s not certain how the no-more-treadmill-pill would be concocted and whether it would be safe and effective, it’s an important first step in the fight against obesity. That fat cells can be converted is well-known. For example, a study at the University of Montreal [1] identified retinoic acid-a derivative of Vitamin A-as being able to turn fat cells brown in mice, but the Harvard team says their discovery is more significant.  ""What we were really impressed by is that there are some compounds that have this same kind of effect when they are administered to animals, but when you remove them, the effect goes away,” says Chad Cowan, a principal faculty member of HCSI. ""But what we saw here was a stable conversion."" Still, says Cowan, it’s not certain what the long term effects on the metabolism and immune system could be, although he is encouraged by the success of the two compounds in mice. Brown fat is considered the ""good fat"" because unlike white fat, it’s capable of generating heat by oxidizing fatty acid. To ignite this process, no exercise is necessary on the part of the individual, so brown fat cells increase the basal, or resting, metabolism. Researchers have come to believe that differing proportions of brown fat could explain why some eat more than others without gaining weight and without considerable exercise efforts. Other studies have indicated that it’s possible to create brown fat in human participants by keeping their living environment at a cool 19 degrees C (66F) for a minimum of one month [2]. The HSCI study was published in the journal Nature Cell Biology. [3]"
Bee propolis offers hope for hair regrowth: study,"The resin-like material is used by honeybees to seal small crevices in their hives. Its anti fungal and anti bacterial properties are already documented but according to the research team [1], it could also contain important clues for reversing hair loss in humans. Spring-boarding on recent research suggesting propolis could promote the growth of cells that contribute to hair growth, Ken Kobayaski and his team were curious to find out if it could actually create new locks. They prepped their mice by either shaving or waxing them, and in both cases those that had received a topical application of propolis grew their fur back faster than those that didn’t. Importantly, the number of cells involved in hair growth increased after propolis had been applied to the skin.  “Propolis stimulates hair growth by inducing hair keratinocyte proliferation,” concluded the researchers. While propolis was only tested on mice that were capable of growing fur rather than balding mice, the research team points out that hair loss is often the result of inflammation. Because it contains anti-inflammatory elements, the researchers say they expect propolis to reverse hair loss, although they acknowledge that further testing is necessary. Propolis, which also has antifungal properties, was used to treat inflammation and wounds in ancient times. The study was published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry."
DSM quantifies stratum corneum variations in different skin ethnicities,"Stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis, is known for its barrier function to protect underlying tissue from infection, dehydration, chemicals and mechanical stress.  Paradoxically, although the face is generally the part of the body most exposed to the external environment, facial skin is particularly sensitive and its stratum corneum is thinner than elsewhere. Studies conducted by DSM Personal Care also found large differences in hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values on different parts of the face.  Moreover, these differences appear to vary among different ethnic groups! In partnership with the University of Limpopo, South Africa, Newtone Technologies, France, and AVR Consulting, UK, DSM Personal Care has run an extensive study to generate detailed hydration and TEWL mapping of the faces of Chinese, Caucasian, Indian and Black African subjects. A special algorithm was developed to automatically detect skin pixels and interpolate a measured value for each of the subjects after superimposing the various bio-instrumental data on the images. As a result, full continuous facial skin hydration and TEWL colour maps are now available for the first time.  Not only skin hydration and TEWL vary on the face, but there are also remarkable differences between the different ethnicities. “Moisturizing creams need to consider the different characteristics of various facial anatomical locations as well as the various requirements of the skin of different ethnicities. Our results will support and boost the deeper understanding of the different needs of different skin types,” commented Rainer Voegeli, Senior Scientist Skin Biology at DSM and one of the authors of the findings. DSM researchers also investigated the role of skin pigmentation in facial stratum corneum barrier integrity and repair capacity.  In cooperation with the Photobiology Laboratory, Medusa Campus, UL, South Africa and AVR Consulting, UK, DSM Personal Care performed a study on stratum corneum barrier characteristics among Caucasian, Albino African and Black African subjects to gain deeper insights in this field. The study revealed that pigmentation does not appear to play a role in the facial stratum corneum barrier integrity and repair capability. On the contrary, Albino African subjects’ cheek stratum corneum barrier integrity and repair capability proved to be superior to that of Black African and Caucasian subjects. Also the stratum corneum of the Albino African group was found to be approximately 67% thicker (p≤0.001) on the cheek compared with the Caucasian group and 35% thicker than the Black African subjects. “Such drastic differences among different skin ethnicities confirms the demand for dedicated solutions to answer the needs of millions of consumers worldwide,” said Rainer Voegeli. According to DSM, thicker stratum corneum and relatively faster repair capacity on the cheeks of the Albino African subjects suggests that their skin has responded to an external UV challenge to strengthen essential skin barrier functions in order to protect the skin against UV radiation. However, the reasons for these findings are currently under investigation at the biochemical level."
World’s oldest people share no genetic secrets: study,"To date, there are 74 supercentenarians alive worldwide, and 22 live in the United States. Supercentenaians are aged 110 and older.  In an attempt to uncover the genetic secrets behind such a long life, researchers from the Stanford University, California, have sequenced the complete genome of 17 of them.  The study, led by Hinco Gierman, was published in the November 12 issue of the open-access journal PLOS ONE. US scientists said they’ve found no genetic secrets shared between this small group of 17 supercentenarians.  They did not find any rare variation producing proteins that could explain their longevity.  They found, in one of these supercentenarians, a genetic mutation linked to a specific heart disease, but which had little or no effect on his health. Even though no genetic clues emerged in this study, scientists said they would make their analysis available to the public as a resource for future research. Indeed, the hope of finding an answer did not seem to have entirely vanished. Actually, several private and public laboratories and universities are conducting researches on this source of youth, pointed a survey from the Pew Research Center last year. According to some researchers, medicine could make such dramatic progresses during the next decades that human life expectancy would grow further what is currently considered as a biological limit.  Manufacturers of cosmetic products are also highly interested in such scientific forays in the biology of ageing. They are also keen to adopt up-to-date technologies and knowledge for developing their products, as shown during the latest Congress of the International Federation of Societies of Cosmetic Chemists (IFSCC) in Paris. Declining birth rates combined with sharp increase in life expectancy mean that the American population is aging rapidly. According to the Census Bureau, one in five Americans will be over 65 by 2050 and at least 400,000 will be centenarians. In Japan and Europe, the aging of the population is even more advanced.  These changes will have a significant impact on health systems and consumption patterns."
"IFSCC 2014: The cosmetics industry takes to ""omics"" sciences","Following in the footsteps of genomics, the study of all genes, “omics” sciences are developing and imposing themselves both in medical research and in cosmetics manufacturers’ R&D departments. “These technologies give access to the different components of living organisms, from the DNA to the metabolite, the small molecule produced due to the cell’s activity”, Dominique Bernard, Omics Platform Manager at L’Oréal Research & Innovation, told the AFP. In practice, cosmetology resorts to omics sciences to understand the skin’s cellular mechanisms and identify action “targets” to develop new products. The use of omics boomed with the development of powerful analysis techniques such as DNA microarrays. These molecular biology tools, which are always based on a holistic approach, are named with neologisms formed according to the same model, all along the chain of components of the living organisms. Transcriptomics analyses how a genome is transcribed into proteins via messenger RNAs (messenger ribonucleic acid). Proteomics explores all the proteins produced by a genome. Metabolomics is dedicated to all the metabolites in a cell. “It gets more complex each time: we start with 21,000 genes, but we end up with several hundreds of thousands of proteins”, the biologist underlines. Omics can thus generate masses of information on the skin and hair biology. For manufacturers, the difficulty is to manage to pick out the relevant elements to be able to market a product that meets consumers’ expectations. “We need to set up bioinformatics systems to extract the most useful information from these big data in order to, for example, analyse the different skin types and subtypes all around the world,” Dominique Bernard explains. “We are also trying to find what we call “targets”, because once you have identified a target, you can develop new molecules capable of modulating that target, and therefore develop new cosmetic products”, he adds – like new anti-aging actives. Omics technologies will also help determine “signatures” specific to certain types of aging, chronoaging or photoaging resulting from repeated exposure to the sun, and then select actives to try and “offset” these signatures. “What is wonderful with the skin is that it is very easily accessible”, notes the biologist. “We have access to its surface and we can already get a lot of information without having to get invasive”. Perspiration is another valuable source of information for cosmetics manufacturers. “If you know the composition of perspiration, you can develop makeup that will last long on the skin”, explains Claudie Willemin, President of the Société française de cosmétologie (the French Society of Cosmetology), which held the congress. “You can develop products that prevent the skin from shining, for example in countries with high humidity levels”, she adds. Scientists are also increasingly interested in the microbiome, these hundreds of millions of microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi, that are present on the skin’s surface and with which human cells permanently “interact”. Three scientific prizes are also awarded at the IFSCC congress. This year the jury rewarded: – Haruka Goto, of Pola, who received the Basic Research Award for her work on the hBD-3, an antimicrobial peptide which plays a key role in the acne flare-up during the premenstrual stage
– Alban Muller, who won the Applied Research Award for his collaboration with the Université of Rouen, France, and the Payan Bertrand SA perfume company on the development of a new strategy to protect the skin against fragrance allergens. The consortium identified and implemented an ingredient of the protein group of prolamins which forms an imperceptible, odorless, colorless film on the skin and protects against the allergens present in a perfume when it is sprayed. 
– Ezure Tomonobu, of Shiseido, who won the Poster Award for a novel approach to anti-aging facial skincare based on the reconstruction of dermal anchoring structures for a toning effect on the face. For its comeback edition in France, the IFSCC congress gathered about 1,500 participants from 40 countries. “We did not want to deal with scientific advances according to the different fields (anti-aging, hair, sun care…), but to really show that cosmetology involves expertise and knowledge beyond the sole cosmetics sector’s boundaries”, Mrs Willemin highlighted. The next IFSCC congress will be held from September 20 to 23, 2015 in Zurich, Switzerland."
Clinical analysis: The value of quantitative measures in cosmetics,"Initially, this technique was developed for fundamental research. Methods developed in this context being now sufficiently robust and proven, Phylogene undertook to adapt it to the analysis of large molecules. To this end, the MS Phylogene platform uses an original configuration of mass spectrometry coupled to high pressure liquid nano-chromatography (nanoLC-MS/MS). The objective is to achieve a quantitative comparison of all the proteins in two complex samples. In concrete terms, samples of skin explants, reconstituted skin, D-Squame, fibroblasts, keratinocytes or other biopsies after being subjected to an active are compared with their placebo control. The platform is powerful enough to be able to identify 200 to 2000 different proteins per sample and measure their relative amounts. Comparing this data with the data coming from the placebo gives a first indication on the possible (and sometimes unexpected) effects of molecules studied. ""The platform is of great interest for applications in cosmetics,"" explained Gilbert Skorski, President of Phylogene. ""Proteins are, indeed, the primary players in the cell’s function and structure."" Hence the value of knowing the impact of a formula or of an active on these proteins, especially with the current ban on animal testing. ""Techniques looking for activated genes move into the background, because molecules expressed from the genes are not directly identified by these techniques,"" he added. Another advantage put forward by Phylogene is the quantitative nature of the technique. ""We get immediate information on the impact and intensity of the resulting phenomena,"" emphasised Skorski. The information of course, needs to be analysed and interpreted afterwards. Finally, the fact that this technique is not targeted enables to not limit research to preconceived ideas that one may have on the effect of an active, but on the contrary to understand what is happening globally, positively or negatively. ""This avoids having to deal with the extra costs relative to the late discovery of unexpected negative effects of an active, which was interesting beforehand."" Conversely, good surprises can also emerge just like unexpected effects, yet of particular interest. All this, according to Phylogene, in less than a month’s time for a complete screening of the active. Once that step is completed, it is possible to perform a bio-informatic and statistical analysis to identify the metabolic pathways and the activated biological or molecular functions. Phylogene has developed for this purpose the Coravalid™ module. ""This step is extremely important, because given the mass of information, without these additional analyses, experience shows that people would tend to only focus on what they already know and miss the new things corresponding to unexpected effects. There is a serious risk of losing the benefit of the relative quantification of these proteins,"" explained Skorski.  ""Finally it is also possible to target multiple proteins, identified as biomarkers and thus to monitor the specific effect of the active, or to perform the same approaches on metabolites generated by these proteins, or to study the post-translational changes of the proteins,"" he concluded."
"Hydration, barrier function and tissue structures on the programme of the IFSCC 2014 Congress","Premium Beauty News - What are the main themes of the IFSCC’s scientific programme? Patrice Bellon - Six themes will be developed during this congress, which will be taking place in France again after a 16 year absence. We have been working for the three past years on a scientific programme built around beauty and skin protection. The programme will include: ""Beauty and Life Science"", ""Beauty and colour"", ""Beauty and surface shield: physicochemistry"", ""Beauty and sensoriality"", ""Beauty and protective strategy within the skin"" and a newly integrated theme in an IFSCC congress: ""Beauty and society"". We are therefore opening the door to sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. Alain Meybeck -  Well-being is also put forward. More and more works in soft science, like psychology, sociology highlight the importance of consumers’ perceptions, their feelings, their emotions in the assessment of a product. Premium Beauty News - How did you select the oral communications and posters? Patrice Bellon - We received 743 abstracts from more than 2,000 authors, among which, 30% from academics, 30% from ingredient and test suppliers and 40% from brands. Each abstract was submitted to three reviewers among a selection of 77 experts. Some subjects are studied a lot, like hydration and the barrier function or the tissue structure, and some are emerging like those related to sustainable development, quality of life. In its choice of 72 oral communications, the Scientific Committee made a point of respecting a representativeness of all geographic regions, all business sizes and a balance between public and private research. Alongside big names in cosmetics, small start-ups will be able to express themselves. Alain Meybeck -  For each session, an introductory lecture will be conducted by internationally recognized professors in the world of beauty. I would also like to stress on the quality of the 464 selected posters which, for the organizers, are as important as oral communications and will be the subject of exchanges of views during the breaks, which were voluntarily lengthened. Premium Beauty News - What type of visitors are you expecting? Patrice Bellon - Usually this congress is followed at 60% by R&D, 16% by teachers and scholars, 7% by managers and 7% by marketing. France is well represented with 42% of participants, as is Asia (with 17% of Japanese and 8% Koreans), and Brazil with 6%. Alain Meybeck -  This year, the fact that the congress is taking an interest in Beauty and Society, and is also taking into account issues related to well-being, makes it an event that can also be of great interest to marketing related teams. It is a major moment for the trade and a way to be informed of recent developments in the cosmetics field."
Reconstructed custom skin models for cosmetic assessments,"Premium Beauty News - You created LSC early 2014. What services do you offer? Amélie Thépot - LabSkin Creations was created in collaboration with Dr. Odile Damour to promote the legacy in tissue reconstruction of the Laboratoire des Substituts Cutanés HCL/CNRS (Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Lyon) has been developing in clinical research [1] since 1988. We use a “full-thickness” reconstructed skin model (dermis and epidermis) to offer custom services for the assessment on the efficacy of ingredients or skin care products. The patented cell culture medium is based on a single matrix composed of essential components in the extracellular matrix (ECM): collagen and chitosan insolubilized glysosaminoglycanes. This porous matrix was optimized to recreate a physiological environment conducive to cellular in vivo and in vitro colonization. A functional dermis is faithfully reproduced, in which all the elements of the ECM are synthesized and placed in an organized manner. Hence, interactions between the two compartments have enabled for the first time the in vitro deposition of a functional and organized tissue, whereas until now, elastin was only found in a soluble form in the culture medium. [2] Premium Beauty News - What are the particularities of the latest models developed? Amélie Thépot - This model is the first to be flexible and adaptable to the needs, it is a constant source of innovation and scientific inspirations. The cell types used, the age and anatomical origin of cells (young vs. aged / photo-exposed vs. photo-protected), the culture time, the moment and type of application of the active (topical vs. systemic) are all possible variables just like the different stresses to apply, like pollution, UV exposure, mechanical stress... For the Laboratoire des Substituts Cutanés (Laboratory of Skin Substitutes) and LabSkin Creations this reconstructed skin model is an ongoing source of innovation and scientific inspirations. Our latest advances relate to models mimicking senescence over very long cultivation times, up to 120 days, while standard cultures stop after 42 days. We are therefore able to test actives throughout the whole tissue reconstruction and substantiate their efficacy on dermal and epidermal reconstruction from a mechanistic and biological point of view. We have also developed “chimeric” reconstructed skin models based on combinations of cells from donors of different ages, highlighting the dialogue between the different skin compartments and their involvement in the damage associated with aging and particularly on the reconstruction and maturation of the dermo-epidermal junction. The real benefit we offer our clients is the development of skin models exactly tailored to their needs and the issues to be addressed. Premium Beauty News - How does it exactly work? Amélie Thépot -  Just like haute couture, we wanted to create the concept of ""Haute Culture"" with three sequential steps:
1) The design and development of the reconstructed skin model following the client’s specifications and adapted to the tested product of interest: the 3D Skin Designer®.
2) The production and delivery of the custom reconstructed skin model with the product application supplied by the client: the 3D Skin Factory®.
3) The observation of the active’s overall effect using histological staining, which enables to guide additional research and further explorations: the 3D Skin Scanner®. Then, two types of approaches are proposed: a tissue approach with the study of skin markers using immuno-detection and quantitative analysis using image processing and a molecular approach. It focuses on the modulation, by the active ingredient, of the genes and / or proteins expression of interest in the reconstructed skin model. This is performed through proteomic analysis or genomic analysis. An illustrated and quantified scientific report is provided with evidence of the product’s efficacy, describing the protocol, summarizing and analysing all the results, providing all the images and videos generated and the associated quantitative analyses. Premium Beauty News - Who are your clients? Amélie Thépot -  Our offer is aimed at both suppliers of cosmetic actives and finished products. However we also have clients in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Academic research also has a keen interest in our techniques to implement more fundamental studies. During the post IFSCC day (31 October 2014), a visit of the Laboratoires des Substituts Cutanés and of LabSkin Creations will be scheduled."
"Sensory 2014: emotion, the key factor of marketing success?","“In addition to researchers working on the sensory, we wanted to open the debate to marketing departments, consumers and product designers, and thus make it an inspiring event”, explains Frédéric Le Gall, the congress organizer. “Emotions lie at the core of perception, communication, motivation and decision-making. They bear an influence on the sensory experience, and they promote action,” explained Arnaud Aubert, professor at the University of Tours, France, at the start of the debate. Emotional priming associated with sensory input thus seems to act on sensory feelings on a global level. “People who are made to see pleasant images such as baby faces for a few milliseconds will then pay increased attention to things,” specifies David Sander, Professor at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. It has therefore become a strategic challenge to take consumers’ emotions into account.  Several approaches seem possible, and everyone agrees with the fact that, as Arnaud Aubert states, “it is necessary to adopt a multidimensional approach with multidisciplinary research”. Among the study tools available, some favour physiological measurements and assess cardiac coherence, record voices, or study the zygomaticus major muscle, while others base their research on questionnaires and interviews, knowing that a large number of individuals (between 60 and 200) should be involved to get interpretable and reproducible results. Indeed, emotions are multiple, and although Alain Finkel considers “95 % of our emotions actually come down to the four basic ones, that is, anger, fear, joy and sadness”, there are emotions integrated to the product, and also others that are incidental, and can be related to the emotions triggered by music in a store, or by the facial expression of a sales assistant. This rich world fascinates researchers, and marketing departments are starting to make it their own. Can we not already see relaxing, boosting products on the market? They might well be the first of future claims for products conveying joy and elation. The next edition of Sensory will be held at the end of June 2016."
"""Research in cosmetology is going beyond the borders of the cosmetic sector,"" Claudie Willemin, SFC","Premium Beauty News - Five months before the kick-off of this major event in the trade, what are the perspectives for the upcoming Congress? Claudie Willemin - Thanks to the involvement of all stakeholders, the congress is looking extremely promising. We have had a very large influx of abstracts: 750 in total, coming from 34 different countries, with a notable presence of France, Japan, but also emerging countries like Brazil and Korea. Don’t forget that authors only commit to communicate recent work, which hasn’t yet been the subject of prior publications, thus giving the event its innovative character. The congress will be preceded by a day dedicated to ""Predictive methods"" and ""Regulatory compliance"" workshops. In addition this year - and this is a first - the congress will continue with two post IFSCC days, enabling to meet experts. The first one will be organized by the Cosmetic Valley with the following perfume thematic: oenology and cosmetic science, and the other, under the aegis of the European Centre of dermocosmetology (CED), which will focus on textile and tissue engineering. Hence, a perfect opportunity for the cosmetic world, to focus for a whole week on science and progress in its field of interest, quite a unique opportunity indeed. Premium Beauty News - What will be the highlights of the Congress? Claudie Willemin - The common thread of these four days is ""cosmetics, innovation and performance for beauty and well-being"" with a format alternating plenary lectures, oral conferences, poster presentations. During the four days of the conference, six plenary lectures animated by international experts are planned followed by 72 oral lectures around six themes illustrating some aspects of research in cosmetology, such as beauty and colour, beauty and sensoriality, beauty and society... We want to show that research in cosmetology requires expertise and knowledge that go beyond the boundaries of the mere cosmetic sector. In addition, more than 650 posters will be exposed and to facilitate exchanges and discussions between scientists, break times will be extended. As for the social programme, it will focus on beauty and the art of living in Paris, including a private tour of the Louvre Museum, a dinner under the pyramid and the closing ceremony, which will take place at the Museum of Fairground Arts. Premium Beauty News - In terms of visitorship, is the current number registrations promising? Claudie Willemin - We are very confident, the number of registrations is already very high. The final programme of the conference will be available early July."
EU-project aims to develop environment-friendly production processes for cosmetics,"Cosmetics companies are increasingly interested in new environment-friendly production processes and in novel cosmetic ingredients with a lower environmental footprint. This is also the aim of the project OPTIBIOCAT [1], which is backed by around 7 million euros of EU funding. The project brings together a broad interdisciplinary team of researchers, academics and industry experts, with 16 partners from Italy, France, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland, covering the entire development process, from genome and microbial mining to application. Most prominent industry partner is Greek natural cosmetics producer Korres. The aim of the four-year project is to replace resource and energy-intensive chemical processes currently used in the cosmetic industry through discovering and optimising novel enzymatic biocatalysts. The OPTIBIOCAT researchers will develop biocatalysts requiring fewer steps in the production of components as well as lower-temperatures (50-60°C) compared to those of chemical processes (up to 160°C). “The environmental footprint for the production of the identified antioxidants will be significantly reduced with our innovative biocatalysts,” says Vincenza Faraco from the University of Naples, who leads the OPTIBIOCAT consortium."
"""Physicochemical properties are a key to the efficacy of cosmetics,"" Stéphanie Briançon, CNRS","Premium Beauty News - The cosmetic industry is particularly interested in your fields of study? Stéphanie Briançon - The means of delivery for active substances is a topic of great interest. Reach the desired target and ensure that the administered product is efficient: it concerns not only the cosmetic but also the pharmaceutical industry, the medicine field–in the context of anti cancer therapies, and the veterinary field for topical applications. We are working on liposomes which, indeed, are pretty old systems since the first patent dates back to 1964, but which are still relevant, being universal and effective. Our research focuses on their manufacturing and stabilization by limiting the use of solvents and by using biocompatible materials. Uses include encapsulation of anticancer molecules or the development of hydrating forms for the ophthalmic route. We also focus on nanoparticles developed from biodegradable polymer-type polyesters (caprolactone, polylactic acids), polysaccharides and lipids based on triglyceride mixtures. The targeted particle sizes are between 200 and 400nm. They are used in the perfume area to encapsulate the fragrance and incorporate it in various formulations. We also work in collaboration with dermatologists to use nanoparticles as vectors in immunobiological diagnosis tests, from contact allergies to perfumes. One of our research objectives for these particular methods of formulation is to reduce the inflammatory potential of molecules. Premium Beauty News - At scientific congresses, there seems to be a proliferation of communications on Pickering emulsions. Your laboratory is also working on this topic, are products formulated that way going to be marketed? Stéphanie Briançon - Since 2006, we have a doctoral student continuously studying this topic, which is indeed interesting more and more the scientific community. Pickering emulsions formulated with no surfactants but with solid particles in the interface between oil and water have specific behaviours. We have observed with silica particles, some modulations of hydrophilic of lipophilic passage of actives in the stratum corneum [1] [2]. This is very interesting to increase the penetration of an active or decrease the transcutaneous passage of irritating molecules like chemical filters. We presented at the IFSCC 2012 results on caffeine and retinol [3]. We investigate from organic particles like silica but also polymeric particles, where we seek to generate in the same step, nanoparticles and Pickering emulsion. This type of emulsion is an interesting study model for us because their interface is not completely solid. Commercially, they are still underdeveloped because they have the drawback of not having a pleasant skin touch, at least for those based on mineral particles. Premium Beauty News - Skin decontamination is another topic of interest for your lab. Skin decontamination and skin de-pollution: could bridges be considered between these two topics? Stéphanie Briançon -  It is still too early to make assumptions. We are at the beginning of our work with a large part of it dedicated to the implementation of a methodology and with finding ways of dosing chemical ions at the skin level. We are working with the DGA on organophosphate molecules [4] [5] and the CEA on radio elements. We are at the understanding stage: how do ions penetrate the skin and how are they stored in a skin layer, with which kinetics? How can the decontamination of molecules or ions be assayed? To this end, we use such techniques as atomic spectroscopy and ion chromatography. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the future of formulation? Stéphanie Briançon - The future will very much depend on the development of analysis and characterization methods and on the efficacy of products in relation with their physicochemical properties. These methods can combine chemical, biochemical or mechanical data. We are fortunate to have in Lyon the IVTV platform. A tour of the laboratory is planned during the post IFSCC Day organized on October 30, 2014 by the European Centre of Dermocosmetics (CED), with whom we are partnering, and which brings together in one place high-tech tools and experts in various fields, from biology to mechanics. We have much to learn from others. Exchanges are essential as well as partnerships with industrialists and foreign universities. In the Lyon area, the CED, of which we are a member, includes many actors with whom we are in contact."
"""In a near future, we will be able to anticipate tissue degradation,"" Thierry Hoc, Ecole Centrale de Lyon","Premium Beauty News - What are the main findings of your works on cell tissues? Thierry Hoc - I started my career studying the plasticity of metals and how dislocations could brittle materials. [1] Lyon being a region where there is intensive research on living organisms, when I arrived at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon in 2009, I focused on themes related to bio-engineering with a mechanic’s approach. Our first works showed that bone balance was governed by the biochemical environment of the bone but also by the mechanical strain undergone by cells. Our experiments revealed for example, that cells had low sensitivity to compression while shear improved their development. This mechanical environment is therefore crucial in the aging process of tissues leading to specific architectures. Some connective tissue create, for example, some microstructures with very conveniently oriented collagen and elastin fibres to withstand the mechanical strain associated with the in vivo environment that one goes through every day. We observed from mechanical tests on collagen fibres, in the presence of elastin fibres, that the mechanical strength was fully linked to collagen fibres, while the tissue springback was linked to elastin fibres. These works have direct applications in the treatment of bone disease (brittle bone disease, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis) in the treatment of parietal hernias but also in tissue engineering which requires better characterizing the environment of the cell. All this data is taken into account in skin cultures with the addition of mechanical strain. Skin is also an excellent marker of aging as Prof. Hassan Zahouani demonstrated. Tension lines at the skin surface reflect the mechanical behaviour and the morphology of more or less deep wrinkles. It is in this context that we use the skin as a laboratory for aging, and that we look if there are some existing correlations between the mechanical properties of bones and the morphology of the skin, in cases of osteoarthritis, is the skin more or less wrinkled, are tension lines different, has elastin gone...? A number of promising and open questions. Premium Beauty News - Since 2012, you are in charge of the equipment of excellence for the engineering and aging of living tissues (ingénierie et vieillissement des tissus vivants or IVTV). Can you explain what this vast project, selected by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, is about? Thierry Hoc - The IVTV platform, located in the Ecole Centrale de Lyon and in the Health Cluster of St. Etienne is the only centre of its kind in Europe. It aggregates 14 research laboratories, two hospitals, nine private–sector companies, including four operating in cosmetics, around high-tech tools, coupling mechanics and multi-scale imaging to help characterize the chemical, mechanical, topographical properties of the different tissues (bone, teeth, cartilage, skin, ligaments, arteries, muscles...), to individually follow their aging and make correlations between observations performed. Skin being easily accessible, we are seeking to understand if its aging reflects the aging of other tissues. The platform was launched in December 2012, it offers training services and provision of equipment but also services. Exchanges between the 170 permanent members of the platform are frequent and the development of cross-functional skills is a priority. Premium Beauty News - What will, the industry - including cosmetic manufacturers - be using the IVTV platform for and what are the current results? Thierry Hoc - Operational studies have begun a few months ago; to date several oral presentations have been made, highlighting a great potential. For example, confocal microscopy enables to monitor how soft tissue composed of collagen and elastin respond when they are subjected to mechanical stress, how fibres react, how they redirect themselves. Raman spectroscopy helps monitor the penetration of actives at different depths; ultra-sound propagation speed measurements in tissues will enable to better characterize the skin according to its age. The field is vast and areas of application are dermatology, orthopedics and cardiovascular, but we always keeping a key thread on understanding, on the product/tissue interaction and with a partnership between the doctor/engineer and the biologist. A visit of the IVTV laboratory is planned during the post IFSCC day, organized by the European Centre of Dermocosmetology (CED), on October 31, 2014. Premium Beauty News - How do you think aging could be addressed in 20 or 30 years? Thierry Hoc - to date scientific advances enable to reconstruct the skin, bones, arteries. I believe that in a near future, we could, maybe not make human beings bionic, but anticipate human tissue degradation and through cell therapy, overcome these unwanted changes in order to locally regenerate damaged tissues."
HelioScreen aims at more reliable in vitro sunscreen tests thanks to new robot,"“The spread is a key parameter of the in vitro evaluation of solar products. We worked for several months on the development of our HD-Spreadmaster robot. The initial technology is based on a six engines robot made by the Sysaxes company, to which was added a silicone finger especially designed to reproduce the hardness, the pressure and the movement of a human finger. We also added a thermal chamber to maintain the required temperature at the surface of the plates,"" explains Sébastien Miksa, laboratory manager at HelioScreen. According to HelioScreen, their innovation shows better performances, in particular in terms of time, compared to a conventional application by an operator (up to two times faster, announces the company) and a reproducibility that is improved by a factor of 2-3, depending on the product’s texture. HelioScreen adds that the system has been validated by leading French cosmetics companies and was presented to the ISO working group on sun protection test methods (ISO/TC 217/WG 7). HelioScreen already uses the HD-Spreadmaster robot, which is available for purchase, for performing SPF (Sun Protection Factor) in vitro assessments for some customers.  “We have a strong training and in vitro testing business in France. We are now expanding it into Asia with the opening of our branch in Bangkok,"" adds Sébastien Miksa. HelioScreen is a small company that does not lack of impetuosity or ideas to meet the requirements of in vitro SPF measurement for the growing sunscreens market. Founded in 1999 by Dominique Lutz, HelioScreen has specialized since its creation in the performance of in vitro sunscreen tests. It was one of the first companies to market PMMA [1] plates, which advantageously replaced the then usual applications on Transpore®.  While the plates were initially sand blasted, HelioScreen impulse the shift to moulded Helioplate HD6 PMMA plates, which are now a must to meet the ISO 24443:2012 standard and the FDA Rule 2011. In 2013, more than 130,000 HD6 substrates were sold worldwide."
Skin and light: from protection to action,"Sun exposure is appreciated for its effect on morale and also because it allows for the epidermal synthesis of vitamin D. But its dangers are also increasingly known. “UVs are responsible for many biological effects both beneficial and harmful to the body. At the cellular level, UVs act at the nuclear, membrane, and cytoplasmic level,” explained Professor François Aubin (University of Franche Comté). UVAs, which represent 95% of the spectrum, are the ones with the deepest penetration into the skin. More recently, the effects of near infra-reds on photo-induced skin ageing have been highlighted. “50% of free radicals are produced in the visible and near infra-red. These wavelengths between 760 and 1400 nm impact the dermis at high doses causing the metalloproteinase-1 over-expression in dermal fibroblasts,” underlined Jürgen Lademann (Charity Universitätsmedizin Berlin). Lademann also evidenced that near infra-reds regulated highly influential genes in skin homeostasis. He therefore advocated for a protection across the whole light spectrum range and not only centred on UVs. Providing formulations with a UVA and UVB protection is already a requirement. “The product’s dosage form plays an important role, it will determine the amount of product to apply. It is shown that products that spread easily are associated both with a low variation of SPFs and a positive sensory evaluation, which leads, in turn, to the application of a larger amount of lotion,” noted Marc Pissavini (Coty Lancaster), while observing that people always remained below the 2mg/cm² mark required by the standard methods of assessment for the determination of the sun protection factor. Pissavini therefore recommended for the use of an “in vivo veritas SPF” that would take into account  the product’s absorbance spectrum, its uniformity of application and the amount of product applied to actually come closer to an ""in vivo on-the-beach-use”. In contrast, certain wavelengths in the visible spectrum are also used as therapeutic means. According to Dr. Pelletier (European LED Academy Society) “photo-biomodulation, which is the process by which chromophores are absorbed by selective wavelengths leading to major signalling phenomena for biological cellular synthesis, is part of the modern management for a successful ageing.” Clinical studies have highlighted the interest of red light in stimulating melanocyte proliferation and differentiation in cultures. “More recently, it was demonstrated that blue visible light was able to induce in people with a high phototype, a more intense and lasting hyperpigmentation than that obtained with UVAs,” highlighted Professor Thierry Passeron (CHU Nice). Light therefore is of great interest to treat pigmentation disorders such as vitiligo, scars, stretch marks, acne. Meanwhile, Jean-Alexis Grimaud, (University Paris VI), founder and Research Director of the Matriscience Company proposes a screening method for active ingredients subjected to LED illumination. “Our method enables to revisit under the angle of photo-biomodulation known molecules whose activity could therefore be optimized”. Many research fields that open interesting cosmetic perspectives."
The microbiota. Part 2: Specificities of the skin microbiota and progress in cosmetics,"“Although there is still a lot to discover, the skin microflora is fundamental in skin homeostasis. It participates in maintaining innate immunity and the barrier function. The bacterial ecosystem contributes to the clinical signs of some skin imbalances,” explained Audrey Guéniche, of L’Oréal, at the workshop organized by the French Society of Antioxidants (SFA) on the human microbiota, at the beginning of last November. The epidermis generates antimicrobial lipids, peptides such as ß-defensins and cathelicidin, and receptors dedicated to the recognition of pathogens which, put together, form the skin’s innate immunity. The balance of the skin microbiota and the expression of the ecological conditions of the environment (temperature, pH, hormone concentrations in lipids or proteins, UV exposure, absence of light, type of mucous membrane, water concentration, etc.) are also essential to skin maintenance [1] . Suppliers of cosmetic actives that are interested in this field will study the skin microbiota from different angles. The first way to do it is directly inspired from the benefits of probiotics on the intestinal microflora (figure 1). It consists in the topical administration of these probiotics on the skin microflora. Greentech has developed Bioltilys®, an active derived from the optimized fermentation of Lactobacillus pentosus, which improves the barrier function to maintain the beauty of the skin and help it recover its performance functions more quickly after aggressions. Lonza proposes ProSynergen™ DF, which is obtained by the fermentation of two bacterial strains (lactobacillus and ulkenia amoeboidea) grown simultaneously in a competitive environment, so that their active principles are overexpressed. It targets skins that are weakened by environmental factors by reinforcing their barrier function. Finally, Silab has developed Indufence®, which is rich in purified alisma peptides, and offers a probiotic-like effect thanks to a mechanism that is similar to that of an active probiotic, and optimizes the skin’s natural immune functions without causing any inflammation. The second way to study the skin microbiota is related to antimicrobial peptides. Ashland Care Specialties has thus developed Lipigenine™ biofunctional, a flaxseed extract that increases the in vitro and ex vivo expressions of ß-defensin and cathelicidin LL-37 from 50 % to 150 %, when tested on keratinocytes, 24 hours after a 1 % active topical application. Exsymol has focused on cells and nerve endings that are involved in the expression of antimicrobial peptides, and which are particularly sensitive to ageing. Glutrapeptide® acts on the production of catestatin and chromogranin A. In addition, this active can inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus in culture media of nerve cells. BASF Beauty Creations proposes Betapur™, an extract from boldo leaves which regulates the skin microflora by activating the synthesis of ß-defensin. When tested in vivo, it showed a reduction in the size of pores, imperfections and specific lesions of acne prone skins. Lastly, Solabia has been present on this market for several years with Bioecolia®, a prebiotic glycan which protects hair and skin ecology sustainability. The active is obtained by a patented process of enzymatic biocatalysis. It presents a double activity, as it has a microbiological action with the selective stimulation of the beneficial saprophytic flora, to the detriment of opportunist flora, and a biological action, with the release of antimicrobial peptides by keratinocytes. It thus protects the skin’s ecosystem. As more discoveries will be made, the skin’s microbiota ecosystem should play an increasingly significant role in cosmetics."
The Microbiota. Part 1: A field of research with multiple perspectives,"“90 % of our body is made of bacteria, the major part of which being in the intestine”, explained Pierre Rimbaud, of Enterome, as an introduction to the meeting the SFA dedicated to the human microbiota at the beginning of last November. The adult human body counts almost 1,000 billion bacteria, about 10 times more than its own cells. These microorganisms mainly live within our digestive system, but also in our eyes, mucous membrane and skin. “Three bacterial phyla coexist within our intestine: the Bacteroidetes, the Firmicutes and the Actinobacteria”, he added. On healthy skin, “more than 500 bacteria species with more than 2 million genes have been detected. They can be found in the epidermis, but also down in the dermis”, specified Audrey Guéniche, of L’Oréal Recherche. Each cm2 of skin comprises more than 1 million bacteria. The profile of the species that live within the microbiota is stable in individuals aged from 3 to about 60: only composition varies quantitatively. Each person has their own microbiota, which gets defined according to birth factors, but also to ways of life and food habits. “Americans have a number of bacterial species that is much lower to American Indians”, explained Pierre Rimbaud. However, microbial diversity in an environment is one thing, identifying its functionalities and advantages is quite another. In this respect, developing functional metagenomics offers perspectives for a large field of research. “Only 15 % of the human microbiota genome is known so far”, specified Jean-Hugues Masgnaux, of INRA, who coordinates MetaGenoPolis, a large-scale project in collaboration with ICAN (University Hospital Institute of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition) and the Catholic University of Lyon, France. “We aim at providing the medical, scientific and industrial community with innovative tools for analysing this genome. This equipment should make knowledge progress to show the impact of the intestinal microbiota on health and in non-infectious diseases, determine the key components in the interaction between the microflora and intestinal cells, and develop approaches to modulate microbial populations”. At Libragen, researchers have focused more on the skin microbiota and its functions, with a thesis published in collaboration with the École Centrale of Lyon, France. “We have been exploring the functional aspect of the skin microbiota to understand which enzymatic functions enable microorganisms to adapt to the skin environment, and vice versa”, explained young researcher Alban Mathieu. Knowledge on the importance of the intestinal and skin microbiota homeostasis will be deepened thanks to these new methods. It has already been proven that numerous intestinal diseases, but not only these, depended on the quality of the microbiota. “It has been a few years since the intestinal microbiota started being recognized as a real human body organ playing a major role in human health. Analysing the microbiota will be as common as blood analysis in the years to come”, declared Pierre Rimbaud. According to Iradj Sobhani, hospital doctor and professor at the University of Créteil, France, the microbiota definitely is a new field of research. “My team has initiated the analysis of the role of the microbiota in colon cancer, and we have provided evidence that the phylogenetic core of affected patients’ intestinal microbiota was different from that of individuals of the same age and sex with a normal colonoscopy.” The way might thus be paved for a new medicine that would be more personalized, and that would rely on the analysis of patients’ microbiota. “We, at the SFA, are convinced that given already available scientific data, the microbiota will play a major role in the medicine of the future. We are heading towards personalized, preventive and therapeutic medicine through the modulation of our microbiota. And it is in this perspective that the 2nd world conference on the Microbiota will be held in Paris next June 26-27, 2014”, concluded Marvin Edeas, President of the SFA."
"“Dermo-cosmetic techniques contribute to significantly improve skin appearance after surgery,” Dr. Isabelle James","Premium Beauty News - You are a pediatric surgeon specializing in reconstructive surgery of the child and you took the floor at the 2013 edition of the European Dermocosmetology Days on the theme of skin healing in children, what is your view about skin? Dr Isabelle James - skin is an organ and not just a simple tissue. It is made of multiple units, which should be repaired as completely as possible if we want to obtain both an acceptable cosmetic result and most of all a satisfactory function in a growing individual. Repaired skin must follow the changes. It is a major vehicle for social integration and each problem needs to be addressed to provide well-being to the child; do they not say “feeling good about yourself?” As part of my work as a pediatric surgeon in the field of reconstructive surgery of the child, I deal with congenital malformations but also accidents, burn injuries, or any condition that is causing a tissue deterioration and which requires repair with the scarring consequences that it implies. Premium Beauty News - What do your activities consist in? Dr Isabelle James - One of my main activities focuses on cleft lips and palates where we follow different lines of research. The first line is prenatal diagnosis; we work in collaboration with physicians from the Collège d’Echographie Fœtale to improve sonographic signs suggesting this pathology. The second line relates to the support of families as part of therapeutic education appointments. The child and his parents are seen before the procedures by the hospital team to learn the post-operative care gestures and the diet to be less anxious on the day of hospitalization. We offer psychological counselling but also a place of exchange between professionals and parents through our association, Le Trèfle (consisting of the team treating cleft lip and palate at Ecully). In France, the proportion of cleft lips and palates is of 1 per 700 live births. The last line of research focuses on facial growth and on the optimal times for a surgical procedure. In our team, we operate as soon as the child has reached his second month with an early orthodontic treatment and secondary bone surgery and nose symmetry so that the child can enter primary school with a better facial symmetry. In the United States, some teams work in utero, which in theory is very advantageous since healing is optimal on the foetus (foetus heals by apposition of normal tissues and not by producing scar tissues) but the procedure is very delicate and with major consequences in terms of high risks of prematurity. Premium Beauty News - Do you combine surgery with dermo-cosmetic techniques in use in adults but maybe less developed in children? Dr Isabelle James - Absolutely, dermo-cosmetic techniques contribute to significantly improve the aesthetic results when surgery is no longer needed. Dermabrasion, skin-make-up, skin-pigmentation or lipo-filling are increasingly practised in children especially after facial skin grafts. The look can better define through dermo-pigmentations on the eyebrows, or even the eyelashes at the level of eyelids. In the case of hemangioma aftereffects, permanent labial make-up helps to symmetrise the vermilion and define the mucocutaneous line. Finally lipo-fillings on the face or other parts of the body enable to fill tissue depressions and improve the trophicity of the skin surface and also the cosmetics of the tissue volume. Dermo-cosmetics is also very present after any surgery, with in particular the prescription of skincare products, like massage creams, silicone gels or sunscreens. Premium Beauty News - What emerging techniques in the treatment of scars seem promising to you? Dr Isabelle James - In the treatment of scars several phases are to be considered. Firstly, prevention with the use of surgical techniques generating less scars as possible. Then, skin grafts are very interesting; they are taken from donor sites the closest as possible to the receiving site in order to optimize both the trophicity and the skin complexion. In the case of very large lesions, we can use a skin expansion technique that consists in producing tissue by placing a silicone balloon under the skin, which is gradually inflated to produce the amount of skin needed for the secondary repair. This skin can be used either as a local flap (attached to its donor site) or as a graft, moved to another site. Finally in some cases where “total skins” cannot be used it is possible to perform thin skin grafting combined to an artificial dermis. These techniques are used in emergency cases in reconstructive surgery following a trauma or severe burns and are not yet adapted to gestures with a purely cosmetic purpose given the more inflammatory scars than with the native skin of a child. The recent ReCell® technique, which associates dermabrasion and then the spraying of keratinocytes usually taken from a small incision performed behind the ear, is interesting. It enables to repair an already present scar, pigmentations of a former graft but also an acceleration of a scarring from burn wounds. The ultimate goal of our work is, whatever the discipline, to restore a functional and aesthetic anatomy as soon as possible through a full support of the child and his family resulting in as much “well-being” as possible, even if some aesthetic or functional aftereffects may persist."
Cosmetics R&D: Cosm’innov gives an update of the state of the art,"Participants presented their eagerly awaited advancements in a round table dedicated to skin models.  “We work on a simplified representation of reality, so there will always be differences”, according to Christian Pellevoisin, from Skinethic. However, developers keep working on getting as close as possible to the complexity of the human skin and always aim to meet specific needs. Petra Boukamp, from the University of Heidelberg, Germany, presented new advancements, some of which could provide 3D models that would remain stable for longer periods of time. Stem cells survival in these environments would be ensured, and so would the possibility of adding other cells than epidermal ones. Nevertheless, these models still do not reproduce the physiological phenomenon of skin desquamation. Maybe tomorrow. Whether dealing with emulsions, lipsticks or powders, the key to progress and innovation in formulation seems to be physical chemistry. At L’Oréal, Florence Levy’s team spent several months on a research project which consisted in measuring the impact of lipstick components on moulding and on the quality of the deposited film. They used rheology, image analysis and Raman spectroscopy methods. Pickering emulsions have been around for quite some time, since they date back to the thirties. They are much recommended by Professor Wood, from the University of Edinburgh, UK, as a means to form bigel particles, an alternative to multiple emulsions. Other researchers are also interested in this revival, such as Otto Glatter, from the University of Graz, Austria, who presented a protocol to develop them more easily. One of the sessions focused on technologies that may be commonly used in the cosmetics industry in the near future. For instance, acoustic levitation will enable to study the behaviour of suspended blood cells with no contact, thanks to the research carried out by Louis Hennet, from Orléans University. Then it will be easier to have access to photodynamic therapy (PDT) through the optical fiber-based fabrics developed by Serge Mordon, from INSERM in Lille, France. Finally, developing cosmetics devices “offers great market opportunities on all continents, because their efficacy goes beyond that of cosmetic products”, explains Jean-Yves Legendre, from L’Oréal. Two other fields that have become central for a few years, green chemistry and biotechnologies, were also discussed during the scientific congress. Several prizes were awarded. Claude Grison, from CNRS, and Jacques Biton, from Stratoz, a young and innovative company, received the Cosm’innov Award. Their research focuses on an industrial solution for an environmentally friendly chemical catalysis that uses the effects of phytoremediation. The biological properties of plants that hyperaccumulate metals are used to restore mining soils with toxic metals. The leaves that are concentrated in metals such as zinc, nickel and manganese are transformed to produce new chemical catalysts that serve in the production of molecules for cosmetics purposes. Dr Iva Doleckova, from Contipro Biotech, received the Best Young Researcher Award for developing a new hexapeptide targeting desmosomes, and Laboratoires Expanscience got the Best Innovation Award for the Schizandra Hydrolysate active. All in all, this was a comprehensive congress, and next edition is scheduled for 2015."
"Lack of sleep impacts skin aging, recent study shows","The fact that the lack of sleep has a bad impact on the face may seem obvious to many of us, but the research team led by Dr. Elma Baron has demonstrated it scientifically [1]. “Our study is the first to conclusively demonstrate that inadequate sleep is correlated with reduced skin health and accelerates skin aging. Sleep deprived women show signs of premature skin aging and a decrease in their skin’s ability to recover after sun exposure,” said Dr. Baron, Director of the Skin Study Center at UH Case Medical Center and Associate Professor of Dermatology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. The study involved 60 pre-menopausal women between the ages of 30 and 49, with half of participants falling into the poor quality sleep category. The classification was made on the basis of average duration of sleep and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a standard questionnaire-based assessment of sleep quality. The study involved a visual skin evaluation and participation in several non-invasive skin challenge tests including UV light exposure and skin barrier disruption. Additionally, participants filled out a sleep log for one week to quantify sleep duration. The researchers found statistically significant differences between good and poor quality sleepers. Using the SCINEXA skin aging scoring system [2], poor quality sleepers showed increased signs of intrinsic skin aging including fine lines, uneven pigmentation and slackening of skin and reduced elasticity. In this system, a higher score means a more aged appearance. The average score in the good quality sleepers was 2.2 versus 4.4 in poor quality sleepers. While researchers found no significant difference between the groups in signs of extrinsic aging, which are attributed primarily to sun exposure, such as coarse wrinkles and sunburn freckles - they found that good quality sleepers recovered more efficiently from stressors to the skin. Recovery from sunburn was more sluggish in poor quality sleepers, with erythema (redness) remaining higher over 72 hours, indicating that inflammation is less efficiently resolved. A Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) test was used at various time points to determine the ability of the skin to serve as an effective barrier against moisture loss. In measurements 72 hours after a skin barrier stressor (tape-stripping), the recovery of good quality sleepers was 30% higher than poor quality sleepers (14% vs. -6%), once again demonstrating that they repair the damage more quickly. Additionally, poor quality sleepers were significantly more likely to have a higher Body Mass Index (BMI). For example, 23% of good quality sleepers were obese compared to 44% of poor quality sleepers. Not surprisingly, self-perception of attractiveness was significantly better in good quality sleepers vs. poor quality sleepers. “This research shows for the first time, that poor sleep quality can accelerate signs of skin aging and weaken the skin’s ability to repair itself at night,” said Dr. Daniel Yarosh, Senior Vice President, Basic Science Research, R&D, at The Estée Lauder Companies. “These connections between sleep and skin aging, now supported with solid scientific data, will have a profound effect on how we study skin and its functions. We see these findings as yet another way we can direct our scientific research toward the real needs of our customers who want to look and feel their best.”"
Cosm’ing 2013: A biotech revolution in cosmetics?,"At the beginning of the conference, Daniel Thomas, a world-renowned expert and pioneer in the field of biotechnology has set the context.  According to him, industrial biotechnologies using biomass have reached a mature stage, thanks to the emergence and continuous expansion of the concept of ""biorefinery"". ""Biorefineries"" strive to replace oil-sourced raw materials by renewable resources and enhance the value of plants by investing their various compounds. From the farmed, marine or forestry biomass, a wide variety of plant-derived molecules, materials, fuels or ingredients are produced according to processes that often rely on the principles of green chemistry. ""Biorefineries are also interacting with communities where they operate. Brittany is one of the regions that have been able to capitalise on their marine environment,” said Daniel Thomas before opposing biorefineries that interact with their close environment to those sourcing biomass from distant countries in a less sustainable way. Among natural and renewable resources, those from the oceans are often remarkable, both regarding their quantity and their diversity.  ""The plankton accounts for 98% of the biosphere, there are 10 to 100 billion microorganisms per litre of ocean water,"" says Stéphane Bach, from the Biology Station of Roscoff, who’s leading an important research project focused on plankton biodiversity screening and the identification of biological activities that may be of interest for the industry. Microalgae-derived polysaccharides, ulvan-derived oligosaccharides from, free fatty acids derived from marine actinomycetes: the underwater world inspires research laboratories that investigate new efficient extraction processes. ""Our team has worked on new enzymatic processes for the extraction of ulvans. The oligoulvans thus obtained were tested in vitro: production of sirtuins increased by 346%,"" said Helen Marfaing, from the Centre d’Études et de Valorisation des Algues de Pleubian (Brittany, France). Sederma also investigated acid and enzymatic hydrolysis techniques, as well as the saponification, in order to optimize free fatty acids yields derived from actinomycetes.  ""The most effective method is saponification,"" concluded Jodie Symington, Research Engineer at Sederma. More generally, all plant resources are subject of extensive research. And today, the entire plant is explored, not only few parts that are more specifically targeted than the others. Researchers are also trying to increase plants’ productivity. For instance, the roots - where the synthesis of secondary metabolites and hormones takes place - can be propagated through Agrobacterium rhizogenes bacteria allowing the farming of hairy roots. Wild species such as blueberry or eldelweiss can be grown in bioreactors to promote the formation of active ingredients and thus to overcome the difficulty or the prohibition of their gathering. Molecules that naturally occur only in small quantities can be imitated through biotechnology. ""We used a metabolic pathway to reproduce the production of δ-viniferin, a naturally rare resveratrol dimer with anti-aging activities,"" explains Carolina Malhaire of Solabia. There are plenty examples of such powerful techniques. The use of catalytic enzymes is one of the most common techniques. ""We use them in order to degrade plant cell walls and contribute to the release of the seeds’ compounds. These are alternatives to solvent extraction,"" says Lionel Muniglia, Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder of Biolie.  ""Through enzymatic processes, we can create ceramide analogues called pseudo-ceramides, which are highly valued in cosmetics,” complete Florian Joubioux, from the University of La Rochelle. Finding new enzymes is a major issue and it is the objective of Isabelle André, from INSA Toulouse.  ""We identify the amino acids that best correspond to the molecule to be produced, we start from the target molecule and look at how we can introduce diversity,"" she says. However, other techniques are also employed or coupled to enzymatic processes.  For instance, Polaris, a Brittany-based company, is working on an association of molecular distillation and enzymatic trans-esterification  ""With this combination of processes, we extract up to 40% gamma-linolenic acid from borage oil whereas usual yields do not exceed 20%,"" state Bennoit Lennon. Microwaves are also part of the panel of techniques used to extract and transform high added value ingredients. When it comes to measuring the environmental impact of these techniques, the answers are far from being easy.  ""The question is whether biotechnology is better than chemistry or is it the contrary,"" asks Romuald Vallée, Codif International, in the introduction to the session dedicated to this conference. Some companies are developing their own measurement tools in order to know the exact impact of their inputs and outputs on sustainability.  ""After a long bibliographical research, we selected three environmental indicators: water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and e-factor [1], to which we added a home-made indicator, the eco-factor, which takes into account the wastes that are generated during the process.  In the future, we intend to go further in our approach with an indicator related to biodiversity and another on the impact of cleaning waters on effluent treatment,"" exposed Stéphanie Guillotin, Codif International. As far as L’Oréal is concerned, the group uses a multi-criteria analysis regarding the sustainability of each ingredient or process. ""Thus, we are building passports for our green materials. These passports include data related to the e-factor, the percentage of renewable carbon, or eco-toxicity,"" says Michel Philippe, Green Chemistry Manager, L’Oréal."
Japanese-French seminar highlights predictability of anti-oxidative properties ,"“LVMH has been cooperating for a long time with Japanese universities. Almost immediately, we focused our interest on the specificities of Japanese and Asian skins and we have already organized several scientific conferences in the region, in Japan of course, but also in China and the Philippines,” explains Frédéric Bonté, Director of Scientific Communication  at LVMH Recherche, the research and development division of LVMH (Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy, etc.) for perfumes and cosmetics. ""This seminar, which is now in its fourth edition, is the occasion of a meeting between Japanese and French scientists. Participants include academics, business representatives and members of learned societies,"" he adds. This year’s seminar was dedicated to natural antioxidants (from botanical or marine origin) and their application in the cosmetics sector, but also in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Researchers from Japanese and French universities presented new natural molecules issued from rare plants or seaweeds, empowered with potentially strong antioxidant and pharmacological properties. Such active ingredients can be used in cosmetic formulas in order to fight the free radicals and oxidative processes due to UV and pollution, damaging factors involved in skin ageing and some skin diseases. Furthermore, researchers described new methods that now integrate computer predictive calculation and simulation methods from chemical formulas in order to predict their anti-radical and antioxidant powers. “Due to urban pollution, skin and body oxidation today is of major concern. Up to now, it was very time consuming and difficult to make a confident prediction about the anti-oxidative properties of molecules. However, the research on new antioxidant molecules is growing rapidly,” underlines LVMH Recherche."
"“Tomorrow’s skin care will be based on a holistic approach,” Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel, Institute of Biology and Chemistry of Proteins of Lyon","Premium Beauty News - The works of the team you are heading are focusing on the functionality and dynamics of skin tissue. What is about it exactly? Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel - At first, my team was mostly interested in skin micro-circulation. Using non-invasive models, we study the effect of environment, like the effects of the application of a pressure on the interactions between small nerve fibres in the skin and blood vessels especially in young, elderly and diabetic people. In 2013, following a reorganization of the unit to which the team belongs, we merged with the team of Pascal Sommer, which is focusing on elastogenesis in the extracellular matrix and on aging models. This remodelling of the team broadened the field of investigation to the elastic component. It also provided access to in-vitro techniques that will allow us to study very specific cellular interactions to the integrated model and the influence of pressure stress. We are interested in the responses given by the skin under pressure stresses, whether they are light as in a massage, or stronger, which can lead to skin lesions such as ulcers, necrotic lesions. Our current work focuses on the influence of elastic fibres in neuro-vascular interactions and on the relationship with pressure. Which genes, which signalling pathways are activated, which receptors come into play? How does the tissue regenerate? What functionalities are affected? And what are their changes over time? These studies have a particular resonance with the world of cosmetics, since a pressure is exerted during the application of a cosmetic cream on the skin, but also with the world of therapeutic pharmacology with the issue on chronic skin injuries. Premium Beauty News - What biological mechanisms have you highlighted recently? Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel - We published this year in the journal Nature Medicine [1] the finding on the role played by a stretch receptor in the transduction of a low pressure and which interacts with our mechanism. We have shown that low pressure could predict the behaviour of skin under high pressure. This relationship was observed for the past 10 years or more, and we were recently able to highlight it. Depending on the kinetics of reperfusion to the release of pressure, the tissue will become necrotic or not after 24h. The stretch receptor involved is the ASIC3 and the neuropeptide the CGRP, a molecule known for many years as being involved in inflammatory reactions, but which, depending on its tissue concentration, may induce other effects. Hence, we are revisiting the concept of the CGRP molecule. Premium Beauty News - In your speech at the last European Dermocosmetology Days on the topic of healing, you mentioned external parameters – psychological and well-being in particular – as factors influencing the response of the skin under pressure stress. Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel - Indeed, we have observed that the induction of pain can have a deleterious effect on the micro vascular response at the measured pressure on a skin area away from the pain. The nervous system reacts to pain, it sends chemical signals, triggers the synthesis of stress molecules and we can see the behaviour of the skin change in response to low pressure. If the pain receptors are blocked, we recover the micro vascular response to pressure. By extrapolating on a healthy person, we could test the quality of the skin depending on the stress state of the person, conditions of application of the product, and of self-esteem. This could be done by acting on a receiver, a cellular or molecular partner to highlight these mechanisms and modulate the influence of this psychic world. The human body responds to its environment, sometimes it adapts to it, sometimes it deregulates and this, depending on the chronicity of harmful environments but also on one’s individual capabilities. To date, we take account of these observations and always incorporate a questionnaire on the mood and feeling of volunteers with regards to pain, in our clinical studies. Premium Beauty News - What is your insight on the future of skin care? Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel - The skin sends many messages, be they metabolic or psychological. Through the mechanisms that we discover our aim is not about knowing how to repair an injury faster but how best fix and prevent it from reappearing again over time. I’m in a spirit of prevention, of being able to “avoid that”, by investing in the quality of skin. In my view, the future of skincare will lie in holistic approaches, through the mode of application, the environment and not just by treating the site but by taking into account the person as a whole. At the level of my research team, we have a great conceptual strength encompassing the functionality and dynamics of the skin with an approach ranging from epigenetics to cell, culture including the human being taken in its individuality. This is a good program ahead of us for the next 10 years."
"""Our water treatment process increases the performance of formulated products,"" Dr. Philippe Vallée","Premium Beauty News - Apparently there is hardly a single type of water but several. Philippe Vallée - Yes indeed. Water, which has a very simple chemical formula turns out to be a highly complex environment with multiple properties: water is in constant reorganization with a lifetime of its hydrogen bonds of about 10-12 seconds. Therefore, its physico-chemical properties may change.  For example, when water is brought into contact with air - or with a container - there is a migration of the mineral, organic and/or gas compounds. Then, depending on their chemical affinities, these compounds may agglomerate to form colloids that will induce water reorganization at their interfaces. This interfacial water is particularly interesting for its physicochemical properties that can trigger new biological activity. Premium Beauty News - You have studied the impact of electromagnetic fields on water. What were the lessons learned ? Philippe Vallée - Actually, my PhD dissertation [1] focused on the impact of low frequency electromagnetic fields on water physicochemical properties and by extension on its biological activity. As a first step, it required developing a standardized protocol in order to control the interaction between water and the environment. From there, I was able to demonstrate that, when applied to water samples, low frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields impact the double ionic layer, at the gas/water interface of existing gas nano bubbles. Indeed, water always contains nano-sized gas bubbles that agglomerate themselves around residual impurities to form an interface on which water molecules are organized in interfacial water. The action of these electromagnetic fields, by destabilizing gas nanobubbles, causes the release of the adsorbed molecules and consequently a better hydration.  Changes in physicochemical and biological properties of exposed water samples can therefore be observed. It is interesting to note that water in our body is mostly interfacial water. Premium Beauty News - What are the potential applications of your findings? Philippe Vallée - The applications of our patented water treatment are numerous and have been the subject of scientific publications [2]. We develop these applications within our company Biophys-Solutions. One of our goals is to transfer this disruptive technology to industrial partners in the biotechnology sector. We have several projects in agronomy, water treatment, and the nutraceutical and cosmetic fields. For example, our process significantly increases the solubility and dispersion of a slimming active ingredient and can double its transcutaneous diffusion measured on human skin explants. The physical process we use for formulating optimizes the solubility and dispersion of non-polar compounds without adding surfactants and thus allowing the creation of clean formulas. We increase the bio-assimilation and performance of formulated products. This eco-technology is also environmentally friendly and complies with organic standards. Premium Beauty News - However, the need to apply a low frequency electromagnetic field may be a major constraint for the industry? Philippe Vallée - Any innovation requires some adaptations but the way the industry works is consistent with our eco-technological process. Today, our laboratory facilities enable us to carry out feasibility studies and we are currently testing the industrial transfer with a partner from the nutraceutical market to produce industrial quantities. Premium Beauty News - What are the prospects? Philippe Vallée -  Our R&D department continues to investigate possibilities for new applications and several projects are underway. With a partner from the cosmetics industry, we are investigating ""active water"" formulation considering that water is usually the ingredient in cosmetic formulations. In the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries, we collaborate with the INSERM on a project to create therapeutic waters. We also explore the opportunities in the fields of medical diagnostic and veterinary products. Water is an important ""vehicle"" in many fields.

New alternative method to identify allergenic substances,"According to Promega, a life sciences company, and BASF, a chemical giant and a leading supplier of ingredients for the cosmetics and personal care industries, their fully in vitro new method can reliably detect the allergenic potential of natural or chemical substances. The method is based on the use of a cell line newly developed by scientists of the RWTH Aachen University Hospital.  Indeed, the researchers have modified a reporter gene [1] from Promega, so that the stress reactions are coupled to a light signal. This gene construct was then stably inserted into human skin cell lines.  “Our luciferase [2]vectors translate cellular changes into a luminescent signal. This allows stress reactions in skin cells to be easily detected with our luciferase assay systems,” explains Dr. Katarina Bohm, Marketing Manager of Promega. Then, the new cell line has been tested at BASF and a standardized method has been developed to reliably assess the allergenic potential of a substance. According to the two companies, “the reaction of skin cells to allergenic substances can now be demonstrated in the test tube.”  Indeed, allergic skin reactions involve a variety of biochemical processes. These include the binding of a substance to one of the skin’s proteins and a resulting stress reaction. Both are early and reliable indicators of an allergenic potential of the test substance. Previously, the skin sensitizing action of substances had to be determined in animal studies.  As animal studies on cosmetic ingredients for the European market have been completely prohibited since March 2013, developing the method at the present time is particularly important.  In particular in a context where REACH regulation simultaneously requires several thousand substances to be tested for their skin sensitizing action by 2018. “Combining the new method with two additional alternative methods to investigate skin sensitization allows us not only to significantly reduce the number of animal studies, but also to predict a possible allergic risk more reliably than before,” says Dr. Robert Landsiedel, Head of the short-term Toxicology unit at BASF. The alternative method was therefore submitted to the European Commission (European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods, ECVAM) to decide whether it can be recognized as a standard method for toxicological studies in Europe."
"Nanomaterials, where do we stand?","A possible ban on nanoparticles would be tantamount to accepting to deprive ourselves of structures which, because of their small size, change the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of materials and therefore offer broad fields of application. In fact, the possible applications offered by nanomaterials exceed by far the sole domain of cosmetics [1]. “Nano-objects can be found in many business sectors such as the food industry with cyclodextrins which are flavour enhancers, the health industry where nano vectors are widely used to carry drugs, in cosmetics, and many other areas. Nanoparticles are ubiquitous in our everyday lives,” says Dr. Philippe Piccerelle. The properties obtained are often remarkable: improved solubility, different colour, targeted and prolonged action, magnetic properties, different biological interactions... The range of possibilities seems infinite. The study conducted in May 2012 by the firm McDermott Will & Emery even defines nanotechnology as the 5th Industrial Revolution. In this area, the United States is the country which files the most patents (54%), far ahead South Korea (8%), Japan and Germany (7%). France contributes to 4% of patent applications. The general increase in the number of applications is vertiginous since it is close to 150% between 2006 and 2011. [2] But for manufacturers, particularly those in cosmetics, there is also the question of the acceptability of these nano-particles for consumers. Won’t they suffer the same fate as other substances, now more or less ostracised. Because undeniably, nanoparticles have not always had good press, especially with some environmentalists. However, strictly regulatory speaking, nothing is banned. The new European regulation for the cosmetic industry requires that nanoscale substances are subject to opinion 6 months before the placing on the market of products. No later than January 11, 2014, the Commission will provide a catalogue of nano-products used in cosmetics, and the term [nano] will have to follow the name of the ingredient concerned on the label of products containing some.
According to Prof. Piccerelle, “questions that arise, about the use of nanoparticles are those related to their physical state (are they solid or liquid?), to their biopersistence, their possible passage through the tissue barrier and to their genotoxicity.” In March 2011, the Afssaps adopted a report on the state of knowledge concerning the use of TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles in cosmetics, especially with regards to their skin penetration, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. “No general conclusion could be given, everything depending of the routes of exposure –whether they are cutaneous or pulmonary routes, of the skin condition –whether it is injured or not,” explains Dr. Picerrelle. “Studies conducted by independent experts are to be done on this subject and they also need to be backed-up by information campaigns” he adds. The conduct of such studies is essential if we want one day to get the benefits of these particles. The European Consumers’ Organisation (BEUC), which groups several consumer associations from 31 European countries, is already asking for a stricter regulation. The organization wishes that are established as nanomaterials, those with at least 0.15% of nanometric particles, those unintentionally produced as well as soluble nanoparticles and nanostructures, and those with sizes under 1 nm. The BEUC also wishes for a criterion of specific surface to be taken into account."
Healing and dermocosmetology,"For Dominique Bouvier, the President of the European Centre of Dermocosmetology (CED), the theme of these 26th Days - “Contribution of dermocosmetology to healing” - enables to make a link between clinical dermatology and cosmetology. The study, the understanding but also the repair of injuries were at the heart of the two-day conferences. Everyone has experienced during his life a more or less traumatic event which generated a scar. “Immediately after an injury, whether thermal, mechanical or chemical, a process enabling the healing of the skin but also of internal or external mucous membranes develops” explains by way of introduction, Prof. Alexis Desmoulière from the Department of Physiology at the Faculty of Pharmacy of Limoges. Three successive phases take place, the purpose of which is to completely close the wound. The first phase is vascular and inflammatory, the second consists in the cell migration and proliferation and the third one in the maturation and tissue remodelling. A number of cellular mechanisms take part to this process and defects may occur leading to pathological conditions such as chronic wounds, excessive wound healing, stretch marks... Some actors play an important role: the macrophages during the inflammatory phase, myofibroblasts during cell proliferation and all physiological phenomena of apoptosis involved during maturation. The cellular microenvironment, interactions between the cell and the extracellular matrix, mechanical stress are also factors to be considered. “Wound healing is multiparametric” confirms Prof. Philippe Humbert from the CHU of Besançon. In addition, such factors as age, the health state, but also the person’s emotional mind state will play a part in the healing process. “The nervous system plays a role in the healing process. Skin is an extremely sensitive, highly innervated organ, a delicate balance occurs between on the one hand neurotransmitters that stimulate the healing process and on the other hand the ones that slow it down,” explains Prof. Laurent Misery from the neuroscience laboratory of Brest. Ideal healing only being observed in humans in the foetal state. To better understand healing in order to get a better grasp of its process is also an objective of players in the field. In vitro and in vivo models coexist. They help replicate in a standardized manner each step of the process and provide some understanding. Dr. François Berthod from the LOEX centre at the University of Laval in Quebec studies with an in vitro model the effect of the sensory nervous system on healing. “Our skin model reconstructed with human microvascular endothelial cells, also innervated with sensory mice neurons allows us to study the influence of sensory nerves, endothelial cells on the speed of wound closure independently of inflammation,” he says. Concerning in vivo evaluations, the Dermscan laboratory has a whole range of protocols on standardized wounds to measure the contribution of cosmetics on healing. Innovative measurement tools like Raman spectroscopy, confocal microscopy or high resolution photography are used for the assessment. “With Raman spectroscopy, we can study molecular entities, which enables us to follow the penetration of actives, the changes in the composition of the Natural moisturising factor (NMF)” details Véranne Charbonnier from ProDERM. An overall assessment that increasingly combines a biometric and objective part to a subjective part obtained from answers to self assessment questionnaires. At a medical level, skin substitutes, tissue engineering and stem cells are widely used to deal with the most severe scars, including so-called accidental scars. For chronic wounds such as bed sores, ulcers, approaches are different. Some target the microenvironment of the extracellular matrix to restore cellular homeostasis. Denis Barritault from OTR3 proposes a treatment based on sugar chemistry, RGTA molecules which are heparan sulfate mimetics, degraded compounds in the case of injuries and involved in cellular communication. Anaïs Raynaud from the laboratory of chemistry of natural substances of Limoges demonstrates the immunostimulatory effect of honey on wound healing. These works are the result of more than 30 years of use, by Prof. Descottes from the CHU of Limoges, of thyme honey to treat ulcers. For acne type scars which are a frequently observed complication, the various possibilities offered by lasers were discussed by Dr. Michel Magis. Finally, to improve the quality of life of people whose scars are still apparent both on the body and in the mind, Agnès Arquillière, a socio-esthetician has developed a skincare protocol for people who underwent a mastectomy. As for Dr. Philippe Deshayes he focuses on corrective make-up. Cosmetics is involved in the healing phenomena which are found at stretch marks site but also on micro tears observed in aged skins. “In the case of cosmetics, emphasises Humbert, we act on healthy skins.” In dermocosmetology, the scope is wider since it also covers cracks, cuts, splits, diaper rashes. Solutions provided by brands are increasingly sophisticated, based on biological efficacy coupled with good marketing. Suppliers of cosmetic actives in turn are closely studying the healing process to better meet their customers’ needs. This is particularly the case with Silab and the active Glyco-Repair® which is now also available in an organic version. Glyco-Repair® Bio regenerates the depleted natural repair systems by impacting on the synthesis of growth factor activin A, which are tissue repair mediator, and on the synthesis of alpha-SMA, the characteristic marker of myofibroblasts.  This is also the case with Codif’s EPS and MEPS, exopolysaccharides produced and secreted by marine plankton, which impact the epidermal reconstruction.  ""We have demonstrated that they improve the epidermal reconstruction by stimulating proteins of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) and antimicrobial peptides,” said Pierre-Yves Morvan, R&D Director, Codif International. Finally, a source of inspiration for cosmetology is, according to Dr Patricia Rousselle from the Institute of biology and chemistry of proteins of Lyon, “the dermo-epidermal junction, which is a living base capable of repairing the damages of time.” We can be certain that all of these pieces of advices were heard by the audience."
"""Ultra customization of products is the emerging trend,"" Jérôme Lamartine, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1","Premium Beauty News - You are a scientist by training, a graduate of the École Normale Supérieure of Lyon in molecular biology and genetics, you were a researcher at the CEA of Évry, what triggered your interest in skin, the epidermis, differentiation and stress? Jérôme Lamartine - Indeed I am a scientist by training and not a dermatologist. In 2005 before joining the centre of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Physiology of the CNRS in Lyon, I took part in research projects aimed at understanding cellular mechanisms through their gene expression. I started exploring this topic through a thesis I conducted at the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon by studying genes involved in genetic diseases of the immune system. Then I was recruited at the Généthon in Évry to work on the identification of genes responsible for rare skin diseases such as ectodermal dysplasias that result in particular in hair formation defects at both the skin and hair level. So it is through genetic diseases that I started to get involved in skin. These works were followed a few years later at the CEA of Évry by studying, through the use high-throughput analysis approaches, the effects of radiation, such as ionizing radiations on the skin. These technologies, like microarrays or high-throughput sequencing, allow approaching the cell as a whole. The cell is very complex with millions of biological objects and these methods of investigation enable to have a comprehensive view of phenomena. Currently, with my team at the CNRS in Lyon, we are focusing on genotoxic stress [1], on its impact on skin homeostasis and on the occurrence of skin diseases such as cancers. We are trying to understand how a cell enters into a differentiation program, what are the molecular mechanisms involved and how this program is disturbed as a result of genotoxic stress. Premium Beauty News - What are your latest advancements in this area? Jérôme Lamartine - Recently, we have demonstrated the role played by transcription factors particularly those that occur at a critical moment for the epidermal cell: when it stops dividing and starts to differentiate. We have shown that the same regulators act during normal differentiation and during a response to stress. For example, an important player that we discovered is the transcription factor GATA-3 [2]. This molecule not only plays a part in the formation of the hair follicle but it is also present to regulate the genes response to gamma irradiation at the epidermis level. The GATA-3 is involved in stopping cell proliferation and in its entry into differentiation. Our work aims to highlight the link between stress and differentiation through the molecular players involved in these phenomena. Aging is part of our research. Sun exposure is a stressor for the skin who will respond by accelerating its differentiation, through the modification of some genetic networks. We are trying to understand how to protect the skin from genotoxic stress, or even how to reverse the differentiation and aging process. Premium Beauty News - Your team is also involved in the study of skin cancers. Very recently, the work of one of your researchers, Miss Manale El Kharbili, were awarded the 2012 SPIM Junior Scientist Prize, can tell you us more on their content? Jérôme Lamartine - Concerning skin cancers and in particular melanoma, we use methods of global gene expression analysis to understand why a melanoma is invasive or not. The work of Manale El Kharbili [3] has evidenced that a membrane protein, the Tetraspanin 8 is highly expressed in invasive cells and totally absent in others. This molecule seems therefore to be an interesting candidate to use as a diagnostic tool on this subject or as a therapeutic target. Regarding these subjects, molecular players involved are investigated by us the same way. Premium Beauty News - The city of Lyon appears as being an active pole for dermocosmetics, with whom do you collaborate? Jérôme Lamartine - As we only do basic research, cosmetic manufacturers are not for the time being our main partners even if our subjects are of interest to them. However, we will be signing this year a collaboration agreement with a player operating in this field. We interact with research laboratories, like for example the team of Odile Damour or with colleagues fom the IBCP (Institute of Biology and Protein Chemistry).Moreover, as a teacher at the University Lyon 1 and a member of a committee which is interested in the links between the academic world and the industry, I am in contact with the European Centre of dermocosmetology (CED). Premium Beauty News - Finally, how do you see the future of the cell, you who are observing it in a global manner? Jérôme Lamartine - biology in my opinion is undergoing the same changes as physics did between the beginning of the 20th century and today. From experimental science, we are gradually shifting to a science of modelling. Yet, what is true for physics is not true for biology but I think the future stands in the gathering of knowledge with the hope of one day being able to model the cell. Another trend, which is starting to emerge, in my opinion, is the ultra customization of products and medicine. It is already possible to obtain many biological data on an individual and tomorrow for just a few hundred euros, its entire genome will be accessible. This information could be stored on individual smart cards that could be consulted to develop medical treatments or customized cosmetics. These changes can be summarized in three words: globalization of analysis, customization, modelling."
"""The theme of healing is the link between clinical dermatology and cosmetology,"" Dominique Bouvier, President of the CED","Premium Beauty News - What does this 26th edition of the European Dermocosmetology Days look like? Dominique Bouvier - Actually it looks really exiting! We again expect about 200 visitors, who we hope, will this year once again enjoy the friendliness and the high quality of communications that characterize this event and made its reputation over the past five decades. These days, which are held every two years, coincide in fact this year with the fiftieth anniversary of the European Centre dermocosmetology (Centre européen de dermocosmétologie - CED). Our partners are loyal, such as the Grand Lyon, the ADERLY, the CCI of Lyon, the University Lyon 1, and manufacturers like Gattefossé, Alpol, Sicobel, Greentech, Miyoshi, Strand Cosmetics Europe, Seppic, Expanscience, IEC, Dermscan, Vitroscreen .I hope I did not forgotten anyone. Premium Beauty News - This year’s theme is ""the contribution of dermocosmetology to healing."" What was the reason for this choice? Dominique Bouvier - This year, as in previous years, the subject was chosen by our Scientific Advisory Board. We wanted to deal with the repair, restoration of the skin barrier. We hesitated for some time concerning the title before finally opting for the word ""healing"". It is a broader term but more adapted to what makes the DNA of our association, namely an equal exchange between academic research, clinical laboratories, galenic formulators and manufacturers. In other words, the term ""healing"" is one that best establishes the link between clinical dermatology and cosmetology. Recent changes in temporary rejuvenation practices, be they with the use of medical lasers, subcutaneous injections and, in general, ""light cosmetic surgery"" have led to the development of a whole series of post-intervention treatments that also include new make-up techniques. These are all the topics that will be discussed during these two days. Premium Beauty News - Precisely what will be the highlights of these two days? Dominique Bouvier - The first day will be dedicated to academic research. We will review the latest progress in the mechanisms that come into play in the healing process. The second day is dedicated to in vitro and in vivo assessment tests, skin renovator actives, with a focus on socio-aesthetic practices, particularly on interventions of beauticians in hospitals and on the compared regulation between cosmetics and medical devices. In addition to this scientific program some special events will take place that should delight participants. On February 6, the exhibition ""Le teint entre scène"" (complexion comes into play) will open its doors at the Gadagne Museums. It will be a unique opportunity for those interested, to discover the art of skin care and make-up from the 18th century to the present days. Indeed, after the exhibition ""Lèvres de Luxe"" (Luxury Lips) dedicated to lipstick in 2011, Anne Camilli and Jean-Marie Martin Hattenberg had wished to return to Lyon for a second act in a venue for which Lyon inhabitants are particularly fond of thanks to its famous Guignol Theatre in the heart of the ""Vieux Lyon"". Hence the adventure continues in 2013, with Maria-Anne Privat-Savigny, Chief Cultural Heritage Officer of the Gadagne Museums. On February 7, a gala dinner will bring together all the participants at the Palais de la Bourse, the headquarters of the Lyon CCI. On this occasion, the company ""Guichets Fermés"" will present a series of sketches - created for the occasion by the writer Jean Louis Rapini - on the relationship between the industry, academic research and public authorities. Premium Beauty News - What main projects does the CED have underway? Dominique Bouvier - Our main focus remains scientific training. Our partnership with FC3Bio, the training company of Jean-François Prost, will give birth to four sessions dedicated to cell biology: ""hypersensitivity to cosmetics"", ""skin and Immunity"", ""collagens"" and ""reconstructed skin models "". In addition, the CED will also take part in April to In-Cosmetics in Paris. In June we will participate to the day dedicated to innovation organized by Allizé-Plasturgie, the Interregional union of plastics industry that covers the entire eastern part of France, from north to south. On this occasion we will review the work of the joint working group with the plastics industry on the content/container interactions. This theme launched by the CED in early 2010 is of particular concern to us. The overall safety of our products, including container and content, is a key issue, not only because of regulatory constraints that are looming on the horizon, but also because of the thorny issues that this raises and which only collaborative work can solve. To note finally that our website www.ced-lyon.com has been completely redesigned with the aim to foster a close relationship with our members and to increase our notoriety in France and abroad."
Senescence and skin: what progress?,"Senescence is defined as a progressive loss of body functions. According to Prof. Gérald E. Pierard from the University of Liège ""skin senescence which is the global reflection of the influence of many intrinsic and extrinsic factors can be divided into seven types (chronological, actinic, genetic, endocrine, catabolic, addictive and gravitational)."" Senescent cells accumulate in the skin, but the whole body is affected. For her part, Prof. Judith Campisi of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging paid some attention to the question of knowing when and where senescence begins and what were the associated mechanisms. ""It is a very complex process, which can be partly explained by the secretion from senescent cells of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and proteases which have been called SASP (Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype)"" she explained. Skin models consisting of fibroblasts, keratinocytes or melanocytes are also widely used to study aging. Thus the Dr. Martine French from the Laboratory of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, demonstrated that in senescent fibroblasts, the size and number of autophagy vacuoles increase in comparison to young fibroblasts. For keratinocytes, the level of autophagic activity that determines cell death and for melanocytes, their decreased activity with age leads to skin pigmentation defects and to a loss of efficiency of the tissue homeostasis. ""After 30 years of age, there is loss of 8 to 10% of the melanocyte activity per decades hence the appearance of white hair, senile lentigo and of hypomelanosis"" explains Corinne Bertolotto, from the Inserm U1065 in Nice. Finally, aging can also be observed at the mitochondria level (Dr. Carine Nizard, LVMH Recherche) or at the level of the extracellular matrix whose structure alters with age (Dr. Sylvie Brassart-Pasco, CNRS - Laboratory of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). In this context, what are the pathways leading to an ""optimal"" aging or even to the reversibility of the process? One of the avenues investigated by Dr. Jean-Marc Lemaître, Institute of Functional Genomics of Montpellier, is that of stem cells. ""Recently we were able to develop a screen to identify the target genes capable of influencing the entry into senescence or its avoidance using a specific combination of six reprogramming factors, we were able to reprogram senescent cells of aged donors."" In these experiments, signs of aging, such as those associated with the telomere length, the loss of mitochondria efficiency, were eventually faded out. At the skin level, it is already possible to achieve rejuvenated fibroblasts or keratinocytes. We all noticed that from one individual to another, longevity is different and depends, according to Lemaitre, ""of genetic and epigenetic factors for respectively 25% and 75%."" Lifestyle, diet, stress have an influence on molecular decline. To evaluate the aging of organisms, some address senescence from the angle of the regulation of gene expression. This is in particular the case with the Prediguard Company. ""We study the genes of young and aged skin and make correlations between the differences observed and the pathologies developed ""explains Dr. Philippe Benech founder and Head of Prediguard. Others will focus on skin constituents taken separately or as a whole. Thus, the Bioexigence Company studied the contractile properties of aged fibroblasts at the bottom of wrinkles. ""Fibroblasts inside wrinkles develop less contractile forces than fibroblasts from surrounding unwrinkled aged skin"" explains Dr. Carol Corderot-Masuyer, Manager. The Straticell Company has studied premature senescence induced by free radical stress or by UVBs. But measurements assessing the colour and consistency of the complexion are also performed by Skinexigence, demonstrating that this criterion has an influence when determining the perceived age. Because finally, isn’t the main goal to look younger than one’s actual age? The Chanel company has on this topic, shared a consistent study performed on 289 women aged from 20 to 70 and demonstrating that colour contrasts observed at the face level are a good marker of perceived age. Hence, couldn’t simply applying make-up be enough to create an illusion of youth? This solution is not exclusive and suppliers of cosmetic actives are working on their side to offer always more efficient molecules. This year, the ends of chromosomes - the telomeres for which research work was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2009 - are the target of new substances that are found under the name of Juvinity at Sederma, Telosomyl at Silab and Telosense at Ashland ISP. For Biotechmarine and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, progerin is the new marker that their latest actives are targeting. Induchem-Libragen has worked on a new class of receptors, the DOR (Delta Opiod Receptors) which are involved in the control of the skin differentiation process. The anti-glycation activity of the Sakura extract of Oryza Oil and the detoxifying and plumping activities of Effipulp proposed by Expanscience were also highlighted. This edition of the Jean-Paul Marty Days being completed, the French Society of Cosmetology is already preparing the next one on the theme: ""Skin and photoprotection."""
Study highlights experience-related changes in the brain of perfume creators,"It is, according to researchers from the CNRS (French National Centre for Scientific Research) and Inserm (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) team devoted to the study of the olfactory memory [1], another example of the human brain’s amazing plasticity [2].  These results, obtained through anatomical MRI performed on professional perfumers, students in perfumery and control subjects, also show that training can reverse the age-related decline in the volume of grey matter in olfactory areas, which is observed in the general population. The same team of researchers has shown in earlier studies that training enables perfumers develop the capacity to mentally imagine smells they can virtually ""feel"" in their nose while it is not physically present. Scientists have also observed that perfume experts enjoy a more efficient, rapid and specific neuronal communication in their brain’s olfactory areas. Researchers thus wondered whether the intensive training of perfumers was also reflected by an increase in the volume of grey matter in the brain areas related to olfaction. To answer this question, they submitted 14 renowned expert perfumers, including Jean-Claude Ellena and Daniel André, to an MRI.  The same test was conducted on 13 students from the Versailles-headquartered French school of perfumery (ISIPCA - Institut Supérieur International du Parfum, de la Cosmétique et de l’Aromatique Alimentaire), and 21 subjects with no particular expertise in perfumery. The MRIs showed that perfumers have a greater volume of grey matter in the primary olfactory cortex and the orbitofrontal region, next to the olfactory sulcus, than control volunteers. Furthermore, the volume of grey matter appears to be directly correlated with a perfumer’s experience. The more trained they are, the bigger the volume of olfactory areas is. However, the researchers found the volume of these brain areas to significantly decrease with age in control subjects, and that the process is general and continuous when no training is performed. Thus indicates that the brain changes observed among perfume experts are the result of training and are not innate characteristics. ""These results remind us similar structural changes observed in other expert categories such as musicians, athletes, multilingual individuals, mathematicians, or taxi drivers. All these specialists reorganize and over-develop specific brain areas according to their expertise. The amazing brain’s ability to adapt to environmental demands and to reorganize with experience seems to be limitless,"" says the CNRS in a statement."
SPIM 2012: skin from every angle,"The atmosphere at the Palais des Congrès in Vichy was conductive to exchanges and discussions favourable to brainstorming on the conference’s key themes: aging, skin epithelium, disorders and rare diseases of the skin. Epigenetics was at the centre of the presentation of Dr Eli Puterman, from the University of California in San Francisco. This researcher has highlighted the relation between the impact of lifestyle factors (physical activity, food, sleep quality, social relations, the level of psychological stress) with the telomerase activity and the length of telomeres, two known markers of cellular aging. ""Psychological stress has an influence on the regulation system of the telomere/telomerase couple"" he explained. A study conducted by the team of Dr. Puterman during a year on 213 women with controlled life conditions has shown a decrease in telomere length and in the telomerase activity depending of the importance of perceived stress. According to Puterman, ""in women with a good physical and health condition, the impact of stress on the length of telomeres, in connection with past events, is negligible, while it is significant for those whose health is fragile."" For its part, Prof. Andrew Dillin, of the Howard Hughes Institute in San Diego, took an interest in another approach to aging, by focusing on studies related to the mitochondria, in particular to the humoral control of the mitochondrial form and function in order to promote the longevity of a simple cell model, the C Elegans worm. His team sought to understand why, during aging, the organism starts losing control of the proteome and how this is transmitted to the whole organism. Also from this angle, Dr. Johan Auwerx, from the Laboratory for Integrative and Systems Physiology from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, studied how a decrease in mitochondrial functions - such as the one caused by caloric restriction - could have a positive impact on aging. Beyond aging a key focus was given to recent discoveries on the skin epithelium. For Prof. Jens Schroeder, from the Department of Dermatology at University of Kiel, the skin is considered as a microbial barrier where each skin layer contains antimicrobial peptides that protect the skin against infections. The presence of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-1 beta, IL-22, IL-36 plays a role in the production of these peptides. The lipid layer is also important in the development of some skin diseases among which eczema. Prof. Joke Bouwstra of the Leiden University, demonstrated for his part, that the lipid organization of the stratum corneum of skins affected by eczema was different from the one of healthy skins in terms of organization of lamellar structures and ceramides composition. ’We observed 28 patients, half of them with eczema. We took into account the composition and lipid organization of the skin, of the NMF and analysed the barrier function by measuring the transepidermal water loss. Although some mutations in the gene encoding the fillaggrine seem to be involved in eczema, we were unable to establish a correlation between the fillaggrine and the lipid properties, while on the other hand, the ceramide composition and the lipid organization appeared as factors correlated with the presence of eczema,"" he explained. Dr Patricia Rousselle from the CNRS Lyon presented recent results on the role of the microenvironment in skin repair showing that the syndecan-1, a transmembrane protein capable of carrying heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, was involved in important mechanisms at the skin repair level. Finally, several researchers shared their work on rare diseases: progeria or Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome by the Dr. Annachiara de Sandre-Giovannoli, the Kindler syndrome by Dr. Joey Lai-Cheong, the CMC (chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis) by Dr. Anne Puel. For psoriasis, the study approach was done using the microRNA pathway which are short DNA segments playing an important role in gene regulation. ""More than 2000 miRNAs were identified and each of them regulates hundreds of genes; it was demonstrated recently that these short DNA segments were involved in skin homeostasis and skin problems"" exposed Andor Pivarcsi from the Unit of Dermatology and Venereology, Department of Medicine at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, who uses the miR-203 that regulates keratinocyte differentiation or the miR-21 involved in psoriasis, as examples. ""We created SPIM to foster a spirit of open discussion, but also as a platform for young researchers,"" explains Jean-Yves Berthon CEO of Greentech. Three sessions are reserved to young researchers, a space for posters is available and they are awarded two prizes at the end of the two days. ""We retained 9 out of the 15 application files we had received. During a plenary session, the selected researchers present their work which will also published in the special edition of the SPIM III European Journal of Dermatology."" detailed Berthon. This year, Miss Manale El Kharbili was given the SPIM 2012 Junior Scientist Award for her work at the Centre for Molecular and Cellular Genetics and Physiology of Lyon on the involvement of tetraspanin 8 in the early invasion of cutaneous melanoma. The 2012 SPIM best poster was awarded to Miss Léa Moulin who identified a mechanism of epigenetic regulation specific to the aging of fibroblasts, by focusing on the Loxl1 gene repressed in aged fibroblasts. The next appointment of the Spim will take place in 2014"
What are the avenues against photo-aging?,"Sun is ambivalent: essential to health, on the one hand and a source of risks on the other hand. Its effects are beneficial for the mood through the endorphin synthesis, on health with the induction of the vitamin D synthesis, but it can also cause severe damages to the skin and eyes. In Western countries, behaviours and habits concerning sun exposure have evolved considerably in recent decades. From the 1930s, the traditional mistrust to sun gradually gave way to the desire of being tanned resulting in an increased exposure to sun then correlated with an increase in immunosuppression, in the number of skin cancers and in the acceleration of skin aging. Regarding photo-aging, the simplest markers, according to Dr. Marwin Edeas, President of the SFA, are ""free radicals and ROS (reactive oxygen species), but a decrease in the length of telomeres and in mitochondrial deterioration can also be observed."" Sun radiations, depending of their nature penetrate more or less deeply in the skin layers generating photo-products and free radicals. The measurements of the products resulting from this oxidative stress are of great interest to researchers wishing to know the reactivity of induced mechanisms and thus provide the skin with adapted antioxidants. ""We have enough mechanistic, epidemiological and pathophysiological data to confirm the existing link between oxidative stress and skin diseases,"" confirmed Dr. Olivier Sorg from the Dermato-Toxicology Service at the University of Geneva. He considers, however, that ""providing antioxidants to the skin is of no value if they are not well chosen and administered at the appropriate time and place."" A real challenge. Especially when we know that studies showing the value of the topical application of these molecules often result from in vitro tests. Very few clinical studies exist and Dr. Sorg is convinced that ""the in vitro reactivity of molecules is different in an in vivo system, the micro environment being very important."" Another difficulty arises from the non-standardization of measurement methods on oxidation products ""Methods used such as tissue assays, photometry, spectroscopic measurements... differ depending of the system used,"" explained Dr. Olivier Sorg. However, scientists generally agree on the high potential of antioxidant molecules. For Dr. Marwin Edeas the stimulation of the endogenous synthesis of antioxidants could help reach difficult targets such as mitochondria, and adjust dosage according to the individual. Indeed ""each person has its own needs in anti-oxidants, depending of their morphology and metabolism."" A clever balance must be found, especially since all free radicals must not be fought: a small fraction of them playing a part in the cellular mechanisms required for the proper functioning of the body. An ambivalent nature which is also found, according to Matthias Schafer from the Department of Biology which is part of the Institute of Cell Biology ETH Zurich, in the Nrf2 transcription factor. Depending of the conditions under which it is activated, it protects the skin from oxidative stress, but it can also disturb cellular functions in the epidermis, hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Would not all these issues on photo-aging find an answer by forgetting about aging? In any rate this is the track explored by Stéphanie Lacour, from the Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Neuroprosthetic Technology in Lausanne. With her team, she is working on a skin substitute called electronic skin whose goal is to mimic the sensory functions of the skin and to connect it with the neuronal system. To date, this research work is at the development stage of sensors with a capacity towards deformation similar to that of skin. To achieve this, technologies in microelectronics were adapted to super flexible sensors. Meanwhile, Nicolas Fortunel from the ""Stem Cells and radiation"" service of the Genopôle in Evry demonstrated the huge regeneration potential of tissue stem cells, particularly of keratinocytes through clonogenic assays, of tissue reconstruction capacity in 2D and 3D. According to Fortunel ""the cell does not need to rejuvenate but to preserve its cellular environment"" bearing in mind that ionizing radiations and UVs are great sources of genotoxic stress. To end the day, the Berkem company unveiled its new active, Origa’light, the Laboratorios Cinfa its Be Cell Energy Booster while the ICDD (Innovative Concept in Drug Development) presented a Mitosafe® method to assess the action of an antioxidant on mitochondrial functions."
"""Allergens, infectious agents, are necessary to insure our good health, it is only a question of dose,"" Jean-François Nicolas, dermatologist","Premium Beauty News - What are your areas of research? Jean-François Nicolas - Our activities and research focus not only in the pathophysiology of allergic skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, atopic contact dermatitis, but also on drug allergies. We work on understanding the cellular mechanisms involved, we develop diagnostic and prediction tools and propose new therapeutic strategies. We have cellular and animal models related to allergic contact eczema, atopic dermatitis helping us identify the molecules and cells responsible for the inflammation and those that could be treatment targets. Our teams are organized around three structures, two clinical services, part of the University Hospital of Lyon namely the Service of Allergology and Clinical Immunology headed by Frédéric Bérard and the Clinical Research Unit on diagnostics, treatments and drug testing under the responsibility of Catherine Goujon and the team from INSERM 851 [1]. Our work of course is oriented towards the medical domain but we have been working for many years with the cosmetic and dermocosmetic industry. Lyon is a recognized Pole of expertise in skin biology, and theEuropean Centre of dermocosmetology (CED) is a part of it. Premium Beauty News - What work did you undertake for the cosmetic industry? Jean-François Nicolas - Through our knowledge in immunization and in the development of contact allergies, the cosmetic industry with whom we have been working for more than twenty years, is interested in our work. Moreover, as specialists of in chemico, in silico, in vitro alternative methods, we develop in vitro tests of sensitization to contact allergens. Currently, we are studying an alternative method to animal testing, as required by the European Directive. We also just finished a blind study on the detection of low allergens. Out of 16 blind tested compounds, we managed to single out 10 of the 12 allergens present which imparts this test with an excellent sensitivity/specificity ratio. We are also involved in a European program ""Cosmetics Europe"" whose goal is to achieve the development of an in vitro alternative test on T cells (hTCPA test for Human T Cell Priming Assay). Many manufacturers also ask us to identify potential allergens in their products, fragrances, hair care, skincare. Premium Beauty News - We regularly read in the mainstream press that people are becoming increasingly allergic. What is your insight, as an expert on this subject? Jean-François Nicolas - I’m not sure whether allergies have increased or not, however there are an increasing number of sensitive people and in this group there are non-allergic sensitive subjects and allergic sensitive subjects. The person we call allergic will be immunised against the molecule, it will have developed antibodies or specific lymphocytes to the molecule and this is what is responsible for inflammation and the allergic disease. The non-allergic hypersensitive person will be sensitive to the effect of the pro inflammatory molecule leading to the inflammation. At the maximum 10 patients out of 100 will be allergic, with an extreme majority (90%) which is non-allergic with an hypersensitivity. The more and more frequent exposure to pro-inflammatory products like chemicals are predisposing factors. When the tissues’ biological adaptability is overcome, inflammatory reactions occur. Each individual once a certain amount of exposure to a molecule is reached can become hypersensitive but cofactors often come into play like health conditions, stress, and food. Premium Beauty News - Fragrances are once again stigmatized in some headlines, as a source of allergens and some media do not hesitate to stress on the fact that 10% of the population is allergic to perfumes, it seems a lot? Jean-François Nicolas - Anything can be an allergen, it all depends of the dose. When we talk about 10% of the population being allergic to perfume, the conditions under which this result was found must be specified. Studies are carried out using patch testing. Molecules are dissolved in Vaseline and applied with an occlusive patch for 48 hours, hence the discovered allergies are not usage ones. Conditions are very different from a sprayed perfume on the skin in the morning and sometimes only on the clothes. Compared to conditions of use, the percentage of people allergic to hydro-alcoholic perfumes is much lower, probably 1/1000. Premium Beauty News - Are there any other solutions to counter the allergenic effect of some molecules than the eviction or a desensitizing therapeutic treatment? Jean-François Nicolas - A line of research could be to ""quench"" allergenic molecules against one another and then to see how they react. Place a molecule with a high allergenic power like hexyl cinnamic aldehyde in a assay like for example the hTCPA and see if its effect could not be inhibited in combination with other allergens. People should know that allergens and infectious agents are necessary to insure our good health; it’s just a question of dose."
Emotional approaches of cosmetic efficiency,"""In 2001, we started investigating this area on behalf of the Sederma company, a manufacturer of cosmetic actives. In the past, science research mainly focused on so called ’negative’ emotions such as stress, anxiety and depression and concerned the medical field. Now, it is proven that well-being is also the result of so called ’positive’ emotion which can be evaluated in cosmetics, such as those triggered when inhaling a perfume or applying a cosmetic product "" explains Stéphanie Esnault, in charge of Marketing and Communication at Spincontrol [1]. Measuring emotions involves working on an multiparametric evaluation using three components: subjective, expressive and visceral. The whole purpose being to decrypt the mental content, the behavioural and postural changes and the physiological reactions inherent to an emotional impact. To have a knowledge of what is happening in a person when she opens a luxuriously wrapped product but also how she feels when she is wearing make-up, in short: to better understand the emotional state of the consumer. To achieve this, a whole series of means come into play because the purpose is not only to collect the feelings of panellists but also to measure them. ""We work with Dr. Arnaud Aubert, neuropsychologist, and use different methods both subjective and instrumental,"" points out Esnault. Thus, can be performed, measurements on pupil dilation (mydriasis), eye tracking, analysis of facial expressions as well as salivary assays. Tests of alertness and of well-being like the Bradley’s well-being questionnaire are other ways of measuring and evaluating a feeling. ""We have several tools available that we adapt according to the purpose of the study."" Although scientific literature is still scarce in the cosmetic field, all the major players of this industry are taking an interest in the matter. And for example at the 2009 IFSCC Congress, a scientific publication from LVMH concerned the impact of make-up on well-being [2].Prosody (vocal frequency and intensity), measurements of the skin temperature and hormonal assays showed that make-up regulated emotions in stressful situations, particularly in anxious and introverted women lacking self-confidence. For some, it is only the demonstration of a clear evidence but the measurement of emotions will maybe one day enable to broaden the scope of cosmetic claims to other new topics."
New biological targets involved in aging,"Premium Beauty News - You defended a doctoral thesis in 2011 on skin aging, in what context did you do it? Morgan Dos Santos - I had the chance to do my doctoral thesis in an interface position between the academic and industrial sectors. Indeed, a collaboration took place between the CNRS, through the laboratory of Dr. Patricia Rousselle from the Institute of Biology and Chemistry of Proteins (CNRS/UCBL), and BASF Beauty Care Solutions. The topic was ""the role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the basal lamina during skin aging"" [1] . The aim was to identify new biological targets involved at the level of the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ) in the aging process and in skin homeostasis. Under the direction of Dr. Patricia Rousselle, an internationally recognized expert in the area of dermo-epidermal junction - also called epidermal basal lamina - we studied the qualitative and quantitative changes of some partners during the aging process and the associated effects. This small area located between the epidermis and the dermis regulates a great number of fundamental processes in the skin such as differentiation, proliferation, and presents over time striking histological differences. Until now, research work had focused mainly on the study of collagen and glycoproteins present at this level. Proteoglycans are well known at the dermis level but much less at the DEJ level. All our results evidence that a significant decrease of the perlecan synthesis – the main proteoglycan of basal lamina – takes a part in the thinning and in the epidermal differentiation defects observed during aging. Premium Beauty News - What methods and approach did you use for your study?  Morgan Dos Santos - We had a multi-pronged approach, namely, a tissue, cellular and molecular approach. First, the expression of proteoglycans was studied from a fundamental point of view, analysing them qualitatively and quantitatively at the tissue and cellular level and during aging. An immunohistological analysis of a cohort of normal human skin from donors ranging from 22 to 73 years of age showed a drastic diminution of perlecan at the DEJ. Biochemical studies combined to genomic analyses demonstrated that the decrease in the expression of perlecan was not caused by a degradation of the protein itself but by a decrease in the transcriptional activity of keratinocytes. We then validated our observations on different three-dimensional models of reconstructed skin mimicking some characteristics of aging. For this, we took advantage of the knowledge and expertise of Dr. Odile Damour, Head of the Laboratory of Skin Replacement in Lyon and internationally recognized in the field of tissue engineering. We were able to approach the molecular mechanisms by which these proteoglycans could influence the epidermal differentiation. Generally speaking, the constituents of aging are well identified but our understanding of the associated mechanisms is not complete. With our findings on proteoglycans, we have contributed to make some progress on this subject. Premium Beauty News - What was at stake for your industry partner? Morgan Dos Santos - Having discovered new biological targets associated to aging and having approached the mechanisms involved, it was interesting to see if some compounds were able to restore the expression of proteoglycans involved in aging processes. For this, an identification and screening of molecules by our industrial partner was performed on a simple cell model and then on a three-dimensional model. Some chemical and natural compounds proved being particularly effective. Premium Beauty News - What prospects does your work offer? Morgan Dos Santos - There will be some academic but also industrial spin-offs. In the short term, this work will lead to a publication in a scientific journal. At the industrial level, this work will be the basis for future industrial development. We have already made some in vitro evaluations on the potential of some molecules to restore the expression of these partners. This work could have some repercussions in the areas of skin repair and cosmetics. On a personal level, my wish is to continue to study skin aging. In addition, I had the chance of being in contact with experts in skin biology, namely Dr. Patricia Rousselle and Dr. Odile Damour, both references in their field and belonging to the Lyon centre of expertise in dermocosmetics with the CED being its reflection. And to be able to contribute to the development of an active ingredient in connection with the findings was a great opportunity and I am grateful for the confidence that BASF Beauty Care Solutions placed in me."
What future for the cosmetics industry after oil?,"Is this still an ethical issue?  Corporate commitment to sustainable development seems increasingly guided by the reality principle and common sense. The obvious depletion of many natural resources, starting with oil, is forcing companies to reconsider their long-term strategy.  “The competitiveness and sustainability of LVMH’s activities depend very directly on our ability to preserve and enhance natural resources,” explained Sylvie Bénard, Environment Director of the LVMH Group. Like other major groups, the French luxury giant is actively seeking the technological revolutions that will bring the cosmetics industry into a new era. Oil’s abundance, easy extraction and the breadth of its applications have made it an important resource, and today 400 million tons of oil are used by chemical industries and approximately three-quarters of that amount are used to make plastics.  However the peak of oil production probably already occurred, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects that about 30% of the production of existing wells will have vanished by 2020. Of course new oil fields should be discovered, but exploitation costs will skyrocket. These questions lead the chemical industry to undergo a real revolution combining the anticipation of oil exhaustion together with the drastically reduction of greenhouse gases, and a strong regulatory pressure regarding the toxicology and ecotoxicology related to the use of raw materials. Great strides in new forms of industrial synthesis have been made through green chemistry. “Plant or algae-based chemicals might partly replace oil as a raw material. Plant biomass can be converted in biorefineries into glucose and fatty acids, which, in the future, will be able to be used to produce monomers and polymers,” says Frédéric Bonté, Director of Scientific Communication at LVMH Recherche. While today, biomass represents a huge renewable resources, its use for industry purposes imply to preserve its use a food source. In the 1990s early research efforts focused on bio-polymers, a sector that is now dramatically booming as it is forecasted to grow by 23,000% from 2005 to 2015.  More recently, technological roadmaps were established setting out a limited list of key precursor chemicals to which scientific research should be directed. “Today, bio-based materials are serious alternatives to mass produced or specialty chemical intermediates that are offered by the petrochemical industry,” deems Frédérique Lafosse, CEO of Soliance.  However, she warns they “cannot be disconnected from their industrial environment, or from scientific and technical processes and techniques used to obtain them and produce them in a sound manner.” Very concretely, Carine Alfos, Innovation Director at Iterg, highlighted the development of green oleochemistry, which already represents 7% of the world market of vegetable oils (excluding saponification and biodiesel). “In the U.S., research is being conducted on several oilseed species whose oil has a specific fatty acid profile: jojoba, Crambe abyssinica, Lesquerella, Vernonia, Cuphea, Limnanthes. In Europe, several oilseeds with a particular fatty acid profile have begun to gain recognition in the domain of green chemistry: erucic rapeseed, low linolenic rapeseed or high oleic rapeseed, linseed, oleic sunflower and, maybe in the future, stearic sunflower. The fatty acid composition of their oils offer many opportunities: biofuels, lubricants, detergents, plastics, paints, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.” Of course, there are numerous technical difficulties, but so far these alternatives have mainly suffered from a lack of competitiveness compared to ingredients derived from petrochemicals. A financial mechanics that could be reversed in the medium term."
A comprehensive approach to detect phthalates in cosmetic products,"The European legislation prohibits eight phthalates from being used in cosmetic products (DBP, DEHP, BBP, DMEP, DNPP, Dipp, DPP, and DiBP). However, phthalates, which form an especially wide family of molecules, remain widely used in several other industry sectors, in particular for manufacturing plastic products. For example, phthalates are added to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to make it more flexible, resilient and easy to work and can make up to 50% of the mass of this material.  Since, as pointed out by the French agency, phthalates molecules are not chemically bound to plastics, they are likely to be released and can therefore contaminate cosmetics, either during the manufacturing process, or because of the contamination of certain raw materials, or as a result of a release from packaging into the formulation. To facilitate the detection of these potential contaminants, the ANSM has developed an analysis method that allows for the detecting and the measuring of twelve phthalates.  The details of the method, which is based on gas chromatography and detection by mass spectrometry, have been published in the Journal of Chromatography A [1], dated August 31, 2012. Main advantage of this new method: the first time it is possible to search for twelve phthalates simultaneously, including the eight one that are prohibited by the European regulation on cosmetics, and to measure them. Depending on the type of cosmetic tested, the detection limit of the twelve phthalates using this method is comprised between 0.5 and 2.5 μg g−1. This method, which is currently used by the French agency in its laboratories, has been presented to the Technical Committee 392 of the European Standardisation Committee (CEN TC 392), as a future European standard. It also used as a base for the development of similar methods suitable for the detection of phthalates in other health products, such as some medical devices."
Trade associations contest links between diabetes and phthalates used in cosmetics,"Previous studies have shown that women have higher urinary concentrations of several phthalate metabolites compared to men, possibly due to higher use of personal care products. In order to further investigate the consequences of these concentrations, researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) have explored the possible links between these metabolites, diabetes, and diabetes-related risk factors in women [1]. They analyzed urinary concentrations of phthalates in 2,350 American women, between 20 and 80 years of age, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2001-2008.  After having adjusted their results for potential confounders, they found that women with higher levels of phthalate metabolites in their urine were more likely to have diabetes. The lead researcher of the BWH study, Dr. Tamarra James-Todd, noted herself that this exploratory research had “a number of limitations.”  In particular, as phthalates are known to be in certain types of medications and medical devices, including medical products containing polyvinyl chloride used in intravenous bags and medical tubing, the possibility of reverse causation cannot be ruled out.  “As such, it is possible that some of these associations are due to greater exposure to phthalates through increased use of certain medical devices and medications among women with diabetes.” Linda Loretz, PhD, Director, Safety and Regulatory Toxicology at the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the main trade association representing the cosmetics industry in the U.S. also pointed the fact that while “diethyl phthalate, also known as DEP, is the only phthalate with significant use in cosmetics, the BWH study found no association between DEP and diabetes in any of the four models used by the study’s authors.” The Cosmetic Toiletry & Perfumery Association (CTPA), the UK cosmetic trade association, also noted that “of the particular phthalates mentioned in the study and the reports (mono-benzyl phthalate, mono-isobutyl phthalate, mono-n-butyl phthalate and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate is banned from use in cosmetic products in Europe and we are not aware that any of the others are used in cosmetic products.” The organisations representing the industry underline that while the study associated urinary levels of several phthalates with prevalent diabetes, no direct links have been found between diabetes and the use of phthalates in personal care products. As for the authors of the research, they consider that “future prospective studies are needed to further explore these associations to determine whether phthalate exposure can alter glucose metabolism, and increase the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes.”"
Human sciences and cosmetics: the challenge of Nivea research,"Premium Beauty News - Could you come back on the creation of the Observatoire Nivea? Anne Zavan - Nivea is a group that relies heavily on scientific research. In 2005, we wanted to add to our activities a reflection on human sciences as societal challenges. It was an initiative of the French teams, supported by the parent company in Hamburg. For this, we asked Gilles Boëtsch, a CNRS researcher and anthropologist to create a committee of experts to study the cultures of the body and of appearance as social issues. Gilles Boëtsch surrounded himself with Georges Vigarello a historian, Nadine Pomarède a dermatologist, David Le Breton a Professor of sociology and anthropology and Bernard Andrieu a Professor in epistemology and philosophy of the body. This is a scientific committee independent from Nivea that meets four times a year. Its members confront their views, their recent readings, their prospective analysis and anticipation of the world. In parallel, some topics are subject to publication in booklets, the ""Cahiers de l’Observatoire"" [1]. Nivea does not intervene, or only exceptionally, in the choice of the themes defined by the expert committee. Great freedom is given. Out of the sixteen booklets published in five years, only two were the choice of the brand, namely a booklet on global beauty and another one on the world of bathrooms. The first booklets focused more specifically on the observation of the skin and since 2008, the Observatoire Nivea extended its field of reflection to the question of appearance in society. Indeed, in a world where the body image is becoming increasingly instrumental in the construction of identity, appearance has becomes a real societal issue. The Observatoire Nivea also supports academic research by presenting the Observatoire Nivea/CNRS Award rewarding two researchers in human sciences. In 2011, the winners were Fabienne Laval, PhD in sports science and Jean-Baptiste Eczet, PhD in social anthropology (11 winners in total in the past 5 years). Their work focuses on the theme of ""the construction of appearance in society"". Premium Beauty News - For whom are your booklets intended, have they inspired your launches? Anne Zavan - As the books are written in French, the public is French speaking. They are journalists, opinion leaders, scientists, colleagues, always as part of a BtoB approach. The distribution of the paper version is limited since we only print 1,500 copies but they are also available as free downloads from our web site (www.observatoirenivea.com) If our launches are not directly inspired by the content of booklets, on the other hand the avenues to explore they provide may well influence a discourse, the choice of communication. It sheds some light on what is happening at the level of society and of societal actions. They are sources of inspiration, a necessary food, a way of staying well acquainted with the evolution of the society. Premium Beauty News - The latest booklet focuses on the body in 50 years time, and at the exhibition, it led to a scientific symposium themed ""2062, the future of the body"" at the Gaîté Lyrique in Paris, how do you see the future of the body? Bernard Andrieu - We notice a strong convergence where advances in science especially in terms of regenerative medicine, of communication techniques, of exoskeletons make that the body in 50 years will be much different from the one we currently know. The surface of the body will serve as a communication area where implants will be able to interfere in real-time with the environment, transmit information, stimulate functions. It will be like a total immersion of the body inside a network. We will be living in interactive environments where cosmetics will communicate with interfaces, new cosmetics will have become technological. Skin will be complemented by its screen. The body and the world will no longer be separated, other bodies will be added to our existence. In immersive arts, these aspects already exist and the artist Orlan [2]  is an example of this."
"""Scientific evidence becomes unavoidable in cosmetics,"" Professor Daniel Hartmann","Premium Beauty News - Where does your interest for tissues and more specifically collagen come from? Professor Hartmann - In the ’80s, the Centre Technique du Cuir
 [1] started in Lyon a scientific activity around collagen. Several teams were working on this subject, some on collagen extraction, others on the impact of diseases on the extracellular matrix such as liver fibrosis. At the Pasteur Institute in Lyon, I was involved in the production of immunological probes: antibodies [2] directed against extracellular matrix molecules like collagen, elastin, laminin... Our specialty was to work on proteins of human origin but also of other animal species. This working group evolved and Lyon remained a platform bringing together academic and industry researchers specialized in this area. We also are fortunate to have a global competitive cluster, Lyonbiopôle, which is a centre of excellence in infectious diseases for therapeutics and diagnostics and to which the Novotec company [3] was taking part. Today my work as a Professor at the faculty of pharmacy, has led me to work on materials and medical devices intended for health. These biomaterials can be synthetic, like ceramics, bioglasses or resorbable polymers like polylactic acid, or natural like collagen. Applications concern for example bone substitute products, surgical oriented resorbable screws or coated dressings with wound healing properties. To this end, we have developed an expertise in tissue analysis in collaboration with Novotec. Premium Beauty News - What are your specificities in this area? Pr. Hartmann - We work in partnership with Novotec for whom I am a scientific advisor. Novotec develops, manufactures and markets specific antibodies for the extracellular matrix and offers its knowledge in tissue characterization. In this context, conventional techniques of tissue analysis like histology, immunohistochemistry (using antibodies for the mapping of the tissue) and electron microscopy have recently been complemented by in situ hybridization. Hence, the collected information is more complete since on the same tissue we can have in parallel the localization of a protein of interest and the expression of its gene. Kinetic studies are also possible to study proteins produced during a process of tissue repair such as wound healing. Premium Beauty News - What are the applications of the different methods of tissue analysis in particular in the cosmetic field? Pr. Hartmann - The developed methods are mainly applied in the health sector but bridges do exist with cosmetics because the experimental approach is identical. For example, the effects of pharmaceutical molecules have been studied in skin disease like psoriasis. And the reactions in connection with the implantation of skin substitutes and biomaterials were analysed and monitored in vivo in mice, rabbits and rats. A publication is currently under validation. In the cosmetic field, work on the effect of active molecules present in a cream has been undertaken to explore tissue remodelling and understand the mechanisms involved. We try to answer the questions: Who, When and Where? I believe that in the future, scientific evidence will be increasingly indisputable in the cosmetic field, which is comparable to the health sector area. I am also a member of the European Centre Dermocosmetics (CED), with one of the goals precisely being to strengthen the scientific knowledge in cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - Are you planning to further your work in tissue analysis? Pr. Hartmann - Yes, we want to answer the question How many? That is to say, after having accessed the localization of protein expression in tissues, to be able to quantify the gene expression level. This is indeed a major axis of development for Novotec."
"""We are exploring the genes that affect aging,"" Hugo Aguilaniu, CNRS","Premium Beauty News - Your research work has recently led your team to findings on the aging of organisms. What about it? Hugo Aguilaniu [1] - With my team, we explore the genes that affect aging by increasing it or decreasing it but also those that improve its quality. For our work we use nematode worms, a model organism for us, geneticists because it is capable of self-fertilizing and reproducing very rapidly. Its life expectancy is short, 2 to 3 weeks, it has a genome which is 40% equivalent to that of humans. Our daily work consists in searching, understanding, acting on genes that have the power to regulate longevity. This is hard and tedious work because we are confronted to a lot of information. There are between 16,000 and 20,000 genes in the nematode and fifty of them were characterized as having the power to regulate longevity. These are the ones we are studying. To increase longevity, all the cells need to work better and for this we are looking for ""orchestrators""’ of genes, capable of inducing the expression of many other genes. One of the keys to success is a combination of intuition and reasoning. In 2011, we published [2] results on one of the longevity genes the NHR-80. We highlighted that this over-expressed gene led to a life expectancy 2.5 times greater than that of normal nematodes. Furthermore, some old animals carrying an active version of this mutated gene appear rejuvenated. Relationships with lipid metabolism have been made since the NHR-80 gene governs a cascade of reactions leading to the modification of the expression of several genes including the fat-6, which encodes an enzyme that converts stearic acid into oleic acid. We are continuing our investigations on this subject and are trying to understand how this longevity occurs. Moreover, in 2010, we published some research work on rejuvenation in the journal Aging Cell  [3]. We demonstrated that when fertilization takes place the amount of damaged proteins present in the oocyte decreases sharply. We have put that in connection with the proteasome (an enzyme complex responsible for the targeted degradation of proteins). It is a rejuvenation process that prevents the transmission to the offspring of aged components coming from sex cells. We study mainly the impact of reproduction on longevity as well as the effect of caloric restriction on aging. How do they act on longevity? which genes are involved? can they be handled without reducing the caloric intake for example, what ways can be found to mimic the benefits without having the drawbacks? Along these lines of work, we also focus on the role of epigenetic changes on aging. What is the impact of these changes in the structure of the genome? We are no longer working on genes but on how the DNA is folded into the cell. These are basic research issues but with numerous potential applications. Premium Beauty News - Can the work conducted by your team and yourself on nematode worms have a direct impact in the industry an particularly in cosmetics, which has long been looking for eternal youth? Hugo Aguilaniu - All the genes on which we are focusing in the nematode worm have direct cousins in humans. A gene is a sequence of several thousand base pairs and the ones we are studying have up to 90-99% homology with humans. The cosmetic industry, who could use some activators of longevity genes in its products, is therefore paying a close attention in our findings. We are also in touch with some private stakeholders in this field. It is fairly easy to find molecules that mimic the mutation that was found, and to undertake measurement tests on human cells like keratinocytes. As for the pharmaceutical domain, gateways are narrower, there is still a long way to go because we are very far from the drug and we do not know yet how to perform transgenesis in humans. Our findings are regarded by the pharmaceutical industries as pipelines, main lines of research. However, genes that were found in nematodes were also found in mice and Drosophila. One of the solutions would be to have a drug that would act on the quality of aging instead of longevity. This is a major focus for the years to come, knowing that in 45 years life expectancy has increased by three months each year. Besides which, the issue on aging is, beyond the scientific challenge, a huge social issue. Premium Beauty News - Other teams are working on longevity, a subject whose challenge we understand is important. Are there possible collaborations? Hugo Aguilaniu - We are following of course what is done in this area. There are in France, two or three teams like ours working on the genetics of aging, we have some contacts in the United States, England, Germany. We study a book that fills every day a little more and we all contribute to add some pages to it. We can take inspiration from the mechanisms discovered by our colleagues even if the studied organisms are very different. Some complementary activities exist between laboratories. A large quantity of articles is published every day. In our laboratory, we have an average of one publication a year and currently we have five under investigation."
Alternatives to animal testing: the European cosmetics industry increases investments,"The new funds come on top of the 50 million euros programme that the European Commission and Cosmetics Europe (formerly known as Colipa)have jointly invested in SEURAT-1 [1], a five year research initiative, which was launched to develop a consistent strategy for the replacement of in vivo repeated dose systemic toxicity testing. Speaking at the annual SEURAT-1 meeting, which was held in Lisbon last week, Cosmetics Europe Director-General, Bertil Heerink, said the research programme need to be extended in order to take full benefit of all the efforts made in previous years. “We want the programme to maintain momentum. This industry continues to be totally committed to replacing alternative methods as soon as scientifically possible and therefore we continue to invest in research. The acknowledgement of our industry’s efforts helps us to continue our research on such a large scale,” he added. The Cosmetics Europe Alternatives to Animal Testing (AAT) extended programme will focus on: – Pre-validation of ‘promising’ toolbox test methods for Skin Sensitization and data integration activities 
– Finalising development and conduct pre-validation of the already developed 3D-model for genotoxicity, and promote regulatory acceptance in this field 
– Refinement of eye irritation assays to address last remaining gaps. The aim is to achieve workable solutions to replace animal testing as soon as possible, since the ban on the tests that remain accepted will enter into force in March 2013, despite the fact that it is unlikely that safe alternatives have been finalised in the meantime. “The scientific consensus is that the development of non-animal alternative methods represents a considerable challenge. The cosmetics industry has been working hard for many years to meet this challenge as fast as possible. Nevertheless, the development, validation and acceptance of alternative methods by regulatory bodies can only be considered as a long-term effort,” pointed out Dr Rob Taalman, Director of Research and Project Management for SEURAT-1."
Interactions between skin and formulations the main theme of the Jean-Paul Marty Days,"About 130 delegates gathered at the Pavillon Dauphine in Paris on November 30th and December 1st 2011 to better understand how formulations interacted with the skin. A theme chosen in tribute to Dr. Alec D. Bangham, the discoverer of liposomes who died in March 2010. According to Claudie Willemin, a member of the Scientific Council of the French Society of Cosmetology (SFC) and organizer of this conference, ""the great discovery of Dr. Alec D Bengham resulted in more than 41,000 publications, 6,000 patents applications and has enabled us to have a rational, scientific and thorough approach of formulation"". These two days program was punctuated by sessions led by renowned European researchers, the greatest names in cosmetics and raw material suppliers. New this year: the opportunity given to a young doctor to present the results of his thesis. Skin, an organ whose surface is the most important of the human body has many properties, one of them being to ensure the protection of the skin from its external environment. In his introduction, Dr. Marek Haftek, a Research Director at the CNRS, recalled that ""intercellular lipids imparted the stratum corneum with sealing properties and also regulated water fluids. The proper functioning of the stratum corneum barrier is essential to our survival"". To better understand skin and its surface properties is an important issue for researchers seeking to design products perfectly suited to this complex environment. For Gustavo S Luengo, from L’Oréal Research and Innovation ""the interaction of liquids with the surface of the skin is of paramount importance since many products are applied in this form"". Such techniques as atomic force microscopy, measurements of contact angles, lateral diffusion, help determine on plasties optimum wetting conditions. They depend of the nature of deposited molecules and of the chemistry of the ones present on the surface of the skin. The CERT (Centre d’Études et de Recherche sur le Tégument - Centre of Studies and Research on Integument) in Besançon, for its part, conducted an in vivo study of the effects of sebum and of various liquids (palmitic acid, squalene...) on the wettability of the skin. According to Ahmed Elkhyat a researcher at the University of Franche Comté, ""the cleansing of the skin will lead to an increased hydrophobicity of the skin, while the application a moisturizing cream will reduce it.""  These surface modifications also act, as explained Dr. Cyril Pailler Mattei from the Central School of Lyon, on the tribology of the skin or its mechanical behaviour, ""measurements that enable to distinguish the different skin types and why not, one day to objectively define what a beautiful skin should be"". To have a good understanding of the medium to better treat it is the first step. The following step consists in measuring what crosses the upper layers of the epidermis even reaching in some cases the bloodstream. The in vitro percutaneous absorption is one of the research tools available to address this need. Its evolution is constant. For example, new skin models take into account the presence or absence of pilosebaceous follicles, an area conducive to penetration. In addition, as stated Dr. Marie-Alexandrine Bolzinger from the Faculty of Pharmacy of Lyon ""the development of imaging techniques allows significant advances in the non invasive monitoring of actives and ingredients and in the study of actives / lipids, proteins interactions."" To date, there is ample evidence that the sizes of molecules, the ionic charges, the hydrophilic/lipophilic nature, the solubility of the active ingredient, the sites of application and the formulations are essential factors to optimize absorption. In terms of formulations, the liposomes discovered in 1964 by Alec D. Bangham are still relevant as being efficient vectors for active ingredients. The initial technology has inspired many products and materials that were able to evolve by integrating in their conception the latest scientific advances. On the marketplace, these ""magic bullet "" are used to encapsulate perfumes, control the release of actives, protect sensitive materials, adapt to the needs of the skin... Possibilities are huge and some liposomes are formulated to withstand extreme conditions of pH, of electrolyte concentrations in solvents or in polar oils. The vectorization system is usually based on multi-layers of surfactants or of oil-in-water dispersions. But Prof. Markus Antonietti from the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam has opened a new field of investigation by presenting a work on double hydrophilic polymers that can store molecules in the double layer of neutralization. In a very different domain from liposomes but with a significant interest in terms of formulation, Shiseido researchers have managed to formulate a long-lasting, transfer proof and very bright lipstick with optimal hydration. The technology as it was explained by Mrs. Mouna Ghoul, a researcher for Shiseido Europe is based on the incorporation in the formula of a liquid crystal in combination with an oil with a high refractive index, very viscous and not compatible with the pigments and the liquid crystal. Upon application there is a phase separation and the formation of a glossy film on the surface of the lips. This work was granted the Award of Applied Research at the 2010 IFSCC [1] congress. In conclusion Étienne Soudan, President of the SFC announced the theme for the 2012 session ""skin and senescence"".  A forever topical subject on which current science is progressing rapidly. Quite enough to attract, again, a large audience."
"Étienne Soudant, SFC, ""Meeting the challenge of the 2014 IFSCC Congress!""","Premium Beauty News - March 1951, marks the creation of the French Society of Cosmetology, March 2011, marks your nomination as a President of the SFC, March 2012, is the date when you will be stepping down, already!  SFC boasts having 1500 members, and that has been going on for 60 years! Quite a good example of sustainability in time! Étienne Soudant - There are several questions to answer! I will start with the last one. The SFC was indeed created in 1951 and has continued to grow and fulfil its missions, namely to disseminate in the cosmetic field the knowledge related to Science and Technology and group members of different backgrounds such as chemists, biologists, physicists, dermatologists, toxicologists and perfumers who have as a matter of fact contributed to the development of cosmetology since the second half of the twentieth century. My time as President, for a period of one year, was planned that way from the onset. The next President will be fully operational in 2014 and for the big meeting of the IFSCC’s [1] International Congress that we will have both the privilege but also the responsibility of organizing in Paris. As for the sustainability of our organization, we owe it, of course, to the dedication and volunteer work of hundreds of people who contribute to its reputation but also, of course, to all the activities that generate daily flows of contacts and of information feedback. The proof of this is for example our monthly lectures the ""Jean-Paul Marty Days"", which are held on the last Thursday of each month, the last one which just took place on the theme ""Interactions Formulation and Skin"", the Cosmetagora show which has become, in just four years time, a ideal friendly place to foster encounters between all the actors operating in cosmetology. Not to mention our training sessions, our newsletter, our directory, our website and the many prizes we award to personalities in the cosmetic field for their contribution, including the ""Prix Pierre Velon"", awarded every two years to the author of the best lecture given during the previous two years, and the Award of the SFC, who singles out, every two years, one or two key figures in our trade. Another example is the distribution to each of our members of the six annual issues of the International Journal of Cosmetic Science (IJCS) indexed in Medline dedicated to research work on the skin and cosmetics as well as the IFSCC’s magazine. This continuity is certainly also due to the grouping of all the national (47 societies including the SFC) in a single International Federation the IFSCC whose idea of creation dates back to 1956 in Paris for an effective birth in 1959 along with The Belgian federation. It acts as a link between all societies and every 2 years chooses a society to organize its annual conference. Premium Beauty News - How does the SFC operate? Étienne Soudant - Like any association, the Society is managed by a Board composed of 21 members of French nationality elected for three years by secret ballot by the General Assembly, plus the outgoing president and two delegates from the Committee of Wise Men. The elected members of the Board are renewed by thirds every year. To note that to seek to become a member of the Board you must be a active member for more than two consecutive years. Each year, after the renewal of one third of members, the Board elects a President by secret ballot and also chooses among its members the Vice-Presidents, a Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, a Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer. Within the honorary members, there are also personalities who render or have rendered exceptional services to cosmetology. Among the so called ""active"" members, we find any natural person belonging or having belonged to trades in connection with cosmetology as well as any person taking an interest in it or who can justify of its interest for it. Finally, are ""associate members"", any natural person who is or has belonged to a company in connection with cosmetics, but who carrying on business abroad provided she can prove  her membership in the Society of her country of origin, if one exists."
LVMH investigates skin rejuvenation strategies,"“In many countries, in the next 50 years, about one-third of women will be over 50 years of age,” said Frédéric Bonté, Director of Scientific Communication in its keynote speech. “Appearance and skin vitality are and will remain a subject of primary importance in daily life and for social well being.”  In such a context and considering the progress of scientific knowledge, “the current issue is no longer to fight ageing, but to trigger rejuvenating processes”, added Dr. Max Santoul, dermatologist and scientific adviser of LVMH Recherche. In order to investigate the new strategies that can regenerate the health and youth of the skin by producing a durable effect below the skin’s surface, LVMH Recherche Parfum & Cosmétiques - the common scientific arm of LVMH’s main cosmetic brands (Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, Parfums Givenchy, and Fresh) - gathered scientists whose presentations covered a wide range of topics, including genetics, cellular and molecular biology, active ingredients, reprogramming strategies and formulation, dermatology, and even developmental meditation. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical gerontologist based in Cambridge, and Chief Science Officer of SENS Foundation, a California-based charity dedicated to combating the aging process, presented a very ambitious approach that encompasses the characterisation of all the accumulating and eventually pathogenic molecular and cellular side-effects (“damage”) of metabolism that constitute mammalian aging and the design of interventions to repair and/or obviate that damage. Concerning skin aging in particular, he noted that while the skin a rather complex tissue was affected by what occurred in the rest of the body, the specific types of molecular and cellular “damage” accumulating in all tissues, including the skin, are broadly similar. Whether it concerns the extracellular or intracellular level, this damage can be properly fixed through maintenance strategies including cell therapy, phagocytosis by immune stimulation, transgenic microbial hydrolases, etc.  In sum, according to Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a sophisticated multi-component assault will probably be necessary if we are to achieve complete rejuvenation of aged skin - but this is no longer a utopian goal. “With sufficient resources and determination, it can be achieved within the foreseeable future,” he said. Focusing on the issue of stem cell and skin rejuvenation, Carlo Pincelli, Professor of Clinical Dermatology and Director of Research of the Laboratory of Cutaneous Biology at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, detailed the role of Keratinocyte Stem Cells (KSC) in the process of skin aging.  He showed that while KSCs play a key role in the process of skin aging, cosmetic and medical rejuvenation strategies nevertheless have to take into account the entire environment of stem cells, and in particular the KSC niche, to be effective. For her part, Melanie Swan, a Research Fellow at DIYgenomics, a non-profit research organization she founded in March 2010 to investigate the links between genotype-phenotype, explained how genomic profiling of individuals might lead to personalised solutions, including the development of skin care products customized to individuals per genetic profiles.  “Personalized genomics is an important emerging field of science being applied to human biology and medicine. Its application in disease risk assessment, wellness profiling, drug response determination, and product response customization may only grow over time and lead to many useful innovations in translational anti-aging skin research,” she said. While some of these biological approaches may seem quite utopian,the publication in the November 1st issue of Genes & Development, of a successful rejuvenation protocol of senescent and centenarian human cells, prove that impressive results can already be achieved under laboratory conditions.  Scientist have succeeded in reprogramming the pluripotent state of old cells through the introduction of a series of specific genes, and thus demonstrated that cellular senescence is not a limit and that age-related cellular physiology is reversible. However, more practical and immediate approaches of skin rejuvenation were also presented.  Dr. Leslie Baumann a dermatologist, researcher, professor and well-known author, presented the various techniques already available to dermatologists and how their combination within a multifaceted approach can lead to visible results. Dr. Laure Rittié, Research Investigator at the Department of Dermatology Photoaging and Aging Research Program, of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, explained how laser-based devices can be effective in rejuvenation strategies aiming at stimulating collagen production in photodamaged skin.  Laser devices are used to generate a controlled wound healing reaction that ideally triggers minimal inflammation and maximal collagen production. While they are not yet any promises of eternal youth, major cosmetics manufacturers are closely monitoring these various scientific developments.  “By combining our knowledge with information from the fields of sociology, psychology and neurocosmetics, and validating our results in clinical studies and consumer panels worldwide, we seek to reach tailored cosmetics solutions,” said Eric Perrier, Executive Vice-President R&D at LVMH Recherche. “The idea that ageing is an active continuation of a genetically programmed development of organisms has been partially discredited. Ageing is now admitted to be a loss of equilibrium between the capability of an organism to maintain its repair potential and the frequency and intensity of the damage to which it is exposed,” explained Carine Nizard, Bio-Science innovation Manager at LVMH Recherche. Carine Nizard presented three examples of skin-cell rejuvenation strategies, using innovative ingredients, developed by LVMH Recherche based on experimental work (in LVMH laboratories or within academic collaborations).  These strategies were materialised into cosmetic products marketed by LVMH brands. “These approaches enable us to have interesting in-vitro skin-cell rejuvenation experimental data and in vivo quantifiable results for skin following their cosmetic use,” she concluded."
"X-Rite, towards colour digitization","""Colour digitization of is our new frontier"", explains Andréa Vannacci, Sales Director for Southern Europe. After having developed non-contact spectrophotometers, enabling to measure a surface colour without having to modify its structure, X-Rite has set foot on the path of colour dematerialisation. To that end, the company is developing a range of software and services facilitating the digital communication of everything related to colours, in order to avoid as much as possible sending physical samples. With obviously, some considerable reductions in terms of cost and time for manufacturers and their partners. The other current challenge at stake for the company, which now includes in its portfolio Pantone, is the measurement of colour variations caused by the changes of vision angles. ""We develop multi-angle spectrophotometers capable of retrieving their entire measurements in the form of a unique patented algorithm"", emphasised Vannacci. Beyond measurement and colour selection, the X-Rite expertise extends to many other disciplines, including creation, formulation, communication and the matching of colours. ""A number of specialties that enable users to obtain the correct colour on their first attempt."""
Will caffeine be the next trendy sunscreen ingredient?,"It was already known that drinking that morning cup of coffee might decrease the risk of occurrence of certain skin cancer. However, the mechanism by which caffeine protects the skin remained largely unknown. A new study by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, provides further documentation on biological mechanisms involved. “Multiple human epidemiologic studies link caffeinated (but not decaffeinated) beverage intake with significant decreases in several types of cancer, including highly prevalent UV-associated skin carcinomas,” said the authors of the study funded by the National Institutes of Health, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. To further investigate this issue, scientists genetically modified and diminished the levels of a protein enzyme in the skin, known as ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), in one group of mice. Then, they exposed the transgenic mice to UV rays.  Indeed, caffeine is known as an inhibitor of several cellular processes, including the activation of ATR. The study confirmed the importance of the inhibition of the ATR protein. Indeed, genetically modified mice developed tumours more slowly than the unmodified mice and, at the end of observation, they had 69 percent fewer tumours than regular mice and developed four times fewer invasive tumours. The researchers have compared these results to another study where caffeine was applied on the skin of UV-pretreated “high-risk” mice.  In that case, mice developed 72 percent fewer squamous cell carcinomas, a form of skin cancer. [1] While this aspect needs to be further investigated, scientists believe that based on what they have learned studying mice, caffeine applied directly to the skin might help prevent damaging ultraviolet light from causing skin cancer. The study, also found, however, that when both groups of mice were exposed to chronic ultraviolet rays for an extended period of time, tumour development occurred in both the genetically modified and regular mice. “What this seems to indicate is that inhibiting the ATR enzyme works best at the pre-cancerous stage before UV-induced skin cancers are fully developed,” said Allan Conney, professor of Chemical Biology and director of the Susan Lehman Cullman Laboratory for Cancer Research at the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, co-author of the study. “Caffeine might become a weapon in prevention because it inhibits ATR and also acts as a sunscreen and directly absorbs damaging UV light,” he added."
The war for collagen did not take place...,"Premium Beauty News - After having chaired it for more than nine years, you are still close to the European Centre of Dermocosmetology. Among future projects, a scientific conference in Lyon that will be jointly organized with the IFSCC’s World Congress to be held in Paris in 2014. Alain Huc - That’s right! The work achieved by the CED in recent years has been crucial. In this context, I wish to pay a tribute to Professor Jean Cotte for creating this association and launching the European Days whose success has never wavered. Taking the chair after such a prestigious figure was for me quite a challenge. Nevertheless, we kept the European days going on with as a setting, the Cité Internationale of Lyon that can welcome a very large number of foreign participants. We have also reinforced our ties with the French Society of Cosmetology (SFC). Currently, it is Dominique Bouvier, who accepted to take over the chairmanship of the CED, providing all her dynamism to it. Christiane MONTASTIER  (Société Française de... par ced-lyon Premium Beauty News – In your opinion, Lyon is the nerve centre for skin research. Alain Huc - Indeed, I believe that Lyon and its region have developed a recognized expertise in the field of connective tissue and collagen, therefore bringing a specific contribution to the development of French cosmetics. I also express the wish that each region do the same, each of them developing its own specialty, to thus prevent a sterile competition between the various French cosmetic clusters. Premium Beauty News - You were recently rewarded with the SFC prize for your work on collagen. A story that looks like a real saga?  Alain Huc - This saga, as you call it, is probably familiar to the elders but ignored, at least in its details, by the younger owns. In the 1960s, the Centre Technique du Cuir decided to create a small research unit on collagen. The director, in charge at the time, Dr. Georges Vallet, believed that to be familiar with the skin, it was necessary to study its basic protein, collagen. Our team then worked with a laboratory of the University led by Daniel Herbage, with applied research being conducted by our team and the more fundamental work by the University. The findings led to the development of processes for the recovery of industrial protein waste and a better understanding of tanning techniques. At the time, the French leather industry was on a declining phase and the management of the Centre Technique du Cuir considered our work to be too theoretical. The very existence of our research team seemed threatened. It was then that luck smiled on us. On the occasion of the European Dermocosmetology Days that were taking place at that time, we met Mr. Koulbanis, Director of Applied Research at L’Oréal. He told us he had just launched a collagen cream and its sole supplier for this material was German. He then asked our team to develop a collagen solution that could be used for cosmetic purposes. We immediately understood that a promising path of diversification was opening before us. The collagen solution was developed. Production could start and the Gattefossé company was in charge of distribution. Very quickly large quantities were ordered and, because of its statutes, the Centre Technique du Cuir could no longer ensure its production. This led to the creation of a company, the Saduc, in which the directors of the Centre Technique du Cuir and some employees became shareholders. Laurent SCHUBNEL (Gattefossé) par ced-lyon Premium Beauty News - In parallel with this cosmetic activity, the pharmaceutical industry also approached you? Alain Huc - Yes, that’s right! The pharmaceutical industry entrusted us with the development of collagen-based biomaterials. A hemostatic sponge was developed and distributed by the Fournier company in Dijon. As a result, our team began to work for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries and very much less for the leather industry. It was therefore necessary to part with the Centre Technique du Cuir and create a new company. This was made possible with venture capital. This creation was not easily achieved, as the Saduc was seeing in the new company a potential competitor and as a leading industrialist from the area was seeking to take a blocking minority in the capital. After our team had turned down this offer, a number of bankers from Lyon even stopped assisting us. The daily newspaper, Les Echos, had even headlined at the time: ""Will the war for collagen take place in Lyon?"" Viviane JAILLET (Strand Cosmetics Europe) par ced-lyon Premium Beauty News - And the Parisian bankers were the ones who eventually came to the rescue! Alain Huc - Absolutely! It’s thanks to Parisian bankers that the Bioetica company was created. It then developed its activities in the fields of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and finally took the name of Coletica. The management was ensured by a directorate headed by a financier, Pierre Devictor. I headed the Research department for fifteen years, Eric Perrier then brilliantly taking over. Daniel Herbage became our scientific advisor and provided us with the support of the Institut de Biologie et de Chimie des Protéines (Institute of Biology and Protein Chemistry). We also successfully worked with the laboratory of skin substitutes from the Edouard Herriot Hospital led by Odile Damour. It was thus possible to work towards the development of a completely reconstructed skin with dermis and epidermis, which will be of great help for cosmetics tests and also allowing the reconstruction of tissues, particularly in the field of severe burns. After a few years, under shareholders pressure, the pharmaceutical activity had to be abandoned to my great regret. Fortunately, the Saduc, becoming the Symatese company, took up the torch in this area and now produces collagen-based biomaterials that bring medicine and surgery increasingly appreciated therapeutic properties. Finally, we mustn’t forget the research work conducted on skin by the team of Professor Thivollet and Daniel Schmidt, at the Edouard Herriot Hospital, especially in the field of immunity. http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhulyh_christiane-montastier-societe-francaise-de-cosmetologie_tech

"""New research fields are going to revolutionize the approach to skin rejuvenation"", Frédéric Bonté, LVMH Recherche","Premium Beauty News - How did this idea of organising symposiums emerge? Frédéric Bonté - The initial idea was to bring scientists together in order to carry a reflection on major themes for our trades and to act as a facilitator, a creator of interactions among researchers coming from different backgrounds. Congresses are generally very specialized and our approach was to generate transversal links between different disciplines. Premium Beauty News - Precisely doesn’t cosmetology suffer from a lack of scientific recognition? Frédéric Bonté - It is a profession in which there is a lot of research work carried out in biology, physical chemistry, neuroscience, sociology, but it is true that sometimes theses work lack visibility. This is also why we organize our symposiums, take part to many conferences and also publish in scientific journals. The competitiveness cluster, led by the Cosmetic Valley, is a proof of the profession’s current dynamism. Premium Beauty News - Yet, communicating on private scientific research seems to be a difficult art, especially when it extends beyond the strict framework of experts? What are the objectives for LVMH? Frédéric Bonté - Science and its orientations must be consistent with the society we want.  Sharing its implications, its main findings is a real duty and private research must take part to it.  As a proof of this, the success of the last Science, Recherche et Société Forum organized by the magazine La Recherche and the newspaper Le Monde at the Collège de France in Paris on June 16. We partnered with a scientific photography exhibition on the topic of ""Rare species, endangered plants"", a way of showing using an artistic dimension, our commitment in the field of biodiversity. Premium Beauty News - The 11th Symposium on the theme of Skin Rejuvenation seems particularly promising, including an overview of issues related to stem cells. Can you briefly tell us what topics will be addressed? Frédéric Bonté - Combined to protection, rejuvenation techniques are based on the 3 R’s theory, namely, Repair, Replace, Regenerate. We will address new research areas that will, in the next 10 years, revolutionize our approaches to these areas. Molecular genetics, elimination of degradation products of metabolism that tend to accumulate, reprogramming strategy, epigenetic rejuvenation, new tools in Bioinformatics stability or metabolic awakening will be, among others the themes that will be addressed. How far to go, what are the risks with new technologies, realistic hopes will open discussions to imagine tomorrow’s products. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose to hold this event in London? Frédéric Bonté - London is a dynamic capital and we were looking for an English-speaking context. We chose a magical place combining culture, heritage preservation and knowledge dissemination. The whole of it with a desire to place this event in a eco-design concept: ease of accommodation, accessibility, direct access by public transportation to overseas destinations... We try to alternate the venues abroad to always enrich the network of researchers that we bring together."
Shiseido discovers new ingredient to fight skin ageing,"Serpin b3 was discovered some years ago as a cause of skin damage known as “parakeratosis” (abnormal keratization).  More recent research carried out by Shiseido also found that serpin b3 is a factor of skin ageing.  “An increase in serpin b3 not only damages the surface and stratum corneum of the skin, but also propagates and amplifies the damage to the whole epidermis, and furthermore it propagates damage to the basement membrane and dermis, and accelerates skin ageing,” explains the cosmetics giant. According to Shiseido, an increase in serpin b3 in the epidermis obstructs the self-defense system that prompts cells to eliminate themselves when they accumulate irreparable damage. These damaged epidermal cells thus accumulate into the skin and accelerate its ageing.  Furthermore, their negative effects can raise the levels of serpin b3 in their vicinity and trigger a vicious circle of damage propagation.  Actually, Shiseido’s research showed that an increase in serpin has negative effects on the whole skin. In order to block the negative effects of serpin b3, Shiseido tested an amino acid derivative known to be effective to control the production of the protein.  According to the company, the continuous use of high concentrations of 1-piperidine propionic (1PP) acid, proved extremely effective in inhibiting the production of serpin b3 and in rejuvenating damaged skin. In the future, the 1PP acid is expected to be the based of new generations of anti-aging skin care products.  Indeed, Shiseido wants to apply the results of its research to develop products that will nurture the skin and make it smooth, younger with more firmness and elasticity."
Lyons: cosmetics science is brought out of the shadows,"L’Oréal, the global cosmetics giant, has just opened in Lyons (France), a research centre unique in its field, fully dedicated to the predictive assessment of safety and efficacy of ingredients and cosmetic products. A location that owes nothing to chance!   This brand new centre falls in line with the extended activities of the Episkin SNC company, one of L’Oréal’s subsidiary, specialized in skin engineering. Precisely, the creation of artificial skin, tissue and cellular engineering, molecular designing are all specialties of researchers in Lyons. Long considered as the hub of excellence in dermocosmetological research in France and Europe, the Lyons region seemed to give way to other players, perhaps better organized.   A situation that Dominique Bouvier, CEO and President of the European Centre of dermocosmetology (CED) in Lyons, wants to bring an end to. Created in 1962 in Lyons, the CED was at the time a very innovative organisation since one of its first objectives was to unit researchers and industrialists. Details are given to us by Pr Marie-Claude Martini, a member of the board of the CED, interviewed by Premium Beauty News:  Dominique Bouvier is convinced that the CED is the ideal tool to help the excellence of local researchers and industrialists collectively stand out. ""It is obvious that Cosmetology is suffering from a lack of visibility in the Lyons region, despite the high level of its researchers and of many leading companies in the sector. It must be said that the regional industrial network is both dense and very diversified. We have undertaken a lot of work to highlight the excellence of the sector in the area by targeting both the industry and the general public."" And these efforts are bearing fruit. In February, the CED organized its 25th European Days on the theme of the use of stem cells in dermocosmetology and it was a success considering the number of delegates and the interest generated by the work presented. According to Frédéric Bonté, in charge of LVMH’s Scientific Communications for Perfume and Cosmetic Research, these European Days are a unique opportunity for researchers to share and exchange:  According to Alain Denis, Global R&D Director of BASF Beauty Care Solutions, links with basic research organizations are essential for innovation, especially in the domain of actives:  In conjunction with this event, the Museum of Textiles and of Decorative Arts of Lyons was launching the exhibition ’Luxury Lips’, relating for the general public, the saga of lipstick. ""An opportunity to enhance the work of formulation, packaging or design manufacturers who usually stay in the shadows of their products,"" explained Bouvier. There too, success was the one expected since the duration of the exhibition had to be extended an extra month. A series of initiatives that the CED intends to renew with in focus, the organisation of a satellite-relayed scientific day of the IFSCC’s World Congress (International Federation of Societies of Cosmetic Chemists) in 2014. Quite enough to impart Lyons with a taste of capital of cosmetic research!"
Stem cells: what prospects for cosmetology?,"More than 210 people attended the event, held on 3 and 4 February 2011 in Lyon, under the auspices of the Centre européen de dermocosmétologie (European centre of dermocosmetology) and its president Mrs Dominique Bouvier. The interest in stem cells (or undifferentiated cells) results in their two main characteristics: they can give specialized cells through cell differentiation and they can renew themselves a very large number of times. Stem cells are present at the different stages in the development of human beings, thus there are: embryonic stem cells, foetal stem cells and adult stem cells. These cells do not share the same properties. The very first embryonic stem cells (from the zygote to the eight-cell blastomere, at the fourth day of embryonic development) can give all cell types, and thus an entire organism: they are called totipotent. Then appear pluripotent stem cells, capable of giving rise to all cell types, embryonic annexes excepted. In later stages, there are: – Multipotent stem cells, which may give different cell types, but specific to a given cell lineage.
– Unipotent stem cells, that can give only one kind of cell. They can, however, like any stem cell, insure self-renewal, it is therefore important to distinguish them from precursors. Skin is a considerable reservoir of adult stem cells offering new therapeutic perspectives while giving rise to fewer ethical issues compared the use of stem cells of embryonic origin. Some of them may be used for therapeutic skin applications, such as the treatment of severe burns. But there are a number of other promising prospects because scientists are now capable of reprogramming them to make so-called multipotent embryonic-type stem cells, which can then reproduce all types of cells. Thus, very recently researchers were able to obtain blood cells and cardiac cells from adult skin stem cells. The study of skin stem cells is still in its infancy, there are at least seven different reservoirs (""niches"") currently identified in human beings at the level of the epidermis, hair follicles, sweat and sebaceous glands, dermis and adipose tissue. Each one has its specificities and its possible uses. Although they are the purpose of much research, stem cells still retain their share of mystery because their identification remains complex due to the lack of specific markers and also to the fact their characteristics will change when they are cultured in vitro which further complicates the study. Some questions on their biology are also widely debated. In particular, concerning the issue related to their ageing, which seems to be more the consequences of changes in the micro-environment affecting their regenerative capacities, than a reduction in their number. The question remains open. Skin applications of stem cells cover very large areas ranging from basic research to regenerative and aesthetic medicine and finally cosmetology. Researchers are now able to reconstruct in vitro, tissue with melanocytes and hair follicles to deepen the fundamental knowledge on stem cells (evaluating the impact of UV radiation, understanding the phenomena of hair loss or hair bleaching...) or to study some skin diseases (bullous diseases, vitiligo ...). In the medical field, these reconstructed skins can be used for skin grafts for burn victims, for some pigmentation diseases or for the transplantation of hair follicles in the domain of baldness. In the field of plastic and aesthetic surgery, lipofilling techniques, used for over twenty years, consists in taking from a patient some adipose tissue, with a very rich content in stem cells and to reinject it after centrifugation to help restore contour and volume defects or to facilitate the healing of chronic wounds. Finally, the cosmetic field is not to be outdone. Skin tissues developed from stem cells allow carrying out pharmaco-toxicology studies. The European project ScreenTox, which has just begun, is also an example of that. It aims to assess the toxicology of drugs, chemicals and cosmetic ingredients through the use of stem cells. Reconstructed models help achieve a complete skin or some specific tissues such as adipose tissue, which are increasingly used by the industry and the suppliers of cosmetic ingredients to study the effectiveness of active cosmetic ingredients. In the field of ageing, the stimulation of stem cells or on the contrary, the limitation of their growth to avoid their shortage were discussed repeatedly during the conference. Unknown factors in this area have been widely highlighted and representatives from the R & D departments of major cosmetic brands have presented their research efforts in this area while putting forward their extreme caution as to immediate applications. The answer of specialist researchers is quite clear: current knowledge on stem cells does not indicate it would be wise to try to change their behaviour. It is nevertheless admitted that a better understanding of how to act on the composition of the niche, its functions and its interactions with stem cells, will enable to act without affecting stem cells themselves. The debate over stem cells in the field of anti-aging cosmetics is not closed either. The second part of the European Dermocosmetology Days was devoted to the presentation of various cosmetic active ingredients, most of them of plant origin. Some of them are called ""plant stem cells"" and provide the necessary elements to protect skin stem cells. Others allow, thanks to the biotechnology-techniques from which they were produced to protect biodiversity, avoid the problem of pollutants or overcome sourcing problems due to seasonality. And finally, some suppliers have highlighted the interest of skin stem cells to assess the efficacy of their actives. In short, a very broad area of possibilities, but nonetheless a domain where research efforts to be undertaken and knowledge to be acquired are still considerable."
"""Skin is increasingly more assaulted"" Dr. Marek Haftek, CNRS","Premium Beauty News - You have been working for many years on the skin barrier and its functions. Dr. Marek Haftek - The Laboratory ""Normal and pathological functions of the skin barrier"" integrated in the University Lyon 1, which I head, is trying to understand how work biological mechanisms that allow the skin to achieve its role as a body protector. It is a vital function, since the skin, especially its outermost part, the stratum corneum, or horny layer, is both a protection against the risk of massive loss of body fluids, and a protection against external aggressions. The stratum corneum’s malfunctions are very interesting to study from a scientific point of view. They can of course be the result of diseases, but they can also be at the origin or self-sustain pathological processes. Our research also focuses on analyzing the molecular components and their regulation, particularly in atopic dermatitis and aging. We also work on the protection against physical and chemical stresses and on the phenomena of transcutaneous penetration. The objective being to develop therapeutic and industrial applications oriented on the barrier function of human epidermis. Premium Beauty News - What is the importance of this barrier for cosmetics? Dr. Marek Haftek - This barrier is the skin’s surface, it is actually what can be seen. The malfunctioning of biological functions that produce it may have unattractive consequences which are at the heart of cosmetic issues. Understanding the biology of this barrier is obviously useful to prevent damage suffered by skin with age or as a result of external stresses. The skin surface forming the barrier is composed of ""dead"" cells as a result of biological processes pre-programmed within underlying living cells. A number of dysfunctions are likely to affect these complex processes and induce disturbances and inconveniences ranging from simple dry skin, with the discomfort associated to it, to severe allergies to different substances, including skin redness or unsightly flaking. Cosmetic products will try to correct the consequences of these dysfunctions, by providing for example lipids that will integrate the stratum corneum, reinforcing its hydration, to make it more supple, thus improving its appearance while providing extra comfort. We can go even further. This is the reason why we are also studying the penetration process of cosmetic or pharmaceutical products, to target the passage of some molecules ensuring the skin’s appropriate functioning. Premium Beauty News - Do aggressions against this barrier have a tendency to increase? Dr. Marek Haftek - Unquestionably. In fact, the skin is more and more assaulted. Firstly, people in developed countries live in an increasingly complex universe from a chemical point of view, with a proliferation of allergens and aggressive substances in their environment. Other factors, such as dryer air coming from heaters or air conditioners affect the skin condition. In developed countries, atopic dermatitis is growing exponentially. Premium Beauty News - And the exposure to UVs? Dr. Marek Haftek - It also influences the skin condition, but in a different way. Indeed, one of the important functions of the stratum corneum is to protect underlying tissues from ultraviolet radiation. The horny layer absorbs about 70% of UV-Bs, but the rest passes through and can induce significant damage. Not to mention UV-As and infra-red radiations that penetrate more deeply and act on the dermis. Our laboratory, which comprises mainly researchers specialised in skin biology and galenical pharmacists, is taking a very great interest in how the skin barrier manages to cope with all these stresses, and how it is possible to strengthen natural defences. Premium Beauty News - What are the current issues of research on the barrier function of skin? Dr. Marek Haftek - The main scientific challenge is to better understand interactions between the different elements that contribute to the production and function of the skin barrier. We have a pretty good picture of the role played by each element, but it is still unclear to us on how the modification of one of these elements interacts on the others to achieve the appropriate final function. Such an important mechanism for the survival of the human being can not just depend on a single element! The impairment of a link may well modulate the function but shouldn’t abolish it. For this reason, we learn a lot from genetic diseases that affect a particular function. The increasing development of atopic dermatitis is also insightful. It was recently discovered how the mutation of a gene (that of filaggrin) can induce dysfunctions of the skin barrier and make people very vulnerable vis-à-vis substances in their environment. Premium Beauty News - Specifically, what are the topics of current research in your lab? Dr. Marek Haftek - Concerning the topics of research we can name: – The differentiation and epidermal extracellular matrix (Marek Haftek, Sylvie Callejon),
– The barrier functions in normal human epidermis and in atopic dermatitis (Marek Haftek, Sylvie Callejon, Jacques Portoukalian),
– The roles of dendritic cells in defence, allergy and tolerance (Josette Péguet, Claude Vincent, Aurore Rozières, Florence Persat, Evelyne Colomb),
– The transcutaneous penetration and the galenic formulation of nanoparticles for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes(Françoise Falson, Fabrice Pirot, Valérie Bertholle, Karine Padois),
– The clinical and pathological aspects of composite grafts and of side effects of immunosuppression (Sylvie Euvrard, Jean Kanitakis),
– Melanoma (Luc Thomas). In addition, we organize every year in Lyon, a course in French language of skin biology (CoBiP) [1]. Like the European Dermocosmetology Days, who will soon take place in Lyon [2], this course contributes to the promotion of excellence in the Rhone-Alpes region in dermocosmetology. Indeed, the Lyon region features unique assets with the presence of several major laboratories specialized in skin and with advanced research centres on the biology and chemistry of proteins. Basic and applied public research is particularly developed: skin substitutes and skin substrates, collagen-based biomaterials, formulation (topical forms of products), active ingredients, skin diseases - cancers and allergies, skin/graft/immune suppression relations, etc. The region has an exceptional expertise in the field of dermatological research and cosmetic products, it is important to make the promotion of it!"
Nano-sized titanium dioxide may cause pulmonary inflammation,"According to a research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) by a Swiss-French team of scientists, “inhalation of nano-TiO2 provokes lung inflammation”.  The authors of the study add that “the current use of nano-TiO2 may present a health hazard due to its capacity to induce IL-1R signaling, a situation reminiscent of inflammation provoked by asbestos exposure.” Actually, the researchers from the University of Lausanne’s Department of Biochemistry in Switzerland, and the University of Orléans’ Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Embryology, in France, investigated the inflammatory capacity of TiO2 nanoparticles by testing them on human cells and in lab experiments using mice.  They found that nano-TiO2 can cause pulmonary inflammation through biological mechanisms very similar to asbestos and silicone, thus releasing molecules capable of attacking DNA, proteins and cell membranes. Jürg Tschopp, the lead researcher and professor of biochemistry at the University of Lausanne, told Swiss media that asbestos and nano-TiO2 particles act in a very similar way and can get accumulated in lungs.  According to Professor Tschopp more caution should be required in order to limit the absorption of these particles at work and in daily life. Titanium dioxide is widely employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes.  Nanoparticles of titanium dioxide are increasingly used in various fields, including paints, biomedicine, electronics and sunscreens. Scientific literature reports increased incidence of respiratory diseases in people exposed to titanium dioxide and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified titanium dioxide dust as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group 2B) when inhaled. Titanium dioxide in its nano form gets more easily absorbed into the skin and this has regularly raised health concerns. The new Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products, which will come into full force on July 13, 2013, provides that cosmetic products containing nanoparticules will have to be notified to the Commission six months prior being placed on the market and that nanomaterials in the formula will have to be mentioned in the list of ingredients with the concerned substance followed by the word “nano” in brackets (e.g.: Titanium dioxyde [nano])."
Sunscreen can help prevent melanoma,"The message that sunscreen can prevent sunburns, early skin ageing and most skin cancers, including melanoma, the deadliest form, is now backed by a large randomised trial conducted in Australia. [1] Scientists at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) have randomly selected 1,621 residents from the city of Nambour, to participate in a trial which ran from 1992 to 1996. Half the participants applied sunscreen every day and the other half continued to apply sunscreen as they would normally. After 15 years, the number of people who developed melanomas from the discretionary sunscreen group was twice that of the group who had applied daily sunscreen in the trial. “This is the first time that a randomised trial has been conducted that can evaluate if using sunscreen prevents melanoma,” explained lead researcher and Head of QIMR’s Cancer and Population Studies Laboratory Professor Adèle Green. “By randomly assigning people to the two groups we overcame the bias present in other studies. Often the very people who are predisposed to developing melanomas, eg people with fair skin, are the people predisposed to applying sunscreen and therefore it is impossible to determine if sunscreen is independently able to prevent melanomas.” The effectiveness of sunscreen’s protection against melanoma has been highly controversial and Professor Adèle Green deems that QIMR’s now provide some assurance to medical professionals, public health authorities and the general public, that the regular application of sunscreen is likely to be beneficial with regard to melanoma protection. “While sunscreen use is an important part of skin cancer prevention, they of course are not the whole solution: other sun protection measures should be continued too,” she added Australia is the country with the highest rates of melanoma and skin cancer in the world, and residents of Queensland have rates even higher than other Australians.  In an effort to refine their understanding of the factors that underlie skin cancer risk, researchers at the QIMR recently embarked on the largest skin cancer research study ever conducted in Australia. More than 200,000 men and women will be invited to participate. “Around 451,000 people will be newly diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancers in Australia in 2010, and more than 2,000 will develop melanoma,” said Associate Professor David Whiteman from QIMR’s Cancer Control Group."
Study suggests Triclosan exposure may increase allergies,"A study by the University of Michigan (U-M) School of Public Health [1] suggests that young people exposed to triclosan - a substance used in some soaps, cleansers, toothpastes and other personal care products - may be subject to increased allergy risks. Researchers at the U-M used data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [2] to compare the amounts of triclosan found in urine with diagnosis of allergies or hay fever in a sample of U.S. adults and children over age 6.  They found that people age 18 and under with higher levels of triclosan were more likely to report diagnosis of allergies and hay fever. The authors said the study findings may support the “hygiene hypothesis,” which argues that living in excessively clean and hygienic environments may be detrimental to the development of the human immune system that require some level of exposure to micro-organisms. Previous animal studies indicate that triclosan, known as an endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC), may affect the immune system, but this is the first known study to look at exposure to triclosan as it relates to human immune function, said Allison Aiello, associate professor at the U-M School of Public Health. However, U-M researchers added they need additional studies to check if a causal relationship can be established between the use of triclosan and the higher frequency of hay fever and allergy diagnoses. “One limitation of the study is that it measured disease and exposure simultaneously and thus shows only part of the picture,” Aiello said.  “It is possible, for example, that individuals who have an allergy are more hygienic because of their condition, and that the relationship we observed is, therefore, not causal or is an example of reverse causation.” The lack of any causal link in the study form most of the critics expressed by the American Cleaning Institute (ACI – formerly The Soap and Detergent Association), which represents the US cleaning products industry. “This is speculation at its worst.  The researchers do not provide data to show a problematic cause-and-effect from usage of antibacterial soap containing triclosan,” said Richard Sedlak, ACI’s Senior Vice President of Technical & International Affairs. “ACI doesn’t want this mythmaking and fear-mongering to discourage individuals from engaging in important cleaning and disinfecting practices.  Smart, targeted hygiene is essential to preventing the spread of germs and illness that can truly make us sick or even kill us,” he added."
Study links presence of UV filters in human milk with cosmetics use,"Researchers say it is the first time that a link can be made between exposure to cosmetics and the level of specific contaminants in the body.  A recent study, which is part of Swiss national research programme on endocrine disruptors [1], shows that the presence of cosmetic UV filters in the human body is widespread and is correlated to product use. Three cohorts of human milk were sampled over three years (2004, 2005 and 2006) at maternity in Basel. The participants filled out a detailed questionnaire with a special focus on the use of cosmetic products. Chemicals out of a large range of products, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) but not limited to them, were analyzed in the same human milk sample. The list comprised cosmetic UV filters, synthetic musk fragrances, pesticides, phthalates, parabens, flame retardants (polybrominated diphenylethers), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); in total 89 analyses per milk sample.  The chemical analytical data of milk samples of individual mothers were then compared with the information obtained through the questionnaire. “Human milk was chosen because it provides direct information on exposure of the suckling infant and indirect information on exposure of the mother during pregnancy,” explain Margret Schlumpf and Walter Lichtensteiger, who lead the research. The study found widespread presence of UV filters in the human body as they were detected in 85% of human milk samples, at concentrations comparable to PCBs. Synthetic musk fragrances were also present in the milk samples. While the concentration in milk samples of classical contaminants such as PCBs, DDT and metabolites of DDT as well as some other persistent organochlor pesticides was generally similar, variations of UV filter concentrations were significant between samples.  Actually, the presence of UV filters in human milk was correlated with the use of cosmetic products containing these UV filters.  “It seems plausible that exposure to other cosmetic constituents such as synthetic fragrances is also linked to the use of the corresponding products. However, this could not be investigated because musk fragrances are not declared,” comment the authors."
LVMH explores the multiple interfaces of cosmetics,"“Interfaces.”  The unifying thread of the 10th Scientific Symposium organised by LVMH Recherche Parfums & Cosmétiques opened the door to a multitude of approaches, whether anthropological, biological, chemical or even historical. At the end, cosmetology emerged as a comprehensive science. Indeed, the notion of interface can be applied to many areas, starting, of course, by the skin itself.  “Skin is the final destination of the cosmetic products. It is our interface with the world: an interface of colour, a visible protective interface and a support of our contact with others. The everyday life of skin is governed by biological and physicochemical interfaces, exchanges with light or other sources of stress,” explains Frédéric Bonté, Director of Scientific Communication at LVMH Recherche. Professor Nina G. Jablonski, Head of Department of Anthropology at the Pennsylvania State University, explained that human skin is unique among mammals because its lack of functional body hair, its high density of sweat glands, its range of natural colours, and its ability to be deliberated decorated for social purposes.  “Humans are highly visual animals, and it is likely that we have been decorating our naked skin for nearly the entire history of our species. Reconstruction of the details of this history is difficult, but archaeological evidence indicates that humans have probably been decorating their skin with mineral pigments for at least 80,000 years.” Skin therefore appears as a social communication tool, including the colour that we intend it to get through tanning or, on the contrary, through bleaching agents. For his part, Desmond Tobin, Professor of Cell Biology and Director of the Centre for Skin Sciences (CSS) at the University of Bradford, says human skin is “strategically located at the interface of the internal and noxious external environments.”  It “plays a significant role in sensing and responding to light of all types,” he adds.  Generally speaking, human beings are looking for sun light and are avoiding it too: the need it, but it can become dangerous.  As per the latter, the effects of UV radiations have been extensively documented, however, according to Pr. Tobin, other types of light also deserve more scientific attention. For instance, approximately 33% of the sunlight impacting on human skin is represented by infra red light and its impact on skin ageing has been demonstrated recently.  The incidence of visible light is also of current research interest. At this level, recent findings are quite surprising, as photosentive proteins, rhodopsin and opsin, once considered as specific of rod cells of the eye’s retina, have been detected in human epidermis. According to Desmond Tobin, skin appears as a giant photoprotector organ, as well as a giant photoreceptor, which is sensitive to all kinds of lights that may have noticeable negative or positive health effects. If the understanding of the skin’s structure and biology made huge progress over the latest years, it is also because of the progress in microscopy techniques.  Emmanuelle Noblesse, Responsible of the Life Imaging Platform, Biology and Cutaneaous Obhjectivation Department at LVMH Recherche, explained the role of imaging in the demonstration of the various biological mechanisms that occur in cutaneous tissues. Beyond the role of skin, LVMH Recherche intended to show that the concept of interfaces was also applicable to cosmetic products, being either skin care, make-up or fragrances, both as complex molecular systems and as consumer goods that need to make sense in the mind of consumers. Dr. Johann W. Wiechers hence presented a method for characterising emulsion structures, in order to better understand the surfactants’ behaviours at the interfaces between water and oil phases.  Recently, this theory was transformed into a computer programme that can be used by formulators, with the aim of better understanding the behaviour of a surfactant system and thus decrease the number of operations required to get a desired emulsion. Then, Sylvie Hénon, Professor of Physic at the University Paris Diderot, explained that the products used in cosmetology are mostly derived from divided media (suspensions, emulsions, and foams are composed of solid particles, liquid droplets or gas bubbles dispersed in a liquid) and their properties are largely dictated by the extent of the interface between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. However creation of an interface requires free energy, the cost to which is known as surface tension.  Surfactant molecules reduce the surface tension and are one of the strategies that allow to stabilize suspensions and emulsions. Finally, in a very different field, Germain Gazano, Marketing and Consumer Intelligence Director at LVMH Recherche, described the various methods that are used to dissect consumer perceptions regarding the products they are proposed; methods that are based on the analysis of their verbal responses, in other words, the semantics interface. The impressive evolution of cosmetics’ efficacy, presentation and methods of application is based on a set of innovations that require a broad spectrum of scientific knowledge, on which LVMH Recherche gave a wondering overview in a one-day symposium."
Skin ageing: “We are in the stage of understanding.”,"Patricia Rousselle is one of the French researchers, specialised in skin science, who was trained in the crucible of the Hospital Edouard Herriot in Lyon, where she was an intern in medical biology in the Laboratory of skin substitutes.  “It is initially for the treatment of severely burned patients that the Edouard Herriot Hospital developed a dermatological expertise of a very high level,” she explains. In 1988, Patricia Rousselle became interested in proteins involved in the mechanisms of adhesion of the epidermis. Autografts which were prepared by the laboratory from cultures of healthy epidermal cells taken from burnt patients were encountering many difficulties due to the lack of adhesion of some epidermal grafts. She then joined Professor Burgeson’s team at the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children (Portland, Oregon), who had just identified and characterized the collagen VII, which plays a major role in anchoring the epidermis to the dermis. Hence, she participated in the discovery of laminin-5 (LN-5), a protein that makes up the filaments involved in the skin adhesion. Additional researches were however necessary before considering clinical applications.  “From the beginning we worked in partnership with cosmetic laboratories interested in the development of active ingredients designed for improving skin condition,” explains Patricia Rousselle. She therefore continued here works, first in the service of Professor Petit for the treatment of severely burned patients, always within the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons, then with Professor van der Rest’s team, at the Institute of Biology and Chemistry of Proteins (IBPC). She briefly returned to the United States for a post-PhD at the Cutaneous Biology Research Centre in the Harvard Medical School (Boston, Mass.), before finally joining the CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research) in 1995. At each stage, she questions herself on the prospects for implementation of her findings and seeks to combine basic and applied research. With some success, as can be seen by her numerous partnerships with pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries and with clinicians.  “It is the originality of my thematic approaches,” she says modestly. Shiseido was among the first laboratories interested in here works with the launch in the early 1990s of a range of anti-aging products promoting healing and skin repair. Other big names in cosmetics (Dior, Chanel, Yves Rocher) offered Patricia Rousselle and her team collaboration contracts for specific research missions. In 2006, studies conducted on a peptide fragment of LN-5, in partnership with the Laboratoires d’Anjou, lead to the launch of the LCE balm from the Cebelia range. The balm, protected by a patent was acclaimed by a panel of consumers during the contest called Victoires de la Beauté 2009-2010. ""Restoring the activity of some proteins involved in epidermal junction seems to be more than ever a key element in the fight against signs of aging skin. This is why the cosmetic industry is interested in our works"", explains Patricia Rousselle. She is also currently involved, with her team in the development of anti-aging actives related to the activity of proteoglycans as part of a partnership with BASF Beauty Care Solutions. Over the past two decades, basic research has identified different molecules involved in the functioning of skin cells. According to Patricia Rousselle, this stage is probably completed. But there is a huge gap between the knowledge we have of a protein and understanding what role it has.  “What we are currently studying now are the functions of this catalogue of proteins. We are in the understanding stage. Some of these proteins or cells which had been somewhat sidelined now appear in a new light as we understand a little better their usefulness.” Scientists now have an excellent mapping of the different cells and molecules involved in skin aging and are investigating their interactions.  “On the other hand, we know little about the mechanisms of disturbances involved during the aging process. For example, do they concern degradations or changes in proteins, of a significant diminution in protein synthesis or degradations related to enzymes? It is not because we know a protein that we know the functions and dysfunctions of it.” The interest in having a better understanding of these cellular mechanisms and methods of analysis developed by scientists such as Patricia Rousselle goes of course far beyond the domain of cosmetics.  “I’m more and more interested in aspects related to wound healing in order to develop therapeutic strategies which could be applied in the field of tissue repair and a partnership with the pharmaceutical company, Symatèse Biomatériaux gave birth to a joint patent. I have also developed an interest in adhesion proteins involved in tumorigenesis, to better understand the cellular mechanisms that come into play in the formation of cancers of epithelial origin,” she explains."
Dermatologists claim retinyl palmitate is safe in sunscreens,"In a commentary published online in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD), dermatologists Henry Lim, Steven Wang and Stephen Dusza [1] say there is no evidence that retinyl palmitate (vitamin A palmitate) [2] in sunscreens causes cancer. “Earlier this year, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) [3] issued a health warning that sunscreens containing retinyl palmitate could pose a cancer risk,” said dermatologist Henry W. Lim, a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology, chairman of the department of dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. “This warning garnered significant media attention and caused considerable confusion among the public. Our report should help dismiss the misinformation that sunscreens are not safe, as sunscreens are vitally important in reducing your risk for skin cancer, not causing it.” Authors of the commentary explain that although retinyl palmitate was selected for testing by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), mere selection does not mean that the chosen compounds are dangerous or unsafe. They say that retinyl palmitate was mainly selected because of its widespread use in cosmetic and sunscreen products. Many common ingredients, such as aloe vera, nanoscale titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide are currently under review by the NTP. The Environmental Working Group’s concerns were mainly based on a succession of eight in vitro studies performed since 2002 demonstrating that retinyl palmitate can produce free radicals, which can disrupt cell function.  According to Dr. Steven Q. Wang, co-author of the commentary, these non-human studies are too far from the real conditions of use to be biologically relevant.  “For example, when a sunscreen with retinyl palmitate is applied to the skin, a number of antioxidants work together to alleviate the risk of free radical formation seen in these in vitro experiments,” he said. Dr. Wang and his team also reject the results of a large animal study testing conducted by the NTP whether hairless and albino mice developed tumours sooner when coated in retinyl palmitate versus a placebo cream. In particular, they argued that “at this time, the findings have not been published in peer-reviewed literature,” and that “mice in the NTP study are highly susceptible to the effects of UV radiation and can develop skin cancer or other skin abnormalities within weeks of UV exposure, even in the absence of retinyl palmitate.” Although there are no published human studies on the potential of retinyl palmitate or other retinoids to cause cancer, the commentary concludes that observations from decades of clinical practice do not support the notion that retinyl palmitate in sunscreen causes or promotes skin cancer. “On the contrary, years of research suggests that retinoids are helpful in reducing your risk for skin cancer,” said Dr. Wang. “People should continue vigilantly using sunscreens along with other sun-safe practices – such as limiting sun exposure, seeking shade, and wearing sun-protective clothing, hats and sunglasses – to reduce the risk of skin cancer and premature aging.” The Environmental Working Group has strongly criticised the conclusions of the commentary.  The public action group, said it found “numerous flaws and misleading arguments” in the commentary published in the JAAD, “along with undisclosed industry affiliations by two of the three authors.” “Their fragmentary analysis of a government study exonerates an ingredient used by companies for whom they have done paid consulting,” said Jane Houlihan, EWG’s senior vice president for research."
